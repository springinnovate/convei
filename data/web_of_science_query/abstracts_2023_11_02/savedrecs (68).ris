TI  - Melanoma: Prognostic Factors and Factors Predictive of Response to Therapy
T2  - CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: A better understanding of prognostic factors and biomarkers that predict response to treatment is required in order to further improve survival rates in patients with melanoma.Prognostic Factors: The most important histopathological factors prognostic of worse outcomes in melanoma arc sentinel lymph node involvement, increased tumor thickness, ulceration and higher mitotic rate. Poorer survival may also he related to several clinical factors, including male gender, older age, axial location of the melanoma, elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase and S100B.Predictive Biomarkers: Several biomarkers have been investigated as being predictive of response to melanoma therapies. For anti-Programmed Death-HPD-I)/Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) checkpoint inhibitors, PD-L1 tumor expression was initially proposed to have a predictive role in response to anti-PD-VPD-Li treatment. However, patients without PD-L1 expression also have a survival benefit with anti-PD-L1/PD-L1 therapy, meaning it cannot be used alone to select patients for treatment, in order to affirm that it could be considered a correlative, but not a predictive marker. A range of other factors have shown an association with treatment outcomes and offer potential as predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy, including immune infiltration, chemokine signatures, and tumor mutational load. However, none of these have been clinically validated as a factor for patient selection. For combined targeted therapy (BRAF and MEK inhibition), lactate dehydrogenase level and tumor burden seem to have a role in patient outcomes.Conclusion: With increasing knowledge, the understanding of melanoma stage-specific prognostic features should further improve. Moreover, ongoing trials should provide increasing evidence on the best use of biomarkers to help select the most appropriate patients for tailored treatment with immunotherapies and targeted therapies.

AB  - In this paper, we describe computational ethnography studies to demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be utilized to exploit bias resident in language data produced by communities with online presence. Specifically, we leverage the use of figurative language (i.e., the choice of metaphors) in online text (e.g., news media, blogs) produced by distinct communities to obtain models of community worldviews that can be shown to be distinctly biased and thus different from other communities' models. We automatically construct metaphor-based community models for two distinct scenarios: debates on gun rights and marriage equality. We then conduct a series of experiments to validate the hypothesis that the metaphors found in each community's online language convey the bias in the community's worldview.

AB  - One has carried out the monitoring of rapeseed cultivation on the example of land-use area of 69.7 hectares, located on the territory of Busk district of Lviv region outside the settlement Baluchyn according to the artificial satellite Sentinel-2. One has identified the state of its sowing, which is characterized by the maximum value of the NDVI vegetation index on July 1, 2019, and indicates the developed vegetation for harvesting. Areas with high, medium and low rapeseed vegetation are displayed using the numerical taxonomy method of optical brightness based on the analysis of multispectral land-use scan data in the Crop Monitoring geo-information system. One has done biological yielding capacity prediction using obtained values of vegetation index NDVI, NDRE, MSA VI and RECI in each zone of land use, which indicates the sparse vegetation of rapeseed with low yield and therefore requires the application of additional organic and mineral fertilizers in the low vegetation area with an average of 41 hectares per the research object. The obtained results of the use of geo-information technologies according to space monitoring data are proposed to be applied for the estimation of the state of sowing, yielding capacity prediction, the performance of agrarian and technical operations at all stages of agricultural development.

AB  - Detailed resource or impact assessment studies often call for higher spatial resolution data products. Remote sensing data e.g., SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) provide high spatial resolution wind information but suffer from the satellite's relatively poor revisit time. This paper focuses on the preliminary assessment of offshore wind speed derived from diverse data sources, characterized by different spatial and temporal resolution. A univariate statistical analysis and a match-up comparison between in-situ Cyprus meteorological stations wind speed measurements and Sentinel-1A and 1B VV-polarized SAR wind field estimates were conducted for a two-year period between 1st June, 2017-1st June, 2019. Results indicate that SAR data overestimate the in-situ measurements resulting in an average bias of 0.7 m/s, which was gradually increasing in parallel to the wind speed values. Errors also proved to vary spatially with Akrotiri demonstrating the highest average errors comparing to Pafos and Larnaca. Despite the discrepancies found, Sentinel-1 SAR Level-2 OCN can be considered as a reliable source for offshore wind field estimation. The initial assessment presented in this paper can be considered as the basis for a future in-depth analysis of Cyprus offshore wind resource assessment.

AB  - Sea ice melt onset (MO) is a parameter related to the melt progress and it is an important predictor of the September sea ice minimum extent of Arctic. Using brightness temperatures of the Microwave Radiometer Imager (MWRI) onboard the FengYun (FY)-3B satellite, we retrieved MO and early melt onset (EMO) in the year of 2016 by passive microwave (PMW) algorithm with a higher resolution than the current MO product. The result shows that MO and EMO tend to be earlier on first-year ice (FYI) and be later on multi-year ice (MYI) compared with AIR SAT as well as MO and EMO products based on the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I).

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial relationship between land use change and ecosystem services is still unclear, which constrains the formulation of corresponding policies on land use and eco-environment protection. This study attempts to fill this gap by quantitatively analyzing the relationship between land use change and ecosystem services value from a spatial perspective at the provincial scale in China. To this end, the characteristics of land use change in Fujian province of China from 2000 to 2018 were systematically analyzed by using the single land use dynamic degree on the basis of obtaining five-phase land use data through supervised classification of Landsat TM/OLI RS images. Subsequently, the equivalent coefficient was modified and willingness to pay and ability to pay were introduced in the evaluation model, which was reconstructed to measure its ecosystem services value (ESV). The results indicated that (1) Land use change is the main driving force for the spatial pattern of ecosystem services and overall supply changes; (2) ESV in Fujian from 2000 to 2018 continuously declined, with a decrease of 686.23 billion Chinese yuan in the past 18 years; (3) The value provided by secondary ecosystem services followed that regulatory service > support service > supply service > cultural service. The above results can not only provide basic data for inter-regional ecological compensation, but also serve as reference cases for other countries/regions to carry out relevant research work.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the kinematics of the goal ball turning throwing motion, and the conclusions are as follows. First, the total time for goal ball turning and throwing motion was 1.82 s, 76.95 % in P1 and 23.02 % in P2. Second, it was found that the COM (center of mass) left and right displacement of the goalball turning throwing motion moved leftward from P1 (E1~E2) and moved to the right from P2 (E2~E3). COM forward and backwark displacement Moved to the forward according to the progress of the event. COM vertical displacement moved downward according to the progress of the event. Third, the COM left and right velocities of the goal ball turning throwing motion showed the fastest velocity from E3 to the right, and the COM forward and backward velocities showed the fastest speed from E2 to the forward. COM vertical velocity showed the fastest downward velocity at E2. Fourth, when the goal ball turning throwing motion was released, the velocity of the ball was 12.00±0.88 m/s, and the stride width was 1.09±0.12 m. Fifth, the body segment's angular momentum at the time of release of the goal ball turning throwing motion was found to be the largest in the trunk. And the upper arm, forearm, and hand segment of the upper limb all showed greater angular momentum than the left.In the case of the lower extremities, the right thigh and foot segments showed greater angular momentum than the left, but the left shank segment showed greater angular momentum than the right.Sixth, when the goal ball turning throwing motion was released, the ground reaction force of the forefoot showed the force in the right direction, the rear direction, and the vertical upward direction, and at this time, the large force was in the order of Fz, Fy, and Fx.

AB  - Many algorithms and products for snow cover have been developed. Then a unified set of "ground truth" data is important to validate snow cover products. In this study, Landsat-8/OLI data processed by linear unmixing algorithm was determined as "ground truth" to validate the moderate resolution snow products. In order to evaluate the cloud removing effect of the daily fractional snow cover (FSC) dataset of MODIS over High Asia, we use the MOD10A1 FSC product which is calculated by recommended equations as the before cloud removing data, then the Landsat-8/OLI FSC was used to validate both of the MODIS data. The results show that when the percentage of cloud pixels is less than 10%, the binary accuracy can reach 0.85 or more, the mean absolute error is less than 0.25, and the root mean square error is less than 0.35. These results suggest that the product has high credibility, despite there is still a small amount of cloud in the product.

AB  - Landmines are still a never-ending problem. Due to the conflicts and war in the previous centuries, a lot of landmines have been buried which are active still today and de-mining them is a difficult, dangerous and time consuming task. As in the regular manner if the solution is expected it involves loss of human life which is not acceptable. Technology paves way to solve this problem in a scientific manner using robots which can solve the problem without loss of human lives. A robot has been developed to detect these landmines and find then locations with the help of Global Positioning System (UPS) technology. Further the feedback is sent about the findings of the latitude and longitude location to the server through Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) technology to help target the exact position of the landmines. The feedback can be received on mobile phones using the same GSM technology so to alert the bomb squad member. The robot contains a camera for navigation purposes to spot out its path of movement and problematic locations by capturing the image and use it for its effective functioning. This robot can be used to deal with both the types of anti-personnel landmines which includes Blast Mines and Fragmentation Mines. This robot is effective for defence applications during war times and post war periods where it is preferred to nullify the threat of landmines and bring happiness among the people residing in the locality.

AB  - Mangrove forest is the most well known in Langsa City. Mangrove forest has high productivity and rich of biodiversity. However, the mangrove area has decreased in quantity. It caused by human activities (anthropogenic factors) and natural conditions. Aims of this research are to map the spatial distribution of mangrove forest in Langsa City, analyze the changes occurring mangrove area, and identify the factors that leading to the changes. Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 OLI images are selected to represent data with multi temporal images (1996, 2006, 2016, and 2018). This study used the maximum likelihood classification on multispectral data. The result of the research showed the accuracy of Landsat 8 OLI images in 2018 was 62.50%. Mangrove area changes during three periods of observed data, i.ehas decreased to 419.04 ha in 1996-2006, increase to 459.76 ha in 2006-2016, and decreased 330.57 ha in 2016-2018. These changes were generally caused by anthropogenic factors such as logging, garbage buildup, over function of mangrove to cafe, bridge and settlement. On the other hand, natural factors did not caused the change.Natural factors value in research location are accepted by mangrove growth requirements, i.e water pH was 7.8, temperature was 34 degrees C, salinity was 33.03, and DO (Dissolved Oxygen) was 5.28.

AB  - Purworejo is one of the potential area that could be experiencing landslides, because the geomorphological conditions which are included in Menoreh Hills are geographically sloping to very steep. Based on the Indonesian Disaster Information Data (DIBI) and the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) in the last five years from 2014 to April 2019 there have been 64 landslides in Purworejo. The research on landslide vulnerability mapping has been done with various spatial modeling methods, one of them is using Information Value Model (IVM). There are four landslide factors arranging the model, such as elevation, slope, slope direction and vegetation index (NDVI). The purpose of this research is to determine the most influence factors towards landslide vulnerability levels thorugh remote sensing data. Multiple regression analysis is used to determine the most influential factors. In this research, dependent variable represented by eight landslide factors, and the independent variable is vurnerability level of landslide in Purworejo. The results of this study explain that the predictor variables that most influence the occurrence of landslides in Purworejo are elevations with regression values that are quite dominant among other variables.

AB  - Mangrove forest grows on tropical coastal areas and has an ecological role for its surrounding environment. Mangrove forest protects the coast from large waves and becomes a habitat for various marine fauna. It stores the highest densities of carbon among any other ecosystem globally. In Southeast Asia, Mangrove forest is highly biodiverse and contributes to the sustainability of the ecosystem. However, based on previous studies, mangrove forests are experiencing deforestation due to high demands of commodities and land use. In this study, we analyzed changes of land cover in Southeast Asia using several global land cover products produced between 2001 and 2012 and their correlation with mangrove deforestation based on Mangrove Forest Watch (CGMFC-21) data. LULC data products applied in this study were ESA CCI LC, MODIS LC, GlobCover. The analysis was carried out by calculating the rate of increase in mangrove deforestation and comparing it with changes in land cover that replaced the mangrove area temporally. The results of this study were land cover classes that replaced mangrove forest areas in the study period. Based on the results it could be concluded that the methods and products used influence the results. There are many sources of data products that might be used for future research, with other methods that are better so that they provide space for future research and development. Our study can be used as a consideration to implement policies that conserve mangrove forest across Southeast Asia.

AB  - Information about rice phase growth is essential forpredicting of rice production, and to ensure food security program, especially during Rendeng season of rice field. The use of remote sensing data is very helpful in the process of determining the phases of plant growth. Information about the condition of the rice plant is very important to be able to estimate the growth phases and the planting season that fittingwithin the control of the production results of the rice field. This research aims to analyze phenology of rice crops during Rendeng season using remote sensing data by utilizing EVI-2 ratio. The methods used in this research is a descriptive method of quantitative interpretation with Landsat 8 OLI data.Classification on phenology phase was carried out fro the selected area of Aceh Besar District, Aceh. Results show that phenology cycle of rice crop during Rendengseason vary, ranging from low greenness to high greenness. The total area for each phase of growth also varies, with peak area occur inJanuary.There are cyclical differences of different rice plant phenology in the Rendeng in Aceh Besar District. The differences of planting times by the farmers resulted in the existence of the value of the EVI-2 ratio variation in the area. January is the higher values of the greenness of rice crop then drop to February to March. The value of the ratio of EVI-2 experience increases with the total area of rice plant in accordance with the phases of growth of the rice plant.

AB  - Bioterrorism attacks become more probable when important high-profile international or political events are held, such as G7 summit meetings or mass gathering events including Olympic and Paralympic games and FIFA World Cup tournaments. Outbreaks of infectious disease and widespread incidents of food poisoning are also public health concerns at such times. In Japan, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government operates Ambulance Transfer Syndromic Surveillance (ATSS), which can help monitor such incidents. The present study presents and assesses the ATSS framework. During the study period of October 2017 through November 2018, we monitored 33 areas for symptoms of 9 categories: vomiting/nausea, dizziness, palpitation, unconsciousness, breathing disorder, fever, spasm/paralysis, collapse/weakness, and bloody emesis/nasal hemorrhage. Among all symptoms, we found 9929 low-level aberrations, 2537 medium-level aberrations, and 577 high-level aberrations, with respective frequencies of 9.2%, 2.3%, and 0.5%. Of those, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health reported the information to Tokyo Metropolitan Government 28 times during the period. Of the 28 identified clusters, Tokyo Metropolitan Government judged the necessity for investigating 7. All of those were investigated at hospitals by the jurisdictional public health center. Because ATSS covers almost the entire Tokyo metropolitan area, with about 13.8 million residents, it is definitely the largest syndromic surveillance in the world.

AB  - In order to improve the urban thermal environment, efforts are being made to increase green areas in cities that include park construction, planting, and green roofing. Among these efforts, urban parks play an important role not only in improving the urban thermal environment, but also in terms of eco- system services (serving as resting places for citizens, providing cleaner air quality, reducing noise, etc.). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to suggest planning and management guidelines for urban parks that are effective in improving the thermal environment, by analyzing the urban surface temper- ature reduction performance of urban parks. To do this, first, land surface temperature was calculated by using Landsat 8 images. Second, the PCI (Park Cool Island) index was calculated to identify the temperature reduction performance of urban parks. Third, the characteristics of parks (area, shape, veg- etation) and the surrounding spatial characteristics (land cover, building-related variables, etc.) were identified. Finally, the relationship between the PCI indices (PCI scale, PCI effect, PCI intensity) and the characteristics of the parks and their surroundings were analyzed. The results revealed that the parks consisting of a larger area, simple shape, and higher tree coverage ratio had increased PCI per- formance, and were advantageous for improving the urban thermal environment. Meanwhile, PCI performance was found to have decreased in areas with a higher impermeable area ratio and building cov- erage ratio. The outcomes of this study can be used to identify priority areas for planning and manage- ment of urban parks and can also be utilized as planning and management guidelines for improving urban thermal environment.

TI  - Inconsistency distribution patterns of different remote sensing land-cover data from the perspective of ecological zoning
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing consistency of different land-cover data is significant to reasonably select land-cover data for regional development and resource survey. Existing consistency analysis of different datasets mainly focused on the phenomena of spatial consistency regional distribution or accuracy comparison to provide guidelines for choosing the land-cover data. However, few studies focused on the hidden inconsistency distribution rules of different datasets, which can provide guidelines not only for users to properly choose them but also for producers to improve their mapping strategies. Here, we zoned the Sindh province of Pakistan by the Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World as a case to analyze the inconsistency patterns of the following three datasets: GlobeLand30, FROM-GLC, and regional land cover (RLC). We found that the inconsistency of the three datasets was relatively low in areas having a dominant type and also showing homogeneity characteristics in remote sensing images. For example, cropland of the three datasets in the ecological zoning of Northwestern thorn scrub forests showed high consistency. In contrast, the inconsistency was high in areas with strong heterogeneity. For example, in the southeast of the Thar desert ecological zone where cropland, grassland, shrubland, and bareland were interleaved and the surface cover complexity was relatively high, the inconsistency of the three datasets was relatively high. We also found that definitions of some types in different classification systems are different, which also increased the inconsistency. For example, the definitions of grassland and bareland in GlobeLand30 and RLC were different, which seriously affects the consistency of these datasets. Hence, producers can use the existing landcover products as reference in ecological zones with dominant types and strong homogeneity. It is necessary to pay more attention on ecological zoning with complex land types and strong heterogeneity. An effective way is standardizing the definitions of complex land types, such as forest, shrubland, and grassland in these areas.

TI  - WILD CANIDS AS HOSTS FOR TICKS AND TICK-BORNE ZOONOTIC PATHOGENS IN SERBIA
T2  - Veterinarski Glasnik
M3  - Article
AB  - Wild canids are recognized as important reservoir hosts for several vector-borne pathogens and are a good sentinel species for epidemiological surveillance. Identifying the reservoir hosts for particular zoonotic pathogens in a specific area enables the implementation of adequate measures in order to prevent the occurrence of zoonotic diseases in humans and domestic animals. The present review aims to summarize the role of wild canids in the epidemiology of tick-borne zoonoses in Serbia based on previously published papers and to discuss the available data from an epidemiological point of view. The results of previously published studies indicate that wild canids are potential reservoir hosts for several zoonotic tick-borne pathogens in Serbia, and hosts for several tick species which are proven competent vectors. Based on molecular studies conducted so far, the presence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, was confirmed in jackals while the presence of Candidatus Neoehrlichia micurensis (FU98), Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia garinii, and Borrelia lusitaniae was proven by PCR in analyzed red foxes. There is a need for continuous epidemiological monitoring of diseases caused by pathogens previously confirmed in wild canids. Also, further research is needed to reveal the role of other wild and domestic animals in the epidemiology of tick-borne zoonoses in Serbia.

AB  - Mangrove forests have important values and roles both ecologically and economically in coastal areas. Over time, the area of mangrove forests in Indonesia decreased due to high rates of deforestation. One of the mangrove forests that has decreased in the area is the mangrove forest on the North Coast of East Java. Therefore, monitoring of changes in the density of the mangrove canopy is needed, especially in Gresik Regency. Mangrove ecosystems can be identified using remote sensing technology. To get the density level of the mangrove canopy, it can be done by calculating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) algorithm on the Sentinel 2A Level 1C satellite imagery in 2016-2019. Based on the results of the study, it was concluded that the dominant mangroves in Gresik Regency in 2016 to 2019 were mangroves with good density, which amounted to 58.66% in 2016; 53.21% in 2017; 45.22% in 2018, and 46.81% in 2019. Then, the mangrove area in Gresik Regency from 2016 to 2019 increased by 22.09% in 2017, then decreased by 1.74% in 2018 and continued to decrease by 8.28% in 2019. The most influential parameter for the density of mangrove canopy is the water pH with a correlation coefficient of -0.733 which shows that the density of mangroves canopy and the water pH has a strong and significant correlation.

AB  - Mangrove grows in coastal areas with the soil is resulted from the accumulation of mud substrate from the sedimentation process. Gresik Regency is a downstream area where the Bengawan Solo River flows and there is the Java Sea that carries a lot of sediment material to the coast. As a result, there is sedimentation that is forming new land increasingly that can be a place for mangroves to live. Therefore in this study, the calculation of suspended sediment concentration and mangrove area in Gresik Regency during 2016-2019 is using Sentinel-2A satellite imagery. The purpose of these calculations is to determine the effect of sedimentation as suspended sediment on changes in the mangrove area. Mangrove area is obtained from the Maximum Likelihood supervised classification. While suspended sediment concentrations estimated from remote sensing data are obtained using four prior algorithms but those do not meet the specified accuracy requirement. This research shows that there have been changes in the mangrove area in the form of increasing and decreasing during 2016-2019. The largest addition of area occurred in the period 2016-2017 which is 479.347 Ha and the most reduction in the area occurred in the period 2018-2019 which is 534.087 Ha. The statistical test result proves that the suspended sediment as sedimentation affects the mangrove by 64.9% in the significance level of 5% or 95% confidence level.

AB  - The problem of damage and infestation of forests by pests and diseases takes a significant place in forestry. The combination of these factors, taking into account cutting and harm to forests from fires and other human activities, as a result leads to tremendous degradation of forest ecosystems. In modern conditions, the forest pathological stands condition in Russia is determined on the basis of data from forest pathological surveys and state forest pathological monitoring. For the current period (2020), disappointing statistics remain on the reproduction of the Siberian silkworm population (Dendrolimus superans sibiricus Tscetv.) nd the negative consequences for taiga forests. Modern climatic changes on a planetary scale have a significant impact on mass outbreaks of dangerous phytophage. In the near future, adaptation measures in the field of forest pathological monitoring should be based on risk factors when planning forest protection measures, a diverse selection of adaptation options and adopting a flexible forest management system at the regional level. In this paper, we consider one of the methods for improving forest pathological monitoring, based on the principles of covering as large a territory as possible with remote sensing data (ERS) combined with predictive models based on GIS that allow predicting the risk of mass reproduction of the Siberian silkworm based on the previously studied factorial dependence.

AB  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to Sentinel 2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) imagery to investigate its ability to detect deforestation through direct analysis of resulting Singular Values and Principal Component loading matrices. Initial work aims to compare deforestation detection in small areas across North-East Rondonia, Brazil with previous deforestation studies. Subsequently, a deforestation analysis of the Sentinel 2 MSI using PCA in Sub-Saharan Africa is presented. Standardised PCA is applied through the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of channel standardised, resampled input imagery. First, cropped sub-areas of input imagery are considered, termed local PCA. Local PCA is applied to images separately (separate rotation) and to two-year image composites (merged rotation). Both approaches were found to detect forest cover changes, with separate rotation allowing for the generation of time-series data. The change detection resolution of both approaches is relatively low; being able to detect only if change has occurred in the general area and not the exact location of greatest change. In order to improve change detection resolution and identify the sub-areas of greatest change, separate rotation PCA is applied on a pixel scale. A simple statistical threshold is used to implement bi-temporal change detection, demonstrating the ability of this approach to detect forest cover changes at a higher resolution. Lessons learned from the separate rotation local PCA technique is used to analyse forest cover changes in an area in Sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - Monitoring crop phenology is crucial for making site-specific management decisions for crop protection and nutrition. The prominent yellow bloom associated with canola (Brassica napus L.) and similar yellow-flowering plants can provide cues about spatial differences as well as timing of crop input requirements. The objective of this study was to remotely characterize the phenological development of Brassicaceae oilseeds such as canola and carinata (B. carinata A. Braun) in terms of spectral-temporal dynamics between vegetation density and yellow flower density. Temporal variation of spectral indices (normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI], normalized difference yellowness index [NDYI], and visible atmospherically resistant index [VARI]) were measured in small plots over the growing season in relation to changes in vegetation density and flower density in winter canola and spring carinata. Phenological change between vegetative and reproductive development could be automatically detected using the difference in the change of the sign of Delta Index values between VARI and NDYI. An overall accuracy of 85% was obtained when testing the algorithm with Landsat 8 data of canola fields near Olds, AB, Canada. The contrasting behavior between reproductive and vegetation indices across flowering transitions was confirmed for three independent datasets across a range of genetic variation in Brassica oilseeds as well as geographic variation in soil types and management practices. A bivariate time series analysis procedure was developed for automatically estimating flowering transitions based on predictable, relative differences between vegetative and reproductive indices. Researchers and land managers can exploit optimal phenology windows to improve site-specific models and disease risk assessments.

AB  - The use of remote sensing technology has been widely used to estimate carbon stocks above ground level, including in mangrove forest landscapes. This study aims to obtain information on the spatial distribution of above-ground carbon using Landsat 8 satellite imagery in the Percut Sei Tuan mangrove forest landscape. Ordinary least square (OLS) regression method is used to build a model of estimating the spatial distribution of above-ground carbon based on vegetation index values of normalize different vegetation index (NDVI) and green normalize different vegetation index (GNDVI). The results showed the average carbon content above ground level in the Percut Sei Tuan forest landscape was 23.55 tons ha(-1). The power regression model is the best estimator model for the distribution of carbon content above ground level with the equation y = 205.9 x(4.2713) and R-2 of 72.4%.

M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and expansion of cities have a significant impact on the climate. It is essential to understand the impact of the land use land cover changes (LULC) on the regional climate variations over cities. This work mainly focuses on the changes in hotspot zones, UHIs during two different seasons - winter and summer. An attempt has been made to study the spatiotemporal variation in the urban heat islands (UHIs) and their relationship with LULC during 2000-2018, over Chandigarh (30 degrees 43' 59 '' N, 76 degrees 46' 46 '' E), a planned sub-tropical Indian city, using the remote sensing techniques. The indices such as Enhanced Built-up and Bareness Index (EBBI), Dry Built-up Index (DBI) and Dry Bare-Soil Index (DBSI) are employed to differentiate the built-up areas (BA) from the drylands (DL) effectively. The changes observed in the LULC reveals an increase of 10% in the BA at the expense of the vegetation during 2000-2018, which is in close agreement with the EBBI, DBI and DBSI assessments. A steady increase is observed in the UHI intensities for both summer and winter seasons during the study period. The UHIindex is noticed to be higher for the DL than that of the BA.

CL  - Bogor, INDONESIA
AB  - Severe and expansive land fires in Indonesia have been occurred since 1982 due to the human activities and got more severe because of El Nino phenomenon. The impact of this catastrophe has always been notorious. The land fires in 2019 burned down a total of 850,000 hectares of which 200,000 hectares were peat land. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) stated that 85% of the land fires incidence did not occur in concession land, on the contrary, The Ministry of Environment and Forestry claimed that 85% of the land fires were related to oil palm plantation or oil palm businesses. These contradictory statements of both government institutions have led to the public's bafflement, therefore the aim of this study was to seek the actual condition regarding the land fires in 2019. The results show that the BNPB statement was based on satellite data and actual field observation data while extinguishing the fires. Meanwhile, The Ministry of Environment and Forestry released their statement according to the land fires hotspots data. This research showed that there are many land fires cases actually detected from real time burn scar of Sentinel L1C and L2A, but are not detected from the MODIS C6 hotspots data. This fact related to the fire flow that fire was initiated mostly in areas with low biomass vegetation such as shrubs. This type of vegetation provided highly combustible fuel for fires so that fire continuously swept the whole similar areas and eventually approached areas with higher biomass vegetation, such as oil palm plantation. Once fire reaches and burns higher biomass vegetation, it lasts for a longer period, and will be recorded as hotspots data. Referring to the regulation of The Ministry of Environment and Forestry Number P.8/ MENLHK / General Secretariat / KUM.1 / 3 / 2018 article 8, land fires without hotspots recorded will not be the priority to be checked and controlled. Consequently, the fire will be only detected and then checked after reaching the area with higher biomass vegetation, such as oil palm plantation. There will be a significant delay for inspecting and controlling initial fires. This study also showed that as the result of this monitoring system, The Ministry of Environment and Forestry tended to assume that the land fires are mostly initiated and occurred on oil palm plantations or on concession areas. Therefore it can be concluded that hotspots data cannot be the only source for early warning land fires incidence. An alternative method which is more accurate and susceptive should be invented.

TI  - A Deep Multi-Attention Driven Approach for Multi-Label Remote Sensing Image Classification
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning (DL) based methods have been found popular in the framework of remote sensing (RS) image scene classification. Most of the existing DL based methods assume that training images are annotated by single-labels, however RS images typically contain multiple classes and thus can simultaneously be associated with multi-labels. Despite the success of existing methods in describing the information content of very high resolution aerial images with RGB bands, any direct adaptation for high-dimensional high-spatial resolution RS images falls short of accurate modeling the spectral and spatial information content. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel approach in the framework of the multi-label classification of high dimensional RS images. The proposed approach is based on three main steps. The first step describes the complex spatial and spectral content of image local areas by a novel K Branch CNN that includes spatial resolution specific CNN branches. The second step initially characterizes the importance scores of different local areas of each image and then defines a global descriptor for each image based on these scores. This is achieved by a novel multi-attention strategy that utilizes the bidirectional long short-term memory networks. The final step achieves the classification of RS image scenes with multi labels. Experiments carried out on BigEarthNet (which is a large-scale Sentinel-2 benchmark archive) show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of multi-label classification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB  - The military requirements of space security defense and space fast response are increasingly urgent. Accurate and effective micro anomaly detection of on-orbit satellites is an important technical way of satellites life cycle health management. Under this military background, the micro anomaly detection of the key components of the satellite is proposed and carried out. In order to solve the problems of low diagnostic accuracy of the traditional Voherra series model in satellite telemetry signal micro anomaly detection, o-Voherra series anomaly detection model for the feature extraction of telemetry data based on the optimized sequence model is proposed. Firstly, the feature of satellite telemetry data is extracted by using the constructed optimized sequence model. Secondly, phase space reconstruction of telemetry data after preprocessing and feature extraction. Finally, the telemetry data micro anomaly detection are realized by the proposed o-Voherra series model. Through the remote sensing data experiment of the key components of the satellite after desensitization, the proposed model can accurately realize the micro anomaly detection of the key components of the satellite.

AB  - Based on the datasets of MODIS NDVI and SPOT VETGETATION NDVI from 1999 to 2018, this study has introduced the gravity centre model and time-lag analysis model to explore the spatial-temporal change patterns of the NDVI in China in different sub-regions and its response to climate factors. Results showed that: (1) In 1999-2018, there was an increasing trend in vegetation coverage in China on the whole, with a larger increase occurring in central south and northeast China. (2) The NDVIs of six land use types showed a similar change trend with temperature and precipitation with different time lags. (3) The maximum correlation coefficients between the NDVIs of different land types and climate factors appeared at Lag 0-1 (current month and previous one month) and Lag 0-2 (current month, previous one and two month), while the correlation coefficients were the lowest at Lag 3 (previous three month). (4) During the past twenty years, the gravity centres of the NDVI, temperature and precipitation moved northward as a whole with similar migration trajectories. These results could provide important decision supports for vegetation restorations and ecological protections in different sub-regions of China.

TI  - Estimation of GDP Using Deep Learning With NPP-VIIRS Imagery and Land Cover Data at the County Level in CONUS
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of gross domestic product (GDP) at small geographies is of great significance to evaluate the distribution and dynamics of socio-economic development. Nighttime light (NTL) data is becoming increasingly important in socio-economic data estimation. However, previous research has found that using NTL alone is insufficient to accurately measure the GDP at small geographies, and the contribution of NTL for time-series GDP estimation is unreliable. This article proposed a deep learning method for the Contiguous United States (CONUS) time-series (2012-2015) GDP estimation at county level. The model is developed by combining the NTL data from the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite day/night band and the MODIS land cover data. The proposed method can improve the existing methods mainly in two ways. First, by taking advantage of the great computing power of the Google Earth Engine, a histogram-based feature regulation method was employed, which not only keeps more information over regions but also provides dimension-reduced tensors from mass remote sensing data. Second, a multi-inputs convolutional neural network-based model was proposed instead of the traditional linear regression model for multisource feature exploration and learning. The proposed method was evaluated by leave-one-year-out cross-validation with the time-series (2012-2015) data. The results show that the R-2 between the actual and estimated GDP are 0.81, 0.83, 0.83, and 0.83 for years from 2012 to 2015, indicating a good predictive power of the proposed model. Given that the data employed are globally and publicly available, the proposed method would also be applicable in other countries or regions where socio-economic survey data is hard to obtain.

TI  - Multilevel Deep Learning Network for County-Level Corn Yield Estimation in the US Corn Belt
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely estimation of crop yield at a small scale is of great significance to food security and harvest management. Recent studies have proven remote sensing is an efficient method for yield estimation and machine learning, especially deep learning, can infer a good prediction by integrating multisource datasets such as satellite data, climate data, soil data, and so on. However, there are some bottleneck challenges to improve accuracy. First, the popular remote sensing data used for yield prediction fall into two major groups-time-series data and constant data. Surprisingly little attention has been devoted to deep learning networks which can integrate the two kinds of data effectively; second, both temporal and spatial features play a role in affecting the yields. But most of the existing approaches employed either convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN). CNN cannot learn temporal patterns, while RNN barely can learn spatial characteristics. This work proposed a novel multilevel deep learning model coupling RNN and CNN to extract both spatial and temporal features. The inputs include both time-series remote sensing data, soil property data, and the model outputs yield. We experimented with the model in U.S. Corn Belt states, and used it to predict corn yield from 2013 to 2016 at the county-level. The results approve the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach over the other methods. In the future, the model will be used on other crops such as soybean and winter wheat to assist agricultural decision-making.

TI  - Continuous Expansions of Yangtze River Islands After the Three Gorges Dam Tracked by Landsat Data Based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the change of river islands is essential for water conservancy construction, channel navigation safety, and industrial/agricultural production. Yangtze River is the largest river in China; however, there are few long-term monitoring results on the changes of Yangtze River islands. To fill this gap, Landsat data available on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) were used to obtain the annual changes of the Yangtze River islands located from the lower reaches of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) to the Yangtze River delta during 1986-2017. Moreover, we focused on the changes of those islands before and after the construction of the TGD. Annual areas of all river islands were calculated and spatial-temporal pattern of Yangtze River islands were analyzed. Our satellite observation results show continuous expansions of Yangtze River islands after the construction of the TGD in 2003. For the total 138 river islands, in three stages: before 2003, after 2003 and in the 32-year study period, 68, 118, and 124 river islands showed increasing trends, with the net increase of 286.47 km(2), 417.49 km(2), and 665.62 km(2). For the total 92 river island groups (138 islands), percentages of river island expansion are 41.30% (before 2003), 80.43% (after 2003) and 88.04% (1986-2017). Moreover, we found 10 newly developed river islands, with a net expansion of 87.42 km(2) and an expansion rate of 2.73 km(2)/year. The significant decrease (2-4 m) in water level before and after the TGD might be the main factor that results in the observed expansion of Yangtze islands downstream the TGD. We also highlighted the importance of using all available Landsat imagery for tracking the changes of river islands. Our satellite-derived dataset provide reference data for the land use planning and environmental protection in the Yangtze River drainage basin.

AB  - Crosstalk contamination in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal emissive bands (TEBs) has been a known issue since prelaunch, that has amplified on-orbit for some of bands. A linear algorithm has been developed and successfully applied to mitigate the crosstalk effect and restore the quality and accuracy of the MODIS L1B products. Significant crosstalk effect has also been found and characterized in TEBs of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP). NOAA-20 VIIRS, a follow-on instrument to SNPP VIIRS, was launched on November 18, 2017. In this report, it is shown that there are nonnegligible crosstalk contaminations among the TEBs of NOAA-20 VIIRS as well. They are characterized using the scheduled lunar observations and compared with those in SNPP VIIRS.

AB  - We aim to introduce and demonstrate several improvements that are applied to the on-orbit solar diffuser (SD) calibration of the day-night band (DNB) low gain stage (LGS) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the NOAA-20 satellite. The most important improvement is the expansion of the angular range, referred to "sweet spot", from 4 degrees to 7.8 degrees in order to increase the number of fully-illuminated scans considered for the SD calculation. The increase in scan number enables the completion of on-orbit calibration using the SD within one orbit, compared with the multiple orbits approach, which is required in the current standard approach applied in operational DNB LGS calibration coefficients look-up tables (LUTs) updates. The NOAA-20 DNB LGS calibration coefficients have been derived with the new methodology and the results show a more stable, smoother, and less noisy trend when compared with the current standard approach. The results also demonstrate that the NOAA-20 VIIRS DNB overall on-orbit performance has been very stable.

CP  - Conference on Sensors, Systems, and Next-Generation Satellites XXIV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on-board the Terra and Aqua spacecrafts were launched on December 18, 1999 and May 4, 2002, respectively. Each instrument has been scheduled to view the Moon through its Space View (SV) port approximately once per month in order to monitor the long-term radiometric stability of their reflective solar bands (RSB). The lunar calibration has played a key role in tracking the change in the response versus scan angle (RVS) of the instrument's scan mirror, which is an essential part of the RSB calibration. The lunar irradiance observed by MODIS depends on the view geometry and it is crucial to remove the geometric effects in order to derive accurate RSB calibration coefficients. With a scheduled roll maneuver, the lunar phase angles are kept in a narrow range of 1 degrees for each MODIS instrument such that the impact of these geometric effects is minimized. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to completely remove the impact of geometric effects in the calibration coefficients derived from the lunar observations, considering the high expectations for the accuracy and quality of the results. In the current MODIS lunar calibration, the geometric effects on the lunar irradiance are corrected by the RObotic Lunar Observatory (ROLO) model. The overall relative uncertainty of the ROLO model for the MODIS calibration has been assessed to be about 1% in the selected lunar phase angle range of 1 degrees. It could be as large as 4% beyond this small phase angle range, especially for the shortest wavelengths. This uncertainty induces noticeable oscillations in the calibration coefficients derived from the lunar observations. We developed a simple lunar model, which is based on MODIS lunar measurements, derived from scheduled lunar observations, as well as those obtained from intrusion of the Moon in the SV, referred to as unscheduled lunar observations, in the time period from 2005 to 2012. Here, the scheduled lunar observations for the entire mission are reprocessed with the new lunar model applied to correct the view geometry effects for each MODIS instrument. New calibration coefficients for the RSBs are calculated. We show that oscillations and noise in the derived lunar calibration coefficients are significantly reduced for both MODIS instruments.

TI  - Integration of Time Series Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Imagery for Crop Type Mapping over Oasis Agricultural Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate crop type mapping is a critical prerequisite for the estimation of water availability and environmental carrying capacity. This research proposed a method to integrate time series Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data for crop type mapping over oasis agricultural areas through a case study in Northwest China. Previous studies using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data alone often yield quite limited accuracy in crop type identification due to speckles. To improve the quality of SAR features, we adopted a statistically homogeneous pixel (SHP) distributed scatterer interferometry (DSI) algorithm, originally proposed in the interferometric SAR (InSAR) community for distributed scatters (DSs) extraction, to identify statistically homogeneous pixel subsets (SHPs). On the basis of this algorithm, the SAR backscatter intensity was de-speckled, and the bias of coherence was mitigated. In addition to backscatter intensity, several InSAR products were extracted for crop type classification, including the interferometric coherence, master versus slave intensity ratio, and amplitude dispersion derived from SAR data. To explore the role of red-edge wavelengths in oasis crop type discrimination, we derived 11 red-edge indices and three red-edge bands from Sentinel-2 images, together with the conventional optical features, to serve as input features for classification. To deal with the high dimension of combined SAR and optical features, an automated feature selection method, i.e., recursive feature increment, was developed to obtain the optimal combination of S1 and S2 features to achieve the highest mapping accuracy. Using a random forest classifier, a distribution map of five major crop types was produced with an overall accuracy of 83.22% and kappa coefficient of 0.77. The contribution of SAR and optical features were investigated. SAR intensity in VH polarization was proved to be most important for crop type identification among all the microwave and optical features employed in this study. Some of the InSAR products, i.e., the amplitude dispersion, master versus slave intensity ratio, and coherence, were found to be beneficial for oasis crop type mapping. It was proved the inclusion of red-edge wavelengths improved the overall accuracy (OA) of crop type mapping by 1.84% compared with only using conventional optical features. In comparison, it was demonstrated that the synergistic use of time series Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data achieved the best performance in the oasis crop type discrimination.

TI  - Improved mapping and understanding of desert vegetation-habitat complexes from intraannual series of spectral endmember space using cross-wavelet transform and logistic regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Desert vegetation-habitat complexes in dryland systems are fragile ecosystems with complex vegetation-habitat feedback, and have significant implications for natural environment protection and global climate change mitigation. However, a spatial-detailed and high-precision remote sensing method for the identification of desert vegetation-habitat complexes and characterization of their biophysical processes remain scarce. Here, we developed an innovative cross-wavelet transform (XWT)-based approach coupled with logistic regression to extract critical vegetation-habitat interaction characteristics in order to identify, map, and understand their complex ecological processes. Fine intraannual profiles between the green vegetation (GV) fraction and habitat fractions including dark material (DA), saline land (SA), sand land (SL) were unmixed by Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) from 16-period Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide field of view (WFV) images in Minqin County, after which XWT was performed to extract feedback characteristics as feature parameters. Major principal components (PCs) were obtained from those feature parameters to reduce dimensions and solve multi-collinearity, logistic regression was applied for mapping. The results demonstrate that the proposed procedure efficiently reproduced desert vegetation-habitat complexes with high accuracy (overall accuracy: 87.33%; Kappa coefficient: 0.86) in the entire Minqin County, representing a 3.42% overall accuracy increase relative to a previously published decision tree (DT) method. The new method also had a lower quantity and allocation disagreement. Moreover, this procedure not only achieved comparable accuracy to that of an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) and superior to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based U-net model, but also explored biophysical processes and complex relationships with better interpretability. Therefore, the developed approach has the potential for accurately monitoring the highly heterogeneous dryland landscape and characterizing the land degradation processes in the spectral endmember space of fine spatial-temporal remote sensing data.

AB  - The long time series vegetation productivity products are of great significance to the research of increasing CO2 and global changes. In this paper, global net primary productivity (NPP) in 1981-2018 was firstly estimated with Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) data , ERA-Interim meteorological data and the other variables by using the improved Multi-source data Synergized Quantitative (MuSyQ) NPP algorithm. The average global NPP is 61.0 PgC/yr in 1981-2018, which is in great agreement with the other similar products. The global NPP has shown a significant increase trend, with an annual growth rate of 0.10 PgC/yr over the past 38 years. NPP in the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere account for 62.0% and 38.0% of the global respectively, both show an increasing trend. The overall increasing trends in NPP are also consistent among most of the biomes.

TI  - Integrating satellite observations and human water use data to estimate changes in key components of terrestrial water storage in a semi-arid region of North China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable management strategies for water resources rely on accurate knowledge about the dynamics of hydrological processes, especially in drylands, where freshwater is the limiting factor for the development of human society and ecosystems. The populated Loess Plateau (LP) in North China is a typical semi-arid region where competition for water between people and nature is worth noting because of afforestation promoted by the Grain to Green Program. In this study, changes in key components of terrestrial water storage (TWS) in the LP were explored using a multi-satellite approach, including Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations and Earth observations of precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture. By integrating data on human water use from different sources with satellite observations, we were able to examine the mechanisms driving these changes. The results demonstrated that, according to an evaluation based on reproducing TWS computed from the regional water balance in the LP, the mascon solution of the Center for Space Research (CSR) at University of Texas at Austin performed best out of the commonly used GRACE products. Regional TWS derived from the CSR mascon solution in the LP decreased significantly for the period 2003-2015. Significant decreases were also detected for regional ground water storage (GWS) estimated by decomposing the GRACE TWS using multi-sources remote sensing data. GWS made the greatest contribution to the changes in TWS. Increased plant transpiration was one reason for the decreasing trend of GWS. Because changes in precipitation, soil moisture and water consumed by irrigation were minor at regional scales, we concluded that the increase of transpiration is driven by deep-rooted trees planted, which use the part of precipitation that previously recharged groundwater. The findings from this study are valuable for water resource management and ecological restoration in semi-arid regions with high populations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: About 30% of the breast's ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) will be histological upstate according to the postoperative pathology. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is currently recommended on most DCIS excision in order to potentially avoid secondary surgery, which is apparently over-treated for most patients with DCIS. Hence, the decision to perform SLNB before DCIS excision remains controversial. The aim of this study is to establish an improved nomogram including elastography for predicting the risk of the histological upgrade of DCIS preoperatively.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 147 patients who were preoperatively diagnosed with DCIS and underwent breast surgery were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into DCIS group (n=99) and DCIS with invasive components (DCIS-IC) group (n=48) according to the postoperative pathology results. The clinicopathologic and multimode ultrasonic records were analyzed and used to develop the nomogram. The difference in performance between the nomogram with and without acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography was compared in this study.RESULTS: Patients with high-grade lesions (OR = 4.762, p = 0.032), positive human epidemal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) expression (OR = 3.560, p = 0.007). comedo type of DCIS (OR: 3.163, p = 0.041), larger lesion size (OR = 3.253, p =0.002), and higher mean SWV value (SWVmean) (OR: 5.083, p < 0.001) were found to be independent factors associated with the histologic upgrade. The discrimination of the nomogram (0.896), including the 5 independent predictors (ARFI elastography included), was higher than that without ARFI elastography (0.788). It could be utilized to predict the probability of the histologic upgrade of DCIS.CONCLUSIONS: The developed nomogram incorporating ARFI elastography is expected to predict the risk of the histologic upgrade of DCIS preoperatively and to provide a reference for the decision making for SLNB. It showed improved performance owing to the elastography.

TI  - Regional-scale drought monitor using synthesized index based on remote sensing in northeast China
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought has a significant impact on agricultural, ecological, and socioeconomic spheres. Although many drought indices have been proposed until now, the detection of droughts at regional scales still needs to be further studied. The Standardized Vegetation Index (SVI) that represents vegetation growing condition, the Standardized Water Index (SWI) that represents canopy water content, and the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) that quantifies anomalies in the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration were calculated based on the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. A new remote sensing-based Vegetation Drought Monitor Synthesized Index (VDSI) was proposed by integrating the SVI, SWI, and ESI in the northeast China. When tested against the in situ Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), VDSI with proper weights of three variables outperformed individual remote sensing drought indices. The county-level yields of the main crops in the study area from 2001 to 2010 were also used to validate the VDSI. The correlation analysis between the yield data and the VDSI data during the crop growing season was performed, and its results showed that VDSI during the crop reproductive growth period was strongly correlated with the variation of crop yield. It was proved that this index is a potential indicator for assessment of the spatial pattern of drought severity in northeast China.

AB  - In many remote sensing methods, the use of spectral information to obtain large-area soil salinization information has been a key focus of research. Typical samples of saline soil in Da'an city west of Jilin were selected as the research area, and co-observation was conducted using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral images and Sentinel-2 data. To provide a method for testing the authenticity of satellite products in high-resolution UAV images, three kinds of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were obtained by calculating the positive point, polymerization of 80 and 140 pixels of the infrared band reflectance was extracted from the UAV image, and correlation analysis of NDVI with Sentinel-2 was carried out.

TI  - Deep Learning Classification for Crop Types in North Dakota
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, agricultural remote sensing community has endeavored to utilize the power of artificial intelligence (AI). One important topic is using AI to make the mapping of crops more accurate, automatic, and rapid. This article proposed a classification workflow using deep neural network (DNN) to produce high-quality in-season crop maps from Landsat imageries for North Dakota. We use historical crop maps from the agricultural department and North Dakota ground measurements as training datasets. Processing workflows are created to automate the tedious preprocessing, training, testing, and postprocessing workflows. We tested this hybrid solution on new images and received accurate results on major crops such as corn, soybean, barley, spring wheat, dry beans, sugar beets, and alfalfa. The pixelwise overall accuracy in all three test regions is over 82% for all land types (including noncrop land), which is the same level of accuracy as the U.S. Department of Agriculture Cropland Data Layer. The texture of DNN maps is more consistent with fewer noises, which is more comfortable to read. We find DNN is better on recognizing big farmlands than recognizing the scattered wetlands and suburban regions in North Dakota. The model trained on multiple scenes of multiple years and months yields higher accuracy than any of the models trained only on a single scene, a single month, or a single year. These results reflect that DNN can produce reliable in-season maps for major crops in North Dakota big farms and could provide a relatively accurate reference for the minor crops in scattered wetland fields.

AB  - This study examines how to overcome traumatic memory of conservative Christians as a solution to ideological conflict within the church by presenting a view to analyzing their active involvement in political rallies as excessive psychological anxiety caused by historical trauma. The traumatic memory of the great misdeeds and persecution of the Korean War has not yet been overcome, causing fear to most conservative Christians. War experiences are so powerful that they tend to become worldview beliefs, and these internalized beliefs have had a lasting impact on the next generations who did not directly experience war in the divided Korean Peninsula. Such an analysis explains a lot about why con- servative Christians are more likely to participate in political rallies than other groups, and how their political consciousness is combined with religious beliefs.According to the memory discourse of Miroslav Volf, memory should be redeemed. The healing of traumatic memory consists of three steps: securing safety and restoring control, accepting traumatic memory as part of life, and re-connecting with the others. Therefore, rather than unconditionally criticizing conservative Christians participating in Taegeukgi rally, it would be necessary to help them to have confidence in the stability of the liberal democratic system, in order to relieve their fear of war, persecution of Christianity, and return to poverty.

AB  - Identification of clouds and cloud shadows in terrestrial remotely sensed imagery is an important first processing step during generation of surface data products. One of the most successful automated cloud masking algorithms is fmask which has been used extensively with Landsat data. The algorithm uses a series of spectral tests to identify potential cloud pixels followed by an additional test to eliminate bright materials which may be incorrectly identified as clouds. In this study we investigate the performance of fmask using realistic spectral scene simulations of partly cloudy scenes. Using simulated imagery provides a unique opportunity to evaluate algorithm performance knowing truth for each pixel in the scene. In this study, the fmask algorithm correctly identified pixels as clouds when the optical depth of the cloud pixel was above a scene dependent threshold which varied from an optical depth of 3 to 10.

AB  - Multispectral Image classification is one of the Important and complex tasks in remote sensing image analysis. Many approaches have been studied to improve classification performance. Most of these methods use pixel based Classification. Unlike, this paper proposed object based Classification which uses Vector data by make use of geometrical shapes like lines and polygons. Series of steps are designed and implemented for remote sensing satellite images like Deimos-2 and Cartosat-1. The Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient values have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method. These values are 93.6% and 87% respectively for Deimos-2 Data. But for Cartosat-1 Data accuracy values are less and observed as 87.33% and 81%. Besides, the proposed method can be useful in tree parameters estimation along with supported elevation data.

AB  - The Ryukyu, which has now become the Okinawa Prefecture in Japan, faces an era of political and economic stability as it enters the era of the unified kingdom, starting with the era of villages and tribes, through the era of Gusuku, which built the castle. For about 450 years, the Unified Kingdom, which had its own culture, was the center of maritime trade in the South Sea and maintained its position as a bridge between Southeast and Southwest Asia, and China, the Korean Peninsula, and the Japanese Islands. But internally, it respected traditional culture and maintained a unique form of ancient belief. Therefore, people who lived on the island were connected by blood and had a strong sense of community.People and the village society were closely connected and had few opportunities to leave the village because they had little social interaction with other local villages. Marriage forms were also extremely closed as marriages on the island were customary around cousins and relatives. Therefore, most of the peasants rarely lived out of the village. So the island space had a sanctuary and a worldview related to the ancestral gods or the supernatural gods, each telling a conflicting story.In this paper, we will consider the origin of the folk belief of the Ryukyu, focusing on the traditional faith related to the occurrence of religion in history and the indigenous religion, which is characteristic of this Ryukyu culture, and also infer the relation between Dangsan and Seonghwangdang in Korea.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the qualitative and quantitative effects of environmental policies in terms of green space management using logistic regression model(LRM). Landsat satellite imageries in 1985, 1992, 2000, 2008, and 2015 are classified using a hybrid-classification method. Based on these classified maps, logistic regression model having a deforestation tendency of the past is built. Binary green space change map is used for the dependent variable and four explanatory variables are used: distance from green space, distance from settlements, elevation, and slope. The green space map of 2008 and 2015 is predicted using the constructed model. The conservation effect of Ulsan’s environmental policies is quantified through the numerical comparison of green area between the predicted and real data. Time-series analysis of green space showed that restoration and destruction of green space are highly related to human activities rather than natural land transition. The effect of green space management policy was spatially-explicit and brought a significant increase in green space.Furthermore, as a result of quantitative analysis, Ulsan’s environmental policy had effects of conserving and restoring 111.75 ㎢ and 175.45 ㎢ respectively for the periods of eight and fifteen years. Among four variables, slope was the most determinant factor that accounts for the destruction of green space in the city. This study presents logistic regression model as a way of evaluating the effect of environmental policies that have been practiced in the city. It has its significance in that it allows us a comprehensive understanding of the effect by considering every direct and indirect effect from other domains, such as air and water, on green space. We conclude discussing practicability of implementing environmental policy in terms of green space management with the focus on a non-statutory plan.

AB  - Polarization Orientation Angle (POA) estimation and compensation with P-band, L-band and C-band Po1SAR data are investigated previously. In this paper, we focus on the POA estimation performance with X-band Po1SAR data. We analyze the effect of SAR image resolutions, signal to noise ratio (SNR) and scattering characteristics on POA estimation. Through the processing results of the airborne Po1SAR data and TerraSAR-X Po1SAR data, we can see that the POA estimation can be successfully executed in the building areas and non-vegetation covered areas, which will facilitate the Po1SAR and Po1InSAR processing. However, POA estimation will fail in other areas except for the built-up regions when the SAR image resolutions are below 3 meters even the high SNR of X-band Po1SAR data. We illustrate the conclusions by Po1SAR data experiments.

AB  - Karawang Regency is the top rice producer within West Java, Indonesia. Accurate information about the number of harvest area is essential in rice production in Indonesia. The Sentinel imageries (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) which have a spatial resolution of 10 meters can provide spectral information on the earth surface in relatively narrow temporal resolution. The study aims to spatially analyze the rice field phenology using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery and estimate the rice productivity in Karawang Regency. The study used Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1, with the C-Band, which are capable of monitoring rice phenology and Sentinel-2. The combination of polarization from SAR and vegetation index algorithm from the optical image are used to determine the age of rice plants, which then used to estimate rice productivity. The stage of rice was land preparation, vegetative, generative, and harvesting. The result from the estimation of harvest area is between 102,965.00 - 109,338.27 hectares, and the estimation of rice productivity is 5-6 tons/hectares in Karawang Regency.

TI  - THE VARIETY OF PROPER NAMES IN E. BARSOV'S <i>LAMENTATIONS OF THE NORTHERN LAND</i>
T2  - VOPROSY ONOMASTIKI-PROBLEMS OF ONOMASTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with a broad variety of names featured in the three-volume Lamentations of the Northern Land published by Elpidifor Barsov in 1872-1885. The toponymy of lamentations has been repeatedly addressed by researchers as the most prevalent and diverse class of proper names due to its symbolic weight and a pronounced local colour. This study aims to bridge the gaps in the systemic description of other categories of names presented in this collection (ethnonyms, chrononyms, theonyms and hagionyms, anthroponyms, and onomastic derivatives). These may lack the diversity of toponyms but are intrinsically related to the genre of lamentation in terms of their composition and usage. Therefore, a comprehensive description of these classes is required, primarily from the standpoint of linguistic pragmatics. Christian onyms (theonyms, hagionyms, chrononyms, ecclesionyms, names of icons (iconyms)) are most frequent in lamentations, which reflects the later influence of Orthodox worldview on this archaic genre and the proliferation of Christian naming patterns. Alternatively, the same could be explained by intergeneric influence, meaning that Orthodox vocabulary and semantic oppositions in lamentations could be assimilated from spiritual verses. The fact that lamentations were only performed by women also speaks on favour of the genre-driven nature of their onymic composition, abound in proper names reflecting the "female" perspective. These include regional toponyms forming a local image of space, mentions of "female" calendar holidays, religious names reflecting a special role of the Mother of God cult. The onomasticon of lamentations is also an important linguo-geographic source. For example, the predominance of Olonets toponymy in Lamentations and its hydrocentricity (a large share of names of water bodies and settlements located near large lakes and rivers) attests to the North Russian origin of this genre. Frequent mentions of the names of monasteries and the near-by holy sources, facts of ecclesiastical naming of cemeteries, and other local features also highlight the regional specificity of this collection.

AB  - Estimating rice production is vital in ensuring economic stability. One of the critical element in the estimation is the information on the width of the rice field. The uncertainty on this aspect is exacerbated by which the rice field is calculated. The current method only considers the width of the fields, without taking into account the rice field embankment. The width of the embankment is usually between 25 cm to several meters. Neglecting the contribution of this embankment to the overall width of the rice fields can result in overestimation to the rice production. In this research, the coefficient of rice field embankment is calculated. The data used are from high-resolution satellite imagery of Pleades, SPOT-6, Worldview, and GeoEye. UAV data from rice fields in Yogyakarta was used as control data. The study area covers rice fields in Bengkulu, Jambi, Riau, Bangka Belitung, Sulawesi Tenggara, Sulawesi Barat, Sulawesi Tengah, Gorontalo, Maluku, Nusa Tenggara Timur, and Papua. Two types of digitization methods were used. The first one is a rice field without any embankment incorporated. Only road or irrigation channel wider than 2.5 meters were included. The second one is a rice field with embankment feature digitized. The coefficient of the embankment is calculated by dividing the width of the embankment with the width of rice fields without embankment. For a different location, the coefficient is different, between 1% - 3 %. Types of rice fields, satellite imagery being used, and topography affect the coefficient.

AB  - The traditional methods for measuring water quality and suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) are time-consuming and often do not give the spatial and temporal detail needed for assessment of the water quality and sediment transport. The determination of the suspended sediment concentrations using remote sensing through the main channel and tributaries of Rhine River can provide valuable information to assess the spatial and temporal of the suspended sediment. The main objective of this study is to estimate the suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) using Landsat satellite images. This study developed a method of quantifying SSC based on Landsat imagery and corresponding SSC data from the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine (IKSR) and Dutch Rijkswaterstaat from 1995 to 2016. The model was built using the ratio of logarithmic transformation of a red/green band and logarithmic transformation of SSC based on in-situ sampling measurements. The SSC model works well and shows satisfactory performance. Landsat satellites (Thematic Mapper (TM), Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM), Operational Land Imager (OLI)) explained an acceptable result accuracy.

TI  - An assessment of the aboveground phytomass and carbon levels of the forests of northern Telangana, India, using a geospatial technique
T2  - Biodiversity (Ottawa)
M3  - Article
AB  - An assessment of aboveground phytomass and carbon levels was conducted in the South-Central region of India, in the Telangana State, situated on the high Deccan Plateau. The study is based on field observations at 30 sites using cluster sampling. The sites were selected on homogeneity maps prepared using satellite data of forest cover type maps, forest cover density maps, normalized difference vegetation indices and maps of administrative boundaries. Field observations such as forest types, canopy cover, species, girth and plant height were made for assessing basal area, bole volume, biomass and carbon, first for each tree, then for each plot and then for the entire region. The basal area varied from 0.09 to 40.94 m(2)/ha, and the phytomass ranged from 0.07 to 174.69 t/ha. The total phytomass in the study area was about 6709.623 t, with a mean value of 859.10 t/ha per site (i.e. 250 x 250 m). The predicted carbon was 5.02 million tons (Mt) (standard deviation [SD] 9.542) against the total phytomass of 10.46 Mt (SD 19.878) for the study area. These data can provide essential information for helping to establish forest policies that support a more sustainable development of local forest resources, as well as for structuring forest management working plans.Key policy insightsThe study reveals the observed and predicted biomass and carbon of northern Telangana, India.The key purpose of the study is to determine the biomass and carbon content of northern Telangana, in light of the Kyoto Protocol.For the study area, the predicted carbon is 5.02 Mt against the total biomass of 10.46 Mt.The forest density, phytomass and carbon maps are the first of their kind at a landscape scale for the Telangana State of India.These data help to assess and inform forest policies, which contribute towards the sustainable development of forest resources through preserving the ecological integrity of this landscape.

AB  - This paper presents a method to identify tropical peatland degradation using satellite remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Mapping the spatial distribution of tropical peatland degradation is important for decision making of peatland restoration and disaster mitigation against peat fire. This study used Landsat-8 imageries as the basic data to identify the tropical peatland degradation and analyzed using GIS tools. Rupat Island and Tebing Tinggi Island in Riau Province were picked up as pilot project areas for this research because these areas historically had many fire spots in the peatland on last few years. The identification of tropical peatland degradation on Landsat-8 imageries data was carried out using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on composites of band ratios and single band variables. The identified peatland degradation was overlaid spatially with peat fire events using GIS tools. The results of the analysis were confirmed with the ground check field survey data and other map from a separate study to estimate the accuracy of the proposed method. The results show how the approach can be used to distinguish tropical peatland degradation at locations within a map unit quickly and cost effective. The best band combination of using Landsat 8 for mapping the peatlands, and to classify them, was 753. The land cover types of study areas have a correlation with the historical peat fire, where the peat fire usually occurs in degrade peat land. The result of the degradation peatland map from this study will be useful for decision making on land management, peatland restoration and carbon storage in soil. The classification of the peat area from this study could be used to prioritize the area of restoration program by the Indonesian government and stake holder.

TI  - Characteristics of Short-Period Internal Waves in the Avacha Bay Based on the <i>In Situ</i> and Satellite Observations in August-September, 2018
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The paper is aimed at evaluating the characteristics of short-period internal waves in different regions of the Avacha Bay in the Pacific Ocean concerning their hydrological and morphometric conditions.Methods and Results. The characteristics of internal waves are assessed through synthesizing the results of the in situ studies in the Avacha Bay in August-September, 2018, the high-resolution remote sensing data and the results of tidal modeling. The data of the in situ and satellite observations of internal waves were also directly compared. The results show that in the shallow part of the Avacha Bay, the waves, whose heights are from 10 to 15 m were observed. They constitute 10 % of the total number of cases. In the deep-water part of the bay, the internal waves are also often observed, but their maximum height does not exceed 10 m. The satellite images show 72 manifestations of short-period internal waves. Some of them spread to the coast with a tidal frequency from the generation source located around the 500 m isobath where the bottom abruptly slows down.Conclusions. The results of the investigation revealed a pronounced relationship between the wave trains recorded in the shallow-water area and the semidiurnal tidal dynamics. Analysis of the hydrological situation and the satellite images permitted to assume that the internal waves could be generated as a result of not only a barotropic tide collapse, but also due to the inertial oscillations of the frontal zone formed by the Kamchatka current meanders in the presence of a shallow sharpened pycnocline. Having been analyzed, the synchronous satellite and in situ observations made it possible to fmd out that the internal waves of the 5-8 m height were distinctly manifested on the sea surface in case the pycnocline depth was 10-20 m.

AB  - Many organizations process big data for important business operations and decisions. Hence, data quality greatly affects their success. Data quality problems continue to be widespread, costing US businesses an estimated $600 billion annually. To date, addressing data quality in production environments still poses many challenges: easily defining properties of high-quality data; validating production-scale data in a timely manner; debugging poor quality data; designing data quality solutions to be easy to use, understand, and operate; and designing data quality solutions to easily integrate with other systems. Current data validation solutions do not comprehensively address these challenges. To address data quality in production environments at LinkedIn, we developed Data Sentinel, a declarative production-scale data validation platform. In a simple and well-structured configuration, users declaratively specify the desired data checks. Then, Data Sentinel performs these data checks and writes the results to an easily understandable report. Furthermore, Data Sentinel provides well-defined schemas for the configuration and report. This makes it easy for other systems to interface or integrate with Data Sentinel. To make Data Sentinel even easier to use, understand, and operate in production environments, we provide Data Sentinel Service (DSS), a complementary system to help specify data checks, schedule, deploy, and tune data validation jobs, and understand data checking results. The contributions of this paper include the following: 1) Data Sentinel, a declarative production-scale data validation platform successfully deployed at LinkedIn 2) A generic design to build and deploy similar systems for production environments 3) Experiences and lessons learned that can benefit practitioners with similar objectives.

TI  - Melancholy in the Newest Polish Poetry
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with Polish poetry at the turn of the 21st century from the perspective of its important category such as melancholy. Before the era of "involvement" began in Polish literature, it had been dominated by the categories firmly rooted in the aesthetics of nostalgy, and melancholy in particular. It was the first reaction of Polish literature to the situation resulting from the axiological, epistemological and social threat typical of the culture of late capitalism. Due to the fact that melancholy is a primary psychological category, it adheres more to modernist than postmodernist thinking. Thus we are likely to find more modernist poetical melancholy than postmodernist one. As for the former, the most existentially convincing version of poetic melancholy is represented by the so-called "old masters", such as Jaroslaw Marek Rymkiewicz or Tadeusz Rozewicz. Both poets do not strive to compensate for losses - like Czeslaw Milosz or Zbigniew Herbert. Rozewicz's poetry proves that melancholy does not necessarily have to be a "passive" category, it is primarily a tool for criticism of culture. On the other hand, thanks to melancholy, Rymkiewicz seriously revaluates his previous cultural worldview - it changes from the language of culture to the "language of nature". Among the poets debuting after 1989,, the most melancholic (this being this is the principle of all their works) are Marcin Swietlicki and Eugeniusz Tkaczyszyn-Dycki. The subject of Swietlicki is constantly and increasingly disappearing, he dissolves, reporting subsequent states of his "post-life". The poetic world of Tkaczyszyn-Dycki is extremely monotonous, his subject is obsessed with the idea of death, illness and homelessness. Probably the most important poetic representative of Polish postmodernist melancholy is Andrzej Sosnowski. The traditionally experienced existential lack is replaced here by "lethal" philosophies of language - from Benjamin's allegory to Derridean deconstruction - the lack is the "essence" of the language freed from essentiality.

M3  - Article
M3  - Meeting paper
AB  - In situ data of Longtail tuna fishing location and satellite-based oceanographic data of chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a), sea-surface temperature (SST), and salinity were employed to figure out the impacts of oceanographic condition on the pattern of potential fishing zones for Longtail tuna in waters around Madura Island. The relation of those parameters to the dissemination of Longtail tuna was analyzed with a maximum entropy (Maxent). The predictive model performance was estimated using the area under the curve (AUC). The jackknife test was then employed to examine each parameter's model contribution. The results from the Maxent model exhibited a high predictive success of the model with AUC value of 0.932. Maxent prediction showed a high probability occurrence of Longtail tuna occurred in the offshore area of the Java Sea. The results also revealed that the Longtail tuna habitat selection was significantly controlled by the salinity ranges from 32.3 - 32.5 ppt, SST ranges from 29.5-30.5[degree]C, and chl-a ranges from 0.2 - 0.4 mg/m3. Besides, among the set of oceanographic variables utilized (SST and chl-a), salinity exhibited the highest value of the jackknife test. Therefore salinity expressed to be the most significant factor in the geographic dissemination of Longtail tuna in the waters Madura Island.

AB  - Mackerel tuna (Euthynnus sp.) is one of the pelagic fish species that has become the export commodity of Indonesia. This species is a carnivorous marine biota that forms a group with rapid swimming abilities. Mackerel tuna is scattered throughout Indonesian waters, including the waters of the Bali Strait. This study aims to predict Mackerel tuna fishing zone in the Bali Strait by using remotely sensed data. Sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface chlorophyll-a (chl-a) were downloaded from the ocean colour website meanwhile the fishing catches obtained from nusantara fisheries port (pelabuhan perikanan nusantara) Pangembangan, Bali and the fishing lane from marine research and observation agency (balai riset dan observasi laut), Bali. The results showed that the highest of fishing catches occurred in September and October with SST value of 26 - 28 degrees C and chl-a value of 0.4 - 2.6 mg/m(3). Based on the SST and chl-a value, the results revealed the potential fishing zone of Mackerel tuna mostly occurred during south monsoon (April - September). In general, the distribution of Mackerel tuna, based on the overlaid SST and chl- a, showed moderate spatial correlation with actual fishing locations from local fisherman. Integration in situ data and oceanographic condition generated from remotely sensed data could form the basis for fisheries management and information system, such as Mackerel in Bali Strait.

Nahuys van Burgst, Resident of Surakarta, entitled Verzameling van officiele Rapporten, betreffende den Oorlog op Java in de Jarren 1825-1830, as a polemic with H.J.J.L. Ridder de Stuer. His memoirs represent a typical Dutch government worldview based more on colonial interests and power tendencies. The colonial interests made colonial goverment have a tendency and take a certain position from the start against Islam and the cultural and Islamic characterist resistance movements launched by Diponegoro and Kiai Modjo. The descriptive analysis of the memoirs about the Javanese War which is presented chronologically makes it easy for us to reveal how war gures put Islam as the motivation for war, the spirit, the basis for thinking, the strengthening of the support network, the basis for regulation, and the justi cation for starting or ending the war. Meanwhile, the colonial government saw Islam as being used as a foster for the character's socio-vertical mobility ambitions, as an identity, propaganda material, and procedures in oath-taking ceremonies.

AB  - The presence of atmospheric particles in multispectral imageries such as Landsat 8 OLI can reduce the visual acuity of the imageries. The most ideal method to reduce the existence of atmospheric particles in the imagery, as well as to enhance the visual appearance of the imagery, is to employ atmospheric corrections. However, atmospheric corrections are a very complex process. Besides, sometimes the results don't have an impact visually. There are many other methods to enhance imagery radiometrically, either by stretching the pixel value, shifting the histogram, or reducing the presence of clouds. This research aims to develop practical formulations to enhance the spectral value of the Landsat 8 OLI imagery bands, by reducing the presence of aerosol particles using the C/A band. Several regression models were involved in the construction process of these formulations. The accuracy assessment was performed using the Pearson correlation coefficient and RMSE, using the USGS Landsat 8 OLI TOC imagery as a comparison. The results showed that the radiometric imagery enhancement using the C/A band gave satisfactory results. Apart from providing a significant visual sharpness increase, for the exponential model with parameters, the average Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.96, with an RMSE value of 0.04, relative to the USGS Landsat 8 OLI TOC product. For a more practical model, we can omit the parameters in the exponential model. The results that will be obtained are still quite accurate. Furthermore, we can implement this enhancement model directly on digital numbers.

AB  - Burned area extraction from optical imageries often has a major problem, that is the presence of atmospheric particles. A potential alternative for burned area extraction is using SAR imageries, those are relatively free of atmospheric interference. The purpose of this research was to explore change detection capabilities of Sentinel-1 SAR polarimetry for burned area extraction. The imagery used is dual-polarized Sentinel-1 (VV,VH). A number of polarimetric transformation methods are applied for the purpose of change detection. Those are, single cross-polarized log ratio, single co-polarized log ratio, dual polarized combination log ratio, dual polarized multiple log ratio, and dual polarized ratio log ratio. For comparison, the Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR) method was applied to the Sentinel-2 MSI imagery. The Otsu thresholding is then applied to separate the burned area and the unburned area. The results of the research showed that the single cross-polarized log ratio (ln(sigma(VHt1)-V-0/sigma(VHt2)-V-0)) transformation method was the most accurate method. This method has an overall accuracy of 88.7665% (Kappa 0.7567). It is more accurate than Sentinel-2 RBR, which has an overall accuracy of 81.8470% (Kappa 0.6383). Cross validation between Sentinel-1 SAR change detection and Sentinel-2 RBR does not show a significant correlation. The highest correlation coefficient achieved is only 0.25. This shows that burned area extraction between change detection from SAR imageries and RBR from optical imageries has a different mechanism. SAR change detection tends to detect changes in surface roughness, while NIR-based RBR tends to extract changes in leaf chlorophyll conditions.

AB  - Peatland fire has been the most prominent cause of transboundary haze problem in the ASEAN region since 1997/1998. The impacts are not locally but also globally identified. The paper aims to elaborate on how peatland fire occurred and techno-socio approaches for fire control. The study was based on a Focus Group Discussion of relevant stakeholders and literature review conducted using descriptive and content analyses. The study found that peatland fire occurred mostly caused by human activities in land preparation. Efforts on peatland fire control have been conducted by various agencies with various approaches. Technological approaches have been developed for peatland fire control in terms of fire prevention stage on early warning system, early detection system, and fire suppression stage on early suppression as well as of post-fire activities on burned area estimation. On the other hand, social approaches have also been developed and implemented in terms of community empowerment and incentives scheme for zero burning implementation. No doubt, synergy between socio-economic approaches and technological approaches have to be prioritized in peatland fire control in Indonesia with multi/transdisciplinary manners.

AB  - One of the most important poets of postwar Hungarian literature, Janos Pilinszky's (1921-1981) poetry represents the problems of connecting with the Other, the imprints of Second World War trauma and the struggle with God's distance and silence. Although, unlike the case of most of his contemporaries in Eastern bloc Hungary, his poetry has been translated into several languages, he is hardly known in English-speaking countries. The metaphysically accented lyrical worldview and creator-centered aesthetics-which shows parallels with the Christian poetry of Michael Edwards-of this Hungarian poet are difficult to link or to bring into discourse. On the occasion of the most recent publication (Pilinszky 2019) of Pilinszky's non-literary publications which are practically unknown to non-Hungarian scholars, I attempt to outline the major attributes of Pilinszky's poetry and aesthetics in order to highlight-with a mystical approach in mind-the intertwining presence of said lyre and aesthetics in his poem, In memoriam F. M Dosztojevszkij ['In Memoriam F. M. Dostoevsky'].

TI  - Reclaimed Area Land Cover Mapping Using Sentinel-2 Imagery and LiDAR Point Clouds
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the possibility of using fusion Sentinel-2 imageries (2016, ESA) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds for the automation of land cover mapping with a primary focus on detecting and monitoring afforested areas and deriving precise information about the spatial (2D and 3D) characteristics of vegetation for reclaimed areas. The study was carried out for reclaimed areas - two former sulfur mines located in Southeast Poland, namely, Jeziorko, where 216.5 ha of afforested area was reclaimed after borehole exploitation, and Machow, where 871.7 ha of dump area was reclaimed after open cast strip mining. The current land use and land cover (LULC) classes at the Machow and Jeziorko former sulfur mines are derived based on Sentinel-2 image processing, and confirmed the applied type of reclamation for both analysed areas. The following LULC classes showed a significant spatial range: broad-leaved forest, coniferous forest, and transitional woodland shrub. The progress of afforested areas, not only in terms of the occupied area, but also in terms of the growth of trees and shrubs, was confirmed. The results of the study showed differences in vegetation parameters, namely, height and canopy cover. Various stages of vegetation growth were also observed. This indicates an ongoing process of vegetation development, as an effect of the reclamation treatment for these areas.

TI  - A DENDROECOLOGICAL FIRE HISTORY FOR CENTRAL CORSICA/FRANCE
T2  - TREE-RING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are an important factor shaping Mediterranean ecosystems and determine the distribution of different species. Information about past forest fires can be obtained with pyrodendroecology. Here, we present a fire history for three sites in the mountain forest belt on the island of Corsica in the Mediterranean Basin. The dating of scars from cores, stem discs, and wedges from 101 pine trees (Pinus nigra and Pinus pinaster) allowed the reconstruction of six definite fire events between 1800 and 2017. Additionally, we reconstructed the spatial extent of a large fire event at AD 2000 with remote sensing data. The study sites are affected by different types of fires. The even-aged forest structure at two sites is clear evidence of past lethal fires, whereas the old-growth Pinus nigra forest at the third site represents the final stage of succession under current climate conditions. The current distribution of both pine species can at least partly be regarded as a result of varying fire frequency at different sites. Although Pinus pinaster stands dominate in areas with frequent fires and can even replace Pinus nigra in cases of high fire frequency, Pinus nigra dominates in areas with low fire frequencies.

AB  - In the framework of land-use mapping in urban areas, this paper explores the potential of the fusion of remote sensing data with information from transport demand data. The role of transport demand data is discussed and a probabilistic fusion framework is developed to exploit remote sensing and transport data in the discrimination of land use classes and land cover classes in urban and surrounding areas. Within this framework, two methods are proposed, based on pixelwise decision fusion and on the combination with a region-based multiscale Markov random field. The methods are validated on a case study associated with the Italian city of Genoa.

AB  - Monitoring oil stocks provides valuable insights on the balance between production and demand of petroleum products. The identification of oil depots is important for estimating storage capacities and measuring oil stocks. To achieve this purpose, we present an oil tank detector. As oil tanks are generally circular, we use as a first step a circle detection algorithm. However, this approach tends to generate a considerable amount of false detections, as circular shapes are not necessarily tanks. To reduce these false detections, we take advantage of the fact that oil tanks are generally densely grouped together, and filter out isolated detections using a clustering algorithm. The clustering method uses the a contrario framework which gives a way to control the number of false detections per image. The method is illustrated on Sentinel-2 images.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine the spatial and temporal resolutions that can represent land surface characteristics comprised of various landuse using Landsat/AMSR2-based soil moisture data. We estimated the Landsat (30 m×30 m)-based soil moisture values using the soil moistureregression model. Then, the Landsat (30 m×30 m)-based soil moisture (reference values) were resampled to the relatively coarse resolutions from 1 kmto 4 km, respectively. Comparing the reference values to the resampled soil moisture values, we confirmed that uncertainties were increased with thespatial resolutions of 2 km∼4 km indicating that the spatial resolution of 1 km×1 km is required to represent the complicated land surface. Also, theAMSR2 soil moisture values have less uncertainties compared to SMAP data with the temporal resolution of 1∼2 days. Thus, our findings can beuseful for various areas such as agriculture, hydrology, forest, etc.

TI  - Wetland Dynamics Inferred from Spectral Analyses of Hydro-Meteorological Signals and Landsat Derived Vegetation Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic response of coastal wetlands (CWs) to hydro-meteorological signals is a key indicator for understanding climate driven variations in wetland ecosystems. This study explored the response of CW dynamics to hydro-meteorological signals using time series of Landsat-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values at six locations and hydro-meteorological time-series from 1984 to 2015 in Apalachicola Bay, Florida. Spectral analysis revealed more persistence in NDVI values for forested wetlands in the annual frequency domain, compared to scrub and emergent wetlands. This behavior reversed in the decadal frequency domain, where scrub and emergent wetlands had a more persistent NDVI than forested wetlands. The wetland dynamics were found to be driven mostly by the Apalachicola Bay water level and precipitation. Cross-spectral analysis indicated a maximum time-lag of 2.7 months between temperature and NDVI, whereas NDVI lagged water level by a maximum of 2.2 months. The quantification of persistent behavior and subsequent understanding that CW dynamics are mostly driven by water level and precipitation suggests that the severity of droughts, floods, and storm surges will be a driving factor in the future sustainability of CW ecosystems.

AB  - In recent years, the expectations for high throughput satellite (HTS) have diversified based on rapid increase in traffic demands. However, the Ku-band and Ka-band utilized by HTS are growing tighter. It is necessary to utilize the limited frequency ranges efficiently and share resources with other communication systems. The digital beam forming (DBF), which has a high area flexibility for allocating power resources, is being developed to adapt to the diversification of communication applications. However, it remains unclear how multi-spot beam placement is related to throughput in an HTS communication system equipped with DBF. In this study, we attempted to determine how the distances between spot beams in the same frequency band and the distances between adjacent spot beams in different frequency bands are related to overall system throughput and to derive a multi-spot beam arrangement to improve overall system throughput. The main contributions of this study are the clarification of relationships between the positions of multi-spot beams and overall system throughput and the construction of a novel mathematical model to derive multi-spot beam arrangements to enhance overall throughput. The effectiveness of our proposal is evaluated through numerical analysis.

AB  - In this study, a remote analysis of the anthropogenic activity, which plays a fundamental role in the formation of the contemporary landscapes in part of the Pazardzhik-Plovdiv lowland area - the lands of the Belozem (Plovdiv Province) and Opalchenets (Stara Zagora Province) villages - is carried out, as well as of the landscape pattern, determined by the complex interaction of natural and anthropogenic factors. The study area was selected based on the registration of some differences in the character of the land use in the lands of the two villages. Remote sensing contributes for more profound investigation of the spatial pattern and dynamics of anthropogenic landscapes in the study area. Satellite data, as well as landscape metrics analysis of the landscape pattern in the study area are used. A multi-temporal analysis was conducted to study the dynamics of landscapes over different periods. Some differences have been registered in the pattern of agricultural landscapes of the two studied lands, which could be explained by the different type of organization of the agricultural process on the territory of Plovdiv and Stara Zagora provinces. The manifestation of versatile by its character anthropogenic activity is a major factor in the formation of specific types of land use, which depend to a large extent on the socio-cultural and economic features of the environment, which in turn influences the formation of the landscape pattern. This is precisely what necessitates the study of these transformations and interactions and in a temporal aspect.

AB  - Periodic generated, sequence of earthquakes with magnitude 7.5 at a depth of 10 km occurred in Palu Koro fault, Central Sulawesi, and was trigger tsunamis wave in Talise beach reach coastline in few minutes. It causes entire coastline become extremely attacked and moves gravitationally of the ground at a slope as well, known as flow of liquefaction. Reconsolidation of coastline structure in post-liquefaction event in Palu's Talise beach had been heaving due to devastating aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami that hit Sulawesi. Lack and rough terrain are intensively associated with the difficult to assess post-area, so remote sensing can be efficiently and quickly to identify potential post-area occurrence. Satellite multispectral such as Sentinel, and SRTM DEM applied with a new approach to corporate post-event liquefaction in Talise beach, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. In this result, we depict the 3D surface topography of pre and post event to analyse the liquefaction impact. We found the differentiation approach of pre and post event imply the liquefaction in variation of dimensional ratio. Therefore, our hypothesis may be useful to the preliminary research for mitigation and revitalization in post-area.

AB  - Northern peatlands are significant pools of stored carbon. Understanding of seasonal dynamics of peat water table (WT) is the key to improve spatial models of material flows and gas exchange in those landscapes. Since synthetic aperture radar interferometric (InSAR) observables are influenced by soil moisture variations, the objective of this study is to examine the ability of Sentinel-1 long term InSAR coherence magnitude (calculated using a single master image) to characterize seasonal dynamics of peatland WT over 3 years of different climatological conditions. We show how in the open bog the coherence can be preserved more than 6 months and is related to peat WT difference in favourable weather condition. The second degree polynomial regression model can describes the relationship between coherence and WT with Root Mean Squared Error RMSE 0.047 (p < 0.001). These findings suggest long term InSAR coherence has potential to characterize seasonal bog WT fluctuations, especially during dry summers or in intensive drainage affected sites with high discharges.

AB  - This paper proposes a semi-empirical microwave model of methane emissions (CH4) based on the biogeochemical processes from rice paddy. By exploiting the mechanism processes of methane production, oxidation and emission, a combined microwave model is developed to predict methane emissions from rice paddy. Simultaneously, the main influencing emissions factors, which concluded soil, underlying water body, vegetation, climate and management, are analyzed in the present model. During the whole growth season, the multi-polarization backscattering coefficients of rice are measured by the ground-based radar scatterometer (GBRS), and relevant parameters are observed in the rice fields. Moreover, experiments of the emissions samples are conducted on conventional static box, and the results are compared to the semi-empirical microwave model and Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) simulation model, respectively, which shows the good extend performance is developed from experience model into mechanism model based on active microwave remote sensing data.

TI  - Geospatial Contextual Attention Mechanism for Automatic and Fast Airport Detection in SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The automatic extraction of airport runway areas from high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is of great research significance in the military and civilian fields. However, it is still challenging to distinguish the airport from surrounding objects in SAR images. In this article, a new framework is proposed to extract airport runway areas (runways, taxiways, packing lots, and aircrafts) in a fast and automatic manner. The framework is based on the Geospatial Contextual Attention Mechanism (GCAM) for geospatial feature learning and classification, which is employed together with the down-sampling and coordinate mapping modules. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, three large-scale Gaofen-3 SAR images with 1m resolution are utilized in the experiment. According to the results, Mean Pixels Accuracy (MPA) and Mean Intersection Over Union (MIOU) of the GCAM are 0.9850 and 0.9536, respectively, which outperform RefineNet, DeepLabV3+, and MDDA. The training time of GCAM for the dataset is 2.25h, and the average testing time for the five SAR images is only 18.15s. Therefore, GCAM can offer rapid and automatic airport detection from high-resolution SAR images with high accuracy, which can further be employed to mark the airport to greatly improve the detection accuracy of the aircrafts.

AB  - The solar spectrum of 400-2500nm wavelength is mostly used in optical remote sensing satellite for land observation. In this spectrum, the radiation received in the view field of satellite dominated by reflecting solar energy. This work analyzed the radiation transferring model of atmospheric scattering and absorption theoretically and simulated the effects on optical remote sensing of aerosol and water vapor experimentally. The theoretical radiation models of atmosphere scattering and absorption have been analyzed; the influencing processes of atmosphere scattering and absorption for remote sensing imaging chain have been simulated by atmospheric radiation transferring model. This work gives the impact mechanisms of atmospheric scattering and absorbing processes by tracing the radiation in the transferring chain from sun to land-surface and to satellite. Simulation experiments of aerosol absorbing and scattering effects on atmosphere path radiance and scattering transmittance and the effect of water vapor absorption on atmosphere transmittance have been made, including analyzing the effects of aerosol and water vapor in typical wavelengths of land observing satellite with three typical atmosphere models (mid-latitude summer continental model, mid-latitude winter continental model and 1976 US standard model). The results indicate that: 1) atmosphere aerosol scattering mainly affects the visible (VIS) solar spectrum, the effects becoming greater as wavelength being shorter thus caused the most significant influence on deep blue and blue bands, less effect on NIR and nearly no impacts on SWIR bands with wavelength longer than 2200nm. The atmosphere path radiance in SWIR is less than 1% of VIS, and the atmosphere scattering transmittance in SWIR is more than 4 times of VIS as the aerosol optical depth (AOD) increasing from 0.05 to 2. 2) Water vapor absorption mainly affects longer wavelength radiation, i.e. the near infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) spectrum. Unlike aerosol effects, water vapor has more complex function in IR spectrum, there are several strong water vapor absorption peaks and atmosphere windows in NIR and SWIR, and the sensitivity of different absorption peaks are varied with the changing of water vapor content. Five IR bands, 865nm, 940nm, 1240nm, 1380nm and 1860nm, are involved to study the effects of water vapor on atmosphere transmittance. The atmosphere transmittance decreases from 0.97 to 0.2 in 940nm and 1240, and from 0.6 to almost 0 in 1380nm and 1860nm as the water vapor content increasing from 0.05 to 4.2 g/cm(2), and 865nm is almost independent on the varying of water vapor. Image quality assessment experiments are implemented to study the degradation to image quality of optical remote sensing satellite caused by atmosphere absorbing and scattering effects. In assessment experiments, image sharpness is chosen as the quality parameters. Based on the comparisons of different atmospheric compositions correction in wavelengths of blue (490nm), green (560nm), red (665nm), NIR (965nm) and SWIR (1380nm) images of Landsat-8, the results show that aerosol has greater decreasing on image sharpness of blue band than others, and water vapor mainly degrades the image sharpness of NIR and SWIR bands. The result of image quality assessment experiments has verified the theoretical analysis.

AB  - Timely crop classification maps are essential for the agriculture sector to ensure food security and understand the state and trend of crop growth. Though there are several crop monitoring systems in operation, early-season crop classification is still in demand. We developed a robust crop growth estimation technology previously with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery for canola in Canadian Prairies, and we are extending the procedure to enable accurate early-season crop classification. Here we present a dynamic crop classification technique with RADARSAT-2 (RS2) polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) imagery for the classification of canola, corn, soybean and wheat, the four major crop types in Canadian Prairies. The procedure achieved over 90% classification accuracy of the major four crop types in the testing area by the end of July.

TI  - Combining Residual Neural Networks and Feature Pyramid Networks to Estimate Poverty Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable poverty data are critical for regional economic analysis and policy making, especially considering that economic inequality and sustainable development are widespread social concerns. This article proposes a multitask learning model combining deep residual neural networks and feature pyramid networks to estimate poverty level from multiple sources including the night-time light data, Landsat 8 imagery, and spectral index data. We first train the multitask learning model using the multisource data in Chongqing, China and then estimate the representative economic indicators in the study area. The model is evaluated with the Pearson correlation coefficient of the actual and estimated economic indicators. The result shows that the proposed model outperforms other models with the Pearson correlation coefficient up to 0.87 in the annual estimates of economic indicators between 2013 and 2017. As all the data used in this article are publicly available, the proposed model can be used to estimate the economic indicators in other regions as well.

CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of Sentinel-1/2 time-series for monitoring selective logging in temperate forests. Ten stands were selectively logged with 5 to 28% of the existing growing stock volume being extracted. The analysis was focused on backscatter coefficient and surface reflectance changes for dates immediately prior and past the logging period. Monthly information on leaf area index (from terrestrial laser scanning) and vegetation water content (from destructive sampling) was used to support the analysis. The analysis suggested that monitoring selective logging using Sentinel-1/2 imagery is challenging in temperate montane forests due to a range of factors, including logging time and duration, saturation of C-band wavelength, and relatively small changes in canopy cover that cannot be reliably picked up by the optical sensor.

TI  - Burned Area Detection and Mapping: Intercomparison of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Based Algorithms over Tropical Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provides a comparative analysis of two Sentinel-1 and one Sentinel-2 burned area (BA) detection and mapping algorithms over 10 test sites (100 x 100 km) in tropical and sub-tropical Africa. Depending on the site, the burned area was mapped at different time points during the 2015-2016 fire seasons. The algorithms relied on diverse burned area (BA) mapping strategies regarding the data used (i.e., surface reflectance, backscatter coefficient, interferometric coherence) and the detection method. Algorithm performance was compared by evaluating the detected BA agreement with reference fire perimeters independently derived from medium resolution optical imagery (i.e., Landsat 8, Sentinel-2). The commission (CE) and omission errors (OE), as well as the Dice coefficient (DC) for burned pixels, were compared. The mean OE and CE were 33% and 31% for the optical-based Sentinel-2 time-series algorithm and increased to 66% and 36%, respectively, for the radar backscatter coefficient-based algorithm. For the coherence based radar algorithm, OE and CE reached 72% and 57%, respectively. When considering all tiles, the optical-based algorithm provided a significant increase in agreement over the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) based algorithms that might have been boosted by the use of optical datasets when generating the reference fire perimeters. The analysis suggested that optical-based algorithms provide for a significant increase in accuracy over the radar-based algorithms. However, in regions with persistent cloud cover, the radar sensors may provide a complementary data source for wall to wall BA detection.

TI  - Validation of vegetation coverage and NDVI based on UAV remote sensing method and its response to hydrothermal gradient
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - To verify the accuracy of MODIS-NDVI data products in deserts and provide guidance for scientific management of desert grasslands in the context of climate change, we examined the responses of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to hydrothermal gradient in arid desert areas using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing. In Alxa desert region of Inner Mongolia, GreenSeeker handheld spectrometer was used to obtain NDVI (NDVI,) of 100 sampling points. NDVI was extracted by MODIS-NDVI data products (NDVI), and the accuracy of NDVI was verified by NDVIR. FVC of each sampling point was obtained through unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing (FVC), which was used to examine the FVC that was retrieved by the pixel binary model (FVC). In addition, combining meteorological data, we examined the responses of FVC and NDVI to hydrothermal gradient based on UAV remote sensing method. The results showed that MODIS-NDVI data products reflected the real NDVI in Alxa area with an accuracy of 84.2%, but NDVI were 15.7% higher than the actual values. FVC reflected the vegetation coverage of Alxa region with an accuracy of 83.1%, which were 14.8% lower than the real value. Effects of meteorological factors on NDVI was different, depending on the different acquisition methods. NDVI was affected not only by temperature and precipitation, but also by ground temperature, evaporation and the interaction between evaporation and ground temperature. Because of the different degree of atmospheric influence, NDVIM was more affected by ground temperature, evaporation and precipitation than NDVIR, while NDVIR was more affected by temperature than NDVIM. To examine the changes of vegetation coverage across hydrothermal gradient in desert area, we should consider not only precipitation and temperature, but also the interaction between evaporation, ground temperature and meteorological factors. The interaction between temperature and rainfall, evaporation and ground temperature, and between temperature and evaporation had greater impacts on FVCU.

TI  - A Novel Sample Selection Method for Impervious Surface Area Mapping Using JL1-3B Nighttime Light and Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has attracted wide and active interests due to the impact on regional sustainable development. As an important indicator of urbanization, impervious surface area (ISA) should be accurately monitored. In scenario of identifying ISA by supervised classification from satellite images, the training samples are usually labeled manually, which is highly labor-intensive and time-consuming. High-resolution nighttime light image provides a unique footprint of human activities and settlements which are strongly correlated with ISA. In view of this, a novel ISA training sample selection method is proposed by integrating the JL1-3B high-resolution nighttime light imagery and Sentinel-2 time series imagery, and the random forest is applied to classify ISA from Sentinel-2 imagery. The quality of the automatically selected samples was quantitatively validated. There were over three study areas, and the overall classification accuracies were above 97%, showing reliable and robust performance. Compared with conventional methods, the proposed approach achieves satisfactory results in separating bare land from ISA. This study provides a data fusion way which can automatically generate sufficient and high-quality training samples for ISA mapping, and suggests that high-resolution nighttime imagery could demonstrate a promising potential for urban remote sensing.

TI  - Gastric and adrenal metastasis from breast cancer Case report and review of literature
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Rationale: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancies in females. The most common sites of metastasis are bone, lung, liver, and brain. Gastrointestinal and adrenal gland metastasis from breast cancer are rare. Simultaneous metastases are extremely rare. Therefore, it is critically important to choose proper examination and treatment since the rapid diagnosis and primary treatment can significantly affect the survival of patients. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first case of initial dual metastasis. Patient concerns: The patient had a history of left breast cancer, and she underwent left breast-conserving surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy 2 years ago. She was hospitalized in our center with the complaints of a stomach and lower back pain, which started suddenly and was progressively increased for half a month. Diagnosis: Computed tomography, gastroscopy, and immunohistochemical staining, especially GATA3 and mammaglobin, confirmed that there was simultaneous gastric and adrenal metastases. Interventions: She was eligible for the IMpassion131 clinical trials, a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial under treatment with atezolizumab/palcebo plus paclitaxel as adjuvant-therapy. Outcomes: She was still undergoing the therapy and waiting for the further evaluation. Lessons: In order to better understand metastatic pathways of breast carcinoma, publications of individual patient cases diagnosed with rare metastatic sites should be encouraged, especially for the simultaneous rare metastatic sites. This might improve our understanding of metastatic behavior of breast cancer and promote further clinical research.

TI  - Quantifying the Effect of Registration Error on Spatio-Temporal Fusion
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is challenging to acquire satellite sensor data with both fine spatial and fine temporal resolution, especially for monitoring at global scales. Among the widely used global monitoring satellite sensors, Landsat data have a coarse temporal resolution, but fine spatial resolution, while moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have fine temporal resolution, but coarse spatial resolution. One solution to this problem is to blend the two types of data using spatio-temporal fusion, creating images with both fine temporal and fine spatial resolution. However, reliable geometric registration of images acquired by different sensors is a prerequisite of spatio-temporal fusion. Due to the potentially large differences between the spatial resolutions of the images to be fused, the geometric registration process always contains some degree of uncertainty. This article analyzes quantitatively the influence of geometric registration error on spatio-temporal fusion. The relationship between registration error and the accuracy of fusion was investigated under the influence of different temporal distances between images, different spatial patterns within the images and using different methods (i.e., spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), and Fit-FC; two typical spatio-temporal fusion methods). The results show that registration error has a significant impact on the accuracy of spatio-temporal fusion; as the registration error increased, the accuracy decreased monotonically. The effect of registration error in a heterogeneous region was greater than that in a homogeneous region. Moreover, the accuracy of fusion was not dependent on the temporal distance between images to be fused, but rather on their statistical correlation. Finally, the Fit-FC method was found to be more accurate than the STARFM method, under all registration error scenarios.

TI  - An Object-Based Approach for Mapping Crop Coverage Using Multiscale Weighted and Machine Learning Methods
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of crop distribution on Earth's surface aids in predicting grain production. Pattern classification along with remote sensing imagery can facilitate traditional manual field measurement techniques using machine learning. With the rapid increase in satellite sensor resolution, the object-based classification paradigm has increasingly been applied. However, scale parameter selection is always a difficult part of the object-based classification. Based on ensemble learning, this study proposes a classification method using the multiscale object-based weighted method which includes manual digitizing of crop distribution in the southern region of Jishan County, Shanxi Province, China, applying Gaofen-2 (GF-2) images. This method initially uses estimations of the scale parameter (ESP) tool to select "good" scales, defined here as "preferred" scales, after which feature subsets are screened by each preferred scale as the input of multiple classifiers and classifies. Finally, all classification results are then fused. Our research results indicate that: 1) Feature importance values are sorted differently at different preferred scales; 2) accuracy differences become clear when different preferred scales are combined with different classifiers, and determining the "best" single appropriate scale is generally difficult; 3) accuracy of the multiscale weighted classification method is higher compared to the single preferred scale approach. Furthermore, ensemble learning can be achieved using this method on multiple scales and on multiple classifiers. With this method, procedures that necessitate the selection of segmentation scales and the selection and optimization of classifiers can be skipped altogether.

AB  - Long-term Landsat time series imagery provides valuable opportunities for monitoring land surface changes. However, missing observations that result from clouds, cloud shadows, and scan line corrector failure makes Landsat data record neither a continuous nor a consistent time series. In this study, we present an approach to produce a gap-free Landsat time series for the Taita Hills in southeastern Kenya. We used simulated gaps in nearly cloud-free images to assess the performance of the approach while considering two factors: the size of the gaps and effect of the wet or dry seasons. It turned out that filling image with the largest area of simulated gaps, which were equivalent to 52% of the test image area, yielded almost the same root mean square error, relative RMSE and the coefficient of determination as the smallest gaps equivalent to 25%. Furthermore, gap-free images in both dry and wet seasons could be filled without visual artifacts, and dry season images were better predicted. Finally, the time series images produced for the study area showed consistent temporal variation across land use/land cover types.

TI  - The Phenomenon of Israeli-Judah Prophecy and Elements of Ancient "Philosophical Prophetism" in the "Axial Epoch"
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article makes an attempt to reveal a number of the most significant features of the Israeli-Judah prophecy (VIII-VI cent. BCE), which in effect turned out to be the key worldview phenomenon of the first half of the "axial epoch" in the history of mankind, when "man of such a type appeared, which has survived to this day" (K. Jaspers). The mission of the Hebrew prophet is much broader than a simple prediction of the future, for his prophecies touch upon the whole basic spectrum of man's spiritual and material life: questions of life and death, theology and worship, ethical norms, problems of domestic and world politics, social and economic antagonisms, legal conflicts, family relationships, he develops elements of eschatology, etc. It is possible that the phenomenon of prophecy in Ancient Israel and Judah correlates with the processes associated with the appearance of a new type of state in the historical arena - the empire. Comparison with the types of prophecy, common in Ancient Greece, demonstrates the difference in the areas that are subject to the prophetic wisdom of Greece and Israel. Only in the image of Socrates, created by Plato, we see the traces of prophetic and mediumship chosenness, which gives him wisdom precisely in the spiritual realm of human existence. However, despite the strong influence that Plato's texts had on the evolution of European philosophy and culture, they did not become the "style" of Western thought. Starting with Aristotle, it clearly distinguishes the discourses of "mythologists" and "theologians" from the "first philosophy".

AB  - The color deviation, which refers to the different between the obtained image and the image under the standard light, is from the light source and reflection characteristic of the object. For satellite remote sensing, the length of the radiation transmission path is different for imaging of different latitudes, especially considering the effects of the atmosphere. Therefore, imaging for high latitude in the winter maybe brings some color deviation into the data. There have some color deviation detection methods for digital camera photo, but they are not fit for the remote sensing data, because of the large image range. In the work, a color deviation detection method for the satellite remote sensing image is developed. And the method is validated using the Landsat 8 images obtained in the winter and summer respectively.

AB  - KOMPSAT-5 is an X-band satellite that has a great potential for high-resolution soil moisture retrieval over agricultural regions. In the present paper, comparison between the soil moisture estimations from the widely used Sentinel-1 (C-band) and KOMPSAT-5 (X-band) is conducted for a dryland wheat field site located in Victoria State of Australia. This study uses a semi-empirical vegetation scattering model to invert radar signal and retrieve soil moisture based on KOMPSAT-5 and Sentinel-1 images and the retrieval model is calibrated by field measurements. In this model, normalized difference water index (NDWI) is applied for the parameterization of vegetation water content and the estimation of volume scattering from vegetation canopy. The results demonstrated that the accuracy of soil moisture retrieved from both satellite instruments was consistent with the field measurements, with the root mean square error (RMSE) reached 0.016 cm(3)/cm(3) at X-band and 0.015 cm(3)/cm(3) at C-band, and the correlation coefficients (R) were 0.726 and 0.517, respectively. In addition, the validating results showed that the X-band provided slightly consistent accurate soil moisture retrieval in comparison with the C-band, with the RMSE of 0.017 cm(3)/cm(3). Consequently, this study indicated the prospect and applicability of estimating soil moisture retrieved from both KOMPSAT-5 and Sentinel-1 remote sensing data and could also provide support and reference for other crop yield estimation effectively.

TI  - Detection of Precipitation Cloud over the Tibet Based on the Improved U-Net
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at the problem of radar base and ground observation stations on the Tibet is sparsely distributed and cannot achieve large-scale precipitation monitoring. UNet, an advanced machine learning (ML) method, is used to develop a robust and rapid algorithm for precipitating cloud detection based on the new-generation geostationary satellite of FengYun-4A (FY-4A). First, in this algorithm, the real-time multi-band infrared brightness temperature from FY-4A combined with the data of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) has been used as predictor variables for our model. Second, the efficiency of the feature was improved by changing the traditional convolution layer serial connection method of U-Net to residual mapping. Then, in order to solve the problem of the network that would produce semantic differences when directly concentrated with low-level and high-level features, we use dense skip pathways to reuse feature maps of different layers as inputs for concatenate neural networks feature layers from different depths. Finally, according to the characteristics of precipitation clouds, the pooling layer of U-Net was replaced by a convolution operation to realize the detection of small precipitation clouds. It was experimentally concluded that the Pixel Accuracy (PA) and Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) of the improved U-Net on the test set could reach 0.916 and 0.928, the detection of precipitation clouds over Tibet were well actualized.

TI  - Changes in China's lakes: climate and human impacts
T2  - NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes have played a critical role in providing water and ecosystem services for people and other organisms in China for millennia. However, accelerating climate change and economic boom have resulted in unprecedented changes in these valuable lakes. Using Landsat images covering the entity of the country, we explored the changes in China's lakes and the associated driving forces over the last 30 years (i.e. mid-1980s to 2015). We discovered that China's lakes have changed with divergent regional trends: in the sparsely populated Tibetan Plateau, lakes are abundant and the lake area has increased dramatically from 38 596 to 46 831 km(2) (i.e. increased by 8235 km(2), or 21.3%), whereas, in the densely populated northern and eastern regions, lakes are relatively scarce and the lake area has decreased from 36 659 to 33 657 km(2) (i.e. decreased by 3002 km(2), or 8.2%). In particular, severe lake decreases occurred in the Mongolia-Xinjiang Plateau and the Eastern Plain (-2151 km(2)). Statistical analyses indicated that climate was the most important factor controlling lake changes in the Tibetan Plateau, the Yun-Gui Plateau and the Northeast Plain. However, the strength of climatic control on lake changes was low in the Eastern Plain and the Mongolia-Xinjiang Plateau, where human activities, e.g. impoldering, irrigation and mining, have caused serious impacts on lakes. Further lake changes will exacerbate regional imbalances between lake resources and population distribution, and thus may increase the risk of water-resource crises in China.

AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) is a critical input in many climate and ecological models. The targeted accuracy of FAPAR products is 10% or 0.05 for many applications. However, most current FAPAR products do not meet such requirements, and further improvements are still needed. In this study, a data fusion scheme based on the multiple resolution tree (MRT) approach is developed to integrate multiple satellite FAPAR estimates at site and regional scales. The fusion scheme removed the bias in FAPAR estimates and resulted in a 15% increase in the R-2 and 3% reduction in the root mean square error (RMSE) compared with the average of individual FAPAR estimates. The regional scale fusion filled in the missing values, and provided spatially consistent FAPAR distributions at different resolutions.

AB  - Algorithms of amplitude change detection and texture extraction are applied to consistent satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series collected by the Italian Space Agency (ASI)'s COSMO-SkyMed constellation over the modern town of Shahat (Libya) and the archaeological site of Apamea (Syria). The high spatial resolution and 16-day revisit time of the COSMO-SkyMed Background Mission allowed for an accurate temporal logging of new constructions due to urban sprawl in Shahat, thus complementing assessments based on multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery. Bespoke Enhanced Spotlight acquisition campaigns led to mapping of looting features in Apamea with as much fine detail as very high resolution optical data.

AB  - The use of satellite images is a modern strategy for the evaluation and prediction of various weather scenarios. In addition, this is key tool for the development of environmental sciences. Since the end of the last decade, Chile has been suffering from a megadrought associated with climate change. In this context, this study proposes to evaluate the role of land use change in the Middle Maule River sub-basin, located in the Maule Region, Chile. This is an important sector characterized by a significant agricultural and hydroelectric contribution. To do so, this study performs a supervised classification of land cover through the usage of QGIS software and Landsat images for the years 1999 and 2019. The results show the growth of areas without vegetation due to a great drought facing the Central Zone of the country. Additionally, there is a decrease in available bodies of water. This article leaves open future research on the impact of the main economic activities of the region.

AB  - An algorithm for reconstruction of the Earth's surface reflection coefficients from MODIS images is considered. The atmospheric correction of the data is carried out taking into account side illumination, additional light exposure of the Earth's surface to reflected radiation, influence of the inhomogeneous Earth's surface, and radiation polarization was carried out. To accelerate obtaining of results, it is suggested to use a number of approximation formulas and criteria. A comparison with the results of execution of the MOD09 algorithm for three regions of the Earth's surface (in Tomsk, Moscow, and Irkutsk Regions) demonstrated that in the first, third, and fourth MODIS channels, the average values of the data obtained by the proposed algorithm were closer to the reference ones than the results obtained by the MOD09 NASA algorithm; in the second MODIS channel, the difference reached an order of magnitude. In the eighth MODIS channel, one algorithm was preferable to another in some situations, whereas in other situations, wise versa.

TI  - Land surface temperature relation with normalized satellite indices for the estimation of spatio-temporal trends in temperature among various land use land cover classes of an arid Potohar region using Landsat data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In terrestrial landscape architecture, land surface temperature (LST) is a key estimator of local climate, vegetation growth, and urban transition. It also represents the environmental factors that influence the land cover patterns using temperature variation over land use land cover (LULC) classes. In the present study, various geospatial techniques have been implemented to analyze the spatio-temporal trends in temperature among different LULC of an arid Potohar region of Pakistan using Landsat 7 (ETM+) and 8 (OLI & TIRS) and the relationship between different normalized satellite indices and LST. Results of the seasonal fluctuation in winter showed temperature range of 0-57, 0-50, 04-31 and 7-39 degrees C for the year 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, respectively, while the summer exhibited the temperature range of 24-48, 27- 57, 22-48, and 12-41 degrees C for the year 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, respectively. The analysis established a direct correlation between LST and normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference water index, and an indirect correlation among LST and normalized difference soil index, normalized difference built-up index and built-up index. The findings are critically important for planning and development division for sustainable use of land resources for urbanization extension projects. Future research will highlight the change in the area occupied by different land featured classes and their impacts on LST over a specified period.

AB  - Domain adaptation for semantic segmentation has recently been actively studied to increase the generalization capabilities of deep learning models. The vast majority of the domain adaptation methods tackle single-source case, where the model trained on a single source domain is adapted to a target domain. However, these methods have limited practical real world applications, since usually one has multiple source domains with different data distributions. In this work, we deal with the multi-source domain adaptation problem. Our method, namely StandardGAN, standardizes each source and target domains so that all the data have similar data distributions. We then use the standardized source domains to train a classifier and segment the standardized target domain. We conduct extensive experiments on two remote sensing data sets, in which the first one consists of multiple cities from a single country, and the other one contains multiple cities from different countries. Our experimental results show that the standardized data generated by StandardGAN allow the classifiers to generate significantly better segmentation.

AB  - Although convolutional neural networks have been proven to be an effective tool to generate high quality maps from remote sensing images, their performance significantly deteriorates when there exists a large domain shift between training and test data. To address this issue, we propose a new data augmentation approach that transfers the style of test data to training data using generative adversarial networks. Our semantic segmentation framework consists in first training a U-net from the real training data and then fine-tuning it on the test stylized fake training data generated by the proposed approach. Our experimental results prove that our framework outperforms the existing domain adaptation methods.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal zones in small oceanic islands as the Archipelago of the Azores (Portugal) are very sensitive territories severely threatened by climate change, natural disasters, biological invasions, infrastructure and tourism development, and also agriculture intensification. Land-cover/land-use changes are one of the most relevant indicators for monitoring and assessing coastal spatial planning and management policies in insular territories. This paper describes the application of a low-cost Rao's Q diversity index-based remote sensing tool able to provide a systematic and accurate coastal land-cover/land-use monitoring system in small oceanic islands, using free and open access Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite data and Terceira island (Archipelago of the Azores, Portugal) as the case-study area. Results indicate that about 7% (similar to 300 hectares) of Terceira Island's coastal zone (similar to 4290 hectares) have changed their land-cover/land-use between March 2017 and December 2018 (21 months). Agricultural areas (4.1%), urban areas (2.1%) and bare soil areas (0.6%) are the categories showing more relevant changes.

T2  - KNJIZEVNA SMOTRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the Croatian translation of the novel Debout-paye by the Ivorian writer Gauz with special reference to the translation of implicit ideological messages. In the novel modern French society is presented from the prism of an African immigrant in a simple, yet quite layered language. For Gauz and his heroes, rethinking and interpreting history is a way to better understand the moment in which they live, and there is no doubt that in a given case the key moment is colonization as a product of capitalism and consumerist worldview. The boldness of Gauz's linguistic procedure is mostly reflected in ideologically colored vocabulary, morphological inventiveness, phonetic finesse, and an almost poetic use of homonymy and dramatic expression. Taking into account all these aspects, our analysis shows that the Croatian translation in most cases successfully met these requirements, thus contributing to the translation of Debout-paye deserving the status of a literary event in Croatia, just as in France. Thanks, among other things, to a similar historical and ideological experience, a significant number of conceptual associations has been successfully transferred into Croatian without excessive insistence on foreign terms or unnecessary concessions to the audience's taste such as ethnocentrism or localization.

AB  - The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) recommends AES algorithm as a cryptographic algorithm to maintain confidentiality and data security between spacecraft and ground systems. In implementation, there are several AES algorithm operating modes including Cipher-Block Chaining (CBC), Electronic Codebook (EBC), Cipher Feedback (CFB), Output Feedback (OFB), and counter mode (CTR). One of the operating modes of AES algorithm recommended by CCSDS is CTR because it has advantages in terms of efficiency of implementation and offers a high level of data security. LAPAN-A4 as the next generation of LAPAN satellites also uses CCSDS standard in terms of data exchange between satellites and ground stations including telemetry and telecommand (TTC) data and satellite payload data. In order to protect LAPAN-A4 satellite data, especially TTC data, in this paper AES algorithm was implemented in CTR operating mode on the FPGA which will then be implemented on LAPAN-A4 satellite onboard data handling (OBDH) as one of LAPAN-A4 satellite data security systems. To overcome the limited resource of FPGA, optimization is also done using basic iterative AES hardware reused method, which is to reuse hardware that has been designed n times for same operation for AES algorithm. From the results of implementation and optimization, efficiency of logic gates used is increasing almost a quarter less than the previous research.

AB  - Justification. The Terror Management Theory (TMT) posits that Mortality Salience (MS) creates an anxiety state that people deal with through a Worldview Defence (WD) and the adherence to Identity Motives (IM). Objective. To analyse the effects of MS in the WD and IM of Catholics and Atheists from Lima-Peru. Method. A quasi - experimental design was conducted, 2 x 2 [Condition: Experimental versus Control X Belief Group: Catholics (n = 39) versus Atheists (n = 32)]. Participants in the experimental condition were exposed to MS, whereas those in the control condition were not; after which both groups answered the WD and IM questionaries. Results. No significant differences were found in WD and IM between conditions, nor due to the interaction between condition and belief group. However, an analysis of the differences between belief groups indicates that Atheists show higher WD and Catholics, higher levels in the IM of Belonging and Continuity. Discussion. The findings about the MS effects on the dependent variables are consistent with previous results in non-anglo-saxon contexts. Additionally, the differences between belief groups are discussed from an Intergroup Relations framework in the Peruvian context.

AB  - The paper presents a novel method for the classification of remote sensing data. The proposed approach comprises two main steps: 1) extractor multi-layer perceptron (EMLP) is used for feature extraction of the remote sensing data; 2) the data resulted from the EMLP are classified using support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The contribution of this work is mainly in the creation of the EMLP method based on the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) method, which has the role of creating a dataset more representative of the classes from the original dataset. To better situate and evaluate our proposed approach, we applied our proposed technique to three datasets, namely, Statlog Landsat satellite, urban land cover and Landsat TM Oran. Several measures were used, for example, classification rate, classification error, precision, recall and F-measure. The experimental results show that the proposed approach (EMLP-SVM) is more efficient and powerful than the basic methods (MLP and SVM) and the existing state-of-the-art classification methods.

TI  - Investigation of the distribution of anticoagulant rodenticide residues in red fox <i>(Vulpes vulpes)</i> livers to ensure optimum sampling protocol
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY AND ECOTOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The lobular distribution of 9 different anticoagulant rodenticide (AR) residues in the liver of a sentinel predator/scavenger i.e. the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) was determined following multi-residue analysis using Ultra (High) Performance Liquid Chromatography tandem Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The aim of the study was to address concerns that if distribution of AR residues in the liver was significantly heterogeneous, analysis of random sub-samples or finite remnants of liver could result in false negatives or lead to incorrect toxicological diagnoses. Intact livers excised from animals shot as part of routine legal pest control activities in Scotland during 2018 and 2019 were sub-sectioned and the lobular concentration of AR residues was investigated. Analysis of individual lobes from 10 different fox livers revealed that AR residues initially detected in a randomly selected small portion of liver tissue were present throughout the liver. Also, in caseswhere AR residues were not found in the initial randomly selected portion, they were not found in the subsequent more detailed examination. The limit of quantitation was 3 mu g kg(-1) and AR residue concentrations ranged from 3 to 885 mu g kg(-1). Statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the eight and six out of ten livers that tested positive for bromadiolone and brodifacoum, respectively. No statistical evidence was found of differences in mean residue levels of bromadiolone throughout the liver i.e. within and between liver lobes. However, brodifacoum showed a statistically significant difference (p <.001) in mean residue concentration between the lobes but there was no statistical evidence of mean differences within the lobes.

AB  - Photonic lanterns are being evaluated as a component of a scalable photon counting real-time optical ground receiver for space-to-ground photon-starved communication applications. The function of the lantern as a component of a receiver is to efficiently couple and deliver light from the atmospherically distorted focal spot formed behind a telescope to multiple small-core fiber-coupled single-element super-conducting nanowire detectors. This architecture solution is being compared to a multimode fiber coupled to a multi-element detector array. This paper presents a set of measurements that begins this comparison. This first set of measurements are a comparison of the throughput coupling loss at emulated atmospheric conditions for the case of a 60 cm diameter telescope receiving light from a low earth orbit satellite. The atmospheric conditions are numerically simulated at a range of turbulence levels using a beam propagation method and are physically emulated with a spatial light modulator. The results show that for the same number of output legs as the single-mode fiber lantern, the few-mode fiber lantern increases the power throughput up to 3.92 dB at the worst emulated atmospheric conditions tested of D/r(0)=8.6. Furthermore, the coupling loss of the few-mode fiber lantern approaches the capability of a 30 micron graded index multimode fiber chosen for coupling to a 16 element detector array.

AB  - For hundreds and thousands years, under the extremely difficult conditions of regular wars, raids of foreign invaders, political and natural cataclysms, the self-identification of the Armenian people has been developed only through the national culture, particularly in architecture. There is no exaggeration to put architecture at the first place among other factors of self-identification - not only because it is a synthesis of various arts and sciences, but also because of the close connection between architecture and natural and climatic peculiarities of the country, the national mentality, art ideas of the people of Armenia, and even the political and economical situation in the country. The loyalty to the national sources led to the awareness of the national identity, to the desire to possess and keep a specific worldview, and - thanks to that - to stay in centuries.

TI  - Patient-reported outcomes and objective assessments with arm measurement and bioimpedance analysis for lymphedema among breast cancer survivors
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Lymphedema (LE) decreases the quality of life of breast cancer patients. Objective quantification of PRO may improve the discordance between patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and objective assessments of LE by establishing a standard follow-up for LE. This study determined the prevalence of subjective and objective LE and evaluated the correlation between objective assessment and PRO of LE in primary breast cancer patients undergoing breast and axilla surgery. Methods Breast cancer patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SN) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) more than 1 year after surgery were enrolled. We prospectively evaluated LE using the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) and two objective assessments (arm circumference and bioimpedance) and analyzed their correlations. Results Between November 2018 and January 2019, 631 patients (SN; n = 415, ALND; n = 216) were enrolled. The median age, body mass index, and duration from surgery was 56 years, 21.9 kg/m(2), and 3.8 years, respectively. The prevalences of subjective and objective LE were 4.1% and 1.4% in the SN group and 51.8% and 24.1% in the ALND group, respectively. The objective assessments were weakly positively correlated with PRO-CTCAE. Arm circumference measurement correlated better than bioimpedance overall and was most strongly correlated with "frequency" (r = 0.485, p < 0.01). Conclusions LE occurred in few SN patients. The prevalence of subjective LE was higher than that of objective LE. Arm circumference measurements better reflected PRO than did bioimpedance. These results underscore the limitation of LE detection by subjective or objective methods alone.

TI  - Using the digital elevation model (DEM) and coastlines for satellite monitoring of small reservoir filling
T2  - COGENT ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing of near real-time reservoir filling has important implications for the monitoring of territorial hydrological resources. These tasks are particularly relevant for reservoirs whose ground hydrological characteristics are not accessible. The monitoring of reservoir filling demands bathymetric data or satellite altimetry. However, bathymetry and satellite altimetry data, which are essential for estimating water storage variations, are only available for a limited number of reservoirs. Another possibility is to combine satellite monitoring of the water mirror with data from the Digital Terrain Model (DEM). In this research, we suggest using global DEM to estimate the slope of a reference alluvial inflow cone entering a reservoir, such as a riverbed. Satellite monitoring of the water mirror creates a set of coastlines at different reservoir fills. The spatial location of coastlines on a reference alluvial cone with a known slope allows altimetric linking of water mirrors. The resulting set of altimetrically referred water mirrors gives the possibility to reconstruct the reservoir 3D bed characteristics. The 3D model of the reservoir bed is constructed as a set of layers. Each layer is a truncated pyramid. Pyramid bases are the neighboring altimetric reference water mirrors. The Kapshagay reservoir (Northwest China) on the River Tekes which is the main tributary of the cross-border (Kazakhstan-China) River Ili was considered as an example. Landsat-5,7,8 (resolution 30 m) data for the period 2007-2018 were used to monitor the water mirror area of the Kapshagay reservoir, which varies from 22 to 59 km(2). Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was used as DEM. The nine-layer 3D model of the reservoir bed was created. The operation volume of the reservoir is estimated at 1,37 +/- 0,08 km(3), which is close to the official 1,4 km(3). The empirical equation of the relationship between the mirror area and the water storage in the operating part of the reservoir, received as a result of 3D model calculations, is the basis for operational hydrological monitoring of objects that do not have access to ground data.

TI  - The data deficit for asthma emergency presentations might surprise you: how RAHDaR addresses the data chasm
T2  - RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: National and state-based minimum data sets remain inadequate in providing a complete representation of emergency presentations, especially among paediatric asthma presentations. Thus, the aim of the study was to identify if a deficit exists in current emergency paediatric asthma hospital presentation datasets and how this may inform an understanding of childhood asthma in VictoriaMethods: This retrospective cross-sectional study examined emergency hospital presentation data between 1 February 2017 and 31 January 2019. All paediatric (0-14 years) emergency asthma presentation data were collected from nine hospitals in south- western Victoria, Australia, using the Rural Acute Hospital Data Register (RAHDaR), which gathers both Victorian Emergency Minimum Dataset (VEMD) data from larger government hospitals, and non-VEMD data from smaller, more rural institutions.Results: Of the 854 emergency presentations identified for children with asthma aged 0-14 years, 540 (63.2%) were managed initially at larger government-reporting hospitals. A total of 314 (36.8%) emergency presentations were initially managed at emergency facilities, such as urgent care centres. Overall, it was found that a total 278 (32.5%) of all emergency presentations did not appear in current government datasets.Conclusion: The RAHDaR database, a complete register of data, captures all emergency presentations in south-western Victoria and highlights as much as a 33% deficit in the data currently available to inform asthma resource initiatives including policy development, funding allocation, prevention and management initiatives in Victoria. More accurate data from sources such as RAHDaR are essential to fill the now-evident data chasm.

AB  - Sakurajima volcano is one of the most active volcanoes in Japan and caused the most powerful eruption in Japan in the last century (1914). Volcanic eruptions are often preceded by ground deformations. The activity of Sakurajima volcano is monitored through interferometric analysis of SAR data, ALOS Palsar-2 and Sentinel-1, to obtain caldera displacements over the observed period, from 2015 to 2019 and to investigate deformations correlated with inflation and deflation cycles of magma plumbing system, eruptions and diking. Time series are calibrated and validated through GEONET stations of the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan and the global navigation satellite System (GNSS) stations of the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre. SAR and GPS information are used to identify the most dramatic events affecting the active Sakurajima area since 2015, specifically a dyke intrusion and the ongoing volcanic activity, characterized by several eruptive episodes.

T2  - COGENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, the land use and land cover change and its impacts are revealing on different natural resource and man-made systems. This study attempted to examine the land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics on this using multi-spectral satellite imageries in Geographical Information System (GIS) in the Kesem sub-basin of the Awash River Basin, Ethiopia. It also attempted to assess the community perceptions on this using field observation. Three LULC maps were produced by analyzing remotely sensed images of Landsat satellite imageries within three periods of time from 1986 to 2013. Supervised image classification was used to map LULC classes and explain the drivers, and causes were linked to the changes. The result from LULC maps of 2013 showed nine major land use and land cover types. From 1986 to 2000, there were, among others, a dramatic expansion of agricultural land, massive settlement, and widespread eucalyptus plantation, all of which contributed to a dramatic decrement of shrub land and acacia in the sub-basin. The major driving forces for these changes were population density and over-use of land. The major consequences are the degradation of biodiversity, and loss of natural resources. The significant need of new and sweeping land use policy whose key tenets involve conservation and rehabilitation of land resources and appropriate land use planning is offered to policymakers.

M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperatures in the world's oceans are projected to warm by 0.4-1.4 degrees C by mid twenty-first century causing many tropical and sub-tropical harmful dinoflagellate genera like Gambierdiscus, Fukuyoa and Ostreopsis (benthic harmful algal bloom species, BHABs) to exhibit higher growth rates over much of their current geographic range, resulting in higher population densities. The primary exception to this trend will be in the tropics where temperatures exceed species-specific upper thermal tolerances (30-31 degrees C) beyond which growth slows significantly. As surface waters warm, migration to deeper habitats is expected to provide refuge. Range extensions of several degrees of latitude also are anticipated, but only where species-specific habitat requirements can be met (e.g., temperature, suitable substrate, low turbulence, light, salinity, pH). The current understanding of habitat requirements that determine species distributions are reviewed to provide fuller understanding of how individual species will respond to climate change from the present to 2055 while addressing the paucity of information on environmental factors controlling small-scale distribution in localized habitats. Based on the available information, we hypothesized how complex environmental interactions can influence abundance and potential range extensions of BHAB species in different biogeographic regions and identify sentinel sites appropriate for long-term monitoring programs to detect range extensions and reduce human health risks.

T2  - MODERN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a high grade primary cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma and is among the most aggressive cutaneous malignancies. The rising incidence of MCC, together with its often rapidly aggressive course, underscore a critical need to recognize the histopathologic and the immunohistochemical features that inform its accurate diagnosis. In the current review, we summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the accurate diagnosis of MCC and the exclusion of other entities in the differential diagnosis. We provide a comprehensive review of genomic studies that identified the molecular-genetic drivers of MCC as well as a summary of studies identifying prognostic biomarkers that can facilitate risk stratification. Importantly, Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) appears to be causative in most cases of MCC and represents both a diagnostic and prognostic marker. Finally, as staging of MCC has undergone critical refinements with the introduction of the 8th Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system, we provide an update on MCC staging. In particular, the prognostic significance of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in MCC necessitates a systematic approach to its evaluation and diagnosis to ensure accurate and consistent risk stratification for patients, and we therefore provide a comprehensive overview of SLN evaluation in MCC. Finally, the intimate relationship between MCC and the integrity of the host immune system has led to paradigm-shifting therapeutic advances with the successful application of immune checkpoint blockade to treat patients with advanced disease, and we therefore summarize those studies and the correlative studies in which predictive biomarkers have been identified.

T2  - COGENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) change detection based on remote sensing data is an important source of information for various decision support systems. Information derived from land use and land cover change detection is important to land conservation, sustainable development, and management of water resources. This purpose of this study is therefore concerned with identifying the change in land use and land cover detection of the Tana basin. To identify land cover changes detection; remote sensing data, satellite imagery and image processing techniques had done within three dates of 1986, 2002 and 2018 using Land sat TM 30 m resolution images. ENVI and Arc GIS soft wares had used to identify the changes. The classification had done using six land cover (water body, bushland, grassland, forestland, cultivated, and residential land) class. Preprocessing and classification of the images had analyzed carefully and accuracy assessment was tested separately using the kappa coefficient. The results showed that overall accuracy in the basin was 84.21%, 83.32% and 91.40% and kappa coefficient of 79.02%, 83.32%, 89.66% for the years 1986, 2002 and 2018 respectively. This study indicated that in the last 32 years period, agricultural land and residential areas had significantly increased by 15.61% and 8.05% respectively in the basin. Therefore, proper land management practices, integrated watershed management, and active participation of the local community should be advance to protect undesirable LULC change in the basin.

TI  - Multi-Scale Bushfire Detection From Multi-Modal Streams of Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bushfire is a destructive force that would change the course of a country and even the Earth. They are causing casualties and affect the quality of life of millions of people. Governments are calling for remote sensing methods to monitor and detect active bushfires around-the-clock. To fulfill this call, we develop a remote sensing framework on top of imagery satellite streams to monitor and detect bushfire timely before beyond control. However, detecting bushfires from satellite images needs to take into account several aspects including spatial pattern of fire-positive pixels, temporal dependencies, spectral correlation between channels, and adversarial effects. In this article, we propose a multi-scale deep neural network model that combines both satellite images and weather data for detecting and locating bushfires at both image and pixel level. We illustrate that the weather information with careful spatio-temporal alignment can be utilised to augment imagery data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed model is better than the baselines with 93.4% accuracy and detects bushfires 1.2 times faster. It is also robust to the effects of cloud and night-time.

AB  - On 12 June 2018, the Tirisha village in Nubra valley, Ladakh experienced a flash flood from a cloudburst that occurred over the mountain ridge. This event was captured in a Sentinel 2B satellite image at the time of its occurrence. The image also provided unique visual evidence of the constrained area of a cloudburst for the first time. Field survey of impact area at the Tirisha village was carried out on 13 June 2018. It was followed by assessment of the impact at the place of occurrence and further downstream using satellite data taken on, before and subsequent days. Satellite data show small area where cloudburst impact (< 1km(2)) from a cumulonimbus (Cb) cell of similar to 2.97 km(2) of cloud top area. Rest of the flood catchment remained cloud-free during the event and floodwater in the stream is clearly visible in the imagery. The flash flood entered the Tirisha village situated at the Nubra valley foothills, which destroyed a stretch of 100 m road. Previous studies have suggested inherent atmospheric instability over the arid Ladakh region with an extremely high-temperature lapse rate of >9.8 K/km during 40-70 days during summer months. The extremely constrained nature of this event highlights the challenges involved in monitoring, forecasting and managing such events in the Himalayan region.

AB  - The ERATOSTHENES Centre of Excellence for Earth Surveillance and Space-Based Monitoring of the Environment (ECoE) will provide cutting-edge Earth Observation (EO) research in Cyprus, the Eastern Mediterranean, Middle East and North Africa (EMMENA) region, Europe and Internationally for the benefit of the environment and society. One of the main focus areas of the newly established ERATOSTHENES Centre of Excellence (ECoE) is using remote sensing and space-based techniques for effective, efficient and timely cultural heritage monitoring. Such monitoring can offer tremendous benefits to Cyprus governmental institutions and policy implementation bodies, towards the protection of cultural heritage sites, including cost- and time-effective control of cultural heritage sites/monuments, raising awareness on the preservation and protection of cultural heritage from anthropogenic and environmental pressures, early warning systems and systematic monitoring of cultural heritage. Satellite Earth Observation technologies provide the ideal resource of information to undertake a wide range of effective, cost-efficient and non-invasive activities, which cannot be so easily acquired with other tools. As a result of the Copernicus Program, Sentinel 1 and 2 missions provide free satellite imagery that is accessible, provides global coverage, a high temporal resolution enabling image time series analysis and temporal characteristics, allowing for the consistent and timely monitoring of cultural heritage monuments and landscapes. The efficient exploitation of high resolution dense time-series of multi-spectral and radar imagery for large scale applications introduces new important considerations including cost-effective and systematic monitoring service of cultural landscape sites with archaeological remains, monitoring significant risks that cultural landscapes face, as well as aiding archaeological mapping and interpretation. Further-on exploiting high spatial and temporal resolution (i.e. from other satellites beyond Copernicus) improves modelling and data assimilation solutions and integration of space based remote sensing techniques with advanced ground and aerial based ones. Both data allows to develop more efficient and effective tools of investigation and monitoring, able to ensure mapping and monitoring of buried and exposed archaeological structures.This paper was developed under the auspices of the activities of the 'ERATOSTHENES: Excellence Research Centre for Earth Surveillance and Space-Based Monitoring of the Environment'- 'EXCELSIOR' project that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 857510 and from the Government of the Republic of Cyprus through the Directorate General for the European Programmes, Coordination and Development. From 1st of October 2019, the ERC group (Department of Civil Engineering and Geomatics) at the Cyprus University of Technology is on the way to be upgraded to ERATOSTHENES Centre of Excellence (ECoE) through 'EXCELSIOR' H 2020 Widespread Teaming project (www.excelsior2020.eu).

AB  - Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) is a key tool in managing the interaction of activities in the coastal and marine environment. It analyzes and allocates human activities to achieve the ecological, economic, and social goals established through a political process. Under this project, data was collected for various activities such as tourism, aquaculture, fisheries, renewable energy, ship routes, etc. This study focuses on the data referring to ship detection. Ship routes in Cyprus EEZ were created using position signals of ships in the EEZ for a temporal resolution of 15 minutes. These signals are compared to the positions of these ships using the radar backscatter derived from Sentinel-1A and Sentinel1B satellite images, which have a temporal resolution of 6 days. The radar backscatter for a certain period calculated using the Google Earth Engine platform, was then compared to the ship signals provided. This research is supported by the project entitled "Cross border Cooperation for Implementation of Marine Spatial Planning referred as THAL-CHOR 2" and is Co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and by national funds of Greece and Cyprus under the Cooperation Programme Interreg V-A Greece-Cyprus 2014-2020.

AB  - Sedimentation at coastal of Cirebon City is caused by considerable abrasion process in Indramayu regency and the impact of sand mining on Gosong Island, Indramayu Regency, besides that, the habit of residents in coastal of Cirebon City who heap up garbage at the coastal for years to utilize the area for residential purpose also contributed significantly the problem of sedimentation in the coastal area of Cirebon City. This research applying remote sensing technology of Landsat 7 2005, 2010, and 2015 using Lemigas Algorithm to gain information of special and temporal increase of sedimentation, distribution pattern, and density level of sedimentation. The result shows that the most significant increase of sedimentation happened at 2010 to 2015 with 46,072 Ha. There are 2 types of distribution pattern at Cirebon City, the first one is the sedimentation that ends in the estuary of river. The other type is the sedimentation caused by the presence of longshore currents which carry sediment and stuck on the coast along coastal of Cirebon City. Identification of natural and artificial sedimentation is carried out based on surveys in the field. The Lemigas Algorithm used only for classification of sedimentation based on density level of sedimentation content (mg/L). This research contributes to the Cirebon City government in resolving the problems of abrasion, accretion, and siltation in coastal areas, for the development of the Cirebon City coastal area to be an asset supported the economy in the future.

TI  - Channel stability assessment in the lower reaches of the Krishna River (India) using multi-temporal satellite data during 1973-2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study examines the extent of erosion and deposition along the banks of the lower reaches of the Krishna River (India) between 1973 and 2015, by analyzing the shifts in the bank lines using Landsat images of the years 1973, 1991 and 2015. The analysis is limited to the river segment downstream of the Nagarjuna Sagar Dam up to the Krishna Delta (318 km). The results indicated that the total area lost between 1973 and 1991 due to bank erosion was 3093 ha, whereas the areal extent was reduced to 1386 ha during 1991-2015. Although the individual river reaches had characteristic bank shifting patterns during the period, most of the reaches shifted their banks without changing the bankfull width of the river. Bank erosion was dominated in most of the study reaches during 1973-1991, compared to deposition, while the pattern was reversed during 1991-2015. The contrasting bank erosion/deposition patterns between 1973-1991 and 1991-2015 might be the reflection of the variations in the pattern of flood events between the periods. The impact of the Nagarjuna Sagar Dam on bank erosion is apparent as a sharp increase in the erosion intensity downstream of the dam. The spatial variability of bank erosion is also a function of regional lithology, with marked variability between the Quaternary sediments and other lithological types.

AB  - The future of phenotyping for crop breeding and agricultural production will likely involve cooperation between autonomous aerial and ground-based vehicles. Consideration of this advance in autonomous systems is relatively new in the academic literature, particularly in relation to agriculture. Areas of study to date have included the broadly applied concepts of environment perception and modeling, autonomous cooperation, collaborative position control, and path planning. Multiple opportunities are emerging for the technology to be advantageous in agriculture. An example includes using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for remote sensing in cooperation with an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that will perform ground-based activities in accord with analysis of the remote-sensing data. This case could be applied in mapping and mitigation of insects and weeds as well as harvesting according to variations in crop yield and maturity. Another example includes using a UGV to serve as an autonomous ground-control point in order to maximize the accuracy of UAV remote-sensing data. Ongoing research in this area has shown major improvements in the accuracy of measurements of plant reflectance, height, and temperature, not to mention improvements in georectification.

TI  - Impact of a compression garment, on top of the usual care, in patients with breast cancer with early disturbance of the lymphatic transport: protocol of a randomised controlled trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL) is a common phenomenon. When lymphoedema is diagnosed late, options for treatment are diminished. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are very important to alter the potential deleterious evolution. Lymphofluoroscopy visualises the superficial lymphatic architecture in detail, giving the opportunity to detect a disturbance in the lymphatic transport (ie, dermal backflow) before the lymphoedema is clinically visible. The main objective is to investigate if there is an additional effect of a compression garment on top of the usual care (ie, information and exercises) in patients with early disturbance of the lymphatic transport after breast cancer treatment. Development of clinical lymphoedema and/or deterioration of the dermal backflow visualised by lymphofluoroscopy is investigated.Methodology All patients scheduled for breast cancer surgery with unilateral axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel node biopsy in the Multidisciplinary Breast Clinic of the University Hospitals Leuven are being considered. Patients are assessed before surgery and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months postoperatively. At each visit, a clinical assessment is performed determining the volume difference between both arms and hands (through circumference measurements and water displacement), the water content, the extracellular fluid, the pitting status and the skinfold thickness. Quality of life questionnaires are filled in. At each visit, a lymphofluoroscopy is performed as well. When a disturbance of the lymphatic transport is seen on lymphofluoroscopy, without the presence of clinical lymphoedema, the patient is randomised in either a control group receiving usual care or a preventive treatment group receiving usual care and a compression garment (whether or not combined with a glove).Ethics and dissemination The trial is conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2008), the principles of Good Clinical Practice and in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. This protocol has been approved by the Ethical Committee of the University Hospitals Leuven. Results will be disseminated by peer-reviewed scientific journals and presentation at international congresses.Trial registration number NCT03210311Conclusion The investigators hypothesise that development of clinical BCRL can be prevented and/or the dermal backflow can be stabilised or improved, if a preventive treatment with compression garment is started in the early phase of disturbance.

TI  - USING SENTINEL IMAGE DATA AND PLOT SURVEY FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF BIOMASS AND CARBON STOCK IN COASTAL FORESTS OF THAI BINH PROVINCE, VIETNAM
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative evaluation of biomass and carbon stored in coastal forests of Thai Binh province (Vietnam) does not only contribute to coast protection, but is also required for emphasizing the forest's importance in local socio-economic development when participating in the carbon market. This estimation is primarily based on field data (diameter at breast height, height and quantity of tree in 14 surveyed plots), anatomical data (above ground biomass, total biomass and carbon content of 31 sampled trees) and an NDVI map calculated from Sentinel imagery. Mathematical models are used for expressing the relationships: above ground biomass vs. diameter at breast height, height; biomass vs. above-ground biomass; biomass vs. carbon; and aboveground biomass vs. NDVI. The results show the same behavior of above ground biomass, total biomass and carbon stock, they increase with the growth of tree. The exponential model is acceptable for correlating above ground biomass and NDVI, showing higher values in long planted areas and the lower ones in newly formed lands with recently planted mangroves. Biomass and carbon stock in the study area have average productivities of 38.8 t/ha and 19.4 t/ha, respectively. Overall estimations are ca. 292 kilotons of biomass and ca. 146 kilotons of carbon, roughly valuated of US$ 5.9 million.

TI  - Coarse-Resolution Satellite Images Overestimate Urbanization Effects on Vegetation Spring Phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous investigations of urbanization effects on vegetation spring phenology using satellite images have reached a consensus that vegetation spring phenology in urban areas occurs earlier than in surrounding rural areas. Nevertheless, the magnitude of this rural-urban difference is quite different among these studies, especially for studies over the same areas, which implies large uncertainties. One possible reason is that the satellite images used in these studies have different spatial resolutions from 30 m to 1 km. In this study, we investigated the impact of spatial resolution on the rural-urban difference of vegetation spring phenology using satellite images at different spatial resolutions. To be exact, we first generated a dense 10 m NDVI time series through harmonizing Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images by data fusion method, and then resampled the 10 m time series to coarser resolutions from 30 m to 8 km to simulate images at different resolutions. Afterwards, to quantify urbanization effects, vegetation spring phenology at each resolution was extracted by a widely used tool, TIMESAT. Last, we calculated the difference between rural and urban areas using an urban extent map derived from NPP VIIRS nighttime light data. Our results reveal: (1) vegetation spring phenology in urban areas happen earlier than rural areas no matter which spatial resolution from 10 m to 8 km is used, (2) the rural-urban difference in vegetation spring phenology is amplified with spatial resolution, i.e., coarse satellite images overestimate the urbanization effects on vegetation spring phenology, and (3) the underlying reason of this overestimation is that the majority of urban pixels in coarser images have higher diversity in terms of spring phenology dates, which leads to spring phenology detected from coarser NDVI time series earlier than the actual dates. This study indicates that spatial resolution is an important factor that affects the accuracy of the assessment of urbanization effects on vegetation spring phenology. For future studies, we suggest that satellite images with a fine spatial resolution are more appropriate to explore urbanization effects on vegetation spring phenology if vegetation species in urban areas is very diverse.

TI  - A Modification to Time-Series Coregistration for Sentinel-1 TOPS Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Very high requirement of co-registration accuracy better than 0.001 pixels for Sentinel-1 TOPS (Terrain Observation by Progressive Scan) mode presents a great challenge for application of SAR (synthetic aperture radar) interferometry in Earth Observation. The state-of-the-art techniques have demonstrated that the low coherence scenarios and abrupt loss of coherence between two arbitrary acquisitions are main sources of error to degrade the performance of TOPS time-series co-registration. In this paper, we present a modification to overcome both limitations through the coherence enhancement. The motive behind this is to improve the quality of observations before co-registration and meanwhile avoiding the coherence loss caused by fast decorrelation. To this end, principal components analysis based spatio-temporal filtering is first used to remove the artifacts in burst interferograms over strong noise areas. Rather than heuristically choosing a sub-set of interferograms as a small baseline technique does, we use Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm under graph theory framework to maximize the coherence of a sub-set interferograms. The performance of presented method against the state-of-the-art techniques is fully evaluated by synthetic data and a Sentinel-1A stack over a low coherence scene in Indonesia. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate 9%-17% uncertainty reduction of time-series co-registration when applying our method.

TI  - A Variational Pansharpening Method Based on Gradient Sparse Representation
T2  - IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - By exploiting the gradient similarity between multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images, a variational pansharpening method based on gradient sparse representation is proposed, based on the observation that the gradients of corresponding MS and PAN images with different resolutions have the similar sparse coefficients under certain specific dictionaries. By adding a data fidelity term to preserve the spectral information, an optimization model is constructed as a minimization problem of an energy function. The problem can be solved by the gradient descent method efficiently. Experiments on different satellite data reveal that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual effect and objective quality analysis.

AB  - The extraction of seafloor substrate information based on remote sensing is the inevitable requirement of carrying out the survey of the basic habitat elements around islands and islands ecological environment protection. However, due to the influence of sun glint and water attenuation, the extraction accuracy of seafloor substrate information based on remote sensing has been poor. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the extraction method of coral reefs based on remote sensing data, aiming to improve the feasibility and accuracy of detection. High resolution WorldView-2 remote sensing images were used in this study as data source and waters around one of the Xiasha Islands were selected as study area Our research can be summarized into two part, one is to obtain bottom radiance from remote sensing data and another one is to identify different species from bottom radiance,such as coral reefs, sand and so on. The following results have been obtained.(1) The overall accuracy of the classification results was 80.6%, and the consistency coefficient, also called Kappa coefficient, was 71.5%.(2) Among all the bottom sediment classification results, coral reefs has the highest production accuracy, which is 88.1%, mud has the lowest production accuracy, which is 59.0%, sand was the bottom sediment type whose user accuracy was the highest, which is 94.1%, and the mud has the lowest user accuracy, which is 65.1%.

In this paper, the change of Chalaati Glacier in the Georgian Caucasus from its maximum extent during the Little Ice Age has been studied. For the first time in the history of glaciological studies of the Georgian Caucasus, Be-10 in situ Cosmic Ray Exposure (CRE) dating was applied. The age of moraines was determined by tree-ring analysis. Lichenometry was also used as a supplementary tool to determine the relative ages of glacial landforms. In addition, the large-scale topographical maps (1887, 1960) were used along with the satellite imagery - Corona, Landsat 5 TM, and Sentinel 2B. Repeated photographs were used to identify the glacier extent in the late XIX and early XX centuries. Be-10 CRE ages from the oldest lateral moraine of the Chalaati Glacier suggest that the onset of the Little Ice Age occurred similar to 0.73 +/- 0.04 kyr ago (CE similar to 1250-1330), while the dendrochronology and lichenometry measurements show that the Chalaati Glacier reached its secondary maximum extent again about CE similar to 1810. From that time through 2018 the glacier area decreased from 14.9 +/- 1.5 km(2) to 9.9 +/- 0.5 km(2) (33.8 +/- 7.4% or similar to 0.16% yr(-1)), while its length retreated by similar to 2280 m. The retreat rate was uneven: it peaked between 1940 and 1971 (similar to 22.9 m yr(-1)), while the rate was slowest in 1910-1930 (similar to 4.0 m yr(-1)). The terminus elevation rose from similar to 1620 m to similar to 1980 m above sea level in similar to 1810-2018.

AB  - In this chapter, we discuss the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in the establishment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), highlighting the key role of the multiple, non-mutually exclusive, pathways involved in the modulation of immune responses and in the orchestration of a chronic low-level inflammation state favouring HCC development. In particular, we discuss (i) HCC as a classical paradigm of inflammation-linked cancer; (ii) the role of the most relevant inflammatory cytokines involved (i.e. IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-18, IL-1 beta, TGF-beta IL-10); (iii) the role of T cell exhaustion by immune checkpoints; (iv) the role of the Wnt3a/beta-catenin signalling pathway and (v) the role of different subsets of suppressor cells.

T2  - AUC GEOGRAPHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge of actual evapotranspiration at farm level is a prerequisite for irrigation planning, farm management, to increase production and reduce water consumption. To accomplish this, comprehensive and accurate assessment methods should be applied. In order to evaluate accurately evapotranspiration processes we compared lysimeter evapotranspiration data with MODIS (Aqua and Terra satellites) and LANDSAT (SEBAL algorithm) satellite images as well as with the FAO Penman-Montith method. The findings indicate the low error rate, high correlation (1) and appropriateness of SEBAL in estimating actual evapotranspiration. The error values MAD, MSE and RMSE between lysimeter and the SEBAL algorithm were 0.59, 0.36 and 0.60 respectively. The second best performance was established for the FAO Penman-Montith method. The obtained error values MAD, MSE and RMSE between the lysimeter and FAO-Penman-Montith method are 0.91, 1.29 and 1.13, respectively.

AB  - The relevance of the research is caused by the need to obtain objective information about the patterns of territorial and temporal variability of vegetation state and the factors that determine it for the most effective use of lands in extreme natural and socio-economic conditions in the Republic of Iraq.The aim of the research is to analyze the dynamics of vegetation of territories of the four provinces in Central Iraq using the normalized difference vegetation index NDVI in the period from 2014 to 2017.The objects of the research are territories of Central Iraq: Babil, Baghdad, Wasit and Diyala. The subject of the study is temporal-territorial variability of vegetation state.Methods: remote sensing, thematic mapping, image processing, spatial data analysis, statistical analysis.Results. Patterns of temporarily-territorial dynamics of vegetation state in Central Iraq were revealed using vegetation index NDVI calculated with remote sensing data obtained by Landsat-8. Regional features of the vegetation structure and the rate of its state change were established. The maximum areas of non-vegetated territories were found in Baghdad and Wasit; covered by vegetation of most classes - also in Wasit; covered by dense vegetation - in Diyala, marked as well by minimum of barren areas. Babil is characterized by minimum area covered by vegetation. Baghdad in the studied indicators is intermediate. These patterns are poorly consistent with the absolute values of the province areas. They are caused by the prevailing economic conditions and are manifested in the qualitative and quantitative heterogeneity of the distribution of vegetation in the provinces. During the active stage of vegetation, from February to March, the variations in areas of non-vegetated territories, occupied by moderate and dense vegetation, are stable. At the same time, the variability of areas of territories with very dense vegetation is growing, with weak vegetation and vegetation of maximum density decreases. A correlation analysis between NDVI values and weather conditions did not reveal any significant relationships.

AB  - Gravity data is processed and the problems of the earth are examined. The density of the data can be arranged to solve detail, semi-detail and regional problems. Here, the gravitational data obtained by processing the linearity of the 2D and 3D visuals in terms of plate size large wavelength structures are examined. 2D linearities determine important stress areas but they are affected at different rates with respect to the spatial distribution of source effect. Due to grid formation, these boundaries are affected at different rates from less dense and very dense structures. Different wavelengths in structure boundary analysis; derivative and phase elements and filters. Vertical change in 3D analysis can be made at the approach level with the analytical examination of 2D change. At this stage, the distribution of source effect and depth model structure parameters are calculated. When examining large wavelength structures, some of the buried structures appear due to cover removal. In search of solutions for tectonic structures that we may miss; The tectonic components that need to be confirmed in the Eastern Mediterranean have been tried to be elucidated in this study. 3D building solutions are important in this respect.

TI  - Long-term changes in forest cover in a global biodiversity hotspot in southern Mozambique
T2  - BOTHALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Deforestation is a complex and dynamic process of widespread concern in sub-Saharan Africa that is influenced by a range of social, economic and biophysical factors.Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyse patterns of deforestation and its potential drivers in the Licuati Forest Reserve, a biodiversity hotspot in southern Mozambique, between 1990 and 2016.Method: We performed image classification on Landsat imagery at six time steps and interviewed local community members to understand the spatial pattern and rate of forest cover loss over time. We also examined changes in the incidence of fire.Results: A substantial increase in the rate of deforestation since 1990 was detected in this vulnerable thicket vegetation. The probability of deforestation was significantly higher near the major roads, where houses are located. This suggests that the proximity of human settlements to the forest, and access to charcoal markets in urban areas, influenced the spatial pattern. Two key factors, charcoal production and the establishment of settlements and agricultural lands, were identified as proximate causes of deforestation. In addition, fires associated with these two causes might amplify the loss of forests in the area.Conclusions: Complex interactions between the drivers of deforestation and socio-economic factors were suggested, as most of the charcoal produced in the region is transported to Maputo. Ongoing road improvements and infrastructural development in the region will likely accelerate the decline in forest cover in the future. This has implications for the biodiversity of the region as well as for the sustainability of local livelihoods, as they often depend on forest products for their daily uses.

TI  - The Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System (SORMAS): Digital Health Global Goods Maturity Assessment.
T2  - JMIR public health and surveillance
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - BACKGROUND: Digital health is a dynamic field that has been generating a large number of tools; many of these tools do not have the level of maturity required to function in a sustainable model. It is in this context that the concept of global goods maturity is gaining importance. Digital Square developed a global good maturity model (GGMM) for digital health tools, which engages the digital health community to identify areas of investment for global goods. The Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System (SORMAS) is an open-source mobile and web application software that we developed to enable health workers to notify health departments about new cases of epidemic-prone diseases, detect outbreaks, and simultaneously manage outbreak response.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the maturity of SORMAS using Digital Square's GGMM and to describe the applicability of the GGMM on the use case of SORMAS and identify opportunities for system improvements.METHODS: We evaluated SORMAS using the GGMM version 1.0 indicators to measure its development. SORMAS was scored based on all the GGMM indicator scores. We described how we used the GGMM to guide the development of SORMAS during the study period. GGMM contains 15 subindicators grouped into the following core indicators: (1) global utility, (2) community support, and (3) software maturity.RESULTS: The assessment of SORMAS through the GGMM from November 2017 to October 2019 resulted in full completion of all subscores (10/30, (33%) in 2017; 21/30, (70%) in 2018; and 30/30, (100%) in 2019). SORMAS reached the full score of the GGMM for digital health software tools by accomplishing all 10 points for each of the 3 indicators on global utility, community support, and software maturity.CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, SORMAS is the first electronic health tool for disease surveillance, and also the first outbreak response management tool, that has achieved a 100% score. Although some conceptual changes would allow for further improvements to the system, the GGMM already has a robust supportive effect on developing software toward global goods maturity.

AB  - The short revisit time and large coverage of the Sentinel-1 sensor have opened the way for countrywide deformation maps through persistent scatterer interferometry techniques. It is impossible for a human operator to manually verify millions of data points, hence the need for automatic analysis methods. In this paper, we expand on previous work by employing the newly developed uniform manifold approximation and projection dimensionality reduction methodology to deformation profiles, in a supervised manner, and we show that it is possible to identify certain types of profiles.

AB  - Wildfires seasonal cycle, air temperature anomalies and precipitation in four latitudinal zones of Eastern Siberia are analyzed by multidecadal remote sensing data and CRU TS dataset. Features of latitudinal distribution of small fire patches (0.2-20 ha) are discussed. Trends and correlations between number of small fire patches, air temperature anomalies and precipitation in each latitudinal zone and month of fire season are analyzed. In general, it can be noted that in the northern part of the boreal zone of Eastern Siberia (zones 1, 2) over the past two decades there has been a noticeable increase in wildfire activity in the first half of summer, possibly related to the effects of climate warming. The dynamics of the trends of small-scale fires in the southern part (zones 3, 4) is ambiguous, requiring further research.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODETIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The poplar species in the forest ecosystems are one of the most valuable and beneficial species for the society and environment. Conventional methods require high cost, time and labor need, and the results obtained vary and are insufficient in terms of achieved accuracy level. Determination of poplar cultivated fields and mapping of their spatial sites play a vital role for decision-makers and planners to enhance the economic and ecological value of poplar trees. The study aims to map Poplar (P.deltoides) cultivated areas in Akyazi district of Sakarya, Turkey province using various combinations of the Sentinel-2A image bands. For this purpose, object-based classification based on multi-resolution segmentation algorithm was utilized to produce image objects and ensemble learning algorithms, namely, Adaboost (AdaB), Random Forest (RF), Rotation Forest (RotFor) and Canonical correlation forest (CCF) were applied to produce thematic maps. In order to analyze the effects of the spectral bands of the Sentinel-2A image on the object-based classification performance, three datasets consisting of difierent spectral band combinations (i.e. four 10 m bands, six 20mbands and ten 10m pan-sharpened bands) were used. The results showed that the RotFor and CCF classifiers produced superior classification performances compared to the AdaB and RF classifiers for the band combinations regarded in this study. Moreover, it was found that determination of poplar tree class level accuracy reached to similar to 94% in terms of F-score. It was also observed that the inclusion of the six spectral bands at 20 m resolution resulted in a noteworthy increase in classification accuracy (up to 6%) compared to single 10m band combination.

AB  - Currently, most individual tree crowns delineation methods are proposed for aerial images and Lidar data. In this paper, a scheme is proposed to delineate tree crowns from the high spatial resolution WorldView-3 satellite imagery. We select a multiscale fitting scheme for the delineation and propose two modifications to optimize the result generated from this scheme. First, the object-based classification is applied to detect the shadows between tree crowns. Second, we modified the multiscale fitting process to make the selection of optimal scale fairer. The experiment results of a subset in a WorldView-3 satellite image demonstrate that the proposed modifications can improve the delineation accuracy.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Compact Infrared Camera (CIRC) instruments onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) and the Calorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) attached to the International Space Station are satellite-borne 2D-array thermal infrared cameras for technical demonstrations in fields such as forest fire monitoring, volcano monitoring, and heat island analysis. Since they have the characteristics of low cost and low power consumption and have no onboard calibrator such as a blackbody or shutter, in-flight calibration should be performed by vicarious calibration (VC) and cross-calibration (CC). In this study, we determined the recalibration coefficients for both of the CIRC instruments as a function of time based on VC experiments in Lake Kasumigaura (Japan) and Railroad Valley Playa (USA), VC with telemetry data from three lakes in Japan and the USA, and CC with imagers onboard two geostationary satellites (MTSAT-2 and Himawari-8). As a result, the derived recalibration coefficients improved the accuracy of the ground-testing-based radiance remarkably in both of the CIRC instruments, suggesting that the recalibrated radiance can satisfy the target accuracy of CIRC, given as 2 K at 300 K. These coefficients, as a function of time, will be applied to all CIRC images by reprocessing planned in the near future.

M3  - Article
AB  - Alfred Klaar (1848-1927, born Alfred Karpeles) was someone who for many decades had a fundamental influence on the discourse in Prague, the Czech lands, and in the German -language arena in general, mostly on issues of politics and aesthetics. Born into a well-off German-speaking jewish merchant family in Prag, his boyhood years were refined and spent in a world devoid of any marked political or social excesses. His basic, family-instilled disposition or outlook remained unaltered even by his time as a gymnasium student (or his by then good knowledge of Czech), and on the contrary it was during this period Karpeles became confirmed in a belief in the cultural superiority of the German-speaking world. After that, as a student of law at university in Vienna, the basic frame of his worldview, which included a certain admixture ofpreferences and loyalties, was set, and prepared at most to be further fed and added to. At the age of twenty, he willingly put himself at the service of liberaloriented political forces, identifying, linguistically and culturally, with Germanity, as, paradoxically, something above individual languages and potential ethnic (and thus even anti-Semitic) tensions. In the ensuing years he then worked reliably within the confines of this choice, in 1869-1871 as a frequent contributor to the Prague newspaper Tagesbote aus Bohmen.

T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Starting from the mid-14th century, pilgrimage became a popular activity in Italy, the social status of the individuals participating in this activity suddenly became more varied. Many of the pilgrims kept diaries of their journeys - a genre that became very popular. Thanks to these journeys, the closed world of the medieval man began to expand, and his traditional worldview changed, incorporating a lot of new information. This information had to be understood and classified, and often a reliable method of classification was comparison of the new and the familiar. For this reason, pilgrims paid attention, first and foremost, to things that differed from what they were used to and that they perceived as strange, incomprehensible, and miraculous. Here their descriptions often approached the genre of the mirabilia. One can identify two opposite trends in these depictions of a new world and its realities: rejection and fear, on the one hand, and interest and curiosity on the other. Each author takes a different approach to new information: some considered every unfamiliar phenomenon to be a miracle and described it in corresponding terms, often adding "picturesque" and usually farfetched details along the way. Others adopted a "realistic" and quasi-scholarly style of description, refraining from embellishing their accounts with invented details. The relative share and modality of such descriptions changed over time: whereas emphasis was placed in the Middle Ages on depicting places from the Bible and on spiritual edification, pilgrims' diaries became increasingly bent on entertaining readers.

A main project outcome was the production of an image database containing Sentinel-2 and very high resolution RGB aerial images of artificial marine debris targets. The drone data allow for the precise positioning of the targets in Sentinel-2 images and the derivation of pixel abundance fractions. A reversed linear spectral unmixing methodology was used to calculate the spectral response of the PET target material for each Sentinel-2 10m band. Results suggest that given conditions of low glint, in the case of the PET bottle target, pixels with a relatively small plastic abundance fraction (<40%) can be successfully detected.

TI  - Research Trends in the Use of Remote Sensing for Inland Water Quality Science: Moving Towards Multidisciplinary Applications
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing approaches to measuring inland water quality date back nearly 50 years to the beginning of the satellite era. Over this time span, hundreds of peer-reviewed publications have demonstrated promising remote sensing models to estimate biological, chemical, and physical properties of inland waterbodies. Until recently, most of these publications focused largely on algorithm development as opposed to implementation of those algorithms to address specific science questions. This slow evolution contrasts with terrestrial and oceanic remote sensing, where methods development in the 1970s led to publications focused on understanding spatially expansive, complex processes as early as the mid-1980s. This review explores the progression of inland water quality remote sensing from methodological development to scientific applications. We use bibliometric analysis to assess overall patterns in the field and subsequently examine 236 key papers to identify trends in research focus and scale. The results highlight an initial 30 year period where the majority of publications focused on model development and validation followed by a spike in publications, beginning in the early-2000s, applying remote sensing models to analyze spatiotemporal trends, drivers, and impacts of changing water quality on ecosystems and human populations. Recent and emerging resources, including improved data availability and enhanced processing platforms, are enabling researchers to address challenging science questions and model spatiotemporally explicit patterns in water quality. Examination of the literature shows that the past 10-15 years has brought about a focal shift within the field, where researchers are using improved computing resources, datasets, and operational remote sensing algorithms to better understand complex inland water systems. Future satellite missions promise to continue these improvements by providing observational continuity with spatial/spectral resolutions ideal for inland waters.

T2  - ITALIAN JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY-RIVISTA ITALIANA DI AGROMETEOROLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is expected to significantly affect the precipitation regime of the Mediterranean basin where Turkey is located. This study investigates the trends of seasonal and annual precipitation time series of 29 rain gauge stations of the Turkish State Meteorological Service (TSMS) for the period 1955-2013, using two statistical tests based on a simple linear regression model and the well-known Mann-Kendall test. The non-parametric Sen's slope estimator was used to estimate the slope of the trend. The results of the trend analysis at the national scale for the entire period 1955-2013 revealed a clear significant upward trend of 5.5%/decade only for autumn precipitation. No significant trend was found in the annual and other seasonal time series. The investigation of abrupt precipitation changes in the series averaged over Turkey resulted in a distinct significant upward trend in autumn precipitation starting in 1984 and a downward trend in winter precipitation initiating in 1971, which, however, seems to start reversing after 1996. The influence of atmospheric circulation on the precipitation variability in Turkey was assessed using five atmospheric circulation indices: North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI), Mediterranean Oscillation Index (MOI), Mediterranean Circulation Index (MCI), Eastern Mediterranean Pattern Index (EMPI) and North-Sea Caspian Pattern Index (NCPI). The analysis of the circulation indices revealed an important link between precipitation variability in Turkey and some atmospheric teleconnection patterns, expressed mainly by the indices of NAOI and MCI.

AB  - In the last ten years, ESA's Earth Observation (EO) program has been based on three main pillars, i.e. Copernicus, Meteorology and Earth Science Explorer and on some crosscutting activities covering international cooperation and preservation of historical data.In the framework of the Copernicus program, the Sentinel-1 mission is the workhorse for acquiring systematically and providing routinely a large volume of C-band SAR data to the Copernicus services and the global scientific and commercial user community. As part of the Copernicus expansion, ESA completed the study phase for an L -band SAR mission (ROSE-L) last October 2019 and issued the corresponding Request for Proposal for the development of two spacecraft.On the other hand, the availability of high-resolution X-band data is ensured through national European SAR missions, such as TerraSAR-X, Cosmo-SkyMed and PAZ, which are referred to as Copernicus Contributing Missions. L-band SAR data are required for applications, such as surface deformation mapping, monitoring of cryosphere dynamics, sea-ice classification and land cover mapping, among others. As such, L-band data provide complementary information to C- and X-band data. Besides ESA's ROSE-L, Germany is perusing the implementation of the proposed Tandem-L mission, at national level.Recently, disruptive NewSpace smallSat SAR companies have emerged on the EO market. This has triggered discussions on whether or to what extent smallSats can eventually replace or complement large institutional SAR missions.In this paper we provide the overview of the evolution of the Copernicus SAR Space Component: the Sentinel-1 Space Segment and the Spacecraft development status, the ROSE-L development approach and we also discuss the challenges for the evolution. its objectives and implementation, the systematic data acquisition strategy including coverage and revisit frequency, and the end-to-end SAR performance

TI  - Mapping Evapotranspiration, Vegetation and Precipitation Trends in the Catchment of the Shrinking Lake Poopo
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Poopo is located in the Andean Mountain Range Plateau or Altiplano. A general decline in the lake water level has been observed in the last two decades, coinciding roughly with an intensification of agriculture exploitation, such as quinoa crops. Several factors have been linked with the shrinkage of the lake, including climate change, increased irrigation, mining extraction and population growth. Being an endorheic catchment, evapotranspiration (ET) losses are expected to be the main water output mechanism and previous studies demonstrated ET increases using Earth observation (EO) data. In this study, we seek to build upon these earlier findings by analyzing an ET time series dataset of higher spatial and temporal resolution, in conjunction with land cover and precipitation data. More specifically, we performed a spatio-temporal analysis, focusing on wet and dry periods, that showed that ET changes occur primarily in the wet period, while the dry period is approximately stationary. An analysis of vegetation trends performed using 500 MODIS vegetation index products (NDVI) also showed an overall increasing trend during the wet period. Analysis of NDVI and ET across land cover types showed that only croplands had experienced an increase in NDVI and ET losses, while natural covers showed either constant or decreasing NDVI trends together with increases in ET. The larger increase in vegetation and ET losses over agricultural regions, strongly suggests that cropping practices exacerbated water losses in these areas. This quantification provides essential information for the sustainable planning of water resources and land uses in the catchment. Finally, we examined the spatio-temporal trends of the precipitation using the newly available Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS-v2) product, which we validated with onsite rainfall measurements. When integrated over the entire catchment, precipitation and ET showed an average increasing trend of 5.2 mm yr(-1) and 4.3 mm yr(-1), respectively. This result suggests that, despite the increased ET losses, the catchment-wide water storage should have been offset by the higher precipitation. However, this result is only applicable to the catchment-wide water balance, and the location of water may have been altered (e.g., by river abstractions or by the creation of impoundments) to the detriment of the Lake Poopo downstream.

TI  - Estimation of Evapotranspiration and Energy Fluxes using a Deep-Learning based High-Resolution Emissivity Model and the Two-Source Energy Balance Model with sUAS information

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Surface temperature is necessary for the estimation of energy fluxes and evapotranspiration from satellites and airborne data sources. For example, the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model uses thermal information to quantify canopy and soil temperatures as well as their respective energy balance components. While surface (also called kinematic) temperature is desirable for energy balance analysis, obtaining this temperature is not straightforward due to a lack of spatially estimated narrowband (sensor-specific) and broadband emissivities of vegetation and soil, further complicated by spectral characteristics of the UAV thermal camera. This study presents an effort to spatially model narrowband and broadband emissivities for a microbolometer thermal camera at UAV information resolution (similar to 0.15 m) based on Landsat and NASA HyTES information using a deep learning (DL) model. The DL model is calibrated using equivalent optical Landsat / UAV spectral information to spatially estimate narrowband emissivity values of vegetation and soil in the 7-14-nm range at UAV resolution. The resulting DL narrowband emissivity values were then used to estimate broadband emissivity based on a developed narrowband-broadband emissivity relationship using the MODIS UCSB Emissivity Library database. The narrowband and broadband emissivities were incorporated into the TSEB model to determine their impact on the estimation of instantaneous energy balance components against ground measurements. The proposed effort was applied to information collected by the Utah State University AggieAir small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) Program as part of the ARS-USDA GRAPEX Project (Grape Remote sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment) over a vineyard located in Lodi, California. A comparison of resulting energy balance component estimates, with and without the inclusion of high-resolution narrowband and broadband emissivities, against eddy covariance (EC) measurements under different scenarios are presented and discussed.

AB  - Oobius rudnevi (Nowicki, 1928) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) is first reported from Iberia and southern Europe using sentinel eggs. The parasitoid was detected in July 2016 in three oak open woodlands in Extremadura (SW Spain), located in Almendral (La Jara) and Merida (La Serrana and Cornalvo Natural Park). O. rudnevi parasitized both the eggs of Cerambyx cerdo Linnaeus, 1758 (its only known host to date) and C. welensii (Kuster, 1845), which constitutes a new host-parasitoid association (C. welensii-O. rudnevi). Parasitism rate was quite variable among sites and dates (range 0-93%), with a higher prevalence in C. cerdo than in C. welensii. New studies are conducted in the field and laboratory to explore the ecology, behaviour and parasitic potential of O. rudnevi in Mediterranean oak open woodlands.

AB  - Irrigation is one of the key factors to describe water balance in the Aral Sea basin. However, the irrigated area here changes annually due to severe drought and land salinization. Therefore, there is a need to grasp the extent of this irrigated area albeit the limited available data.Subsequently, this research evaluated a satellite based irrigation index using surface temperature. Since water has a higher heat capacity than soil and since evapotranspiration has a cooling effect, the diurnal difference of surface temperature is generally lower in the irrigated area. However, since climatic and geological variability also affects the temperature, a land surface model was applied to provide an ideal diurnal surface temperature difference without the irrigation effect. This irrigation index was applied in the whole of Uzbekistan, which has various dryness zones in the same country.Firstly, the index was applied on a normal year and compared with a 10km resolution statistics data on the irrigated area in the country. During the irrigation season, the index was found to reduce remarkably when the irrigation fraction is large. Secondly, the monthly and annual changes in the index were compared. In the monthly analysis, it was found that the index showed a significant decrease during the irrigation season where the irrigation fraction was high. However, in an attempt to detect the drought effect on the irrigated area, the annual changes of the index were too small for the purpose.

M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to update efficacy data of Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AS+AQ) and Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) used as first-line malaria treatment in Cote d'Ivoire since 2005. This was an open-label, randomized trial conducted in patients older than 6 months with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria at six sentinel sites. The WHO 2009 protocol on surveillance of anti-malaria drug efficacy was used with primary outcomes as ACPR corrected by PCR at day 42. Secondary endpoints were parasite and fever clearance times and safety. From January to July 2016, 712 patients were included in the trial. 353 and 359 patients were randomly assigned respectively to the AS+AQ and AL arm. Day 42 PCR-adjusted ACPR in the per-protocol analysis was 99.4% and 98.8% in AS+AQ and AL arm respectively. Delayed parasite clearance was observed in six patients at Abidjan and Yamousssoukro sites. Both ACTs were well tolerated. Both ACTs remain efficacious for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria treatment in Cote d'Ivoire. But regarding delayed parasite clearance observed in this study, a close monitoring and supervision for ACT resistance are essential for future malaria treatment and control strategies in Cote d'Ivoire.

AB  - Satellite altimeters, designed to measure the topography of the ocean, are also good imagers of the ocean surface backscatter. A method was developed to invert the classical Low Resolution Mode high resolution HR waveforms in terms of surface backscatter at high resolution (similar to 300m). Since the launch of Cryosat-2 in 2010, a new generation of altimeters using Doppler capabilities has emerged and has become the standard for the new altimeters such as the Sentinel-3 one. The so-called SAR altimetry provides higher along-track resolution and lower noise level. In this mode altimeter are also good imagers of the surface backscatter. A new method of inversion of SAR waveforms is presented. The processing of the Sentinel-3 altimeters provides collocated SAR and LRM waveforms that are used to intercompare the inverted surfce backscatter.

TI  - RECONSIDERING TERROR MANAGEMENT THEORY IN JAPAN
T2  - PSYCHOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the replicability and theoretical validity of terror management theory (TMT). The proposition that mortality salience (MS) leads humans to defend their cultural worldviews has found support in Western cultures. This finding was also replicated in Japan, a non-Western culture (Heine et al., 2002); however, there are limited findings of Japan. The meaning maintenance model proposes that cultural worldview defense is the result of meaning violation (MV) rather than anxiety of death. To investigate TMT in Japan, we conducted an internet survey among people in their 20s and 50s. We examined the effects of three experimental manipulations (MS, MV, and control) on cultural worldview defense. Results indicated that individuals in their 50s in the MS condition had a reaction opposite to the one described by Heine et al. (2002) and MV manipulation showed no effect. This suggests that cultural worldview defense did not occur in Japanese individuals.

TI  - Exploring Spatial Relationship Between Electrical Conductivity and Spectral Salinity Indices in the Mekong Delta
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The negative impact of salinization concurrent with drought is a severe problem that creates challenges for agriculture in deltas and coastal lowlands. This study aims to investigate the spatial relationship among the field measured electrical conductivity (EC) and spectral salinity indices derived from Remote sensed data in the Mekong Delta using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). A wide range of Landsat 8 Operational Land Images (OLI) products, including single bands, band ratios, vegetation indices (NDVI and EVI), intensity indices (INT), and brightness indices (BI) were employed for computing salinity indices. The Kriging and Co-, kriging interpolation techniques were used to estimate the spatial pattern of the field measured EC. Additionally, the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression were employed to characterize the relationship between single bands and EC measurement before applying the GWR for exploring the spatial correlation among the indices. There was a gradually increased of EC value from inland to coastal area. A significant relationship between EC measurement and spectral salinity indices and the highest correlation coefficient with p value less than 0.05 was found in EVI (r(2) = 0.736). This study demonstrated that the GWR is germane to analyse the spatial correlation among the mentioned variables in the study area. Moreover, it also revealed that spectral salinity indice's could be an alternative option for EC measurement in monitoring salt water intrusion at coastal areas.

AB  - This article applies radar interferometry technologies implemented in the ENVI SARscape and SNAP software environment provided by the processing of data from the Sentinel-1 satellite. The study was carried out based on six radar images of Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B taken from September 2017 until February 2018 with an interval of one month and on the radar-module of the already mentioned SNAP software. The main input data for solving the considered problem are radar images received from the satellite Sentinel-1B on the territory of Stebnyk-Truskavets for six months with an interval of one month. Monitoring of the Earth's surface using radar data of the Sentinel-1A with a synthesized aperture is implemented with the application of interferometric methods of Persistent Scatterers and Small baselines interferometry for estimating small displacements of the Earth's surface and structures. The obtained quantitative and qualitative indicators of monitoring do not answer the processes that take place and lead to vertical displacements the six months but do provide an opportunity to assess the extent and trends of their development. The specification in each case can be accomplished by ground methods, which greatly simplify the search for sites with critical parameters of vertical displacements which can have negative consequences and lead to an emergency.

AB  - Coffee plantation is one of the main agricultural sectors in the world, especially in Indonesia. For sustainable coffee management, it is important to obtain an assessment of the spatial distribution of coffee plantation. In fact, most of the coffee trees planted under the forest canopy as jungle coffee. However, remote sensing studies devoted to coffee in Indonesia have been limited due to spectral similarity with forest. Hence, the shaded coffee plantation has been difficult to be mapped. This condition takes aerial photography as an alternative solution to detect the distribution of shaded coffee plantation with high spatial resolution. This paper presents an assessment of the classification method of aerial photography for detecting shaded coffee plantation. The data used in this study is aerial photography captured in a shaded coffee field located in Gunung Puntang. Some classification methods namely Pixel-Based and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) were used. Those method performances were evaluated by comparing the classification result as overall accuracy. The result shows that OBIA is the best method for detecting shaded coffee plantation. It produces an overall accuracy of 73.01%.

AB  - Ganga River's water quality has been improved during COVID-19 lockdowns in India (24th March to 18th May, 2020) while comparing with the normal days. This study attempted to highlight the variation in river's water quality in terms of spatio temporal turbidity. This study is based on the analysis of remote sensing. Red band known as the most sensitive to estimate turbidity. The temporal variation in turbidity was also investigated through linear regression model using Sentinel-2A, B optical satellite data. It was observed that before lockdown period as on 3rd March 2020, mean turbidity was estimated as 13.47 FTU (Formazine Turbidity Unit) and during as on 2nd April 2020, estimated as 11.74 FTU. Further, on 17th April 2020, it was increased with 0.25 and estimated as 11.99 FTU. Hence, it can be concluded that due to less anthropogenic activity led by the lockdown imposed in the country, water quality of the river is improving continuously. The study also exhibited the relevancy of remote sensing approach to make qualitative estimates on turbidity, when there are no field observations.

AB  - This research focused on the geospatial method application called Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) using Sentinel 1-A satellite images to determine the sinking incidence in the San Luis Potosi - Soledad de Graciano Sanchez conurbation area. In this study was carried out the processing and comparison of the sinking values resulting from the period 2014 to 2019, where the procedures showed that the sinking incidence that occurred in some areas of San Luis Potosi Valley was 13.4 cm, which means that a sinking of approximately 2.6 cm would be generated per year in the specific areas determined, as well as, with the results of the InSAR method was made a profiles graphic of the 5 years analyzed, with the aim of observing the behavior of soil sinking in the area studied. Likewise, 72 GNSS vertices were interpolated, which served to know the ground elevations in 2014, in order to correlate their differences according to the results of the interferometry process in the images using SNAP software.

CP  - 3rd International Conference on Environmental Resources Management in Global Region (ICERM)
CL  - Univ Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - The San Luis Potosi Valley is a basin situated in the municipalities of San Luis Potosi and Soledad de Graciano Sanchez belonging to the San Luis Potosi State and which make up the metropolitan area. This state is located in the north-central zone of Mexico; it has a territorial extension of 64,165 m2 that represents 3.12% of the national territory. It is bounded to the north by the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas; to the south by Guanajuato, Queretaro and Hidalgo; to the east by Veracruz and to the west by Zacatecas and Jalisco. The analysis of the radiation capture phenomenon was carried out in the San Luis Potosi Metropolitan Area (ZMSLP). The study area is located between latitudes 22 degrees 20' 00" and 22 degrees 02' 00" north and longitudes 101 degrees 12' 00" and 100 degrees 44' 00" west. Net radiation is the phenomenon in which radiation fluxes interact between atmosphere and the earth's surface. This phenomenon leads to processes such as evapotranspiration and photosynthesis. The net radiation analysis can be performed by three methods: (a) by using radiation monitoring stations, (b) by statistical models using data from meteorological stations such as temperature and relative humidity, and (c) by using satellite imagery. Since satellite images offer the possibility of analyzing large tracts of land, this method has been chosen to carry out the study using two images per year, one for the dry season and one for the rainy season between 1990 and 2017. The results show a considerable reduction in net radiation between the study periods, possibly due to the metropolitan area growth that impacts on the environment and therefore to the processes mentioned above.

TI  - The History of Japanese Buddhism in <i>Konjaku monogatari-shu</i>. Part I: School Founders and Temple Builders
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - Konjaku monogatari-shu, compiled in Japan in 1120s, is a compendium of setsuwa tales where historicism is not less important than Buddhist basis of each story and of the whole text. In the text the Buddhist woridview can be seen through the geographical and temporal perspectives, and all the three are inseparably joined together. Occurences of ancient times are located in India, those happened a long time ago but not so long since, take place in China, and stories of the epoch closer to the lifetime of the compilers are located in Japan. The narrative of Konjaku shows how strong the bonds between our actions and their consequences are. The tales present the life in our samsara world as full of suffering and show to the readers the possible way to the salvation. The view of the historian here is also important because it helps people to look at the disordered mess of the events as at some lined progression. The first part of the article contains analysis of the tales of the volume 11 of Konjaku. It is shown, how the compilers, guided by the principles outlined above bring together the tales making the whole structured and unified text. Volume 11 comprises stories related to the beginning of the Buddhist tradition in Japan. The first tale here, about Shotoku-taishi, can be seen as the model for all the rest of the tales. Eminent monks, founders of various Buddhist lineages in Japan (tales from 1 to 12) acquaint Japan with Buddhist world. They make ties simultaneously geographical (going to China), temporal (with the lifetime of Buddha Shakyamuni) and substantial (teach the Buddhdharma). The investigation of the tales 13-38 of the volume, about the foundation of the most known temples of Japan, shows that they are elaborated in the same paradigm. The translation of tale 11-15, about the construction of Gangoji temple, closes the first part of the article.

AB  - In this work, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network architecture for increasing the low spatial resolution SMAP radiometer based soil moisture estimations from 36 km to 3 km resolution by using time-series of observations from both SMAP's radiometer and Sentinel-1 radar. By simultaneously extracting features from both current low-resolution input and residuals between high and low resolution at previous time instances, the proposed network is capable of accurately estimating soil moisture using coarse resolution observations. Experimental results on three different locations demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to estimate soil moisture with accuracy in the range of the requirements set by the SMAP science team.

The thoughts of Seneca (junior) that the height of human happiness does not lie in material wealth, but in living in accordance with the laws of nature, found their continuation in the oeuvre of Marcus Aurelius, who believed that all art, the best examples of human creativity were, in essence, a reflection of the true nature of things, imitating nature, as much as possible in accordance with its laws. Based on this idea, the outstanding English scientist and politician F. Bacon described it as a rule that should be guided in practical, political activity. The article reveals the rational and instrumental meaning of this rule and its relevance/

TI  - The Anthropomorphic Qualities of Technology in the Postmodern and Post-Postmodern Culture
T2  - PROBLEMY MUZYKALNOI NAUKI-MUSIC SCHOLARSHIP
M3  - Article
AB  - The issue of human beings' interaction with technology has acquired a special topicality. There has emerged a philosophy of technology aimed at researching the anthropological social dimension. The anthropological approach towards understanding technology is based on the human being himself determining his own existence and creating objective reality, while being a subject.The author of the article examines two trends within the anthropological approach: the solution of the problem of human beings' connection with technology in the philosophy of postmodernism and within the conception of transhumanism. In the transhuman conception, the "anthropomorphic qualities of technology" presented a worldview principle of mastery of the technocratic principle in postmodern and post-postmodern eras (the culture of the future). The "anthropomorphic qualities of technology" signifies the character of technologies preserving the algorithm of human behavior and not transforming the human being into a subservient entity in regards to technology. The presented critique of transhumanism makes it possible to disclose its anti-humane character. The present conception, which shows a predominance of the technical-technological side of human development, presents a threat to humanity in the post-postmodern era.By expounding these two trends, it is demonstrated that on the threshold of the advent of the post-postmodern era it becomes necessary to perceive the phenomenon of technical reality on the basis of an anthropological approach.

TI  - Impact of logging operations on forest ecosystem in the Khantai mountain region and forest cover mapping
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests in Mongolia yield low productivity and are vulnerable to disturbances from drought, fire, pests, and illegal logging. Such forests can quickly lose their ecological balance. Logging activities in these areas are limited in monitoring and controls. This study assesses two different logging operations for their natural regeneration capacity by comparing the composition of the soil, soil organisms, physical and chemical properties, and forest cover change after the completion of logging operations. The logging operations were analyzed in two different regions, the Khartsai and Tariakhtai threshold in Selenge soum, Bulgan province. A skyline logging operation was undertaken on Khartsai threshold in 1983 and a tractor logging operation (clear-cutting) on Tariakhtai threshold in 1987. After the completion of the logging, the forests were naturally regenerated. In 2002, soil samples were collected and soil organisms and physical and chemical properties were examined. Satellites images were also used to evaluate forest cover changes after the end of the logging operations. Significant differences in the naturally regenerated tree species in the skyline logging, tractor logging, and natural forest areas were observed. Average tree ring growth was 0.9mm in the skyline logging site, 0.6mm in the tractor logging site, and 1.2mm in the natural forest. Based on forest cover changes observed in satellite images, the density of naturally regenerated tree species in the natural forest area was higher than that in the skyline logging area. In contrast, the latter recorded a higher density than that in the tractor logging area. Therefore, processing of satellite images of forest cover changes with high-resolution data provides valuable information for the local forest community and helps decision-makers in their further actions.

TI  - NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS AND MICRONUTRIENTS DEFICIENCY PREVALENCE IN GEORGIA.
T2  - Georgian medical news
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Until 2015, systematic statistical data on micronutrient deficiency was not available in Georgia, to provide developing national strategy. In the same year, the National Centre for Disease Control and Public Health of Georgia (NCDC) in collaboration with the USA CDC launched the project "Strengthening surveillance of micronutrient deficiency in Georgia". In 2015 we did choose sentinel surveillance approach. For setting nutrition surveillance system 8 sentinel sites (2 sites in each region/children and pregnant health facilities) in four regions of Georgia (Tbilisi, Kakheti, Achara, and Samegrelo) were selected, using the criteria of geographical, social, ethnical, urban/rural, and religion. Also, existing information about malnutrition and dietary habits from the above mentioned regions. The project protocols was approved by the Institutional review board (IRB) at the NCDC and by the Research Review Committee and Ethical review committee of the US CDC. As a result of surveillance system functioning (2016-2019) we reviled that, about 36% out of 1021 studied children U2 (12-23 months) were anemic, 74% of them were identified as iron deficient. Hemoglobin was tested among 963 pregnant women and about 21% of them were found anemic, 57% were iron deficient, and 28% tested positive for folate deficiency. Neural tube defects (NTDs) prevalence per 1000 live births registered in sentinel sites was high 3.7. Our results show that anemia and iron deficiency are prevalent among both pregnant women and children of the specified age group in Georgia. Additionally, folate deficiency was quite common during the1st trimester of pregnancy. Our findings will inform public health policy decision makers to take relevant decisions on required interventions, such as health education, distribution of relevant supplements, and food fortification.

T2  - AB IMPERIO-STUDIES OF NEW IMPERIAL HISTORY AND NATIONALISM IN THE POST-SOVIET SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - For many years, Belarus was used by scholars as an example of impotent post-Soviet transition, unable to acquire a new social vision and subjectivity. Mark Cinkevich argues that the Belarusian civil protest movement that arose in the wake of the rigged presidential election in August 2020 has revealed a dramatic sea change in the Belarusian society that seems to have acquired and recognized a distinctive historical and political subjectivity. Cinkevich explains this profound transformation by the fact that Belarusian society has embraced rather than rejected the Soviet discourse. President Lukashenka's reactionary neo-Sovietism has played a joke on him by gradually changing the positionality of Belarusians vis-a-vis the Soviet legacy. Eventually, Belarus society assumed a hegemonic role over the production and application of the Soviet discourse and full control over its meanings. The next urgent task according to Cinkevich is to articulate a new worldview based on the recently acquired historical subjectivity, including a critical reassessment of the Soviet past by its self-conscious heirs.

AB  - The use of open satellite data has become a valuable tool for monitoring the urban environment due to high temporal, spectral and spatial resolution. Planners and stakeholders can rely on these data since they offer an alternative point of view of a very complex urban scenery. The processing of satellite images with the combined use of different types of data (statistical, in situ etc) can extract information for the present situation, in urban and suburban areas. This study use image data from the Sentinel satellite mission, in order to extract urban land cover characteristics in Thessaloniki city. The Sentinel mission started the image acquisition on 2014. The data set are freely available for downloading. The use of high resolution satellite images (e.g IKONOS) in urban studies, has been proved very useful all these years. On the other hand the use of a medium size spatial resolution satellite, as Sentinel-2, with 10m pixel size, is a very promising optical earth-observation satellite, which is tested in this study. Image processing techniques used to produce classified map of urban characteristics and land cover classes (built up areas, vegetation etc). The contribution of a radar image of Sentinel-1, in the classification process, is also tested. All the above processing is done with an automatic procedure, giving additional value to the proposed methodology. The final classified map will give planners a management tool for decision-making concerning the sustainable urban development and will be the basis for implementing hydrology studies, planning, land use change detection and other.

AB  - Bilateral ectopic axillary breast carcinoma is extremely rare. Here, we report the case of a 68-year-old woman who presented with a palpable mass in the right axilla. After ectopic breast carcinoma diagnosis, the patient underwent partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, followed by radiotherapy of the whole breast. Adjuvant endocrine therapy was administered for 5 years. Seven years after the first carcinoma diagnosis, the patient noticed a second tumor in the left axilla by herself at the age of 75 years. Core needle biopsy revealed second primary breast carcinoma of the axilla. She underwent partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and endocrine therapy. No recurrence has been observed so far. Therefore, ectopic breast carcinoma should be treated as typical breast carcinoma.

AB  - Errors in land cover classification are often spatially heterogeneous even though a soft classification model such as spectral unmixing is implemented to mitigate a mixed pixel problem. The estimated land covers are fractions of targeted classes with the restriction of the sum to one and being non-negative. To assess the classification with considering a spatial heterogeneity, we propose a geographically weighted total composite error analysis. By using the USGS global reference database, we assessed errors of spectral unmixing classification of ALOS AVNIR-2 data into 4 land cover classes. Results yield a spatial surface of local errors by the Aitchison distance and address that the error magnitude across space is associated with the complexity of land covers.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article considers the oral stories as a part of the ethno-cultural component of the Buryat folklore. Also, the ethno-cultural constituents are revealed in their composition. Based on the analysis of the oral prose of the local ethnic group of the Buryats recorded during the expedition to the Evenki Khoshun of Inner Mongolia of the PRC, the historical and ethnographic data, traditional folk worldview and religious ideas, ritual elements were described.The fictional prose of the Chinese Buryats contains historical information from the participants of the past events about the development of new lands by the settlers, among which the issues of survival and self-preservation were important. After cleaning up and tidying up the abandoned territory and some settler activities, independent work began to organize healthcare and educational process for children. It is concluded that during the initial period of social adaptation of migrants, there is an attempt to isolate themselves in a certain way in relation to the title nation of the host country, neighboring ethnicities and peoples. Their everyday life is characterized by closeness, minimal openness to the host society, and lack of integration into the overall Chinese economic development process on a large scale. At the same time, good relations are maintained with the Russian population living next door, as the Buryats consider themselves and the Russians living in China to be children of the same cradle Russia.In the oral tales of the Chinese Buryats, the presence of the Buddhist ethno-cultural component generally determines their religious consciousness. At the same time, one can trace pre-Buddhist relics, shamanistic components of this consciousness related to the worship of the sky, fire, water, and sun. The funeral rite and obit are dominated only by Tibetan-Buddhist rituals and actions. It was concluded that in the oral prose of the Chinese Buryats, syncretism of the two beginnings in their cult notions is observed: the prevailing adherence to the Buddhist faith and the preservation of elements of ancient mythological views.

AB  - The spatiotemporal variability of chlorophyll concentrations on the North-Western Shelf (NWS) of the Black Sea was studied. The monthly average chlorophyll data of the CMEMS for 2007-2017 are analyzed with a spatial resolution of 1 km. As a result, a breakdown scheme for 4 regions is proposed and the cross-correlation coefficients of chlorophyll concentrations are estimated for each pair of neighboring regions by the moving correlation method. The wind field repeatability was analyzed using the six-hour ERA-Interim reanalysis surface wind data for the periods which were identified by the maximum values of the correlation coefficients. It is supposed that the duration and frequency of the plume or riverine waters transport events between defined regions has significant impact on the chlorophyll variability on the NWS shelf. It is proposed to classify the wind types related with maxima of cross-correlation coefficients between established four regions. The results are discussed and compared with recent achievements about the spatial variability and cross-frontal exchange of chlorophyll on the North-Western Shelf of the Black Sea.

TI  - Improved Mapping Results of 10 m Resolution Land Cover Classification in Guangdong, China Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data With Google Earth Engine
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover information depicting the complex interactions between human activities and surface change is critically essential for nature conservation, social management, and sustainable development. Recent advances have shown great potentials of remote sensing data in generating high-resolution land cover maps, but it remains unclear how different models, data sources, and inclusive features affect the classification results, which hinders its applications in regional studies requiring more accurate land cover data. Informing these issues, here we developed a robust framework to improve the mapping results of 10 m resolution land cover classification in Guangdong Province, China using thousands of manually collected samples, multisource remote sensing data (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Luojia-1), machine learning algorithms, and a free cloud-based platform of Google Earth Engine. Results showed that an overall accuracy of 86.12% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.84 could be achieved for land cover classification in Guangdong for 2019. We found that random forest models achieved better performance than classification and regression trees, minimum distance, and support vector machine models. We also found that features derived from Sentinel-1 data and Sentinel-2 spectral indices greatly contributed to the classification process, while the feature of Luojia-1 data was not as much important as other configurations. A comparison between our results and several existing land cover products in terms of classification accuracy and visual interpretation further validated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our experiments and findings not only systematically elucidate the role of classification methods and data sources in deriving more accurate and reliable land cover maps but also provide certain guidelines for future land cover mapping from regional to global scales.

T2  - ERDE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Junggar Basin investigated in this study has seen significant land cover and climate change. However, the spatiotemporal relationship between net primary productivity (NPP) and environmental factors remain unclear. Thus, we applied trend analysis and correlation methods to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of NPP and its relationship with driving factors using remotely sensed data and measured climate data from 2000 to 2015. During the study period, high values of NPP mainly occurred in the forests of the mid-elevation mountain areas. The NPP values showed an increasing trend in the different vegetation types, most likely due to climate change in combination with other factors. The annual trend of NPP in the study area varied in the range from -12.4 to 11.3 gCm(-2) a(-2). The desert area exhibited no significant trends, but most of the mountain areas showed a significantly increasing trend. NPP was significantly correlated with temperature and precipitation. The dominant factor affecting NPP was temperature, mainly in the Ili river watershed and the Tien Shan mountain range. However, human activity and land cover changes were also important factors affecting the fluctuations in NPP. The results of this study highlight the need for appropriate land-use strategies for managing vegetation resources in arid land ecosystems.

In this paper, we have established a classification model using deep convolutional neural networks that can reliably identify the corresponded objects. The explanation of the traditional convolutional neural network and the training process of the proposed convolutional neural network model are presented. The evaluation performances of the proposed model are conducted on the UC Merced Land Use dataset. The proposed model performs high classification accuracy in smallest times without high computation performance.

TI  - Comparison of photogrammetric canopy models from archived and made-to-order aerial imagery in forest inventory
T2  - SILVA FENNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing-based forest inventories 3D point cloud data, such as acquired from airborne laser scanning, are well suited for estimating the volume of growing stock and stand height, but tree species recognition often requires additional optical imagery. A combination of 3D data and optical imagery can be acquired based on aerial imaging only, by using stereo photogrammetric 3D canopy modeling. The use of aerial imagery is well suited for large-area forest inventories, due to low costs, good area coverage and temporally rapid cycle of data acquisition. Stereo-photogrammetric canopy modeling can also be applied to previously acquired imagery, such as for aerial ortho-mosaic production, assuming that the imagery has sufficient stereo overlap. In this study we compared two stereo-photogrammetric canopy models combined with contemporary satellite imagery in forest inventory. One canopy model was based on standard archived imagery acquired primarily for ortho-mosaic production, and another was based on aerial imagery whose acquisition parameters were better oriented for stereo-photogrammetric canopy modeling, including higher imaging resolution and greater stereo-coverage. Aerial and satellite data were tested in the estimation of growing stock volume, volumes of main tree species, basal area and diameter and height. Despite the better quality of the latter canopy model, the difference of the accuracy of the forest estimates based on the two different data sets was relatively small for most variables (differences in RMSEs were 0-20%, depending on variable). However, the estimates based on stereo-photogrammetrically oriented aerial data retained better the original variation of the forest variables present in the study area.

T2  - BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In this study, the aim was to evaluate the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on quality of life in postmastectomy lymphedema (PML) patients. Methods: Twenty-four female patients diagnosed with PML were included in the study. Demographic features, disease and lymphedema duration, cancer type, cancer stage, operation type, radiotherapy and chemotherapy history, lymphedematous and dominant extremity, and body mass index (BMI) were recorded. LLLT was applied to the affected limb as 904 nm, 1.5 Joule/cm(2), three days a week for a total of 8 weeks. Quality of life assessment, lymphedema severity, and lymphedema staging was performed to measure effectiveness before and after treatment. Patients with lymphedema not associated with breast cancer and/or primary lymphedema, ongoing radiotherapy, metastatic high-grade breast cancer, acute infection, and deep vein thrombosis were excluded from the study. Results: Modified radical mastectomy was reported in 18 patients; total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were reported in 6 patients. Of the patients, 45.8% were stage 3, and 54.2% were stage 2. Of the patients, 95.8% had a history of chemotherapy and 83% of radiotherapy after surgery. In this study, following LLLT, improvement of lymphedema stage and severity were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). In the evaluation of lymphedema quality of life, there was a statistically significant improvement in parameters including function, appearance, clinical symptoms, and overall quality of life (p < 0.05). However, no improvement was observed in the emotional state parameter (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Thus, LLLT is a safe treatment method that increases the quality of life in breast cancer-related lymphedema patients.

TI  - Land use/land cover assessment as related to soil and irrigation water salinity over an oasis in arid environment
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The land use and land cover (LULC) changes and the implications of soil and irrigation water salinity have adverse effects on crop production and the ecosystems of arid and semiarid regions. In this study, an attempt has been made to analyze and monitor the LULC changes using multitemporal Landsat data for years 1986, 1998, 2007, and 2016 in Al-Ahsa Oasis, Saudi Arabia. In addition, efforts were made to measure the spatial distribution of soil and irrigation water salinity along the oasis. The supervised maximum likelihood classification method was applied to classify the individual images independently. Moreover, soil samples were collected at surface soil depth from the selected LULC types, namely, date palm, croplands, and bare land. Also, groundwater samples were collected from bore wells located in agricultural farms. The spatial distribution of the soil salinity (Ec(e)) and irrigation water salinity (ECiw) was classified based on the Food and Agriculture Organization guidelines. The results showed that significant changes in LULC patterns have occurred during 1986-2016 in the study area. The ECe was found higher in date palm compared with cropland and bare land. However, the spatial distribution of the ECiw over the oasis indicated that 94% of irrigation water ranged between moderate and severe salinity risk. The study concludes that salinity management practices need to be developed in the study area aiming to sustain crop yields, improve soil properties, and minimize the environmental impacts of LULC changes on the ecosystem of Al-Ahsa Oasis.

TI  - Impact Quantification of Decentralization in Urban Growth by Extracting Impervious Surfaces Using ISEI in Model Maker
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Decentralization problems in Africa have caused some infrastructure disparity between country capitals and distant districts. In Ghana, less public investment has created a gap between implementation results and theoretical benefits. Spectral indices are a good approach to extracting impervious surfaces, which is a good method of measuring urbanization. These are restricted by complexity, sensor limitation, threshold values, and high computational time. In this study, we measure the urbanization dynamics of Wa District in Ghana by applying a proposed method of impervious surface extraction index (ISEI), to evaluate the decentralization policy using Landsat images from 1984-2018 and a single S2A data. Comparing our proposed method with five other existing indexes, ISEI provided good discriminated results between target feature and background, with pixel values ranging between 0 and +1. Other indexes produced negative values. ISEI accuracy varied from 84.62-94.00% while existing indexes varied from 73.85-90.00%. Our results also showed increased impervious surface areas of 83.26 km(2), which is about 7.72% of total area while the average annual urban growth was recorded as 4.42%. These figures proved that the quantification of decentralization is very positive. The study provides a foundation for urban environment research in the context of decentralization policy.

AB  - This treatise focuses on the encounter of Kant with India. Although Kant never wrote about Indian philosophy extensively, we can discuss Kantian and Indian philosophies via Schopenhauer, whose ideas integrate Kant’s transcendental idealism with Vedanta’s doctrines. Schopenhauer’s concept of representation (phenomenon) connects the Kantian concept of phenomena with the Indian doctrine of maya; the former presupposes the modern, western scientific worldview, governed by Newtonian mechanics, while the empirical world as maya is concerned with the problem of desire standing in the way of mokṣa. Vedic thought represented by Upaniṣad gives the teaching that it is the “higher knowledge” to sublate our empirical self―our corporal (mortal) self, thereby intuiting the oneness of Brahman and our noumenal self―our immortal Atman, which is, ontologically speaking, the ‘union with the Absolute/God’. Radakrishnan describes such knowledge as “mystical intuition”; however, Kant defines the “union with God” as being no better than utterly irrational fantasy. The genealogy of Kant-Schopenhauer as transcendental idealism is a critical philosophy adhering to the thing-in-itself as “Grenzbegriff.” Perceived by that critical philosophy, the immediate knowledge of the Absolute, Brahman―Vedanta’s fundamental doctrine―is a confusion of being and thought, and a product of “dialectic reason.” For Kant, the Absolute/God is merely the object of postulate, not that for union or intuition. In his philosophy, Schopenhauer considers Upaniṣad as evidence of the soteriological theme of the denial of the will, but Upanishadic teachings conflict with Kantian transcendental philosophy―the fundamental framework of his doctrine. Although Schopenhauer drew from both Kant and Upanishadic monks for his philosophy, Kant’s meeting with India necessarily ended up being an awkward one.

TI  - Airway brush cells generate cysteinyl leukotrienes through the ATP sensor P2Y2
T2  - SCIENCE IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chemosensory epithelial cells (EpCs) are specialized cells that promote innate type 2 immunity and protective neurally mediated reflexes in the airway. Their effector programs and modes of activation are not fully understood. Here, we define the transcriptional signature of two choline acetyltransferase-expressing nasal EpC populations. They are found in the respiratory and olfactory mucosa and express key chemosensory cell genes including the transcription factor Pou2f3, the cation channel Trpm5, and the cytokine II25. Moreover, these cells share a core transcriptional signature with chemosensory cells from intestine, trachea and thymus, and cluster with tracheal brush cells (BrCs) independently from other respiratory EpCs, indicating that they are part of the brush/tuft cell family. Both nasal BrC subsets express high levels of transcripts encoding cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) biosynthetic enzymes. In response to ionophore, unfractionated nasal BrCs generate CysLTs at levels exceeding that of the adjacent hematopoietic cells isolated from naive mucosa. Among activating receptors, BrCs express the purinergic receptor P2Y2. Accordingly, the epithelial stress signal ATP and aeroallergens that elicit ATP release trigger BrC CysLT generation, which is mediated by the P2Y2 receptor. ATP- and aeroallergen-elicited CysLT generation in the nasal lavage is reduced in mice lacking Pou2f3, a requisite transcription factor for BrC development. Last, aeroallergen-induced airway eosinophilia is reduced in BrC-deficient mice. These results identify a previously undescribed BrC sensor and effector pathway leading to generation of lipid mediators in response to luminal signals. Further, they suggest that BrC sensing of local damage may provide an important sentinel immune function.

TI  - Fishery in the Folklore Traditions of the Kalmyks and Peoples of Southern Siberia
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Kalmyk folklore narratives contain traces of fishery practices, which attests to the fact that the people had been familiar with them since ancient times. The archaic codes mirroring historical worldview concepts of the Oirats, the Kalmyks' ancestors, represent both local and cross-cultural ties within the cross-border regions. The Jangar epic and Kalmyk myths managed to preserve such concepts as 'fish' and 'water' and manifest the national worldview since the era when the ethnos had been clustered with the 'forest peoples'. The paper analyzes a number of mid-to-late 19th-century fairy tale texts recorded from the Astrakhan and Don Kalmyks to have inhabited the Volga and Don valleys respectively. Some of the texts depict the Kalmyk fishery practices in such detail which seeds the idea that the anonymous taleteller could have been a professional fisherman, the latter being evident from most delicate figurative phrases within the fairy-tale framework. The fairy-tale narrative describes the Kalmyk fishery realia through the names of fish species, fishing gear and techniques, specific lexemes (shallow water', low tide', 'squid', etc.), food preferences of certain Kalmyk sub-ethnic groups. The Kalmyks have retained fishery rites in the forms of spells, magic formulas, beliefs and superstitious signs. A vivid example is the offering to the 'king of waters' once administered by the Volga and Caspian Kalmyks. The Kalmyk folklore contains direct and indirect evidence of fishery practices that in course of time would serve either as a key source of livelihood or an auxiliary one.

TI  - Chebyshev Multifractal Signatures and Their Use in Multifractal Interpretation of SAR Images of Ice-Covered Sea Areas
T2  - TWELFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE VISION (ICMV 2019)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 12th International Conference on Machine Vision (ICMV)
CL  - Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS
AB  - Chebyshev multifractal signatures for characterization of a multifractal nature of image textures for natural systems are proposed. These signatures can be obtained by generalized multifractal analysis (GMA) using Chebyshev polynomial (CP) kernels and can be considered as alternatives to traditional multifractal spectra. The paper also presents properties of introduced multifractal signatures: in particular, it is shown that Chebyshev multifractal signatures, similar to traditional multifractal spectra, are invariant to image scaling. To illustrate recognition possibilities of multifractal signatures, the application of the signatures for multifractal interpretation of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images of ice-covered sea areas are shown. It is established that using parameters of multifractal signature approximations calculated by Sentinel-1 SAR image regions, we can separate sea areas with very close ice, close ice and very open ice. The obtained results allow to say that it is possible to use the introduced multifractal signatures at the preliminary stage of object-oriented classification of SAR or other images to assess a textural separability of image objects.

TI  - Hydrological Control of Vegetation Greenness Dynamics in Africa: A Multivariate Analysis Using Satellite Observed Soil Moisture, Terrestrial Water Storage and Precipitation
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation activity in many parts of Africa is constrained by dynamics in the hydrologic cycle. Using satellite products, the relative importance of soil moisture, rainfall, and terrestrial water storage (TWS) on vegetation greenness seasonality and anomaly over Africa were assessed for the period between 2003 and 2015. The possible delayed response of vegetation to water availability was considered by including 0-6 and 12 months of the hydrological variables lagged in time prior to the vegetation greenness observations. Except in the drylands, the relationship between vegetation greenness seasonality and the hydrological measures was generally strong across Africa. Contrarily, anomalies in vegetation greenness were generally less coupled to anomalies in water availability, except in some parts of eastern and southern Africa where a moderate relationship was evident. Soil moisture was the most important variable driving vegetation greenness in more than 50% of the areas studied, followed by rainfall when seasonality was considered, and by TWS when the monthly anomalies were used. Soil moisture and TWS were generally concurrent or lagged vegetation by 1 month, whereas precipitation lagged vegetation by 1-2 months. Overall, the results underscore the pre-eminence of soil moisture as an indicator of vegetation greenness among satellite measured hydrological variables.

AB  - The study approached the problem by viewing Seo Kyung-duk's view of the I Ching world as being focused on 廣業 and 器 among I Ching's 崇德廣業 and 道器合一的 聖人觀. In addition, he did not see I Ching as being Doctrinaire, but rather as a tool for world analysis, and conducted the research on the premise that his philosophy and worldview were derived through it.As a result, I Ching found that he used 至 and 止 as dissipation of his philosophical concepts and focused on 工夫 for their practice. In addition, he said that his studies do not just remain in the academic category, but actively deal with the people's livelihood and economic situation by participating in real-life issues. This resulted in the infiltration and popularization of Neo-Confucianism. He revealed that playing an important role in the process lies in the open attitude of his studies and the acceptance of writers who do not have any status. Finally, we looked at his philosophical values and status based on his later assessment of how these academic attitudes and results were drawn in the private sector.

AB  - The article aims to describe the verbal representation of the time category as exemplified by languages with different structures. The authors consider semantic features of temporal vocabulary, namely, the semantics and functioning of temporal verbs, adjectives and adverbs in English, French and Russian from the viewpoint of cognitive linguistics. The article presents the possible themed classification of these lexical units. The authors conduct their comparative analysis, highlight issues of their semantization and metaphorization, as well as analyze their roles and functions in the formation of the speaker's worldview. While considering methods of verbalizing universal categories of human life, the authors outline prospects for determining the dominant national parameters of communication.

AB  - Atmospheric correction is essential in satellite data processing to reduce atmospheric and lighting effects by studying the physical parameter of the earth's surface. In this study, ATCOR and 6S algorithms were evaluated for Sentinel-2 over paddy field area. In this evaluation, level-1C Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Sentinel-2 image was used as an input data. The spectral pattern analysis of the results was used to assess the reliability of the methods. As a result, the both methods produced the correct spectral patterns. Moreover, the results showed that the longer the wavelength the less the improvement values. It starts from the blue band, 43,2% for the fallow phase and 60% for the vegetative phase of BOA corrected image. In the other hand, the NDVI values of fallow and vegetative phases that derived from the two methods are not greatly different.

AB  - In context of Bonn Challenge commitment, Pakistan has implemented Billion Tree Afforestation Project (BTAP), the initiative of forest restoration and afforestation. The current research was a pilot one which evaluated the success of plantation and assessed growth performance and survival rate. A total of 115 sample plots (0.07 ha size) were laid out in 17 randomly selected sites extended over 1982 ha. Further, Sentinel-2 images were used to derive vegetation indices and regressed indices values with volume and survival percentage. Results showed that all plantation sites showed good performance in terms of survival rate (above 80%). Highest growth performance was exhibited by Eucalyptus camaldulensis which mean height was1.297 (m) and the lowest was of Deodar 0.35 (m). Among Sentinel-2 indices, Transformed Normalized Vegetation Index (TNDVI) has the highest value of R-2 of 0.425 whereas in case of survival percentage, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has the highest value of R-2 of 0.859. Stepwise regression model showed that relationship between NDVI and volume was strongly significant compared to other indices. NDVI differencing of Landsat-8 2013 image and Sentinel-2 2018 image showed that in NDVI range were increased from 0.68 to 0.85, thus showed mosaic restoration and afforestation activities of BTAP.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Bayesian non-parametric mixture models have found great success in the statistical practice of identifying latent clusters in data. However, fitting such models can be computationally intensive and of less practical use when it comes to tall datasets, such as Landsat imagery. To overcome this issue, we propose to obtain multiple samples from data using stratified random sampling to enforce adequate representation in each sample from sub-populations that may exist in data. The non-parametric model is then fitted to each sample dataset independently to obtain posterior estimates. Label correspondence across multiple estimates is achieved using multivariate component densities of a chosen reference partition followed by pooling multiple posterior estimates to form a consensus posterior inference. The labels for pixels in the entire image are inferred using the conditional posterior distribution given pooled estimates, thereby substantially reducing the computational time and memory requirement.The method is tested on Landsat images from the Brisbane region in Australia, which were compiled as a part of the national program for the eradication of the imported red fire-ant that was launched in September 2001 and which continues to the present date. The aim is to estimate the risk of fire-ant incursion in each of the identified geographical cluster so that the eradication program focuses on high risk areas.

AB  - The occurrence of severe thunderstorms and lightning strikes has affected people all over the world. These lightning strikes have a great energy which can lead to severe affects on humans, crops and animals. Kerala is one of the lightning prone areas in the country, especially during pre-monsoon season. In this paper, we have tried to analyze the lightning flashes for every season using LIS TRMM satellite data (1995-2014). Later, we have calculated rainfall days for all seasons using GPCC precipitation dataset (1995-2014). The lightning flashes are more in pre-monsoon season than other seasons which can be clearly observed. Kottayam has the highest mean lightning flashes out of other districts. In pre-monsoon, there was a 75% correlation between rainy days and lightning flashes. In recent years, the occurrence of lightning flashes and the deaths related to it have increased significantly. This study helps us to understand the climatological lightning flashes over every district in Kerala for all seasons and the deaths related to it.

These convective systems and lightning flashes possess great hidden energy to produce serious damages to human lives and property. Srilanka region is affected every year to these types of severe convective systems during the hot period of pre-monsoon season. In this paper, we have tried to analyze the lightning flashes using LIS TRMM satellite data (1995-2014). Later, we tried to analyze the rainfall amounts using GPCC satellite data (1995-2014). We have calculated stability parameters such as Humidity Index (HI), K Index (KI) and Total Totals Index (TTI). These parameters help us to understand the lightning flashes and convection over study region using ERA-Interim ECMWF satellite data (1995-2014).

AB  - Lightning related disasters are considered to be global phenomena, as they may occur at any place, at any instant in the world. These lightning flashes possess great potentiality to produce serious damages to human lives and property. Bangladesh region is vulnerable to severe convective systems during the hot period of pre-monsoon season. In this paper, we tried to analyze the lightning flashes using LIS TRMM satellite data (1995-2014). Later, we calculated stability parameters such as Lifted Index(LI), K Index (KI) and Total Totals Index (TTI), Total Perceptible Water (TPW) and Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) associated with lightning flashes over study region were investigated using ERA-Interim ECMWF satellite data (1995-2014). The threshold values of the indices we have taken for the study are satisfied with threshold values considered for the study.

TI  - Summary: A psychosocial evaluation about the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of the terror management theory
T2  - KLINIK PSIKIYATRI DERGISI-TURKISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, human beings were faced with a feeling of terror that they could not prevent, could not be protected, and were desperate. While trying to deal with the threat they faced, they resorted to many inappropriate ways. Some have tried to overprotect from viruses, while others have insisted on maintaining their normal routine and ignoring the threat. In the second stage of the pandemic, where the threat of death decreased, an increase in psychosocial problems began to be observed. This review is written to understand these dysfunctional behaviors according to Terror Management Theory. This theory provides insight into how human behavior is affected in terms of self-esteem and cultural worldview when mortality salience arises. According to this theory, people resort to conscious and unconscious proximal and distal defenses in the face of the mortality salience. While proximal defenses are irrational, rapid, and automatic mechanisms, distal defenses are efforts to defend the individual's cultural worldview and increase self-esteem.

TI  - Investigating urban heat island intensity in Istanbul
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the annual, monthly, and seasonal variations of urban heat island (UHI) intensity in Istanbul by using meteorological data measured for the period of 1960-2012 at six stations. The UHI on minimum temperature is found to be positive for all seasons, and the average UHI intensity clearly indicates seasonal changes, strongest in summer and weakest in winter. The results demonstrated increase of night time UHI intensity with 0.41-0.50 degrees C/decade and decrease of daytime UHI intensity with 0.13-0.18 degrees C/decade at the urban sites. The UHI strengthened with the expansion of the city due to increased population. The influences of meteorological variables on seasonality of the UHI intensity are examined for the days categorized depending on wind, cloud cover, and precipitation values. It is found that the UHI intensity decreases with increasing wind speed and cloud cover. The integrated response of the city atmosphere to wind speed changes differ such that daytime UHI in urban atmosphere intensifies rapidly from calm conditions to the wind speeds of 2-3 m/s, then slightly increases until 4-5-m/s wind speeds and starts to decline afterwards. On the other hand, the nighttime UHI intensities in urban sites continuously decline with the same rate until the wind speeds reach to 5-6 m/s. The difference of daytime UHI between rainy summer days and dry days is around 1 degrees C which is almost independent of the precipitation amount. Both nighttime and daytime UHI intensities depend on the season and site range approximately between 0.24 and 1.74 degrees C and - 0.62 and 2.61 degrees C, respectively. However, the UHI based on minimum temperature for the selected dry days with low wind and clear sky conditions increases to 1.70-3.08 degrees C. Land surface data from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra show areal extension of the UHI through the north along the Bosphorus between 2000 and 2012, especially in the night observations. The continuous increase of built-up areas, paved roads, and decrease of green areas caused the growth of UHI intensity. The estimated UHI based on land surface temperature (LST) at the most urbanized locations of Istanbul reach to 8 degrees C for daytime and 6 degrees C for nighttime.

AB  - Daily estimation of ground-level PM2.5 (mu g/m(3)) at high spatial resolution is a requisite for carrying out epidemiological studies with respect to air pollution. This can be made possible by exploiting the relationship between Aerosol Optical Depth and PM to provide high spatiotemporal predictions. We have used MODIS-derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) measurement for the Indian subcontinent region in Mixed-Effect Model (MEM) to calibrate the AOD-PM relationship. Ground-level PM2.5 pollution data averaged daily were collected from 34 monitoring stations spread across the country. The MEM considers a fixed and random component, where the random components model the daily variations of the PM2.5-AOD relationship and also derives site-specific adjustment parameters. Comparison between the observed and predicted concentrations of the PM2.5 levels at the monitoring stations show R-2 values ranging between 0.25 and 0.667 depending upon the effect of site bias on the PM2.5-AOD relationship.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The Second Generation Global Imager (SGLI) on Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (GCOM-C) satellite empowers surface and atmospheric measurements related to the carbon cycle and radiation budget, with two radiometers of Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer (SGLI-VNR) and Infrared Scanning Radiometer (SGLI-IRS) that perform a wide-band (380 nm-12 mu m) optical observation not only with as wide as a 1150-1400 km field of view (FOV), but also with as high as 0.25-0.5 km resolution. Additionally, polarization and along-track slant view observations are quite characteristic of SGLI. It is important to calibrate radiometers to provide the sensor data records for more than 28 standard products and 23 research products including clouds, aerosols, ocean color, vegetation, snow and ice, and other applications. In this paper, the radiometric model and the first results of on-board calibrations on the SGLI-VNR, which include weekly solar and light-emitting diode (LED) calibration and monthly lunar calibration, will be described. Each calibration data was obtained with corrections, where beta angle correction and avoidance of reflection from multilayer insulation (MLI) were applied for solar calibration; LED temperature correction was performed for LED calibration; and the GIRO (GSICS (Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System) Implementation of the ROLO (RObotic Lunar Observatory) model) model was used for lunar calibration. Results show that the inter-comparison of the relative degradation amount between these three calibrations agreed to within 1% or less.

AB  - Analysis of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from satellite imagery has become preferable by enhancement of its technology, reliable temporal and spatial resolution, computational power and extensive area of coverage. This paper presents the use of SAR data to map the extent of the inundated area of the river as the primary access way in Banyuasin Regency for water transportation. In this study, 1-year data set of Ground Range Detected (GRD) type radar data from Sentinel-1A's mission was used and analysed by using the Science Toolbox Exploitation Platform (SNAP) toolbox. Related factors on a diurnal tide of river water level and climate which controls the inundated area located mostly within lowland and the biannual season were taken into consideration in the selection of the data set. It is found that the extended inundated area of water body clearly detected. The enhanced polarisation index (VHdB*) which was developed have given a better insight for a response on the extent of inundated area and siltation caused by erosion and sedimentation.

T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXVI
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVI
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Processing of remote sensing data is often based on an assumption that noise parameters in component images are a priori known. If this assumption is not valid, it is desired to perform estimation of noise parameters directly from noisy image patches. In this paper, two estimators - model- and learning-based ones possessing the ability to evaluate noise standard deviation (SD) or variance and to predict estimation accuracy for each image patch are considered. The former approach is the representative of maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of parameters for anisotropic fractional Brownian motion (afBm) field whilst the learning-based one is the representative of convolutional neural networks (CNN) that employs training on real-life images. Our goal is to compare the performance for two cases: for pure afBm data and for real-life images. It is shown that the learning-based approach occurs to be less effective for pure afBm data since it produces a certain bias whilst the model-based approach runs into problems for complex image patches in real-life images. Based on this analysis, we propose to use synthetic afBm data as additional source of training data for learning-based methods of noise parameters estimation. By mixing real and synthetic data for training of the NoiseNet CNN, we were able to improve its performance in both domains. For afBm data, NoiseNet bias was significantly reduced and ability to predict noise SD estimates confidence improved. On NED2012 database of real images, the modified NoiseNet reduces signal-independent noise SD component estimation error by about 40% as compared to the original CNN version.

CL  - Florence, ITALY
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an all-weather imaging tool with several applications in the field of Earth observation. In recent years, novel SAR modes have been developed, where either the pulse repetition interval (PRI) or the transmitted waveform or phase is continuously varied, leading to smeared ambiguities. Ambiguities with the same total energy but different statistical distributions are likely to have different influences on the retrieval of information from SAR images. This paper analyzes the ambiguity statistics and addresses their impact on selected applications for conventional and novel SAR modes through simple models and simulations based on TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X data. The reported results show that an understanding of the ambiguity statistics and of the impact of their smearing on product performance is fundamental to select the SAR operation mode within the design of future SAR systems.

AB  - Global warming is the important issues because is caused by the concentration increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Mangrove ecosystem has a function to reduce climate change through carbon sequestration. Estimates of biomass can be done through an approach from the value of vegetation biomass. Allometric equations method is used for calculating biomass values. Remote sensing technology is used for mapping mangrove ecosystems to determine the spatial distribution of mangrove biomass that is WorldView-2 (WV-2) image. Transformation of the vegetation index are Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) are used to estimate of mangrove forest biomass. The aim of this study is to determine the most accurate vegetation index in estimating the mangrove above-ground biomass (AGB) value. The field biomass data was obtained from mangrove tree diameter at breast height (DBH) measurement. Using the allometric equation, the field AGB can be calculated. A regression analysis between field biomass and WV-2 image pixel value was performed to build regression function to estimate the mangrove AGB. The results of this study show that the SAVI provided higher accuracy for mangrove AGB estimation with R-2 of 0.4125 and resulting the AGB value between 1124.81 to 4499.25 kg/m.

AB  - Concept of sustainable development were introduced in 1987 by the world commission on environment and development, chaired by Gro Harlem Bruntland. Sustainable development is a development process that is principled to meet the needs of the present without compromising with the risk of fulfilment of the needs for future generations. Challenges that must be faced in order to achieve sustainable development is how to repair the environmental destruction without compromising the need for economic development and social justice. The 2005 World Summit outlined sustainable development consisting of three main pillars, includes economic, social and environmental interdependence and strengthening. Environmental aspects sometimes having problems either because they are directly caused by human error or mismanagement. Root cause analysis method is needed to find out the contributing factor of the problems. In this research, Why Tree method is used along with the RCA-Constructor software to investigate the root cause of geothermal power plant's environmental problems in Indonesia. This finding is expected to formulate appropriate and continuous improvement steps to prevent the similar events in the future.

TI  - The downed "wheel of life": an essay on Ouroboros
T2  - LOGOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The focus of this article is a symbolic image often found in world mythology - a giant snake or a dragon biting its own tail. This image is usually denoted by the Greek word "ouroboros" ((sic)), which means literally "eating its own tail." This essay is devoted to an interpretation of this symbol, which the author sees as leading to the much broader topic of human unfreedom and the forms that this unfreedom takes. The first section deals with the unique features of Gnosticism which have made it appealing in extremely varied times and situations. The author's reflections start from understanding the Gnostic worldview as an expression of apprehensiveness about the radical otherworldliness of the human spirit and its alienation from the universe. The second section deals with the symbolism of the ouroboros and its place in Gnostic conceptual schemes as a reference to the closed cycle of nature that enslaves the human spirit. The third section attempts to decipher layer by layer the Gnostic conceptions associated with the ouroboros. Various levels of interpretation are identified: literal, mythological-magical, psychological-ascetic and socio-political. In the fourth section, the author connects Gnostic ideas with Christianity by interpreting St. Paul's Epistles, particularly his ideas concerning rulers and authorities. The place occupied by the ouroboros in the Christian universe is analyzed. The last section relies on the ideas of Rene Girard, Jacques Lacan and Alain Badiou to illustrate the manifestations of the ouroboros in different dimensions of human existence, both individual and collective, with special emphasis on human desire and its futile circlings.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the utility of spectral remote sensing data gathered by a multispectral camera for estimating of vegetation cover in Antarctic vegetation oasis and Arcto-Alpine tundra. The surveys exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and multispectral camera were done in an Antarctic vegetation oasis located at the Northern shore of James Ross Island (Antarctica), and arcto-alpine tundra located in the Jeseniky Mts. (NE Czech Republic, 1 420 m a. s.l.). For the two locations, false colour images of spectral indices (VARI, NGRDI, GLI, RGBVI, ExG, NDVI, PRI) were taken and analysis of vegetation types and components of vegetation cover was done. Additionally, field research was performed by handheld instruments measuring NDVI, PRI and of selected vegetation components: Bryum pseudotriquetrum, Nostoc commune colonies (Antarctica), lichens grown on flat stones and boulders (the Jeseniky Mts.). The results show UAV photo surveys and imaging of spectral reflectance indices can be used to monitor vegetation types forming Antarctic vegetation oases and arcto-alpine tundra.

M3  - Article
AB  - Deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) layer is the concentrated patch of phytoplankton, which occurs as a layer at a depth extending few meters vertically and spanning many kilometers horizontally. These highly productive regions of the ocean are signatures of critical physical, chemical, and biological processes in the aquatic environment. This study reports and characterizes a DCM layer observed in the Bay of Bengal during three different cruises conducted in 2015, 2016, and 2018. The relationships of the defining parameters for the DCM like the depth and maximum chlorophyll concentration are modeled with respect to the biogeochemical parameters and are validated for the region. A new approach using the density for the estimation of the vertical chlorophyll profile was formulated. The DCM characteristics and covariation with respect to the other parameters are, thus, formulated and the factors controlling the DCM in this region are characterized. The model was applied to satellite remote sensing data to derive the vertical profiles of chlorophyll layer in the Bay of Bengal waters. The results were discussed in the context of understanding of the underlying biological and physical processes as well as subsurface phytoplankton biomass and the carbon cycle in the region.

AB  - Coastal sea level changes measured by tide gauges are affected by the severity of coastal land motion. Subsidence due to natural and anthropogenic activities in the coastal regions were directly exacerbates the tide gauge records. In this study, we aim to monitor the coastal land motion at the tide gauges in Korean peninsula using multi-temporal InSAR techniques. We present the methodology that simply employs the selection of sequential and small temporal interferograms in the StaMPS-SBAS technique for increased coherent PS pixels over coastal regions. C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data from ascending and descending mode were acquired over Pohang and Yeosu regions to map the coastal land motion. The preliminary results showed significant increased number of initial PS pixel density than conventional StaMPS-SBAS technique, chosen by Amplitude-Dispersion Index (ADI) and revealed the subsidence about 2 cm/year in Pohang tide gauge and small uplift of 1.46 mm/year near Yeosu tide gauge.

AB  - The project presented in this paper aims to bring to the Romanian stage a system capable of providing information on various land changes that occur in Romania. These changes can have multiple causes, either natural or caused by human activities. Local authorities, business people, and researchers can use this information to make informed decisions that can influence Romanian citizens' well-being. This paper presents a method to build a complex system at the national level, aiming to highlight the usefulness of using geospatial data. In order to interact in a pleasant way with geospatial data providers, this work is based on an open-source solution called Open Data Cube, which incorporates in a library different services, acting as an interface between the system itself and the data providers, but also as a standard for data storage. This paper explores three different use cases, namely the detection of deforestation, monitoring the evolution of urbanization, and the evolution of the Black Sea coast, especially in the area of the mouth of the Danube river. Although different, with totally different causes, these three examples highlight the versatility of such a system.

CP  - IEEE India Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (InGARSS)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The coseismic surface displacement of the 2019 M-w 5.4 Mirpur earthquake is derived using Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) technique. Two Sentinel-1 radar images before and after the earthquake acquired in interferometric wide swath mode are used for displacement map generation. Two definite lobes of deformation corresponding to subsidence and uplift are observed from the displacement map. The results indicate an uplift of 9.5 cm and subsidence of -6.2 cm in the earthquake epicentral region. Using a forward elastic dislocation model the causative source parameters of the earthquake are randomly searched using an iterative approach, which minimizes the error between the InSAR data and the modeled results. The inversion results indicate a rectangular fault of length similar to 10 km and width similar to 5 km is responsible for the earthquake. Other source parameters such as strike, dip, depth, and the slip of the earthquake are also calculated during the coseismic inversion.

TI  - Leveraging Google Earth Engine User Interface for Semiautomated Wetland Classification in the Great Lakes Basin at 10 m With Optical and Radar Geospatial Datasets
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the world's largest freshwater ecosystems, the Great Lakes Basin houses thousands of acres of wetlands that support a variety of crucial ecological and environmental functions at the local, regional, and global scales. Monitoring these wetlands is critical to conservation and restoration efforts; however, current methods that rely on field monitoring are labor-intensive, costly, and often outdated. In this article, we present a graphical user interface constructed in Google Earth Engine called the Wetland Extent Tool (WET), which allows semiautomatic wetland classification according to a user-input area of interest and date range. WET conducts multisource, moderate resolution processing utilizing Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager, Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument, Sentinel-1 C-SAR, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) datasets to classify wetlands in the entire Great Lakes Basin. We evaluated classification results of wetlands, uplands, and open water from May-September 2019, and tested whether SRTM elevation, slope, or the Dynamic Surface Water Extent produced the most accurate results in each Great Lake Basin in conjunction with optical indices and radar composites. We found that slope produced the most accurate classification in Lake Michigan, Huron, Superior, and Ontario, while elevation performed best in Lake Erie. Classification results averaged 86.2% overall accuracy, 70.0% wetland consumer's accuracy, and 82.7% wetland producer's accuracy across the Great Lakes Basin. WET leverages cloud-computing for multisource processing of moderate resolution remote sensing data, and employs a user interface in Google Earth Engine that wetland managers and conservationists can use to monitor wetland extent in the Great Lakes Basin in near real-time.

TI  - Cosmos in Logos: Translingual Poetry by Eduard Mizhit and Bakhyt Kairbekov
T2  - NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the issues of literary translingualism in its Russian-Tuvan and Russian-Kazakh representations. National literatures, which are sustained by the ethnogenetic "soil" of the authentic culture of an ethnic group, can be described in modern terminology as translingual, Russian-speaking and Russophonic (U. M. Bakhtikireeva). Although its external form is indeed Russophonic, the literary text keeps transmitting into the external communicative space primary cultural codes (basic concepts), which are elements of the national world picture.The article demonstrates this, using the case of poetry by two outstanding poets of the present times - Eduard Mizhit, a Tuvan and Bakhyt Kairbekov, a Kazakh. We focus on such Russian-language poetic texts by E. Mizhit as his collections "The Voice of Silence", "The Drops of Eternity", "Roots", "Facets of Loneliness", "The Transient", "Through Oneself", "The Abyss", and "Beads of Centuries'', and B. Kairbekov's "Behind the Lattice of Words", "Mysterious Holidays", "Against the Sun", and "Parts of the Whole".Both poets share a reflective tone which finds its expression in specific genres: ozhuk dazhy (a classic Tuvan three-liner) and tolgau (a genre of Kazakh literature combining contemplation and reflection). A special polycentric organization of space and time is also shared by both poets, as well as a pantheistic outlook, conditioned by the fusion of religious and worldview paradigms (from shamanism to Buddhism, from Tengrism to animism), is also important. A lyrical hero in both poetic universes is a lonely wanderer in a search of Truth, who takes on cultural masks of the Hunter and Nomad, of Baksa and Batyr.

T2  - IN DIE SKRIFLIG-IN LUCE VERBI
M3  - Article
AB  - This article deals with the preaching of the Greek church fathers. Genres, themes and hermeneutics are discussed. It appears that not only the biblical text, but also historical events are considered as messages from God and have to be interpreted in order to understand their meaning. A remarka ble paradigm shift occurred in the 4th century when the church became a dominant cultural and political factor. In the early period, the preaching focused on Christ, glorious in his suffering. After the transformation under Constantine, themes of worldview and even submission to the emperor became the subject of preaching. Preaching which supported existing political powers, replaced the early Christian view of life as strangers on earth. In the last section, the relevance of this for preaching in the 21st century is discussed.

The Sentinel-4 (S4) instruments will be launched on-board the MTG-S geostationary platforms, of which the first is scheduled for launch in 2024. BIRA-IASB is responsible for the development of bread-board algorithms for the retrieval of total vertical column quantities of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO). Tests of these algorithms on synthetic S4-spectra show that the SO2 and HCHO algorithms are capable of retrieving the vertical column with an uncertainty of 10-15% for solar zenith angles smaller than 65 degrees, under clear-sky conditions and without the presence of aerosol.

TI  - Trending: Radioactive and Fluorescent Bimodal/Hybrid Tracers as Multiplexing Solutions for Surgical Guidance
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - By contributing to noninvasive molecular imaging and radio-guided surgery, nuclear medicine has been instrumental in the realization of precision medicine. During the last decade, it has also become apparent that nuclear medicine (e.g., in the form of bimodal/hybrid tracers) can help to empower fluorescence-guided surgery. More specifically, when using hybrid tracers, lesions can be noninvasively identified and localized with a high sensitivity and precision (guided by the radioisotope) and ultimately resected under real-time optical guidance (fluorescent dye). This topical review discusses early clinical successes, preclinical directions, and key aspects that could have an impact on the future of this field.

TI  - IN DEFENSE OF BREAKUPS: ADMINISTERING A "RADICAL" REMEDY
T2  - CORNELL LAW REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Calls for breaking up monopolies-especially Amazon, Facebook, and Google-have largely focused on proving that companies like Whole Foods, Instagram, and YouTube are anticompetitive. But scholars have paid insufficient attention to a separate step in the analysis that may help explain why the government in recent decades has not broken up a single large company. After establishing that an anticompetitive merger or other act has occurred, there is great skepticism of breakups as a remedy. Judges, scholars, and regulators see a breakup as extreme, frequently comparing the remedy to trying to "unscramble eggs." They doubt the government's competence in executing such a difficult task, pointing to decision-making flaws dating back to the breakups of Standard Oil in 1911 and AT&T in 1984. Even scholars calling for more vigorous antitrust enforcement often recommend alternative remedies.This Article asserts that the pervasive hesitancy about administering breakups renders antitrust impotent in the face of monopolies-too often a statutory right without a remedy. More importantly, the Article challenges the perception of breakups as unadministrable. The intellectual foundations for the anti-breakup stance are weak, relying on outdated, anecdotal evidence. Moreover, antitrust needs a methodological shift toward paying greater attention to the breakup insights yielded by other disciplines. In particular, business scholars have studied how the world's leading companies regularly break themselves up voluntarily. Additionally, administrative law scholarship has observed a broader evolution toward collaborative regulation that shows how the much-maligned historical approaches to antitrust remedies could be greatly improved by relying more on the business sector in designing and implementing breakups. In other words, insights from outside of antitrust address many critiques of breakups and show how the remedy is far from radical and messy.Antitrust observers should thus abandon the worldview that compares breaking up prior companies to unscrambling eggs. Or, at a minimum, they should recognize that scrambled eggs, once cooked, are divided into smaller portions. A greater willingness to do the same to monopolies in the post-merger context and beyond would bring regulators more in line with the business sector, which sees divestitures as a routine part of effective governance.

This article explores Blaeu's world map to discover the worldview it conveys. A close reading of the map, and especially of the hitherto neglected explanatory text below the map, reveals a telling story with a multi-layered message. The communicated narrative can be summarized as pro-Dutch (or actually pro-Holland), Euro-superior, male-dominated, in favour of Copernicanism, and optimistic about the progress of knowledge since classical times.

TI  - Extending the Hybrid Surgical Guidance Concept With Freehand Fluorescence Tomography
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Within image-guided surgery, 'hybrid' guidance technologies have been used to integrate the complementary features of radioactive guidance and fluorescence guidance. Here, we explore how the generation of a novel freehand fluorescence (fhFluo) imaging approach complements freehand SPECT (fhSPECT) in a hybrid setup. Near-infrared optical tracking was used to register the position and the orientation of a hybrid opto-nuclear detection probe while recording its readings. Dedicated look-up table models were used for 3D reconstruction. In phantom and excised tissue settings (i.e., flat-surface human skin explants), fhSPECT and fhFluo were investigated for image resolution and in-tissue signal penetration. Finally, the combined potential of these freehand technologies was evaluated on prostate and lymph node specimens of prostate cancer patients receiving prostatectomy and sentinel lymph node dissection (tracers: indocyanine green (ICG) & x002B;(99m) Tc-nanocolloid or ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid). After hardware and software integration, the hybrid setup created 3D nuclear and fluorescence tomography scans. The imaging resolution of fhFluo (1 mm) was superior to that of fhSPECT (6 mm). Fluorescence modalities were confined to a maximum depth of 0.5 cm, while nuclear modalities were usable at all evaluated depths (& x003C;2 cm). Both fhSPECT and fhFluo enabled augmented- and virtual-reality navigation toward segmented image hotspots, including relative hotspot quantification with an accuracy of 3.9 & x0025; and 4.1 & x0025;. Imaging in surgical specimens confirmed these trends (fhSPECT: in-depth detectability, low resolution, and fhFluo: superior resolution, superficial detectability). Overall, when radioactive and fluorescent tracer signatures are used, fhFluo has complementary value to fhSPECT. Combined the freehand technologies render a unique hybrid imaging and navigation modality.

TI  - Breast cancer-induced immune suppression in the sentinel lymph node is effectively countered by CpG-B in conjunction with inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway
T2  - JOURNAL FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We previously showed selectively hampered activation of lymph node-resident (LNR) dendritic cell (DC) subsets in the breast cancer (BrC) sentinel lymph node (SLN) to precede a state of profound T cell anergy. Reactivating these DC subsets by intratumoral delivery of the Toll-like receptor-9 (TLR9) agonist CpG-B could potentially offer a promising immune therapeutic strategy to combat this immune suppression and prevent disease spread. Unfortunately, CpG-B can limit its own immune stimulatory activity through direct TLR9-mediated activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), pinpointed as a key regulator of immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we have investigated whether in vitro exposure to CpG-B, with or without simultaneous inhibition of STAT3 signaling, could overcome immune suppression in BrC SLN. Methods Immune modulatory effects of CpG-B (CPG7909) with or without the JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor (STAT3i) AG490 were assessed in ex vivo cultured BrC SLN-derived single-cell suspensions (N=29). Multiparameter flow cytometric analyses were conducted for DC and T cell subset characterization and assessment of (intracellular) cytokine profiles. T cell reactivity against the BrC-associated antigen Mammaglobin-A was determined by means of interferon-gamma ELISPOT assay. Results Although CpG-B alone induced activation of all DC subsets, combined inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway resulted in superior DC maturation (ie, increased CD83 expression), with most profound activation and maturation of LNR DC subsets. Furthermore, combined CpG-B and JAK2/STAT3 inhibition promoted Th1 skewing by counterbalancing the CpG-induced Th2/regulatory T cell response and significantly enhanced Mammaglobin-A specific T cell reactivity. Conclusion Ex vivo immune modulation of the SLN by CpG-B and simultaneous JAK2/STAT3 inhibition can effectively overcome BrC-induced immune suppression by preferential activation of LNR DC, ultimately restoring type 1-mediated antitumor immunity, thereby securing a BrC-specific T cell response. These findings provide a clear rationale for clinical exploration of SLN-immune potentiation through local CpG/STAT3i administration in patients with BrC.

AB  - Kerala received an extensive rainfall during Jul-Aug 2018 which led to disastrous flood condition in many places of Kerala state. Optical Remote Sensing (RS) images acquired during the flood event with low cloud cover are used for ground truth mapping. Earth Observation (EO) images from three satellite, i.e., Sentinel-2, Landsat-8 and World View-3 are used. Two indices, i.e. Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) are used to analyze the flood pattern in the study area. A hybrid approach involving thresholding the indices combined with manual digitization is carried out for ground truth flood area extraction. Here, we used the CloudToolbox service provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) to process and analyze the Earth Observation (EO) data. From the images, it is quite evident that the flood water was increased from 12 Aug - 22 Aug 2018 and started receding by 27 Aug 2018.

AB  - The Kerala state of India experienced a devastating flood during Aug 2018, which incurred huge socio-economic losses and human fatalities. ALOS-2 L-band SAR image acquired during the peak flood was used in this study. A split-window approach combined with thresholding algorithm was used for analyzing the 2018 flood event of Kerala, India. The SAR image splitting and tile selection was carried out based on two parameters, namely the Coefficient of Variation (CV) and ratio to the scene. Kittler and Illingworth's thresholding algorithm was implemented on the selected split images. Euclidean distance was used to shortlist the split images with large variation in the data representing both thematic classes (flood/non-flood). An independent split based analysis (ISBA) was implemented in which respective threshold values obtained from the split images are averaged to get an optimum threshold value. From the results, we observe that an underestimation of flood area in urban land use due to double bounce, volume scattering and shadow effects. Validation is carried out on a small subset area for which the field data was available, and an accuracy of 73 % was obtained.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications in Urban Environments V held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) is one of the serious phenomena that can influence human activities. Spatial-temporal analysis of land-use/land-cover (LULC) change, as well as the monitoring and modeling of urban expansion, are essential for the planning and management of urban environments. Such environments reflect the economic conditions and quality of life of the individual country. Urbanization is generally influenced by national laws, plans, and policies and by power, politics, and governance in many developing countries. Remote sensing tools play a vital role in monitoring LULC change and measuring the rate of urbanization at both the local and global levels. This paper monitored the changes of the urban suitability area, and prediction of LULC with urban growth using multi-criteria decision analysis and cellular automata (CA)-Markov chain model. The province of Orkhon is the most intensive development area in Mongolia, and a transitional zone on urban area expansion with residential, mining, and industries, where is sampled in this study. The methods are provided by the urban suitability area based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with factor variables and simulation of LULC based on the CA-Markov chain model. The urban suitability area analysis is helpful to validate the prediction of an urban area by relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The CA-Markov chain model was calibrated with data from 1989 to 2019 and used to predict expansions for 2030 and 2040 with two datasets of explanatory variables including slope, forest, river, specially protected areas, road, railroad, and urban centers in an urban and non-urban area. All analyses were based on Landsat imageries (TM, ETM+, and OLI) that were used to derive main land use classes. The results show that the urban, agriculture and mining area were expanded intensively. Forest was decreased in the last few years caused by human influences. Besides, the simulation results were validated by ROC curves with urban suitability analysis. Finally, this kind of study results is very important and useful to land managers and urban planners.

AB  - The extraction of roads from panchromatic images has many insightful applications in the fields of urban planning, setting up of transportation, disaster management and cartography in geographical information systems (GIS). The process of extracting roads from high-resolution images is composite, due to the presence of different noises (i.e., buildings, shadows, clouds etc.). Various image processing techniques and various quality measures are applied on the high-resolution remote sensing satellite images to improve the quality of the image and interactively extract the information of roads. Cartosat-2 images available in Bhuvan website of ISRO are taken for testing the validity of proposed method. The proposed method enhances the images using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and Line Detector for detecting road segments. Connected component analysis (CCA) is performed on segmented image for connection of disconnected objects in the segmented image. Morphological operations fill the holes caused by the presence of shadows, buildings and trees on the road surface.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 26th International Symposium on Atmospheric and Ocean Optics, Atmospheric Physics

AB  - The study of the long-term phenology changes of deciduous needle-leaved forests in Siberia (for subarctic and temperate zone) was carried out using the 15-day of NDVI time series from GIMMS3g data (1982-2015). An analysis of phenology variations of deciduous needle-leaved forests in Siberia during 1982-2015 showed the significant increase of the length of growing season on similar to 28/+/- 7 days in subarctic zone and in temperate zone on similar to 10/+/- 5 days. The increase of the length of growing season is due to the earlier of beginning and the later of the end of growing season. At that time, the shift of dates of the start of growing season in both zones is greater than the shift of dates of the end. Perhaps this is due to a close relationship (R>0.8) between NDVIratio and surface air temperature variations only in beginning of growing season because the correlation in the end of growing season is weak. The phenology trends of deciduous needle-leaved forests during the study period in subarctic zone is similar to 2-3 times higher as compared with temperate zone. For same time, there is a significant increase (similar to 1.7 degrees C/+/- 0.8) of average annual air temperature in subarctic zone but the trend of temperature in temperate zone is negligible. The significant increase of the time integrated NDVI values in both zones are observed and their variations a close relation with changes of summer warmth index values: there is a high (R=0.85) correlation in subarctic zone and moderate (R=0.66) correlation in temperate zone.

TI  - One-year assessment of the CHAOS two-way coupled atmosphere-ocean wave modelling system over the Mediterranean and Black Seas
T2  - MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is currently clear that the atmosphere and ocean should be simulated by integrated modelling systems resolving interconnected physical factors that determine the Earth's energy balance. Waves play a key role in the interfacial interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean, regulating momentum, heat and moisture exchange. This study aims to evaluate the CHAOS two-way coupled atmosphere-ocean wave system (Chemical Hydrological Atmospheric Ocean wave System) over the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The evaluation is performed against in situ and remote sensing data for the period from 1 December 2013 to 1 December 2014. CHAOS includes the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model, version 3.8, as atmospheric component and the Wave model (WAM) cycle 4.5.4 as ocean wave component, coupled through the OASIS3-MCT coupler, version 3.0. Two continuous model simulation approaches were followed to assess the impact of atmosphere-ocean waves coupling. In the first approach (1-way coupling mode), the ocean wave component uses the winds produced by the atmospheric component, while in the second approach (2-way coupling mode) the atmospheric component additionally uses sea state information estimated by the ocean wave component through wave-dependent Charnock parameter computations. In the 2-way coupling mode, the attenuation of the atmospheric flow has a damping effect on wind-generated waves. The simulations in 2-way coupling mode produce more realistic results yielding statistical improvements. Compared against buoy observations, the 2-way mode reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) 1.2% for wind speed and 6.3% for significant wave height, while against Jason-2 satellite retrievals the reduction is 0.5% and 2.4%, respectively. Additionally, the 2-way coupling mode outperformed the 1-way mode under intense wind and wave conditions during the one-year period considered.

AB  - The Common Agricultural Policy, and specifically the part referring to Cross Compliance (CC) is the main tool with which the European Union promotes and enforces environmentally sound practices in agriculture. CC requirements however are extremely complex. Additionally, on-the-spot checks (inspections), the main tool for checking compliance, report ex post facto, are expensive and difficult to perform due to their low level of controllability and verifiability.This paper presents results from the work that has been carried out under RE.CAP (EU Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme Grant Agreement No. 693171). The project aimed at: a) simplifying CC rules, b) facilitating compliance of the farmers with the CC rules and c) reducing the burden of checking cross-compliance while at the same time increasing the controllability and verifiability level of the inspections, through remote sensing, self assessment and acting ex-ante.The novelty of this work is that it presents how remote sensing results are incorporated in a real-world system in a form of a pilot that covered a major part of Thessaly (Greece), including 140 farmers and more than 80 agro-consultants. The remote-sensing algorithms used mainly Sentinel-2 images, and provided accurate crop classification for all five major crops that make up 85% of the Greek agricultural land. The presentation will show: a) the RE.CAP system and how remote sensing algorithms were incorporated in it, b) how inspections validated the results, c) The results of the satisfaction survey and d) real-data estimation of the administrative burden reduction due to RE.CAP.Overall, the work presented here shows for the first time that an integrated solution combining farmers and inspector participation through self-assessment and remote sensing using Sentinel-2 open data can practically be employed and used to carry out environmental monitoring and protection on a national level.

AB  - Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) have become a widely used tool and product in the last 20 years. They provide a snapshot of the landscape and landscape features while also providing elevation values. They have allowed us to better visualize and interrogate topographic features. A landscape feature is a road and the location of the road is the "foundation" of any road. A road constructed in a poor location can fail and cause serious environmental damage, as well as add financial strain from continuous and costly maintenance problems. The forest managers know that forest roads must be inspected regularly and maintained as necessary to minimize erosion of the road surface, otherwise, they will require costly repairs. Forest roads represent a significant investment by forest owners and as such, this investment must be preserved. Nowadays forest managers expect the field survey also use DEM and orthophotos datasets to better understand the condition of the road network and to set maintenance and upgrade priorities. In this study, we validate several DEMs and we compare them to the measurements of a detailed road surveying with geodesic GPS. The aim is to use DEMs to spot troubles in the forest road network and relieve the forest owner from the cost of periodic field survey of the forest roads.

AB  - The paper considers a remote method for determining the occurrence of forest fires (FF) from thunderstorms in Yakutia. FF data (Npix - the number of "fire" pixels) was obtained using a MODIS/Terra, Aqua spectroradiometer (confidence level from 80-100%) of the FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System, https://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/near-real-time-data/firms). Lightning discharge data - WWLLN (World Wide Lighting Location Network, http://wwlln.net/). An analysis of lightning discharges was carried out for a period from 1-10 days to the date of fire detection. The spatial comparison of the centers of lightning discharges and FF was carried out with a circle radius of 10 km having a center relative to the burning center. A comparison of the percentage of FF from thunderstorms according to the remote sensing method with the information provided by the Aviation Forest Protection the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) is carried out.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Currently, Nuclear Medicine has a clearly defined role in clinical practice due to its usefulness in many medical disciplines. It provides relevant diagnostic and therapeutic options leading to patients' healthcare and quality of life improvement. During the first two decades of the 21st(t) century, the number of Nuclear Medicine procedures increased considerably. Clinical and research advances in Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging have been based on developments in radiopharmaceuticals and equipment, namely, the introduction of multimodality imaging. In addition, new therapeutic applications of radiopharmaceuticals, mainly in oncology, are underway.This review will focus on radiopharmaceuticals for positron emission tomography (PET), in particular, those labeled with Fluorine-18 and Gallium-68. Multimodality as a key player in clinical practice led to the development of new detector technology and combined efforts to improve resolution. The concept of dual probe (a single molecule labeled with a radionuclide for single photon emission computed tomography)/positron emission tomography and a light emitter for optical imaging) is gaining increasing acceptance, especially in minimally invasive radioguided surgery. The expansion of theranostics, using the same molecule for diagnosis (gamma or positron emitter) and therapy (beta minus or a emitter) is reshaping personalized medicine.Upcoming research and development efforts will lead to an even wider array of indications for Nuclear Medicine both in diagnosis and treatment.

T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This article attempts to analyze the artistic means by which two writers William Faulkner and M.E. Saltykov-Shchedrin - in their novels written in the genre of the "genealogical saga", are depicting the decay, degeneration and abolishment of a fading noble family. In addition to the natural signs of the degeneration of the noble family (such as drunkenness and in the case of Golovlyovs, the criminal sources of enrichment in the case of Sutpen, and the departure from the patriarchal canon in both cases), both writers also appeal to metaphysical reasons - in particular, such as the predestination of death, the initial doom of the noble family due to this or that sin, the "wormhole". Faulkner and Shchedrin develop the metaphor of the noble estate as a mausoleum in which its inhabitants are imprisoned; coffin or tomb, where they rested during their lifetime; the image of the ice Dante's hell embodied on earth in the world of a noble estate. These metaphors and images are reinforced by demonic features in the images of the main characters of the novels - Thomas Sutpen, Arina Petrovna, Iudushka, - reinforced by extensive parallelisms. Both writers create in their works a special text using all kinds of images: mythological, biblical, even fabulous; our task will be to trace their artistic identity. Moreover, as an additional task, we will try to identify the common places of the two novels and to prove that the "Golovliov Family" by M.E. Saltykov-Shchedrin could have influenced W. Faulkner and reflected on his artistic worldview during his work on the novel "Absalom, Absalom!"

TI  - SEROPREVALENCE OF WEST NILE FEVER VIRUS IN HORSES IN THE BELGRADE EPIZOOTIOLOGICAL AREA
T2  - Veterinarski Glasnik
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile fever is a vector borne viral disease that can affect humans, horses, birds and sometimes other species of animals. Every year West Nile fever is detected in the human population in Serbia. The disease often occurs in a subclinical form, but most clinically evident cases occur in horses. Therefore, horses are recommended as a sentinel species for monitoring the general incidence of West Nile fever in a specific territory. Our goal was to determine the prevalence of antibodies against West Nile fever virus in horses in the Belgrade epizootiological area. We examined serum samples from 77 horses to determine the seroprevalence of West Nile fever virus in horses throughout the city of Belgrade. Sera were tested by commercial ELISA tests for detection of specific IgG-class antibodies to West Nile fever virus and for the detection of specific IgM-class antibodies to confirm the presence of old and acute (recent) infections in horses. The results confirmed that West Nile fever virus is widespread, detected in 70.1% of the surveyed horse population in Belgrade, and we also detected 5.1% of acute cases had occurred due to horses being infected in 2019. The seroprevalence of West Nile virus in the horse population in the municipality of Belgrade is increasing.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the grass-fed cattle ranching sector, precise and accurate information on the available dry biomass for consumption is of fundamental importance for the economically and environmentally sustainable meat production. In extensive pasture areas, as those found in Brazil, the use of orbital remote sensing data can be instrumental for the fast retrieval of biophysical parameters related to biomass production, based on which the livestock intensification potential can be determined. Within this context, in this study we estimated the dry biomass production of the State of Goias (located in the Cerrado biome) pasturelands based on the use of a new highly precise and accurate pasture map and MODIS MOD13Q1 NDVI images (normalized difference vegetation index). Gross primary productivity (GPP) estimates, at 250m spatial resolution, were derived based on the light use efficiency of Brachiaria brizantha (dominant pasture species in the Cerrado), which determines the amount of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (APAR) that is utilized in carbon fixation. Considering the current Animal Unit (AU) per hectare and the estimated forage production, the cattle herd in Goias could double (reaching about 40 million heads) without the need of expanding the existing pasture areas; i.e., with the appropriate information (as the one derived in this study), proper management practices, and adequate public policies, cattle ranching in Goias (and in Brazil) can be substantially improved (regarding productivity gains), while preventing new deforestations and increases in GHG emissions.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 34th International Conference on High Performance Computing (ISC High Performance)
CL  - Frankfurt, GERMANY
AB  - The Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (CAPI) is a general term for the infrastructure that provides high throughput and low latency path to the flash storage connected to the IBM POWER 8+ System. CAPI accelerator card is attached coherently as a peer to the Power8+ processor. This removes the overhead and complexity of the IO subsystem and allows the accelerator to operate as part of an application. In this paper, we present the results of experiments on IBM FlashSystem900 (FS900) with CAPI accelerator card using the "CAPI-Flash - IBM Data Engine for NoSQL Software" Library. This library provides the application, a direct access to the underlying flash storage through user space APIs, to manage and access the data in flash. This offloads kernel IO driver functionality to dedicated CAPI FPGA accelerator hardware. We conducted experiments to analyze the performance of FS900 with CAPI accelerator card, using the Key Value Layer APIs, employing NASA's MODIS Land Surface Reflectance dataset as a large dataset use case. We performed Read and Write operations on datasets of size ranging from 1MB to 3TB by varying the number of threads. We then compared this performance with other heterogeneous storage and memory devices such as NVM, SSD and RAM, without using the CAPI Accelerator in synchronous and asynchronous file IO modes of operations. The asynchronous mode had the best performance on all the memory devices that we used for this study. In particular, the results indicate that FS900 & CAPI, together with the metadata cache in RAM, delivers the highest IO/s and OP/s for read operations. This was higher than just using RAM, along with utilizing lesser CPU resources. Among FS900, SSD and NVM, FS900 had the highest write IO/s. Another important observation is that, when the size of the input dataset exceeds the capacity of RAM, and when the data access is non-uniform and sparse, FS900 with CAPI would be a cost-effective alternative.

TI  - Unboxing Al - Radiological Insights Into a Deep Neural Network for Lung Nodule Characterization
T2  - ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale and Objectives: To explain predictions of a deep residual convolutional network for characterization of lung nodule by analyzing heat maps.Materials and Methods: A 20-layer deep residual CNN was trained on 1245 Chest CTs from National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) trial to predict the malignancy risk of a nodule. We used occlusion to systematically block regions of a nodule and map drops in malignancy risk score to generate clinical attribution heatmaps on 103 nodules from Lung Image Database Consortium image collection and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) dataset, which were analyzed by a thoracic radiologist. The features were described as heat inside nodule-bright areas inside nodule, peripheral heat continuous/interrupted bright areas along nodule contours, heat in adjacent plane-brightness in scan planes juxtaposed with the nodule, satellite heat - a smaller bright spot in proximity to nodule in the same scan plane, heat map larger than nodule bright areas corresponding to the shape of the nodule seen outside the nodule margins and heat in calcification.Results: These six features were assigned binary values. This feature vector was fedinto a standard J48 decision tree with 10-fold cross-validation, which gave an 85 % weighted classification accuracy with a 77.8% True Positive (TP) rate, 8% False Positive (FP) rate for benign cases and 91.8% TP and 22.2% FP rates for malignant cases. Heat Inside nodule was more frequently observed in nodules classified as malignant whereas peripheral heat, heat in adjacent plane, and satellite heat were more commonly seen in nodules classified as benign.Conclusion: We discuss the potential ability of a radiologist to visually parse the deep learning algorithm generated "heat map" to identify features aiding classification.

T2  - CUADERNOS DE RUSISTICA ESPANOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study tries to identify the peculiarities of how the concept of WOMAN is perceived in paremias of different peoples, underlining the fact that it is the paremias that accumulate the worldview idiosyncrasies for various ethnicities as a result of their historical and cultural evolution. The perspective on the concept of WOMAN as viewed through a proverb, allows us to register the differences in both how women are treated and appreciated by the respective peoples, as a backdrop to certain universal norms typical of the cultures in question. The corpus of proverbs of each nation contains their historical memory, priorities and values, ethical code and the current mentality of the native speakers. Thus, foreign language acquisition must be complemented with the study of its paremiological heritage for the development of a better understanding of the meanings and connotations of the acquired lexicon and in case of translation, for the benefit of finding appropriate correspondences.

TI  - Fire and rain are one: extreme rainfall events predict wildfire extent in an arid grassland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing wildfire regimes and their environmental drivers is critical for effective land management and conservation. We used Landsat imagery to describe the wildfire regime of the north-eastern Simpson Desert (Australia) between 1972 and 2014, and to quantify the relationship between wildfire extent and rainfall. Wildfires occurred in 15 of the 42 years, but only 27% of the study region experienced multiple wildfires. A wildfire in 1975 burned 43% of the region and is the largest on record for the area. More recently, a large wildfire in 2011 reburned areas that had not burned since 1975 (47% of the 2011 wildfire), as well as new areas that had no record of wildfires (25% of the 2011 wildfire). The mean minimum wildfire return interval was 27 years, comparable with other spinifex-dominated grasslands, and the mean time since last wildfire was 21 years. Spinifex-dominated vegetation burned most frequently and over the largest area. Extreme annual rainfall events (> 93rd percentile) effectively predicted large wildfires occurring 2 years after those events. Extreme rainfall is predicted to increase in magnitude and frequency across central Australia, which could alter wildfire regimes and have unpredictable and far-reaching effects on ecosystems in the region's arid landscapes.

AB  - The polarimetric signature (PS) at two different crop-specific frequencies using fully polarimetric Radarsat-2 (C-band) and ALOS2/PALSAR2 (L-band) SAR data was generated and evaluated for crop and other dominant feature characterization. PS is a 3Drepresentation of the polarimetric information in different polarization bases that provides a better illustration of the target which is limited in the case of conventional methods. Differential response was observed at C- and Lband, surface scattering was dominant at L-band (crosspol response of similar to 0.11) owing to its high penetration capability whereas at C-band (cross-pol response of similar to 0.25) volume component was found to be prevalent due to its extended interaction with crop canopy components. Also, variation in PS among the crop-types was observed at the same frequency. As the increase in Pedestal height (PH) can be attributed to multiple and/or volume scattering, for cotton high PH was noticed at C-band (0.28) than at L-band (0.11). Similarly, Paddy resulted in a PH of 0.22 and 0.09 at C-band and L-band respectively. The polarization signature for various crops (as was observed to be different) can be very useful in crop discrimination, parameters retrieval, and crop condition monitoring.

AB  - Measuring the spatial distribution of soil moisture in the vegetative area is important for agricultural research and applications. In this paper, we have proposed the soil moisture estimation method in the vegetative area which uses minimum apriori information and low cost in terms of manpower and real-time field survey. For the development of this method, we have used VV backscattering from Sentinel-1 SAR and red band from Sentinel-2 optical images which are freely available worldwide. Along with this, we have also used anisotropy (A) as an intermediate parameter for the estimation of dielectric constant (epsilon) in the vegetative area. The estimated values of dielectric constant show good correlation with dielectric constant (epsilon') inverted using ground soil moisture samples. At last, estimated values of dielectric constant (epsilon) using the proposed method is successfully used for the estimation of surface soil moisture in the vegetative area.

TI  - UNDERSTANDING THE NAMES AND FUNCTIONS OF MYTHICAL FISHES IN THE AVESTA
T2  - VOPROSY ONOMASTIKI-PROBLEMS OF ONOMASTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article studies the names of two mythical fishes in the Avesta and their place in the ancient Iranian worldview. Each of the fishes in question is bestowed with a proper name and a constant epithet. The name of Vasi (Av. vasi-) associates with the worship of the cosmogony elements. In Yasna 42.4, its epithet panchasadvar (Av. panca.sadvara-) means "that of fifty fins" or "that of fifty gates," which presumably refers to the plates on the body of this mythical fish (similar to the Acipenser species). The description of the extraordinary size of Vaspanchasadvaran in Bundahishn (18.5-8) connotes its relation to the spatial worldview, which can functionally correspond to the image of a giant snake encircling the Universe. The name of the mythical Kara (Av. kara-) fish admits several etymologies, but it is highly probable that *kara- is a Uralic loan word from an early period of contacts between Indo-Iranian and Finno-Ugric tribes. The epithet of Kara, upapa- 'the one near the water,' apart from its literal meaning, may also point to its habitat at the source of Ardvisur in the Sea of Frahvkard. In Avestan sources, the Kara fish is connected to the concept of vision; it inhabits the waters of the Rangha river (Yashts 14.28-33; 16.7) located in the north (Videvdat 1.19) and thus suggests tanathological associations. In Yasht 14, Verethragna girds Zarathushtra with the abilities to see underwater like the Kara fish, in darkness like a stallion, and at a distance like a vulture. This symbolically refers to the motive of Zarathushtra's obtaining omniscience over the three different spheres of the natural world: water, earth, and air. Pahlavi sources also keep to Kara's particular sensitivity and, at the same time, endow it with expressive eschatological functions (Bundahishn 18.1-6; Menog-i hrad 62.28-29). These features of the Kara fish were not borrowed from the Aramaic-Babylonian mythological tradition, being a result of the development of Iranian eschatological ideas.

TI  - The 1845-46 and 1766-68 eruptions at Hekla volcano: new lava volume estimates, historical accounts and emplacement dynamics
T2  - JOKULL
M3  - Article
AB  - We use new remote sensing data, historical reports, petrology and estimates of viscosity based on geochemical data to illuminate the lava emplacement flow-lines and vent structure changes of the summit ridge of Hekla during the large eruptions of 1845-46 and 1766-68. Based on the planimetric method we estimate the bulk volumes of these eruptions close to 0.4 km(3) and 0.7 km(3), respectively. However; comparison with volume estimates from the well-recorded 1947-48 eruption, indicates that the planimetric method appears to underestimate the lava bulk volumes by 40-60%. Hence, the true bulk volumes are more likely 0.5-0.6 km3 and 1.0-1.2 km(3), respectively. Estimated melt viscosity averages for the 1766-68 eruption amount to 2.5 x 10(2) Pa s (pre-eruptive) and 2.5 x 10(3) Pa s (degassed), andfor the 1845-46 eruption 2.2 x 10(2) Pa s (pre-eruptive) and 1.9 x 10(3) Pa s (degassed). Pre-eruptive magmas are about one order of magnitude more fluid than degassed magmas. In the 1845-46 and 1947-48 eruptions, SiO2 decreased from 58-57 to 55-54 wt% agreeing with a conventional model that Hekla erupts from a large, layered magma chamber with the most evolved (silica-rich) magmas at the top. In contrast, the lava flows from 1766-68 reveal a more complicated SiO2 trend. The lava fields emplaced in 1766 to the south have SiO2 values 54.9-56.5%, while the Hringlandahraun lava flow that erupted from younger vents on the NE end of the Hekla ridge in March 1767 has higher SiO2 of 57.8%. This shows that the layered magma chamber model is not suitable for all lava-flows emplaced during Hekla eruptions.

TI  - Fire Frequency and Related Land-Use and Land-Cover Changes in Indonesia's Peatlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia's converted peatland areas have a well-established fire problem, but limited studies have examined the frequency with which they are burning. Here, we quantify fire frequency in Indonesia's two largest peatland regions, Sumatra and Kalimantan, during 2001-2018. We report, annual areas burned, total peatland area affected by fires, amount of recurrent burning and associations with land-use and land-cover (LULC) change. We based these analyses on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra/Aqua combined burned area and three Landsat-derived LULC maps (1990, 2007, and 2015) and explored relationships between burning and land-cover types. Cumulative areas burned amounted nearly half of the surface areas of Sumatra and Kalimantan but were concentrated in only similar to 25% of the land areas. Although peatlands cover only 13% of Sumatra and Kalimantan, annual percentage of area burning in these areas was almost five times greater than in non-peatlands (2.8% vs. 0.6%) from 2001 to 2018. Recurrent burning was more prominent in Kalimantan than Sumatra. Average fire-return intervals (FRI) in peatlands of both regions were short, 28 and 45 years for Kalimantan and Sumatra, respectively. On average, forest FRI were less than 50 years. In non-forest areas, Kalimantan had shorter average FRI than Sumatra (13 years vs. 40 years), with ferns/low shrub areas burning most frequently. Our findings highlight the significant influence of LULC change in altering fire regimes. If prevalent rates of burning in Indonesia's peatlands are not greatly reduced, peat swamp forest will disappear from Sumatra and Kalimantan in the coming decades.

AB  - Anapa bay-bar is largest sand accumulative coastal form of the Caucasus Black Sea coast. Bay-bar of the Solenoye Lake is the northern part of the geosystem of Anapa bay-bar. Research opportunities of the relief and the landscape-morphological structure of the bay- bar transformation using remote data are shown in this paper. Simultaneous satellite images from open sources were the basis for analyzing of the dynamics of the sea and lagoon shores of the bay-bar. In addition airborne laser scanning and digital aerial photography of the Solenoye Lake bay- bar have performed in 2013 and 2015. Further, aerial laser scanning data and aerial photography were used to create high-precision digital elevation models (DEMs) and orthophotoplans of bay-bar and adjacent coastal sections. The analysis of digital elevation models made it possible to obtain linear and volumetric morphometric characteristics of this accumulative form. Relief and plan cover changes of the bay-bar, recorded using differential DEM or found in photographs, have both anthropogenic and natural genesis. Relief changes caused by hydrogenic processes are concentrated within the beach and erosion cuts. It has been established that beach topography restructuring occurs in almost every severe storm. The alternation of areas with increasing and lowering surface and fluctuations of the beach width due to coastline migration is characteristic. Most of the changes of the relief and vegetation in the central part and on the lagoon coast of the bay-bar are caused by anthropogenic impact. Leveling surfer of bay-bar for buildings, tents, parking and the dike creation to protect territory are marked. In the future, the destruction of dikes under storm influence and the dune restoration under influence of eolian processes are observed.

TI  - Bayesian Harmonic Modelling of Sparse and Irregular Satellite Remote Sensing Time Series of Vegetation Indexes: A Story of Clouds and Fires
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation index time series from Landsat and Sentinel-2 have great potential for following the dynamics of ecosystems and are the key to develop essential variables in the realm of biodiversity. Unfortunately, the removal of pixels covered mainly by clouds reduces the temporal resolution, producing irregularity in time series of satellite images. We propose a Bayesian approach based on a harmonic model, fitted on an annual base. To deal with data sparsity, we introduce hierarchical prior distribution that integrate information across the years. From the model, the mean and standard deviation of yearly Ecosystem Functional Attributes (i.e., mean, standard deviation, and peak's day) plus the inter-year standard deviation are calculated. Accuracy is evaluated with a simulation that uses real cloud patterns found in the Peneda-Geres National Park, Portugal. Sensitivity to the model's abrupt change is evaluated against a record of multiple forest fires in the Bosco Difesa Grande Regional Park in Italy and in comparison with the BFAST software output. We evaluated the sensitivity in dealing with mixed patch of land cover by comparing yearly statistics from Landsat at 30m resolution, with a 2m resolution land cover of Murgia Alta National Park (Italy) using FAO Land Cover Classification System 2.

TI  - Linking tree-ring growth and satellite-derived gross primary growth in multiple forest biomes. Temporal-scale matters
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study links tree-ring growth and gross primary production for a variety of forest types under different environmental conditions across Spain. NOAA-AVHRR satellite imagery data were combined with dendrochronological records and climate data at a fine spatial resolution (1.21 km(2)) to analyze the interannual variability of tree-ring growth and vegetation activity for different forest biomes from 1981 to 2015. Specifically, we assessed the links between tree-ring width indices (TRWi), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a variety of environmental conditions, represented by climatic variables (air temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration and water balance) and elevation. The impact of these variables on tree growth was assessed by means of the Predictive Discriminant Analysis (PDA). Results reveal a general positive and significant relationship between inter-annual variability of the NDVI at a high spatial resolution (1.21 km(2)) and tree-ring growth. Maximum correlations between NDVI and tree-ring growth were recorded when cumulative NDVI values were considered, in some cases covering long time periods (6-10 months), suggesting that tree growth is mainly related to Gross Primary Production (GPP) at annual scale. The relationship between tree-ring growth and inter-annual variability of the NDVI, however, strongly varies between forest types and environmental conditions.

T2  - BREAST CANCER-TARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to share our experience with SLNB in the Filipino population with early breast cancer.Patients and Methods: A retrospective review was done on all patients with confirmed invasive breast carcinoma, tumor size of 5 cm or less (T1/T2), who preoperatively had no clinical signs of axillary metastasis and subsequently underwent SLNB with blue dye method from January 01, 2008 to December 31, 2017. Clinicopathologic profiles were recorded. Outcomes of patients who had SLNB only were assessed.Results: One hundred twenty-nine patients matched the inclusion criteria with a mean age of 54.3 years. The majority (88.4%) had a total mastectomy. Invasive ductal carcinoma (65.1%) was the most common tumor. Estrogen and progesterone receptors were positive in 69% and 61.2% respectively while only 28.7% were HER2 positive. SLNB was successfully carried out in 126 (97.7%) patients with a range of 2-4 SLNs harvested. Thirty-four (26.4%) patients had completion ALND. With a median of 25 months follow-up, 75 out of 95 patients who underwent SLNB alone had follow-up data. Forty-six (61.3%) patients had seroma formation. One (1.3%) patient developed arm paresthesia, 2 (2.7%) local (chest wall) and 2 (2.7%) axillary recurrences after a negative SLNB. None of the patients developed lymphedema.Conclusion: The blue dye method alone is acceptable and can be readily employed in institutions with limited resources. Even with the limited population, the morbidity and oncologic outcomes of patients who underwent SLNB alone were low and comparable to similar international published data. SLNB should be the preferred method for staging the axilla.

AB  - Over the past decade, Chile has been affected by concentrated rainfall with high-intensity events, due to the effects of climate change. In this context, landslide susceptibility maps can be used for several purposed such as landslide hazard maps, urban planning and hazard mitigation strategies. In this research a landslide susceptibility map for the central Chilean Andes was developed using a GIS function named Fuzzy Logic model based on local parameters and as potential predictors were used geological classes, slope, faults, road network, and drainage network.The largest area with de high and very high susceptibility index represents 20.14% of the total surface and corresponds mainly to the different types of landslide deposits and steep slopes.

TI  - The Bauhaus Pots and Cups Express the Spirit of the Twentieth Century: Design in Art History and Pevsner's Definition of the Modern Movement
T2  - RES MOBILIS-INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL OF FURNITURE AND DECORATIVE OBJECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nikolaus Pevsner's Pioneers of Modern Movement is considered the foundational text of two new historical fields, the history of modern architecture and the history of design. This contribution, nevertheless, discusses this text in the context of art-historical discipline. Pevsner himself namely understood his work as a complement to Kunstgeschichte: by defining the 'Modern Movement' in established art-historical terms and also by discussing not only architecture but attempting to define the style and the worldview expressed in it for the whole period and all of visual arts. Specifically, this contribution is interested in the place that Pevsner allocated to the design within his art-historical edifice, since inclusion of objects of everyday use within an art-historical study was not (and still is not) usual. For Pevsner, on the contrary, design (linked to architecture) turns out to be a key component of his narrative, even if not for aesthetic but rather for moral or social reasons.

TI  - Representations of Palestine by Joe Sacco in his book "Footnotes in Gaza" (2002-2010)
T2  - ANTITESES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to understand the worldview of American journalist Joe Sacco in his work "Notes on Gaza" after September 11 in the United States. In 2002, after working with Chris Hedge for Harpers magazine, Sacco returned to Palestine and produced "Notes on Gaza". In his pages, the journalist depicted the attacks on the villages of Khen Younis and Rafah in 1956 that left more than 270 dead on the Palestinian side. The hypothesis behind this research takes into account the possibility of diverse discourses besides the media position of the mainstream media about the "War on Terror" and the need to resume the 1956 events in Palestine as a way to rethink the consequences of war against terrorism initiated by the United States and Israel in the Middle East. For this, the concept of representations of the French historian, Roger Chartier, collaborates to the understanding of systems of representations produced by distinct groups that aim at their strategies to communicate in an effective way, that is, to favor their ideologies and the legitimation of their actions. Being "Notes on Gaza", the source and object of our research, we also understand that Sacco's work is not unique and much less a groundbreaking work, but that its production was only possible through the various layers of other academic and journalistic works that expressed the most varied representations about the attacks and developments that the US "War on Terror" actions had unleashed in Palestine.

TI  - Interstitial Emphysema as a Rare Radiographic Presentation of Bronchial Dehiscence after Lung Transplant.
T2  - Case reports in pulmonology
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Airway complications after lung transplantation are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Bronchial dehiscence presents within a month of lung transplantation and is typically diagnosed radiographically as a sentinel gas pocket at the anastomotic site and confirmed with bronchoscopy. A 66-year-old man with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who underwent a right lung transplantation 4 weeks prior developed chest pain with palpable crepitus over his right chest wall. A chest X-ray revealed subcutaneous emphysema and a small right-sided pneumothorax. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax without contrast revealed a gas pocket at the anastomotic site in the mediastinum as well as interstitial emphysema around the proximal bronchi of the right lung that had worsened when compared to CT from 11 days prior. A review of prior CT demonstrated interstitial emphysema without evidence of a sentinel gas pocket. These findings suggest that interstitial emphysema was the initial radiographic manifestation of the bronchial anastomotic site dehiscence. Interstitial emphysema is typically self-limiting, but severe cases can lead to major complications. Interstitial emphysema outside of the immediate postoperative period should be recognized as a possible early radiographic sign of bronchial dehiscence in lung transplant patients with vigilant monitoring of potential complications and strong consideration for early bronchoscopic investigation.

TI  - Anti-corruption education as a factor of social security
T2  - RUDN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY-VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV SERIYA SOTSIOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers an urgent scientific issue with a clear practical orientation and related to the anti-corruption education of the youth, which is defined as an important factor of social (public) security as an integral part of national security. The authors define anti-corruption education as a specific type of social activity of the authorities and civil society institutions, which aims at raising public awareness of the nature of corruption as a negative social phenomenon, of legal and social mechanisms to combat it, and at developing the anti-corruption worldview as an element of 'social immunity'. There is a significant number of publications on the anti-corruption education, especially of the youth. They consider various aspects of this type of social activity, analyze its implementation, assess its efficiency, show the role of law enforcement agencies in the anti-corruption education of the youth, etc. However, representatives of the scientific-expert community have not yet considered the anticorruption education in the perspective that the authors suggest. The authors, as members of the National Committee for Public Control, an interregional public organization promoting the implementation of anticorruption programs, interpret anti-corruption education as a serious factor of social security, as an important tool for preventing radicalization of the youth consciousness. It is the radicalization that nourishes extremism and terrorism which are real threats to social (public) security. The article provides some recommendations for developing legislation of anti-corruption education. The authors believe that public authorities and civil society institutions should more actively (and not formally) involve the student youth in anti-corruption education and use the scientific-creative potential of the younger generation.

TI  - Isolated gallbladder metastasis of melanoma: Case report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although metastatic melanoma is most frequently found in liver, lungs, and brain, most metastases found in the gallbladder are from melanoma. Here, we present a case of isolated metastatic melanoma found during cholecystectomy.PRESENTATION OF CASE: 74-year-old male with a personal history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and arrhythmia. A skin lesion was found on the right malar region. An excisional biopsy was performed and histopathological examination showed an ulcerated nodular-type malignant melanoma, Breslow 7.6 mm, Clark IV. Surgical excision with margins of 2 cm and sentinel lymph-node biopsy was carried and were negative. Abdominal sonography at 6 months showed an 18 mm solid mass adhered to the wall of the gallbladder that was suggestive of a polyp. Thorax-abdomen-pelvis CT showed no abnormalities. The gallbladder lesion had increased in volume on the following sonography and therefore, cholecystectomy was performed. Histopathological study revealed melanoma infiltrating the mucosa and muscular layer. Written informed consent was previously obtained, and Institutional Review Board approval was not needed.DISCUSSION: Isolated metastatic melanoma in the gallbladder is uncommon. Follow-up controls with images are important in the diagnosis. As most metastatic melanoma to the gallbladder are asymptomatic, surgeons should have high level of suspicion. Cholecystectomy could prolong survival in these patients.CONCLUSION: Isolated gallbladder metastasis of melanoma is an uncommon presentation of this disease. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is an adequate procedure in this particular situation and may improve patient survival. The presentation of this case may help surgeons to maintain a high level of suspicion regarding the condition. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IJS Publishing Group Ltd.

AB  - The human history can be traced through the impacts of their actions upon the environment. The use of remote sensing technologies combined with deep learning techniques offers to the archeologist an opportunity to detect these impacts which are often invisible to the naked eye. The extraction of remote sensing signatures from a particular geographical region allows the generation of geophysical signature maps, which can be achieved using a multispectral image classification approach based on convolutional neural networks, this is referred to as the Convolutional Pixel Classification method. This paper presents the prospective study for archaeological land use characterization using multispectral remote sensing data provided by SPOT-5 imagery.

T2  - ANALES DE FILOLOGIA FRANCESA
M3  - Article
AB  - There is no doubt regarding the influence exercized by the work of Emile Cioran upon Yasmina Reza's fictional texts. Not only some of her theater characters are inspired in the figure of Cioran, but both writers share a similar worldview and analogous obsessions that flourish in their writings. In this manner, we do perceive in them a kind of aggressiveness that turns against themselves seasoned with frivolity and humor. In the speeches and monologues of Reza's characters we can identify ideas that are repeated endlessly in Cioran's aphorisms. Both authors turn reflection into pleasure towards excess, as if they were unable to contain themselves. From this perspective, we can better understand ideas such as their rejection from the notion of happiness for being considered a desire vulgar and childish, and the apology for barbarism as the only way to be reborn again.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Advancing health literacy is a fundamental step toward achieving population health. To that end, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded research to increase scientific understanding of how health literacy can reduce disparities and enhance the health of the United States.OBJECTIVE: This study identified and evaluated NIH-funded health literacy research focusing on disease prevention.METHODS: New R01, R03, and R21 research project grants awarded from fiscal year (FY) 2004 to FY 2017 studying health literacy and disease prevention were identified. Study characteristics, including the role of health literacy, how health literacy was measured, populations studied, and study design, were coded for each grant. Administrative grant data were obtained from the NIH's internal database. Research impact was assessed using the relative citation ratio (RCR).KEY RESULTS: There were 192 grants studying health literacy and disease prevention awarded by 18 NIH institutes and centers from FY 2004 to FY 2017, covering a wide variety of health conditions including cancer (26.0%), infectious diseases (13.5%), nutrition (8.3%), drug/alcohol use (7.8%), and cardiovascular disease (6.3%). Most grants studied the health literacy skills of patients (88%), with a few studies assessing the health literacy practices of health care providers (2.1%) or systems (1%). There was good representation of populations with traditionally low levels of health literacy, including Black/African American participants (30.2%), Hispanic/Latinx participants (28.6%), older adults (37%), and people with low income (20.8%). The scientific articles generated by these grants were more than twice (RCR = 2.18) as influential on the field as similar articles.CONCLUSIONS: The NIH provided support for a wide array of prevention-focused health literacy research. The value of this research is highlighted by the number of funding institutes and centers, the diversity of populations and health conditions studied, and the effect these grants had on the field. Future research should move beyond patient-level health literacy to health literacy practices of health care systems and providers. [HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice. 2020, 4(4):e212-e223.] PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: This study describes health literacy research funded by the National Institutes of Health that focused on disease prevention. These grants sought to prevent a variety of health conditions, but health literacy research over the past 14 years continued to concentrate on the capacity of patients despite increased attention on the health literacy practices of health care providers and systems.

AB  - The Cienaga Grande, Santa Marta is the largest and most diverse ecosystem of its kind in Colombia. Its primary function is acting as a filter for the organic carbon cycle. Recently, this place has been suffering disruptions due to the anthropic activities taking place in its surroundings. The present study, the changes in the surface of Cienaga Grande, Santa Marta, Magdalena, Colombia between 2013 and 2018 were determined using semiautomatic detection methods with high resolution data from remote sensors (Landsat 8). The zone of studies was classified in six kinds of surfaces: 1) artificial territories, 2) agricultural territories, 3) forests and semi-natural areas, 4) wet areas, 5) deep water surfaces & 6) wich is related to clouds as a masking method. Random Forest classifiers were utilized and the Feed For Ward multilayer perceptron neuronal network (ANN) was simultaneously assessed. The training stage for both methods was performed with 300 samples, distributed in equal quantities, over each coverage class. The semi-automatic classification was carried out with an annual frequency, but the monitoring was carried out throughout the analysis period through the performance of three indicators Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). It was found from the confusion matrix that the Random Forest method more accurately classified four classes while Neural Networks Analysis (NNA) just three. Finally, taking the Random Forest results into account, it was found that the agricultural expansion increased from 7% to 9% and the urban zone increased from 20% to 30% of the total area. As well as a decrease of damp areas from 27% to 12% and forests from 4% to 3% of the total area of study.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water/ice/land region segmentation is an important task for remote sensing, as it analyses the occurrence of water or ice on the earths surface. Many previous deep learning researches effectively utilized multispectral satellite images for highly accurate water/ice/land region segmentation. However, the deep-learning-based segmentation of synthetic aperture radar images still remains a challenging task due to the unavailability of enough labeled data. In order to overcome this issue, we designed a two-step deep-learning-based transfer learning model that needs a very limited number of labeled samples. The proposed approach consists of two models. The first model is a deep encoderdecoder 6SD to Landsat-8 multispectral translation model (DTF) that translates fully polarimetric PALSAR-2 6SD data to six new features. As for the second model (transfer learning), it utilizes the DTF features to fine-tune the model using the Landsat-8 multispectral pretrained model for water/ice/land segmentation. Hereinafter, the proposed two-step model is referred to as DTF-TL. Also, a qualitative and quantitative analysis was carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed model (DTF-TL) and compare it with various transfer learning methods. Overall, the DTF-TL model outperformed the other models with consistent and reliable water/ice/land segmentation results in terms of the recall (0.980), precision (0.981), F1-score (0.981), mean intersection over union (0.962), and accuracy (0.989).

AB  - After the coup d'etat of Thermidor, the new ruling elites constructed the myth of an "Environmental Terror" that had in their view characterized the preceding period. The example of MP Creuze-Latouche, and in particular his criticism of the decree of 14 February Year II on the draining of marshes and ponds, helps to reconstruct the issues involved. In the opinion of this member of the Commission of Eleven responsible drafting a new constitution, political economy must necessarily play a central role in the republican redefinition of a defeuded "land". To be redefined in accordance with the ideals of the regime, it would have to be topographically designed to take into account more fully the social and environmental dynamics of each locality. This would better represent the point of view of rural land owners and notables who would soon be called upon to join the body of "voters" for the future Constitution of the Year III.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mobility and migration are critical processes that influence cultural and socio-economic development, and have lasting effects on demographic and ecological arrangements. However, these are ephemeral behaviors which are difficult to reconstruct archaeologically. Here, we employ geospatial approaches to reconstruct mobility corridors likely used by Tiwanaku migrants during the Andean Middle Horizon, ca. AD 500-1000. Prehispanic mobility relied on caravans of Andean camelids. We reconstruct probable mobility corridors while comparing cost- and permeability-based modeling approaches. We further use remote sensing to examine how modern ecological dynamics relate to modeled mobility corridors. Imagery from the Landsat family of multispectral satellites is used to document the response of green vegetation to seasonal and interannual moisture variability. We find that there is a statistically significant increase in the amount of perennially-green vegetation land cover along the corridor linking Tiwanaku with its principal colonial endaves on the Pacific coast. Such perennially-green vegetation provides a critical resource for prehispanic caravans. The data indicate a relationship between high volumes of migration and enhanced vegetation. We explore whether Tiwanaku migration routes were established in part on the basis of this resource, or if modern land cover reflects an anthropogenic legacy.

AB  - Significant increase in the number of Earth remote sensing devices requires improvement of ground-based means of automatic stream data processing, which would allow the implementation of a mass remote sensing service in real time. The experience of choosing a freely distributed parallel file system working on the Linux operating system for solving problems of operational storage and processing of remote sensing data (RSD) is presented. RSD processing is organized according to the technology which excludes multiple copying of data between the processing steps and the delivery of the program code to the data. The processed data array is a collection of both target data files with the length of up to tens of gigabytes, and a set of short files associated with them with service data of tens of kilobytes in length. Technology Hadoop is used to implement the complex. To improve data processing performance, it was decided to replace the standard HDFS file system with a more efficient one. As a result of analysis and testing, the parallel OrangeFS file system was chosen. Instead of the previously used AVRO format, HDF5 is used as the internal technological format of data exchange. The issues of optimizing the settings of the data access mechanisms stack are considered, including the mode with dynamic selection of the I/O scheduler. The use of a more advanced parallel file system made it possible to increase the processing speed up to 40% relative to the standard Hadoop file system.

AB  - Recent review papers have discussed the opportunities and challenges of applying machine learning (ML) techniques to Earth science data. A common challenge cited in these papers is the lack of labeled training data. A literature review of Earth science papers over the last 10 years demonstrates that while there is rapid adoption of ML, particularly in biogeoscience and land surface research, the training datasets typically contain only hundreds of samples. This lack of training data limits the use of deep learning algorithms, which require larger volumes of labeled data. In situ training data are most frequently used in almost all domains, followed by model output and satellite data. The atmosphere and solid Earth domains use the largest training datasets, an order of magnitude larger than in biogeoscience papers. Random forest is the most commonly applied ML algorithm in all domains except atmospheric science and biogeoscience, which more frequently use fully connected neural networks.

TI  - JOURNALISM AND INTELLECTUAL POTENTIAL OF SOCIETY: THEORETICAL APPROACHES TO SYSTEM ANALYSIS OF INTELLECTUAL INTERACTION IN MEDIA LANDSCAPE
T2  - THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES OF JOURNALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article describes systemic factors of optimization of Russian media landscape in the context of the society's growing intellectual level. This process provides for the best possible intellectual interaction between economic, political, scientific, educational, artistic and other social layers. The authors deal with the criteria of media publicity as combination of informational relations between the participants of this process. Using systemic and synergetic approaches the authors also study an optimal model of informational support of freedom of social creative activities based on interaction of such media realities as public reason, writers' and audience' communities, editorial boards and other media organizations, and others. In this relation, they analyze how the commentariat is motivated to be on the mission of increasing the society's intellectual level.The authors conclude that the purpose of intellectual interaction in the media landscape is repeat renewal of the society's intellectual potential via social creative activities. This provides the basis for intellectual maturity of each individual, which adds not only to development of intellectual culture of a person and that of various communities, but also to improvement of the current goal setting and achieving system.

AB  - Exploration of the outlook and the views of renowned political figures constitutes one of the most thriving fields of historical research. This article focuses on such an understudied topic as a concept of race developed by Otto von Bismarck, the "Iron Chancellor". To examine the interrelation between Bismarck's views on a certain nation's "racial" features and his policy towards this country, the article offers a case study of Bismarck's attitude to Russia and the Russians and its influence on German-Russian relations. This case study relies on a wide range of sources, which completely reveal Bismarck's 'racial' understanding of Russia.

M3  - Article
AB  - Many technology projects fail to be successful, one of the reasons being the lack of monitoring. It is on one hand the lack of system monitoring, which may cause hardware and kernel vulnerabilities, and on the other hand, the lack of applications and services monitoring, which may cause unsatisfied users with the outcome of the project. We propose the monitoring of DHuS, used for downloading sentinel data, which is important once because the system handles large sets of data and once because it is useful to see the user's interest in the provided services. The solution has two components, one of system monitoring and the other of log monitoring. Both results in sending data to graphical interfaces, hoping that the users of those two components may be able to improve the project based on the information provided.

T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the Ob-Ugric and Permian traditions have preserved elements of the ancient mythological consciousness, the study of which together with the available data of related sciences would shed light on the history of the formation of these ethnic cultures traditionally. The solution to such a complex problem is possible on the basis of a comparative analysis of the individual aspects of the perception of the worldview, including its basic values. The authors do not pretend to be unambiguous in their interpretation of limiting themselves for a start to the definition of a single worldview field with the existing of uniqueness, originality and individuality of the cultures of the communities under consideration.Objective: to examine the complexity of the general and specific ideas of the Khanty, Mansi and Udmurts about the components of the human spiritual essence (souls), its characteristic and exceptional properties, including reincarnation, family relations/ties and patronage of descendants under the perception of their traditional worldview of human life and its basic values.Research materials: the research materials are based on (a) the proceedings of the field study materials during interaction with the communities specified which are considered as the primary resources of the study undertaken by the researchers, (b) secondary materials are taken from the scientific articles, book chapters and literature etc. published so far, (c) similar research findings by the scholars in this area of study, and (d) archival resources of the nineteenth and twentieth century.Results and novelty of the research: the study of the ideas about the human soul among the examined ethnicities of the selected communities in this study have their own historical context; nevertheless, a comparative analysis of the findings lead to the novel reflections and conclusions those reveal both universal concepts for the ethnic groups and distinctive/specific characteristics peculiar to the Udmurts or the Ob-Ugrians. The Ugric and Permian people have a clear concept of the presence of two components in a human defined as two souls which are the necessary condition for a life. On the basis of this idea, certain judgments, norms of behavior, and ritual actions have been developed traditionally. The common ideas of these people are also based on the concepts about the role of the `mother goddess' and the influence of the departed on the creation of the life and their ability to endow a newborn with a soul. A distinctive feature of the worldview of the Ob-Ugrians is the presence of a system of ideas about the reincarnation of the souls of the ancestors in descendants and about the connection between the soul and the flower(s) in the worldview of the Udmurts.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the professional life of Ivan Sakharov, a vivid representative of what is known as "nonprofessional" direction in Russian historical science in the first half of the 19th century. He studied the history of Tula Province and actively collected and published the folklore of the Russian people.The author analyzes the intellectual atmosphere of the Russian provincial society in the 1820s and the social, political and spiritual factors that encouraged its citizens to study local history. The most significant ones were the 1812 Patriotic War and the publication of "The History of the Russian State" by N. Karamzin.The article highlights I. Sakharov's life experience and his personal traits as well as his worldview as an intellectual of non-aristocratic origin. The author shows how Sakharov's character influenced his research, his love for folklore and, finally, his publishing business.I. Sakharov exemplifies the characteristic mentality of "posad" people, a social group in the urban population of Russian province. Unlike the "raznochintsy" (people of non-noble origin) in the after-reform time who mostly shared revolutionary and democratic outlook whereas the "posad" people in the 1830s had conservative and nationalist views.

TI  - Monitoring COVID-19 where capacity for testing is limited: use of a three-step analysis based on test positivity ratio.
T2  - WHO South-East Asia journal of public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In an effort to monitor coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many countries have been calculating the ratio of cases confirmed to tests performed (test positivity ratio - TPR). While inferior to sentinel surveillance, TPR has the benefit of being easily calculated using readily available data; however, interpreting TPR and its trends can be complex because both the numerator and the denominator are constantly changing. We describe a three-step process where the ratio of relative increase in cases to relative increase in tests is accounted for in an adjusted TPR. This adjusted value more appropriately reflects the case number and factors out the effect of changes in the number of tests done. Unadjusted and adjusted TPRs are then assessed step-wise with reference to the epidemic curve and the cumulative numbers of cases and tests. Use of this three-step analysis and its potential use in guiding public health interventions are demonstrated for selected countries and subnational areas of the World Health Organization South-East Asia Region, together with the Republic of Korea as a reference. To date, application of the three-step analysis to data from countries of the region has signalled potential inadequacies of testing strategies. Further work is needed on approaches to support countries where testing capacity is likely to remain constrained. One example would be enumeration of the average number of tests needed to detect one COVID-19 case, which could be stratified by factors such as location and population. Such data would allow evidence-informed strategies that best balance the highest detection rate with the prevailing testing capacity.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - In the field of remote sensing and more specifically in Earth Observation, new data are available every day, coming from different sensors. Leveraging on those data in classification tasks comes at the price of intense labelling tasks that are not realistic in operational settings. While domain adaptation could be useful to counterbalance this problem, most of the usual methods assume that the data to adapt are comparable (they belong to the same metric space), which is not the case when multiple sensors are at stake. Heterogeneous domain adaptation methods are a particular solution to this problem. We present a novel method to deal with such cases, based on a modified cycleGAN version that incorporates classification losses and a metric space alignment term. We demonstrate its power on a land use classification tasks, with images from both Google Earth and Sentinel-2.

TI  - Ethnic Fashion: Ancestral Codes and Contemporary Proposals
T2  - DESIGNIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Some twenty Colombian ethnic groups work textile using ancestral techniques. These fabrics constitute a peculiar expression system that informs us about social relations and the worldview of indigenous populations, in accordance with codes of strong symbolic and ritual value. This communicative system was maintained after the conquest, so it offers a very valuable material for the understanding of the symbolic universe and the experience in general of ethnic groups such as the Nasa or the Wayuu. If these ancestral codes have lost their significant relevance of a ritual nature, geometric graphemes survive as an aesthetic system adopted by the current fashion within the ethnic trend, now in vogue, that tries to convey positive semantic values of a cultural, social or environmental nature.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - By mass, dust is the largest contributor to global aerosol burden, yet long-term observational records of dust, particularly over the ocean, are limited. Here, two nearly global observational datasets of dust aerosol optical depth tau(d) are created primarily on the basis of optical measurements of the aerosol column from 1) the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra satellite spanning from 2001 to 2018 and 2) the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) from 1981 to 2018. The quality of the new data is assessed by comparison with existing dust datasets that are spatially more limited. Between 2001 and 2018, tau(d) decreased over Asia and increased significantly over the Sahara, Middle East, and parts of eastern Europe, with the largest increase found over the Aral Sea where emissive playa surfaces have been exposed. These daily, observational, and nearly global records of dust will allow for improvement in understanding the role of dust in climate variability.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on analyzing the monthly averaged sea surface chlorophyll_a concentration data for 16 years (Jul. 2002 Sep. 2018), a remote sensing data product of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (US NASA), the analyzed results have shown that each occurrence of ENSO phenomenon greatly affects the fluctuation of chlorophyll_a concentration in the South Vietnam's coastal waters (SYNC). The monthly averaged chlorophyll_a concentration varies from 0.5 [mg/m(3)] to 1.1 [mg/m(3)] (equivalent to 22.4% 49.3%), while the monthly averaged fluctuation of chlorophyll_a concentration between months is only 0.22 [mg/m(3)] (equivalent to 9.88%). These fluctuations have a great impact on nutritional resources as well as water quality because chlorophyll_a is a pigment in plankton, which is a criterion to assess the "rich or poor" of nutrition source in seawater. The results of this study are considered as a "small piece" in the overall picture of the impact of ENSO phenomenon on global climate change.

AB  - Conventional SAR refers to systems with small fractional bandwidth and short relative aperture whereas non-conventional SAR refers to systems with large fractional bandwidth and long relative aperture. The change detection methods developed for non-conventional SAR have been shown to be applicable to conventional SAR systems. However, the differences in characteristics of non-conventional and conventional SAR, especially spatial resolutions, degrade the change detection performance and cause some difficulties in evaluating change detection results when applying these methods to conventional SAR. SAR apodization, the effects of SAR apodization on change detection performance and change detection evaluation are investigated in this study.

AB  - The pursuit monostatic is a SAR operating mode that requires two SAR data acquisitions separated in short time (seconds) using the same flight tracks and being. In this case, the changes in a SAR scene come mainly from ground moving targets, thus opening up opportunities to detect ground moving targets using SAR change detection methods. The paper introduces a SAR GMTI method that is based on a change detection method in combination with a signature classification. The SAR GMTI method is tested with the pursuit monostatic data acquired by TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X in 2015.

AB  - Urban areas tend to be warmer than their rural surroundings, well-known as the "urban heat island" effect. Higher nocturnal air temperature (T-air) is associated with adverse effects on human health, higher mortality rates, and higher energy consumption. Prediction of the spatial distribution of T-air is a step toward the "Smart City" concept, providing an early warning system for vulnerable populations. The study of the spatial distribution of urban T-air was thus far limited by the low spatial resolution of traditional data sources. Volunteered geographic information provides alternative data with higher spatial density, with citizen weather stations monitoring T-air continuously in hundreds or thousands of locations within a single city. In this article, the aim was to predict the spatial distribution of nocturnal T-air in Berlin, Germany, one day in advance at a 30-m resolution using open-source remote sensing and geodata from Landsat and Urban Atlas, crowdsourced T-air data, and machine learning (ML) methods. Results were tested with a "leave-one-date-out" training scheme (testing(crowd)) and reference T-air data (testing(ref)). Three ML algorithms were compared-Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient Boosting, and Model Averaged Neural Network. The optimal model based on accuracy and computational speed is RF, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) for testing(crowd) of 1.16 degrees C (R-2 = 0.512) and RMSE for testing(ref) of 1.97 degrees C (R-2 = 0.581). Overall, the most important geographic information system (GIS) predictors were morphometric parameters and albedo. The proposed method relies on open-source datasets and can, therefore, be adapted to many cities worldwide.

TI  - Use of remote sensing data to study ice cover in the Dnipro Reservoirs
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The information on the use of remote sensing data when studying the ice cover of the Dnipro Reservoirs is given. The main source of data was the images obtained by the satellites Sentinel-2, Landsat, Aqua and Terra. In addition, the observation data from the hydrological and meteorological stations were used. The combination of these data enabled to study the patterns of ice regime in the Dnipro Reservoirs, to specify some features that cannot be determined by regular monitoring. A typical feature of the ice cover of all reservoirs of the Dnipro Cascade, besides the Kyivske one, is the impact of hydropower plants (HPP) located upstream. The runoff of the rivers flowing into the Kyivske Reservoir significantly influences its ice cover. This is especially relates to the period of spring flood. Besides the Dnipro and the Pripyat Rivers, relatively small the Teteriv and the Irpin Rivers flowing from the south-west to the north-east have a rather significant effect on the ice cover of this reservoir. The distribution of ice cover in the Kanivske Reservoir, compared to the Kanivske one, is significantly less. In addition to more southern location and warmer climate, the city of Kyiv also influences the ice cover on it, namely due to the discharge of wastewater from several industrial enterprises, Kyivska TPP-5 and Bortnitska Station of Aeration are ones of them. The impact of Trypilska TPP, which located downstream, is also significant. The longest duration of ice cover in the Kanivske Reservoir is observed in its south-eastern part. A point of interest about the Kremenchuts'ke Reservoir is the fact that the ice cover in it remains for the longest period compared to the other reservoirs. The largest duration of ice cover in this reservoir is observed in the Sulska Bay. The typical feature of the Kamianske Reservoir is the accumulation of ice in its narrow parts. Within the Dniprovske Reservoir, the longest freezing period is observed in the Samara Bay. Besides the operation of hydropower station, the industrial enterprises of Kamianske town and Dnipro city have a great effect on the upper part of this reservoir. There are significant differences in the ice regime of the different parts of the Kakhovske Reservoir, which extends from the north-east to the south-west. The distribution of ice in its shallow north-eastern part is usually much larger than in narrower south-western part.

TI  - Comprehensive Review on Application of Machine Learning Algorithms for Water Quality Parameter Estimation Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Review
AB  - Water is an integral aspect of the world necessary for living creatures to thrive. Owing to unplanned urbanization, rapid industrialization, and uncontrollable human intervention, water quality is gradually degrading. This affects not only marine animals but also humans. Thus, the quality of water should be examined regularly. Water quality parameters should be estimated to monitor water quality. In general, water quality parameters are measured by in situ measurements. Although these measurements are accurate, they are costly and do not provide real-time spatial and temporal changes in water quality. To overcome this limitation, water quality parameters can be estimated using machine learning (ML) along with remote sensing (RS) data. A combination of ML and RS data is a powerful approach for the routine assessment of spatial and temporal variations in water quality parameters. In this paper, some articles based on this approach are reviewed. By analyzing the literature, it was found that the integrated use of RS-based geospatial data with ML helps to produce an accurate result. Most of the authors used the regression algorithm in the estimation of the water quality parameters, with a support vector machine (SVM) regression intensively used. The artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm was the most used algorithm of ML in many of the studies. The researchers used multispectral images for their study. By applying ML to RS data, water quality monitoring systems are evolving into real-time artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled models that provide valuable recommendations and insights to support farmers to make decisions and take action in aquaculture.

AB  - Geospatial Big Data is currently received overwhelming attention and are on highlight globally and Google Earth Engine (GEE) is currently the hot pot platform to cater big data processing for Remote Sensing and GIS. Currently few or no study regarding the usage of this platform to study land use/cover changes over years in Malaysia. The objective is to evaluate the feasibility of GEE as a free cloud-based platform by performing classification of Klang Valley area from Landsat composites of three different years (1988-2003-2018) using multiple Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA). The best classification results were then imported and further processed to quantify the changes over the years using commercial software. Although, the classification results are of high accuracy but CART shows the best accuracy with 94.71%, 97.72% and 96.57% in 1988, 2003 and 2018 in comparison with RF and SVM. Some misclassified pixels were encountered because the annual composited images were compiled without taken into considerations of crops phenological stages (paddy) which resulted to the misclassified agricultural land into urban and bare land. Hence, the selection and composition of data initially had to be structured and strategized prior to processing as they can affect the classification result and further analysis. Regardless, GEE has performed quite well and fast in term of time and processing complexity of multiple datasets with minimal human interaction and intervention. Generally, GEE has proven to be reliable in fulfilling the objectives of this study to evaluate the GEE feasibility by performing classification and quantifying the land use/cover of studied area and provide good base for further analysis using different platform.

AB  - Analyzing the state and growth of various socioeconomic indicators is essential for effective developmental planning at a sub-national level. However, in many cases, data regarding such indicators are not publicly available and/or hard to collect. In many other cases, the available data may not be recent enough. In contrast, satellite data is both readily available and up-to- date. In recent times, various studies have been conducted to use different types of satellite data as a proxy to determine the condition of socio-economic indicators in different places around the world. In this paper, we study the efficacy of one such data source, nighttime lights (NTL), for monitoring factors related to sustainable development in the context of Bangladesh.

AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate the backscattering characteristics of ice covering Lake Saroma observed by Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data. In-situ observation measuring snow depth and ice thickness was conducted at more than 100 sampling points on Lake Saroma in February 2019. We also tried to apply interferometric SAR data analysis for the data pair acquired during the period from Feb.11 to Mar.7. The C-band SAR backscattering coefficients in both VV and VH have the maximum values at 30 to 35 cm of the ice thickness, and the relatively significant correlation found in the east part of the lake. We also find that the phase difference presumably caused by a tidal change in several areas surrounded the lake. In the relatively thick ice area, the coherence decreases with ice thickness, which is caused by the dominant scattering mechanism change.

TI  - Naturalizing Religion, Spiritualizing Science The Role of Consciousness Research
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reviews and discusses empirical evidence from consciousness research, especially research into anomalies, and asks the question what, if taken seriously, would those data mean for our concepts of consciousness, science, and religion. It shows that the process of naturalization, i.e. finding scientific explanations for as yet badly understood phenomena, is not finished yet and could have a profound impact both on science and religion: traditional religious concepts would have to be reconsidered, and the scientistic materialist worldview that is currently implicitly underpinning much of science would prove to be untenable. The empirical evidence, if accepted, demands a concept of consciousness that grants consciousness some fundamental status in the world, and the capacity to non-locally connect to events and other consciousnesses. This would seem to preclude a materialist concept of science, as well as some fundamentalist concepts of religion. It would continue the process of naturalizing religion into some as yet uncharted territory.

AB  - The deep learning revolution in computer vision has enabled a potential for creating new value chains for Earth observation that significantly enhances the analysis of satellite data for tasks like land cover mapping, change analysis, and object detection. We demonstrate a deep learning based value chain for the task of mapping vegetation height in the Liwale region in Tanzania using Sentinel-1 and -2 data. As ground truth data we use lidar measurements, which are processed to provide the average vegetation height per Sentinel-2 pixel grid (10 m). We apply the UNet, which is a widely used neural network for segmentation tasks in computer vision, to estimate average vegetation height from the Sentinel data. Preliminary results show that we are able to map the forest extent with high accuracy, with an RMSE of 3.5 m for Sentinel-2 data and 4.6 m for the Sentinel-1 data.

TI  - Combination of Linear Regression Lines to Understand the Response of Sentinel-1 Dual Polarization SAR Data with Crop Phenology-Case Study in Miyazaki, Japan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the relationship between backscattering coefficients of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and the four biophysical parameters of rice crops-plant height, green vegetation cover, leaf area index, and total dry biomass. A paddy rice field in Miyazaki, Japan was studied from April to July of 2018, which is the rice cultivation season. The SAR backscattering coefficients were provided by Sentinel-1 satellite. Backscattering coefficients of two polarization settings-VH (vertical transmitting, horizontal receiving) and VV (vertical transmitting, vertical receiving)-were investigated. Plant height, green vegetation cover, leaf area index, and total dry biomass were measured at ground level, on the same dates as satellite image acquisition. Polynomial regression lines indicated relationships between backscattering coefficients and plant biophysical parameters of the rice crop. The biophysical parameters had stronger relationship to VH than to VV polarization. A disadvantage of adopting polynomial regression equations is that the equation can have two biophysical parameter solutions for a particular backscattering coefficient value, which prevents simple conversion from backscattering coefficients to plant biophysical parameters. To overcome this disadvantage, the relationships between backscattering coefficients and the plant biophysical parameters were expressed using a combination of two linear regression lines, one line for the first sub-period and the other for the second sub-period during the entire cultivation period. Following this approach, all four plant biophysical parameters were accurately estimated from the SAR backscattering coefficient, especially with VH polarization, from the date of transplanting to about two months, until the mid-reproductive stage. However, backscattering coefficients saturate after two months from the transplanting, and became insensitive to the further developments in plant biophysical parameters. This research indicates that SAR can effectively and accurately monitor rice crop biophysical parameters, but only up to the mid reproductive stage.

AB  - Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) guidance for Subsequent License Renewal (SLR) applicants is provided in the NUREG-2191. Specifically, Section X. M1 of the NUREG-2191 includes guidance for aging management programs (AMP) which has two aspects related to fatigue analyses, one that verifies the continued acceptability of existing analyses through cycle counting and the other that provides periodically updated evaluations of the fatigue analyses to demonstrate that they continue to meet the appropriate limits. In addition, the NUREG-2191 provides requirements to account for reactor water environment by deriving cumulative fatigue usage (CUF) including environmental effects (CUFen) in component fatigue analyses for a set of sample critical components for the plant outlined in NUREG/CR-6260. Furthermore each applicant is required to determine plant-specific component locations in the reactor coolant pressure boundary that may be more limiting than those considered in NUREG/CR-6260. This paper presents a methodology to identify plant-specific primary equipment component locations that are potentially more limiting than the locations identified in NUREG/CR-6260, through a detailed review and ranking of the analyses of record (AORs) for a plant. The ranking approach implemented in this methodology assesses the level of technical rigor required to derive the CUF values and provides a means to appropriately compare CUF values within the same transient section. This paper also illustrates how this methodology was applied for a recent license renewal application.

AB  - Microfictional texts provide readers with a very limited amount of textual data. This might well result in a disorienting reading experience. This article attempts to tackle the hermeneutic problems connected to microfiction. Taking the view that literary texts imply worldviews as its basis, it argues that at the core of microfiction, there lies a profound epistemological concern: what can be known and how do we know whatever is known? The article suggests that an attempt at (re-) constructing the implied worldview of a piece of microfiction should begin with an analysis of how this epistemological concern manifests itself in the text in question. For this purpose, an analytical toolkit is developed and applied to three examples of microfiction.

TI  - Monitoring progress of the Sendai Framework using a geospatial model: The example of people affected by agricultural droughts in Eastern Cape, South Africa
T2  - PROGRESS IN DISASTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) was adopted by 187 countries and offers a tangible agenda for evidence-based policy for disaster risk reduction as an integral part of the overall post-2015 global development agenda. The progress of implementation of the seven Global Sendai Targets at the national level is tracked by a set of 38 indicators. However, despite the formal commitment, the majority of countries is currently not in the position to monitor the implementation of the Global Targets. The lack of information on disaster relatedloss and damage is mainly due to gaps in data availability, quality, and accessibility, which impairs an accurate, timely and high quality monitoring process. This research addressed this gap by developing a model approach, which aimed at "translating" indicators described by the technical guidance of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) into a geospatial procedure which builds on remote sensing data, climate data, land cover and land use data, agricultural statistics and population census data. With this geospatial model approach, we quantified indicators of the SFDRR for Target B "number of people affected" for the example of agricultural drought in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa in a spatially explicit way. We conducted a media content analysis to generate proxy reference data for evaluation of the model results. In addition, we explored the sensitivity of the model using three different input data on drought hazard, namely the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), the Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPED and the combination of these. The spatial distribution of number of people affected corresponded very well with reference data from the media content analysis; however, model results were very sensitive to different hazard input data. This geospatial model based on remote sensing and geostatistical data is to the best of our knowledge the first attempt to measure Sendai indicators in the absence of national loss and damage databases and provides a unique opportunity to support many countries in implementing the framework. Due to its retrospective nature, even a baseline measure of the indicators can be derived as a reference for monitoring progress. However, the model needs to be further validated in order to qualify the underlying assumptions made to determine thresholds of people being affected. Future research should transfer this model to different hazard contexts to allow hazard-specific monitoring of loss and damage in order to develop targeted disaster risk reduction measures.

TI  - Research on the Applicability of the E Spectrum and PM Spectrum as the First Guess Spectrum of SAR Wave Spectrum Inversion
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important method for observing ocean waves, and inversion of the ocean wave spectrum is an important part of SAR ocean wave detection. For most wave spectrum inversion methods, the first guess spectrum is crucial to the accuracy of SAR wave spectrum inversion. The first guess spectrum can be provided by some existing fixed wave spectrum models, but the applicability of these wave spectrum models as the first guess spectrum has not been systematically studied. This paper focused on the applicability of the Elfouhaily spectrum (E spectrum) as a full wavenumber spectrum and the Pierson-Moscowitz spectrum (PM spectrum) as a wind wave spectrum as the first guess spectrum for inverting the wave spectrum. Based on the SENTINEL-1A and RADARSAT-2 SAR satellite data of the Maritime Silk Road, using the E spectrum and PM spectrum as the first guess spectrum by the Max Planck Institute (MPI) method, the ability of the E spectrum and PM spectrum as the first guess spectrum to retrieve the wave spectrum and wave parameters was systematically evaluated. The significant wave height (H-S) and zero-crossing period (T-Z) wave parameters obtained from SAR inversion were compared with the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) wave data. By the comparison results, we analyzed the best wind speed and significant wave height ranges for the inversion of the PM spectrum and E spectrum as the first guess spectrum. The results showed that the E spectrum as the first guess spectrum had a good effect on the inversion at medium sea situation. It was suitable as the first guess spectrum of the SAR wave spectrum inversion.

TI  - MORPHOTYPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF STARCH GRANULES THROUGH DISCRIMINANT METHOD AND ITS APPLICATION IN PLANT ARCHEOLOGICAL SAMPLES
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Starch granule analysis effectively recovers microbotanical residues of starchy plants from archaeological contexts. Morphometric analysis is a common method to identify starch granules. However, this technique is time-consuming and inaccurate. Morphotypological differences in plants may also cause inconsistent results during microscopic observations. To address this problem, we evaluated the morphotypological features of three types of starch granules, specifically those found in wheat, millet, and yam, through light microscopy. Moreover, we used morphotypological analysis and discriminant analysis by ImageJ and SPSS software to perform computer -assisted analysis on the data set of geometric characteristics of the three types of starch granules, as well as the starch granule fossils from the Xianrendong and Diaotonghuan archaeological sites. Results are detailed and comparable to the light microscopy findings. The improved method with ImageJ and SPSS software required less time by direct measurement with a light microscopy and enhanced the accuracy of starch granule identification with the reduction of subjectivity. Therefore, the combination of ImageJ and SPSS software is a promising technique for the morphotypological analysis and identification of starch granules in archaeological starch granule analysis.

AB  - Remote sensing satellites are playing very important roles in diverse earth observation fields. However, long revisit period, high cost and dense cloud cover have been the main drawbacks of satellite remote sensing for a long time. This paper introduces the novel volunteered passenger aircraft remote sensing (VPARS) concept, which can partly overcome these problems. By obtaining aerial imaging data from passengers using a portable smartphone on a passenger aircraft, it has various advantages including low cost, high revisit, dense coverage, and partial anti-cloud, which can well complement conventional remote sensing data. This paper also examines several issues associated with this concept: why is the type of data needed, how can it be consistently acquired, what are some rules that should be used to acquire the data, what pre-processing is needed, what are some application that could benefit from the data and what are the limitations and pitfalls?

TI  - A Sentinel-Based Peer Assessment Mechanism for Collaborative Learning
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a novel mechanism to improve the performance of peer assessment for collaborative learning. Firstly, a small set of assignments which have being pre-scored by the teacher impartially, are introduced as "sentinels". The reliability of a reviewer can be estimated by the deviation between the sentinels' scores judged by the reviewers and the impartial scores. Through filtering the inferior reviewers by the reliability, each score can then be subjected into mean value correction and standard deviation correction processes sequentially. Then the optimized mutual score which mitigated the influence of the subjective differences of the reviewers are obtained. We perform our experiments on 200 learners. They are asked to submit their assignments and review each other. In the experiments, the sentinel-based mechanism is compared with several other baseline algorithms. It proves that the proposed mechanism can effectively improve the accuracy of peer assessment, and promote the development of collaborative learning.

TI  - Effect of Polyamines on <i>SOS</i>2 Family Gene Expression in Cucumber under Salt Stress
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BOREALI-OCCIDENTALIA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The SOS signal transduction pathway is a salt stress signal response pathway in plants, and serine/threonine protein kinase (SOS2) plays an important role in this pathway. Based on the cucumber genome database, this study used bioinformatics and quantitative real-time PCR and other methods to identify the whole genome of cucumber SOS2 gene family, and systematically analyzed its expression characteristics. The results showed that: (1) a total of 15 SOS2 genes (CsSOS2-1-CsSOS2-15) were identified in the cucumber genome, which were distributed unevenly on 5 chromosomes, and the subcellular localization showed that SOS2 protein were mainly located in the plasma membrane. (2) Phylogenetic analysis showed that CsSOS2-2 and CsSOS2-6 were more closely related to AtSOS2. (3) The prediction of cis-acting elements shows that the promoter sequence of SOS2 gene mainly contains drought-induced and defense-stress response elements. (4) Structural analysis showed that the sequence of conserved motifs contained in SOS2 protein were completely consistent, and mainly contained STKc and NAF mains, which may play a regulatory role in gene response to salt stress. (5) Quantitative test showed that the SOS2 gene family is mainly upregulated in cucumber roots and leaves conserved do real-time PCR in response to salt stress. Among them, 6 genes were up-regulated in response to salt stress on the first day of treatment. As the treatment time prolonged, gene expression was down-regulated under salt stress. Addition of polyamines significantly increased the expression of CsSOS2-1-CsSOS2-5, CsSOS2-8, CsSOS2-9, CsSOS2-12 and CsSOS2-15 in different tissues. This shows that polyamines can induce the expression of cucumber SOS2 gene family under salt stress, and then participate in the regulation of plant salt tolerance molecular network.

TI  - A New Set of MODIS Land Products (MCD18): Downward Shortwave Radiation and Photosynthetically Active Radiation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface downward shortwave radiation (DSR) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), its visible component, are key parameters needed for many land process models and terrestrial applications. Most existing DSR and PAR products were developed for climate studies and therefore have coarse spatial resolutions, which cannot satisfy the requirements of many applications. This paper introduces a new global high-resolution product of DSR (MCD18A1) and PAR (MCD18A2) over land surfaces using the MODIS data. The current version is Collection 6.0 at the spatial resolution of 5 km and two temporal resolutions (instantaneous and three-hour). A look-up table (LUT) based retrieval approach was chosen as the main operational algorithm so as to generate the products from the MODIS top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and other ancillary data sets. The new MCD18 products are archived and distributed via NASA's Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC). The products have been validated based on one year of ground radiation measurements at 33 Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and 25 AmeriFlux stations. The instantaneous DSR has a bias of -15.4 W/m(2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 101.0 W/m(2), while the instantaneous PAR has a bias of -0.6 W/m(2) and RMSE of 45.7 W/m(2). RMSE of daily DSR is 32.3 W/m(2), and that of the daily PAR is 13.1 W/m(2). The accuracy of the new MODIS daily DSR data is higher than the GLASS product and lower than the CERES product, while the latter incorporates additional geostationary data with better capturing DSR diurnal variability. MCD18 products are currently under reprocessing and the new version (Collection 6.1) will provide improved spatial resolution (1 km) and accuracy.

TI  - Primary malignant melanomas of the female lower genital tract: clinicopathological characteristics and management
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The female lower genital tract melanomas mainly include vulvar, vaginal and cervical melanoma. There is little clinical data on the melanomas thus making them highly lethal with their prognosis being worse than for cutaneous melanoma and other gynecological malignancies. Surgery is still the primary treatment for gynecological melanomas with wide local resection (WLE) of tumors with adequate margins being preferred for early-stage vulvar melanoma while complete resection of the primary tumor is the standard treatment for early-stage cervical and vaginal melanoma. Sentinel lymph node biopsy seems to avoid unnecessary complete regional lymphadenectomy. However, it should be chosen cautiously. Recently discovered molecular changes have provided new hopes for effective systemic treatment of female genital tract melanomas. In this review, we summarize the pathogenesis and clinicopathological characteristics of these rare melanomas with particular emphasis on new therapies and clinical management methods that may affect prognosis. The review aims to provide a viable direction for clinicians to diagnose and treat female lower genital tract melanomas.

AB  - Land use change is one of the main impacts of human activities and has a profound impact on vegetation change. Based on the MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 2000 to 2018 and land use data in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, the land use and its impacts on NDVI change in the Shaanxi province of China were analyzed. This study showed that the land use structure in Shaanxi province is stable, with forest land, grassland and farmland as the main components. The main feature of land use change from 2000 to 2015 was the large area of farmland converted to construction land, mainly distributed in the Guanzhong Plain in the central Shaanxi province, especially in the vicinity of the capital city of Xi'an. The impact of land use changes on NDVI showed a significant decreasing trend in the area converted to construction land during 2000-2018, while the NDVI for areas converted to forest, farmland and grassland all showed a significant increasing trend. The growth rate of NDVI in the area converted to farmland was higher than in the areas converted to forest land and grassland, the reason for which needs further study.

AB  - Objective To analysis the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)results of core needle biopsy (CNB) diagnosis of breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) ; and to understand the clinical significance of SI-NB in DCIS. Methods The cases of CNB diagnosed DCIS treated in our hospital between Jan.2010 to Dec.2018 were included.The results of SLNB were analyzed. Results Of 169 patients with a CNB diagnosed DCIS ,all had SLNB ,among which 117(69.2%) were pure DICS,28 (16.6%) were DICS with microinvasion, and 24(14.2%) were invasive ductal carcinoma. Breast conserving surgery was performed in 29 cases (17.2%) , and mastectomy in 140 cases (82.8%).Ninety-three cases (55%) were diagnosed by 14/16 g needle biopsy,76 cases (45%) were diagnosed by 8 g vacuum assisted biopsy system. Compared with the pure DCIS group,the proportion of tumor >2 cm (P<0.001),extensive calcification (P<0.001), 14/16 g needle biopsy (P<0.001) and mastectomy (P=0.03) in the micro-invasive/invasive carcinoma group were higher than that in the pure DCIS group.SLNB was positive in 7 (4.1%) patients, all were diagnosed with 14/16 g needle hiopsy.The results of SLNB were negative in 8 g vacuum assisted biopsy system and breast conserving surgery patients. Conclusions The risk of clinically significant SLN metastasis following a CNB diagnosed DCIS is extremely low; SLNB is not warranted following a CNB diagnosed DCIS, particularly for patients undergoing 8-gauge vacuum assisted breast biopsy or breast conservation surgery.

TI  - Rice Yield Estimation Based on an NPP Model With a Changing Harvest Index
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy rice is one of the most widely planted crops in Asia. Yield estimation of paddy rice is crucial to food security. Gross primary productivity or net primary productivity (NPP) models are some of the most commonly used methods for crop yield estimation as they have a theoretical basis and are simple to use. The harvest index (HI) of paddy rice, one of the input parameters in yield estimation models, has been increasingly used with the improvement of paddy rice cultivars over the past four decades. However, in many previous researches, this parameter was arbitrarily determined to fit the observed yield data values, without considering its changing trend. In the present study, we developed an NPP-based rice yield estimation model with HI being a changing parameter. The accuracy of the proposed method is tested over the Jiangsu Province, Southeast China. The results showed that the rice HI increases linearly in study area. Compared with yield estimation with a fixed HI, yield estimations using a changing HI are greatly improved, with the average estimation accuracy greater than 96 & x0025;, and the relative errors within & x00B1;5 & x0025;. The results proved that the NPP-based yield estimation model with a changing HI can be a promising alternative for rice yield estimation.

TI  - Land Surface Emissivity Product for NOAA JPSS and GOES-R Missions: Methodology and Evaluation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface emissivity (LSE) is a key parameter for the determination of land surface temperature (LST) from thermal remotely sensed data. A new LSE product has been developed at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), College Park, MD, USA, to enhance the LST product for the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-Series (GOES-R) missions as well as to support the forecasting models. A 1-km resolution bare ground emissivity was derived from the historical Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Emissivity Dataset (ASTER-GED) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LSE product. It is then spectrally adjusted to the split window (SW) channels of Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard JPSS and Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) from GOES-R. VIIRS daily green vegetation fraction and snow fraction products are subsequently used to account for the dynamic variations. Validation results indicate that the product has a good agreement with in situ observations, with an emissivity difference less than 0.006 at the bare surface sites and a difference less than 0.007 at one cropland site with three growth stages. The intercomparison with NASA VIIRS daily LSE product proves a good agreement with a standard deviation of less than 0.012. To evaluate the LSE performance in LST retrieval, a whole year VIIRS LST is produced and validated over the SURFace RADiation budget observing network (SURFRAD) sites. The results indicate that the LSE works well with LST RMSE of 1.78 (daytime) and 1.58 K (nighttime). The new LSE algorithm has been integrated to NOAA-20 LST with the status of provisional maturity and will be applied on GOES-16/17 LST product in the near future.

AB  - The daily-composited 9 km sea surface temperature (SST) data from the 10-band Chinese Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (COCTS) onboard the Haiyang-1C (HY-1C) satellite are evaluated for global area against daily 9 km SST product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra satellite and in situ data. Around four months of the data are used for the validation from Jun. 18, 2019 to Jan. 9, 2020. The in situ SST data are averaged at a spatial resolution of 9 km which is similar to that of the COCTS and MODIS SST data. For daytime, the bias, standard deviation (STD) and robust standard deviation (RSD) of the SST difference between COCTS and buoy data are -0.31 degrees C, 1.09 degrees C and 0.66 degrees C. And the bias, standard deviation and RSD of the SST difference between COCTS and MODIS data are -0.14 degrees C, 0.95 degrees C and 0.60 degrees. The error sources are discussed. The results indicate that studies should focus on error sources to improve the HY-1C/COCTS SST products accuracy.

We find out that (1) GSMaP performs worse than IMERG mainly due to systematic errors and poor performance at high latitudes; (2) overestimation is obvious in high latitude areas of the northern hemisphere and also in areas with low rainfall intensity; (3) IMERG and GSMaP show good performance in summer and poor performance in winter; (4) where elevation is lower than 1500 m, the error metrics are highly correlated with the elevation; (5) the correlation coefficient is relatively high in areas with high rainfall, and the dispersion of satellite data and gauge data is also high. IMERG is a high-quality satellite precipitation product in the GPM era, but some uncertainties mentioned above are still worthy of attention by product developers and users.

AB  - Polarized synthetic aperture radar (POLSAR) and multispectral images have great complementarity in information volume. That is to say, POLSAR have high resolution but poor color information. Multispectral images have rich spectral channel information, but the resolution is low. Therefore, this work has explored the fusion problem of the two data source. A framework was proposed, which merged polarized channel fusion data and multispectral images based on the Sentinel-2 and GF-3 data. The experimental results showed that the fusion results greatly integrated the characteristics of each channel of POLSAR and optical image. Therefore, our work has great application potential in improving the accuracy of feature recognition.

TI  - Investigation of wildfire impacts on land surface phenology from MODIS time series in the western US forests
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) characterizes the timing and greenness of seasonal vegetation growth in satellite pixels and it has been widely used to associate with climate change. However, wildfire, causing considerable land surface changes, exerts abrupt changes on the LSP magnitudes and great influences on the LSP long-term trends, which are poorly investigated. This study for the first time conducted a systematic analysis of the wildfire impacts on LSP by investigating 838 forest wildfires occurred from 2002 to 2014 across the western United States. Specifically, we derived three LSP timing metrics that are the start (SOS), end (EOS), and length (LOS) of growing season and two LSP greenness metrics that are seasonal greenness maximum (GMax) and minimum (GMin) from daily time series of 250-m MODIS two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) during 2001-2015. Burned area and burn severity were obtained from the Monitoring Trends in Bum Severity project. The results showed GMax and GMin were decreased at an extent of 0.063 and 0.074 EVI2, respectively. LSP timings presented diverse responses to wildfire occurrences. Absolute abrupt shift of > 2 days in SOS appeared in 73% of burned areas with 40% advances and 33% delays, the shift in EOS occurred in 80% of burned areas with 33% advances and 47% delays, and the shift in LOS occurred in 85% of the burned areas with 36% shortening and 49% lengthening. Moreover, the LSP changes were significantly influenced by burn severity with the largest impact on LSP timing at the moderate burn severity and on LSP greenness at the high burn severity. Finally, the phenological trends from 2001 to 2015 differed significantly between burned and unburned reference areas and the trend difference varied with the wildfire occurrence year. Overall, this study demonstrated that wildfires exert complex and diverse impacts on LSP timing and greenness metrics and significantly influence LSP trends associating with climate change. The approach developed in this study provides a prototype to investigate LSP responses to other land disturbances associated with natural processes and human activities on the landscape.

AB  - With the advances of satellite remote sensing techniques, we are receiving huge amount of satellite observation data for the Earth. While the data greatly helps Earth scientists on their research, conducting data processing and analytics from the data is getting more and more time consuming and complicated. One common data processing task is to aggregate satellite observation data from original pixel level to latitude-longitude grid level to easily obtain global information and work with global climate models. This paper focuses on how to best aggregate NASA MODIS satellite data products from pixel level to grid level in a distributed environment and provision the aggregation capability as a service for Earth scientists to use easily. We propose three different approaches of parallel data aggregation and employ three parallel platforms (Spark, Dask and MPI) to implement the approaches. We run extensive experiments based on these parallel approaches and platforms on a local cluster to benchmark their differences in execution performance and discuss key factors to achieve good speedup. We also study how to make the provisioned service adaptable to different service libraries and protocols via a unified framework.

T2  - 2020 CHINESE AUTOMATION CONGRESS (CAC 2020)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)
CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - In this study, we propose a hybrid weakly supervised segmentation learning approach which employs a ship detection network and a novel segmentation process. First, two robust training strategies, creating soft labels and adding an extra regularization about the predicted probability of ship existence are proposed to train the ship detection network, which can alleviate the phenomenon of DNNS over fitting noisy and missing annotations. Then, OTSU is used to get Gaussian-g(A)(0) mixture model-driven results on the parameter maps which are estimated by the VAE network and data-driven results on the original ROI data. By merging the two kinds of results, we can take the advantage of pixel-level information which can consider more structural details but is easily influenced by the speckle noise and the advantage of model-level information which can smooth the effect of the speckle noise. Our results demonstrate the accuracy of our algorithms regarding experiments on real Gaofen-3 SAR data which includes different complex sea conditions.

AB  - Cloud detection is one of the most important tasks and key technologies during remote sensing image processing. This paper presented a cloud detection method based on multi-temporal thermal infrared data. Compared with traditional methods, this method could not only provide a better discrimination of cloud-free and cloud-cover pixels, but also have the anti-interference ability for snow. Landsat8 data around Beijing and Hotan district were selected for checking the accuracy of this method. The validation results showed that this method could extract cloud boundary accurately, and had a good extraction effect for thin clouds. Most important of all, it could accurately distinguish cloud pixels from snow cover. Whether in flat areas or mountain areas, for thick clouds or scattered thin clouds, the overall accuracy of this method could be always kept above 95%. This showed that the proposed method would have a very broad application prospect in cloud detection of remote sensing images.

AB  - Regional crop production prediction is a significant component of national food security assessment. Crop growth models are successfully applicable for yield estimation in simple point scale, however, they are hampered by the deriving of regional crop key input parameters. The World Food Studies (WOFOST) model had been used to express the characteristic of time series LAI in crop growth season in the study area. To solve the system errors of coarse resolution data extracted LAI due to the mixed pixels effect, the corrected LAI was implemented by combining the field measured LAI data and the HJ-LAI temporal trend information. Time-series LAI was assimilated through combined corrected HJ-LAI and WOFOST simulated LAI during the whole growth stage with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm. The assimilated optimal LAI was used to drive the WOFOST model per-pixel to estimate the regional yield. Scheduling the assimilation of different step length observed quantities, comparing the accuracy and the efficiency of the assimilation at different time scale, we selected the proper time scale of the assimilation. The results indicated that selecting the time scale of the step length between 10 days and 16 days was more appropriate. Compared with the statistical yield, the coefficient of determination was 0.66 and RMSE was 1.61 ton/hm. The results showed that assimilation of the remotely sensed data into crop growth model with EnKF can provide a reliable approach for estimate regional crop yield and had great potential in agricultural applications.

AB  - CDAG (Cloud Detection Algotirhm-Generating method) is a technology that can generate cloud detection algorithm automatically for multispectral satellite sensor based on hyper spectral and high-resolution remote sensing data. It effectively overcomes the problem of large error and poor stability caused by insufficient consideration of surface complexity in traditional threshold cloud detection method. It has shown high accuracy for cloud detection from several multispectral satellite sensor. Based on the parameter of GF-1WFV(Wide field-of-view) camera, the cloud detection algorithm is generated based on AVIRIS data. The results were verified by visual interpretation, and shows that the method can achieve high accuracy and stability for cloud detection from GF-1WFV with only four channels in visible and near infrared bands.

AB  - In this study, we developed a new SAR/InSAR-based land-cover classification algorithm for estimating surface roughness, a key parameter that is critical for accurate compound flood modeling. We successfully classified the Greater Houston area and New Orleans into nine classes with distinct surface roughness using L-band ALOS PALSAR-1 data. The ALOS-derived surface roughness estimates show an excellent agreement with those derived from NOAA's Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP, 2010) land-cover classification data acquired around the same time. The new algorithm allows us to fill the temporal gaps in the existing surface roughness database. The radar-derived surface roughness estimates will be fed into the the Advanced Circulation (AD-CIRC) modeling framework to understand the compound flood risk associated with rapid land-cover changes due to urban expansion over the last decade.

TI  - Investigating the Influence of Registration Errors on the Patch-Based Spatio-Temporal Fusion Method
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal fusion is a common approach in remote sensing, used to create time-series image data with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. However, geometric registration error, which is a common problem in remote sensing relative to the ground reference, is a particular problem for multiresolution remote sensing data, especially for images with very different spatial resolutions (e.g., Landsat and MODIS images). Registration error can, thus, have a significant impact on the accuracy of spatio-temporal fusion. To the best of our knowledge, however, almost no effective solutions have been provided to-date to cope with this important issue. This article demonstrates the robustness to registration error of the existing SParse representation-based spatio-temporal reflectance fusion model (SPSTFM). Different to conventional methods that are performed on a per-pixel basis, SPSTFM utilizes image patches as the basic unit. We demonstrate theoretically that the effect of registration error on patch-based methods is smaller than for pixel-based methods. Experimental results show that SPSTFM is highly robust to registration error and is far more accurate under various registration errors relative to pixel-based methods. The advantage is shown to be greater for heterogeneous regions than for homogeneous regions, and is large for the fusion of normalized difference vegetation index data. SPSTFM, thus, offers the remote sensing community a crucial tool to overcome one of the longest standing challenges to the effective fusion of remote sensing image time-series.

For seasonal averaged proportions of AOD in PBLH, the peak value over land appears in MAM (74.1%) with the valley value in DJF (65.4%). Over ocean, the values appear in DJF (76.1%) and MAM (71%), correspondingly. As for seasonal averaged AODs, the peak value over land appears in JJA (0.236) with the valley value in DJF (0.16). Over ocean, the corresponding values respectively appear in MAM (0.138) and SON (0.131).

TI  - Combination of AIRS Dual CO<sub>2</sub> Absorption Bands to Develop an Ice Clouds Detection Algorithm in Different Atmospheric Layers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of infrared (IR) sensors to detect clouds in different layers of the atmosphere is a big challenge, especially for ice clouds. This study aims to improve ice cloud detection using Lin's algorithm and apply it to Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). To achieve these objectives, the scattering and emission characteristics of clouds as perceived by AIRS longwave infrared (LWIR, similar to 15 mu m) and shortwave infrared (SWIR, similar to 4.3 mu m) CO2 absorption bands are applied for ice cloud detection. Hence, the weighting function peak (WFP), cut-off pressure, and correlation coefficients between the brightness temperatures (BTs) of LWIR and SWIR channels are used to pair the LWIR and SWIR channels. After that, the linear relationship between the clear-sky BTs of the paired LWIR and SWIR channels is established by the cloud scattering and emission Index (CESI). However, the linear relationship fails in the presence of ice clouds. Comparing these results with collocated Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) observations show that the probability of detection of ice clouds for Pair-8 (WFP similar to 330hPa), Pair-19 (WFP similar to 555hPa), and Pair-24 (WFP similar to 866hPa) are 0.63, 0.71, and 0.73 in the daytime and 0.46, 0.62, and 0.7 in the nighttime at a false alarm rate of 0.1 when ice clouds top pressure above 330 hPa, 555 hPa, and 866 hPa, respectively. Furthermore, the thresholds of the three pairs are 2.4 K, 3 K, and 8.7 K in the daytime and 1.7 K, 1.7 K, and 4.4 K in the nighttime at the highest Heike Skill Score (HSS). The error of HSS values based on thresholds of ice clouds is between 0.01 and 0.02 which is comparable with the ice cloud detection results in both day and night conditions. It is shown that Pair-8 (WFP similar to 330hPa) can detect opaque and thick ice clouds above its WFP altitude over the tropical areas but it is unable to observe ice clouds over the mid-latitude while Pair-19 and Pair-24 can identify ice clouds above their WFP altitude.

AB  - Decade years of efforts on the retrieval of soil moisture based on radiative transfer model have largely improved the accuracy of soil moisture (SM). This paper focus on the other parameter, namely vegetation optical depth (VOD). We retrieved X-band VOD from AMSR-E and AMSR2 observations by inverting the L-MEB model (Wigneron et al. 2007 [1]) at X-band, considering that SM was known. As SM input to the L-MEB inversion we used the ECMWF SM product. This step avoids correlation between VOD and SM retrievals from the mono-angular AMSR-E observations. In a first step we evaluated the retrieved VOD with the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) LAI. The evaluation results indicate our model has a great potential for VOD retrievals from AMSR-E/2 satellite data.

TI  - An Efficient Framework for Producing Landsat-Based Land Surface Temperature Data Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A long time-series land surface temperature (LST) product is useful for ecological and environmental studies. However, current LST products cannot provide a global coverage at a fine spatial resolution (similar to 100 m) over a long period (>30 years). Landsat series satellites that have been launched since 1972 provide a unique opportunity to fill the gap. Here, we proposed a single-channel framework for producing global long time-series Landsat LST retrievals on a Google earth engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. This framework unifies the LST, land surface emissivity (LSE) and atmospheric water vapor (AWV) estimation algorithms, as well as the emissivity and atmospheric input data for the Landsat LST retrievals from the entire Landsat thermal infrared image archive. In situ LST measurements and the MODIS LST products were employed to evaluate Landsat LST retrievals using the proposed framework over land and water surfaces, respectively. In total, 1317 clear-sky LST samples were collected from the Landsat 5-8 series after spatiotemporal registration with seven sites, and the average bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were 0.33 and 2.01 K, respectively. Intercomparison between Landsat and MODIS LST retrievals based on 100 clear-sky scenes over 12 inland lakes showed an average bias of 0.17 K and RMSE of 1.11 K. We conclude that the proposed single-channel framework can produce Landsat LST with high accuracy following a simple yet robust way. Implementation of the single-channel method on GEE shows promise in providing the community with freely accessible and global long time-series (>30 years) LST data.

TI  - A Deep Siamese Network with Hybrid Convolutional Feature Extraction Module for Change Detection Based on Multi-sensor Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information extraction from multi-sensor remote sensing images has increasingly attracted attention with the development of remote sensing sensors. In this study, a supervised change detection method, based on the deep Siamese convolutional network with hybrid convolutional feature extraction module (OB-DSCNH), has been proposed using multi-sensor images. The proposed architecture, which is based on dilated convolution, can extract the deep change features effectively, and the character of "network in network" increases the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. The change decision model is utilized to detect changes through the difference of extracted features. Finally, a change detection map is obtained via an uncertainty analysis, which combines the multi-resolution segmentation, with the output from the Siamese network. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conducted experiments on multispectral images collected by the ZY-3 and GF-2 satellites. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable and better performance than mainstream methods in multi-sensor images change detection.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Mixed Noise Denoising with Noise Parameter Estimation

CP  - 5th International Symposium of Space Optical Instruments and Applications

AB  - Images acquired by optical remote sensing often suffer from noise, due to low-light conditions and long distances from the object. Noise introduces undesirable effects such as artifacts, unrealistic edges, unseen lines and corners, blurred objects and disturbed background scenes, and decreasing the performance of visual and computational analysis.The great majority of denoising methods only focus on single noise type, and mostly assume additive Gaussian white noise. However, in practice, according to the different sources of noise during the capturing process, the real image noise may be composed of noises from several different distributions, i.e., Poisson distribution from shot noise and dark current, Gaussian distribution from readout noise, etc. Thus, it is hard to model complex noise with a single noise model, which therefore limits the practical performance of image denoiser for real captured images. To address this problem, we propose a deep residual network with parameter estimation to model and remove mixed noises of remote sensing data, with no noise type and noise level information.In this chapter, a deep convolutional neural network based framework is proposed to implement both noise estimation and noise removing. The framework is composed of noise estimator module and denoiser module. The noise estimator module is used to estimate the noise distribution characteristics of the input image, which are used to synthesize the noisy dataset for the training of the denoiser module. After training, the denoiser module can then denoise the input image specifically for that noise characteristic of the input image. Besides, we use some advanced designment to improve the performance of the network like residual learning, skip connections, and perceptual loss. Our model works for both given noise types and others without taking into account in training process, and for the latter case we test the model on the noise mixed with different types, i.e., shot noise, Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, speckle noise, dark current, and quantization noise, covering most of the common noise types in practical situation. The estimated noise distribution according to the proposed estimator is compared with the ground truth to validate the performance of the estimator. We also compare the proposed method with the existing denoising methods, including both the traditional algorithm (i.e., BM3D (Dabov et al , IEEE Trans Image Process 16:2080-2095, 2007)) and the deep neural network (i.e., DnCNN (Zhang et al., IEEE Trans Image Process 26:3142-3155, 2017)). Experimental results showed that our method outperforms these state-of-the-art methods in both PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) and SSIM (structural similarity index).

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial downscaling is an ill-posed, inverse problem, and information loss (IL) inevitably exists in the predictions produced by any downscaling technique. The recently popularized area-to-point kriging (ATPK)-based downscaling approach can account for the size of support and the point spread function (PSF) of the sensor, and moreover, it has the appealing advantage of the perfect coherence property. In this article, based on the advantages of ATPK and the conceptualization of IL, an IL-guided image fusion (ILGIF) approach is proposed. ILGIF uses the fine spatial resolution images acquired in other wavelengths to predict the IL in ATPK predictions based on the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, which accounts for the spatial variation in land cover. ILGIF inherits all the advantages of ATPK, and its prediction has perfect coherence with the original coarse spatial resolution data which can be demonstrated mathematically. ILGIF was validated using two data sets and was shown in each case to predict downscaled images more accurately than the compared benchmark methods.

CL  - Florence, ITALY
AB  - The inshore ship detection of SAR image is a challenging task, due to inherent speckle noise, complex land background interference, identifiable sea clutter and few available shape feature. In this paper, we propose a context semantic perception method based on superpixel segmentation for inshore ship detection in SAR image. Firstly, the sea-land segmentation is used to quickly locate candidate regions, the ocean regions and buffer regions on both sides of the coastline are reserved, after that, the maximum stable extremum region (MSER) method is used for pre-screening. Then, the background slice of each candidate target is performed superpixel segmentation to extract contextual semantic information, to identify the inshore ships and false alarms. The Sentinel-1 spaceborne SAR images covering a coastal region are used to verify the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can realize accurate inshore ship detection under the complex sea-land mixed background.

AB  - In SAR image target detection, harbor detection can help the detection of harbor targets and maritime traffic planning. In this paper, we propose a harbor detection method of SAR images based on multidirectional one-dimensional scanning. Take the candidate points along the coastline and the multidirectional one-dimensional scanning is performed. Using the distribution characteristics of land, sea and dock in the one-dimensional vector, training a convolutional neural network to classify the candidate points into harbor and non-harbor feature points. Then we get the harbor feature points map reflecting the distribution of harbors. The Sentinel-1 space-borne SAR images covering a coastal region are used to verify the proposed method. The experimental results show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET), including soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration, is a vital component of the water cycle and energy exchange. The end-member-based soil and vegetation energy partitioning approach (ESVEP model) for estimating ET is the first model considering the differing responses of soil water content at the upper surface layer and at the deeper root zone layer. In this paper, we have improved the ESVEP model by 1) improving estimates of canopy resistance from three parts: stomatal conductance, cuticular conductance and leaf boundary-layer conductance; 2) adding the influence of atmosphere pressure and atmosphere temperature on resistance; 3) dividing aerodynamic resistance into convective resistance and radiative heat transfer resistance. Compared to the original ESVEP model, the improved algorithm is more applicable for different biome types and has a great potential in operational estimation of regional and global evapotranspiration. Due to the underestimation of soil temperature, the estimated ET is biased, which means that the biome properties and resistance are required to be further reparameterized in future study.

AB  - State-of-the-art deep learning methods require large quantities of labeled data pairs for high performance. While satellite data is now available in abundance, ground truth labels remain scarce. Moreover, ground truth labels are distributed unevenly around the globe; high-resource regions (e.g. US, Europe) have many more labels than low-resource regions (e.g. Africa, parts of Asia). We hypothesize that a great deal of information can be shared across tasks involving satellite imagery, due to shared image acquisition and similarities in landscapes and objects worldwide. Meta-learning is a machine learning discipline in which models are explicitly trained to adapt to new tasks with few labeled data pairs per task. In this work, we use model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to train a neural network on tasks from high-resource regions to improve land cover classification accuracies in low-resource regions. We observe that a meta-learned neural network outperforms both the same network trained from scratch and the network pretrained on high-resource data and finetuned on low-resource data.

TI  - Weakly Supervised Deep Learning for Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate automated segmentation of remote sensing data could benefit applications from land cover mapping and agricultural monitoring to urban development surveyal and disaster damage assessment. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when segmenting natural images with huge labeled datasets, their successful translation to remote sensing tasks has been limited by low quantities of ground truth labels, especially fully segmented ones, in the remote sensing domain. In this work, we perform cropland segmentation using two types of labels commonly found in remote sensing datasets that can be considered sources of "weak supervision": (1) labels comprised of single geotagged points and (2) image-level labels. We demonstrate that (1) a U-Net trained on a single labeled pixel per image and (2) a U-Net image classifier transferred to segmentation can outperform pixel-level algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest. While the high performance of neural networks is well-established for large datasets, our experiments indicate that U-Nets trained on weak labels outperform baseline methods with as few as 100 labels. Neural networks, therefore, can combine superior classification performance with efficient label usage, and allow pixel-level labels to be obtained from image labels.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of MODIS Land Surface Temperature Based on Geographically Weighted Autoregressive Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter in numerous thermal environmental studies. Due to technical constraints, satellite thermal sensors are unable to supply thermal infrared images with simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution. LST downscaling algorithms can alleviate this problem and improve the spatiotemporal resolution of LST data. Spatial nonstationary and spatial autocorrelation coexist in most spatial variables. The spatial characteristics of the LST should be fully considered as a spatial variable in the downscaling process. However, previous studies on LST downscaling considered only spatial nonstationary, and spatial autocorrelation was neglected. In this article, we propose a new algorithm based on the geographically weighted autoregressive (GWAR) model for LST spatial downscaling. The digital elevation model and normalized difference build-up index were chosen as explanatory variables to downscale the spatial resolution of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer LST data from 1000 to 100 m, and Lanzhou and Beijing were taken as the study areas. The performance of the GWAR model was compared with that of the thermal data sharpening (TsHARP) model and the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The Landsat 8 LST was used to verify the downscaled LST. The results indicate that the GWAR-based algorithm outperforms the TsHARP- and GWR-based algorithms with lower root mean square error (Beijing: 1.37 degrees C, Lanzhou: 1.76 degrees C) and mean absolute error (Beijing: 0.86 degrees C, Lanzhou: 1.33 degrees C).

AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a weak optical signal emitted by chlorophyll under natural illumination. SIF ranges from 600 nm to 800 nm and is assumed as a direct proxy for actual photosynthesis. Due to recent advances in spectroscopy and retrieval techniques, SIF can be retrieved from hyperspectral remote sensing data. Statistical-based approach, typically the singular value decomposition (SVD) method, is one of the two practical strategies for SIF retrieval. A statistical-based approach collects SIF-free measurements of Fraunhofer Lines as training dataset, extracts their spectral features by a statistical approach and then applies the extracted features in the forward SIF retrieval model. In this paper, we first evaluated the performance of the SVD approach in SIF retrieval at proximal scale. Good consistency was found between diurnal SIF cycles given by the SVD method and a 3-FLD method, with SVD-based SIF values higher than those given by 3-FLD. We then applied the SVD method on HyPlant imaging spectroscopy airborne data. Spatial distribution of SIF was successfully depicted using the SVD method. SIF was in a good spatial accordance with NDVI, but the former exhibited a stronger heterogeneity. For both proximal and airborne scales, the in-filling of the Fraunhofer Lines by SIF was successfully detected by the SVD method. However, whether SVD could induce a systematic error should be further studied. It can be concluded that a statistical-based SIF retrieval method is a reasonable alternative to traditional O-2-lines-based methods, especially when synchronous SIF-free spectrum or pixel-wise atmospheric correction is unavailable.

AB  - Early warning of cyanobacteria bloom is very important for water ecological management of lakes. Thus, Based on Landsat8 OLI data, combining the trophic state index (TSI), cyanobacteria and macrophytes index (CMI) and floating algae index (FAT), we proposed a risk zoning framework of cyanobacteria bloom, and applied it in Lake Longgan (China). Eutrophication frequency of Lake Longgan has worsened since 2017. But the maximum eutrophication proportion occurred on 16 February 2016. With a deeper analysis on 16 February 2016, we find that the risk area of cyanobacteria bloom in Lake Longgan is distributed horizontally from the east bank to the center of the lake, and mostly is mid risk. High risk areas are mainly distributed in the east coast, showing a southwest direction. Therefore, the proposed risk zoning framework provides a useful approach to obtain the pre-warning information of cyanobacteria bloom in some Eutrophic and macrophytic lakes.

AB  - A high-frame-rate charge-coupled device (CCD) capable of operating at 500 frames per second (fps) was designed and prototyped. It has a 400 x 300 split frame transfer CCD area array with 26 mu m x 26 mu m photosensitive elements and 420 ke(-) full well capacity. The device was originally developed for the Lightning Mapping Imager (LMI) on China's latest and most powerful weather satellite FengYun-4 (FY-4). It has a total area array of 408 (H) x 304 (V) with dark elements, where eight outputs are settled on two sides of the device. The active photosensitive area is about 11.3 mm x 11.3 mm. According to its feature of high dynamic range and 2 ms frame period (which nearly equals to the duration of a single lightning event), the Lightning Mapping Imager can map total lightning activity on the Chinese and surrounding territory continuously day and night. This will facilitate forecasting severe thunderstorms and typhoon activity, and convective weather impacts on aviation safety and efficiency.

TI  - Estimation of Water-Use Efficiency Based on Satellite for the Typical Croplands
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources become scarce due to the melting of glaciers caused by climate change, and water pollution caused by human activities and overuse of freshwater resources are aggravating this phenomenon. Cropland is an essential part of the terrestrial ecosystem, and it is of great importance to make rational use of the limited water resources to have higher water use efficiency (WUE). The quantitative estimation of the ecosystem WUE and tracking its dynamics of croplands is crucial for addressing the impact of future climate change on crop production. Scaling up field observations of flux towers to a large scale remains a challenge and there are few reports on estimating WUE directly from remote sensing data. This study examined the main environmental factors that contribute to changes in WUE of typical crops, and found that the EVI showed strong correlation with the ecosystem WUE of typical croplands, which can be developed to track ecosystem WUE. This study proposed an alternative method exclusively based on MODIS EVI data analysis with an R-2 of nearly 0.90 and a small RMSE, which was much better than the calculations of the MODIS GPP and ET products, and provided an accessible method for modelling the ecosystem WUE to effectively manage water use in croplands.

TI  - A method for monitoring solar diffuser's bidirectional reflectance distribution function degradation in geostationary orbit
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The advanced geosynchronous radiation imager (AGRI) is a geostationary sensor whose reflective solar band is calibrated by a solar diffuser (SD). The SD bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) degrades over time in the space environment. This degradation can be measured through the SD reflectance degradation monitor (SDRDM). The SDRDM calibration data are normally collected by three filtered detectors, covering wavelengths from 0.45 mu m to 0.90 mu m. The SD reflectance degradation can be derived by trending the ratio of the background-subtracted solar-angle corrected SDRDM sun and SD view responses. The conventional monitoring methods rely on geometry factors of the sun view port and the relative BRDF of the SD, and these parameters can cause uncertainties. Aiming at these uncertain factors, the present study collects calibration data at the same solar angle. This method compares the detector digital counts obtained at different times but with the same solar angle. Consequently, it cancels out the angle-dependent parameter to obtain the ratio of the BRDF degradation factors. The obtained results show that monitoring uncertainty of the proposed method is less than 0.18%, while the corresponding monitoring error is less than 0.66%. This method can be applicated in SD's BRDF monitoring.

AB  - At present, remote sensing images are mutually restricted in temporal and spatial resolution. A single satellite sensor cannot obtain remote sensing images with both high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. Spatiotemporal fusion of remote sensing images is a promising method to solve this issue. The spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) is a widely-accepted method for spatiotemporal fusion. However, STARFM selects similar pixels in a regular rectangular window. This neighborhood window has many different land cover types, which leads to wrong selection of similar pixels. Therefore, we develop a novel spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model based on superpixel, denote by S-STARFM. In the proposed method, the target pixels to be predicted are divided into two categories, including changed pixels and unchanged pixels. Then the superpixels are used to improve the selection of similar pixels. To verify the effectiveness of S-STARFM, the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data are used to generate high spatiotemporal resolution images. The prediction image accuracy shows that the proposed method outperforms the STARFM.

TI  - Woodland Labeling in Chenzhou, China, via Deep Learning Approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to complete the task of the woodland census in Chenzhou, China, this paper carries out a remote sensing survey on the terrain of this area to produce a data set, and used deep learning methods to label the woodland. There are two main improvements in our paper: Firstly, this paper comparatively analyzes the semantic segmentation effects of different deep learning models on remote sensing image datasets in Chenzhou. Secondly, this paper proposed a dense fully convolutional network (DFCN) which combines dense network with FCN model and achieves good semantic segmentation effect. DFCN method is used to label the woodland in Gaofen-2 (GF-2) remote sensing images in Chenzhou. Under the same experimental conditions, the labeling results are compared with the original FCN, SegNet, dilated convolutional network, and so on. In these experiments, the global pixel accuracy of DFCN is 91.5%, and the prediction accuracy of the "woodland" class is 93%, both of them perform better than that of the other methods. In other indicators, our method also has better performance. Using the method of this paper, we have completed the land feature labeling of Chenzhou area and provided it to customers.

AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key variable to describe the energy, mass and momentum exchange between the surface and the planetary boundary layer. Remote sensing technology can quickly acquire the change of LAI on a large scale and provide support for the study of ecological environment and climate change. Due to the complexity of the surface and atmospheric structure, the inversion of LAI is still facing great difficulties. Limited by the information provided by remote sensing sensors and the ability of information mining by traditional methods, the accuracy of LAI inversion is not high. In order to improve the accuracy of LAI inversion, a method of LAI inversion based on deep belief network (DBN) is proposed in this paper and is applied to the MODIS data. Results are verified by the ground measurements performed within the framework of the ImagineS (Implementing Multi-Scale Agricultural Indicators Exploiting Sentinels) project, and shows that the LAI obtained by the DBN algorithm (hereinafter referred to as DBN LAI) can reach a high precision, and performs better than current MODIS LAI product (MCD15A2).

TI  - Analysis of surface deformation and driving forces in Lanzhou
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface deformation has become an important factor affecting urban development. Lanzhou is an important location in the Belt and Road Initiative, an international development policy implemented by the Chinese government. Because of rapid urbanization in Lanzhou, surface deformation occurs easily. However, the spatial-temporal characteristics of surface deformation and the interaction of driving forces behind surface deformation in Lanzhou are unclear. This paper uses small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technology to obtain the spatial-temporal characteristics of surface deformation in Lanzhou based on 32 Sentinel-1A data from March 2015 to January 2017. We further employ a geographical detector (geo-detector) to analyze the driving forces (single-factor effects and multifactor interactions) of surface deformation. The results show that the central urban area of Lanzhou was stable, while there was surface deformation around Nanhuan road, Dongfanghong Square, Jiuzhou, Country Garden, Dachaiping, Yujiaping, Lanzhou North Freight Yard, and Liuquan Town. The maximum deformation rate was -26.50 mm year(-1), and the maximum rate of increase was 9.80 mm year(-1). The influence factors of surface deformation in Lanzhou was a complex superposition relationship among various influencing factors, not a result of the single factor. The interaction between the built-up area and land cover types was the most important factor behind surface deformation in Lanzhou. This paper provides the reference data and scientific foundation for disaster prevention in Lanzhou.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Fire Emissions in Southwest China from 2013 to 2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fire emissions have a great impact on local air quality and the global climate. However, the current and detailed regional forest fire emissions inventories remain poorly studied. Here we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to estimate monthly emissions from forest fires at a spatial resolution of 500 m x 500 m in southwest China from 2013 to 2017. The spatial and seasonal variations of forest fire emissions were then analyzed at the provincial level. The results showed that the annual average emissions of CO2, CO, CH4, SO2, NH3, NOX, PM, black carbon, organic carbon, and non-methane volatile organic compounds from forest fires were 1423.19 x 10(3), 91.66 x 10(3), 4517.08, 881.07, 1545.04, 1268.28, 9838.91, 685.55, 7949.48, and 12,724.04 Mg, respectively. The forest fire emissions characteristics were consistent with the characteristics of forest fires, which show great spatial and temporal diversity. Higher pollutant emissions were concentrated in Yunnan and Tibet, with peak emissions occurring in spring and winter. Our work provides a better understanding of the spatiotemporal representation of regional forest fire emissions and basic data for forest fire management departments and related research on pollution and emissions controls. This method will also provide guidance for other areas to develop high-resolution regional forest fire emissions inventories.

AB  - Highly frequent wildfires are observed every year in Yunnan province, China This study investigated the smoke injection height in a wildfire event using multi-source remote sensing data in Yunnan. The wildfire event was identified and characterized by combining MODIS and Landsat-8 data. The smoke injection height of the event and the vertical profile of smoke aerosol were inferred from CALIPSO data. The results showed that although the burned areas were only 167.67 ha, the maximum smoke injection height of the wildfire event can reach approximately 4.63 km above sea level. In addition, by comparing the smoke injection height with that of other types of fire events, we found that the plumes of the wildfire event in Yunnan were the most likely candidates for injecting smoke into the five troposphere and producing smoke transport. This study has significant implications for understanding the impact of wildfire smoke plumes on air quality in Yunnan.

TI  - Patterns and causes of changes in water level and volume in Tangra Yumco from 1988 to 2018 based on Landsat images and Sentinel-3A synthetic aperture radar
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explored the feasibility of using water level data from a single short-time satellite source to estimate long-term changes in lake water volumes. Combined with Sentinel-3A synthetic aperture radar altimeter ( SRAL) in 2016-2018 and lake water areas extracted from Landsat satellites during 1988-2018, the relationship between water level change and water area change in non-glacial period of 2016-2018 and the water volume estimation formula were used to analysis the inter-annual changes of water level and water volume from 1988 to 2018, the intra-annual change from 2001 to 2018 and the main causes of such changes. Results show that lake area, water level and water volume of Tangra Yumco rose significantly in the past three decades, increased respectively by 21.1 km(2), 5.29 m and 4.47 billion m(3) from 1988 to 2018. Although declines in the lake area and water level and water volume decreased during 1988-1998, the lake expanded during 2000-2018, exhibiting the characteristics of the dry and wet seasons during the period of 2001-2018. From 1996 to 2014/2015, the lake water volume change was from 3.83 billion to 3.55 billion m(3). Such water volume changes are in good agreement with previous research. Lake expansion occurs in the southeastern and mid-western regions where the underground-water terrain is gentle. Based on the data from global land surface data assimilation system (GLDAS) and glacier snow lines, both the changes in precipitation and air temperature exhibited strong correlations (with R-2 of 0.613 and 0.845, respectively) with the changes of water volume over the period 2008-2018. The wet season of lakes was significantly affected by precipitation and air temperature. This study shows the potential of sentinel-3A SYNTHETIC aperture radar data in the estimation of lake water quantity change, and provides a basis for the estimation of lake water quantity change in a long time series by using a single satellite radar data with only short-term data.

TI  - An Adaptive Snow Identification Algorithm in the Forests of Northeast China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Northeast China is one of the primary snow-covered regions, and its forest coverage is over 40%. Forest snow identification is usually a challenging problem, and the SNOMAP algorithm tends to underestimate the amount of snow cover in forest regions for the lower normalized difference snow index. In this article, an improved method of the snow-cover identification based on the Landsat operational land imager is proposed. One improvement includes using the normalized difference forest snow index (NDFSI) to discriminate between snow-covered and snow-free forests. The threshold value of the NDFSI in different forest types is set according to the normalized difference vegetation index. On the other hand, the sun elevation is very low in winter in Northeast China with high latitude; as a result, the snow in shadow areas is usually classified as liquid water for its low near-infrared reflectance in the current SNOMAP algorithm. Then, another improvement is introducing the land surface temperature, which is retrieved from the thermal infrared band to distinguish liquid water from snow in shadow areas. We applied this improved method to evaluate forest areas in the Daxinganling, Xiaoxinganling, and Changbai Mountain areas in different seasons. The total classification accuracy reached 97.5%, and the pixels that introduce omission error and commission error were mainly distributed in areas of dense forest shadows. This improved method retains the computational simplicity and effectiveness of the SNOMAP algorithm in nonforest areas and improves the underestimation of snow cover in forest regions and shadow areas.

TI  - Change Detection Based on Low-Level to High-Level Features Integration With Limited Samples
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed land cover change in multitemporal images is an important application for earth science. Many techniques have been proposed to solve this problem in different ways. However, accurately identifying changes still remains a challenge due to the difficulties in describing the characteristics of various change categories by using single-level features. In this article, a multilevel feature representation framework was designed to build robust feature set for complex change detection task. First, four different levels of information from low level to high level, including pixel-level, neighborhood-level, object-level, and scene-level features, were extracted. Through the operation of extracting different level features from multitemporal images, the differences between them can be described comprehensively. Second, multilevel features were fused to reduce the dimension and then used as the input for supervised change detector with initial limited labels. Finally, for reducing the labeling cost and improving the change detection results simultaneously, active learning was conducted to select the most informative samples for labeling, and this step together with the previous steps were iteratively conducted to improve the results in each round. Experimental results of three pairs of real remote sensing datasets demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy. Moreover, the influences of scene scale for high-level semantic features in the proposed approach on change detection performance were also analyzed and discussed.

TI  - Spatial Scaling of Forest Aboveground Biomass Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of aboveground forest biomass (AGB) at a large scale is important in global carbon cycle, forest productivity, and climate change. Coarse resolution remote sensing data of long time series are often used to estimate large scale AGB, but the result is inaccurate due to the scaling effect caused by nonlinearity in data representation and the existence of mixed pixels containing different forest types and land uses. Improvement in the accuracy of AGB estimated from coarse resolution remote sensing data is urgently needed. Research on spatial scaling of AGB is still lacking, therefore, this article proposed an approach based on structural analysis of mixed pixels and the Random Forest model (SMPRF) to increase the accuracy of AGB estimated from coarse resolution data. MODIS and SPOT 5 data were used to create forest biomass distribution maps of the study area at two scales. The scaling effect on estimating forest biomass based on remote sensing was analyzed by comparing data from these two datasets. SMPRF, which included a correction factor for the scaling effect on AGB estimated from coarse resolution MODIS data, was used to create a model that scaled from the fine resolution data (SPOT 5) to the coarse resolution data (MODIS). The results showed that the accuracy of AGB estimated from MODIS data was increased using this method. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) for data verification increased from 0.63 to 0.89 and the root mean squared error decreased from 51.6 Mg.ha(-1) to 26.8 Mg.ha(-1). The difference tests showed that the changes were extremely significant (p = 0). Thus, SMPRF can significantly improve the accuracy of large scale AGB estimation based on coarse resolution remote sensing data and the feasibility of applying the method proposed in this study to related fields is verified.

TI  - Extraction of urban building damage using spectral, height and corner information from VHR satellite images and airborne LiDAR data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation-based damage assessment has been widely studied in recent years. Considering that the height and spatial variability of buildings change significantly in earthquake-devastated areas, a novel multi-stage urban building damage extraction method that uses bi-temporal spectral, height and corner information is proposed in this study. The post-event height features were directly derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, whereas pre-event height features were generated using pre-event stereo-paired images from different satellites. The spatial features were quantified using the density of corner points (DCP) in spectral images. The proposed method of urban building damage extraction is summarised as follows. Bi-temporal height and corner features were first generated from bi-temporal very high resolution (VHR) satellite data and post-event airborne LiDAR data. Then, vegetation, bare land (pavement and soil) and shadow were extracted from post-event VHR image and height data, and masked out. Finally, building damage was extracted from the remaining areas using the height difference and DCP difference between pre- and post-event images. A post-processing procedure was used to further refine the initial extraction results. The proposed method was evaluated using bi-temporal VHR images and post-event LiDAR data collected in Port au Prince, Haiti, which was heavily hit by an earthquake in January 2010. The results showed that the proposed method significantly outperformed the two comparative methods in the extraction of urban building damage.

AB  - Tropical cyclones (TCs) have caused heavy losses of human life and property. Hence, it is necessary to study TC. Additionally, the retrieval of wind direction is an important part among many researches of TC. Fortunately, Typhoon Iselle, Typhoon Nuri, and Tropical Storm Haima were captured by RADARSAT-2, Typhoon Hermine, Tropical Storm Harvey, and Super Typhoon Jose were captured by Sentinel-1A. In this paper, the wind directions of the six TCs are retrieved from SAR images by improved local gradient (ILG) method. The results show that the sea surface wind directions retrieved by ILG method have good correlation with the texture of the six TCs, respectively. This research is helpful for estimating wind speeds and constructing wind field of a TC.

TI  - Monitoring Crop Growth During the Period of the Rapid Spread of COVID-19 in China by Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The status of crop growth under the influence of COVID-19 is an important information for evaluating the current food security in China. This article used the cloud computing platform of Google Earth Engine, to access and analyze Sentinel-2, MODIS, and other multisource remote sensing data in the last five years to monitor the growth of crops in China, especially in Hubei province, during the period of the rapid spread of COVID-19 (i.e., from late January to mid-March 2020), and compared with the growth over the same period under similar climate conditions in the past four years. We further analyzed the indirect effects of COVID-19 on crop growth. The results showed that: the area of the crops with better growth (51%) was much more than that with worse growth (22%); the crops with better and worse growth were mainly distributed in the North China Plain (the main planting areas of winter wheat in China) and the South China regions (such as Guangxi, Guangdong province), respectively. The area of the crops with a similar growth occupied 27%. In Hubei province, the area of the crops with better growth (61%) was also more than that with worse growth (27%). It was found that there was no obvious effect from COVID-19 on the overall growth of crops in China during the period from late January to mid-March 2020 and the growth of crops was much better than that during the same period in previous years. The findings in this study are helpful in evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 on Chinas agriculture, which are conducive to serve the relevant agricultural policy formulation and to ensure food security.

AB  - In this paper, we describe the formatting guidelines for ACM SIG Proceedings. With the development of social economy, smart cities, especially green energy-saving buildings, are foremost trend in the future. The location of green buildings has a very important impact on the design and plan of future smart cities. The influence of the natural environment, especially that of the topography and landform on the location of architectural design is very significant. Google Earth (GE) platform can provide sufficient remote sensing data, which greatly interpret and promote surface information. However, just few people have done related research. This article takes Beijing as an example and uses Google Earth platform and the remote sensing data to obtain the 3D digital elevation model (DEM) data; and then Google earth's geomorphology data are used to analyze the landform features. Finally, by analyzing their characteristics and distribution features, five energy-saving building locations were selected in Beijing. It can be concluded that GE, is an effective and potential platform for providing remote sensing data, and analyzing the DEM and landform. The rational analysis of the building addresses in this paper could help the buildings to avoid potential geological disasters and make full use of natural resources. Moreover, this research on energy-efficient building addresses make a suggestion for future smart city planning.

TI  - Hybrid Remote Sensing Image Segmentation Considering Intrasegment Homogeneity and Intersegment Heterogeneity
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Image segmentation plays an indispensable role in geographic object-based image analysis, but it remains difficult to obtain meaningful geo-objects from landscape scenes. In recent years, hybrid segmentation methods using the split-and-merge strategy have gained considerable attention. One of the most popular hybrid segmentation methods is the combination of the watershed transformation and full lambda-schedule algorithm (FLSA). The FLSA method only considers the intersegment heterogeneity to calculate the merging cost but ignores the impact of intrasegment homogeneity on the merging cost, thus limiting the satisfactory segmentation quality. To overcome this limitation, this letter improved the FLSA method by enhancing within-segment homogeneity and between-segment heterogeneity. In this letter, the refined method was implemented on four different study regions from Gaofen-1 images and then compared with the FLSA and local spectral angle merging (LSAM) methods. Both visual analysis and quantitative evaluation results indicated that the refined method was more accurate in generating satisfactory segmentation than the competing methods.

TI  - A Modified Four-Component Decomposition Method With Refined Volume Scattering Models
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, a modified four-component decomposition method with refined volume scattering models is proposed for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image processing. In the new decomposition method, after the orientation angle compensation, the orientation angle is placed in the probability density functions. General forms of the volume scattering models and branch conditions can be obtained. Similar to the four-component scattering power decomposition with extended volume scattering model (S4R) proposed by Sato et al., refined volume scattering models can be used for various land covers based on the criteria. Since the orientation angles are contained in the refined volume scattering models, the oriented buildings can be discriminated from the vegetation areas and the overestimation problem of volume scattering is substantially overcome. In this article, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated by the spaceborne C-band Gaofen-3 data and airborne L-band E-SAR data. Several approaches are employed as a comparison of the proposed methods. Experimental results show that, compared with the existing decomposition methods, the proposed method can effectively represent the scattering characteristics of the ambiguous regions, and the double-bounce scattering contributions over the urban areas can be substantially enhanced.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The over estimation of volume scattering is an essential shortcoming of the model-based polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) target decomposition method. It is likely to affect the measurement accuracy and result in mixed ambiguity of the scattering mechanism. In this article, an extended adaptive four-component decomposition method with multiple thresholds is proposed. First, the orientation angle compensation is applied to the coherency matrix, and artificial areas are extracted as the basis for selecting the decomposition method. Second, for the decomposition of artificial areas, one of the two complex unitary transformation matrices of the coherency matrix is selected according to the wave anisotropy (A(w)). In addition, the branch condition that is used as a criterion for the hierarchical implementation decomposition is the ratio of the correlation coefficient (R-cc). Finally, the selected unitary transformation matrix and the discriminative threshold are used to determine the structure of the selected volume scattering models, which are more effective to adapt to various scattering mechanisms. In this article, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated on GaoFen-3 full PolSAR datasets for various time periods and regions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively represent the scattering characteristics of the ambiguous regions, and the oriented building areas can be well discriminated as dihedral or odd-bounce structures.

TI  - Seven-Component Decomposition Using Refined Volume Scattering Models and New Configurations of Mixed Dipoles
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, an extended seven-component decomposition method using refined volume scattering models and new configurations of mixed dipoles (M7SD) is proposed to interpret the scattering mechanisms of various terrain types. In the M7SD, refined volume scattering models are proposed to reasonably characterize the scattering mechanisms of various land covers with different orientation angles, and the redefined configurations of the mixed dipoles, which have better explanations for the scattering mechanisms, are introduced. Although the diameter of the dipole used in the experiment is very small, the superposition of two dipoles in the same plane will cause one of the dipoles to have a distance from the plane. According to the experimental results, since the distance between one of the dipoles and plane cannot be ignored, it will cause an error between the scattering matrix obtained by the experiment and the scattering matrix obtained under ideal conditions. In this case, in the M7SD, two dipoles are placed in two planes, respectively, with a distance of half wavelength. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated and evaluated with the spaceborne C-band GaoFen-3, Radarsat-2, and airborne L-band ESAR fully polarimetric data over different study sites. The experimental results demonstrate that the use of the M7SD can reasonably interpret the scattering mechanisms of various terrain types (especially the building areas with large orientation angles), overcome the overestimation of the volume scattering and reduce the percentage of negative scattering power pixels.

AB  - Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) carried onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite could provide a daily global product of carbon monoxide (CO) total column at a high spatial resolution of 7*7 km(2). However, data gaps exist in the TROPOMI CO product, which likely blocks the researches on the atmospheric CO. Therefore, a fusing method based on XGBoost is purposed in this study to recover the missing data in the TROPOMI CO product. The results show that the R and RMSE for the sample-based cross validation are 0.952 and 0.00303, respectively. It's believed that the proposed method could accurately predict the TROPOMI CO total column. Meanwhile, the spatial patterns of the daily predicted CO total column are similar to those of the TROPOMI. For temporal variations, the proposed method is able to mitigate the rapid fluctuations of the region-averaged TROPOMI CO total column in time series.

TI  - Computer Prediction of Seawater Sensor Parameters in the Central Arctic Region Based on Hybrid Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, with the large-scale reduction of Arctic sea ice, the supplement of chlorophyll sensor data in seawater has become an essential part of environmental assessment. Accurately predicting the chlorophyll sensor data in seawater is of great significance to protect the Arctic marine ecological environment. A machine learning prediction method combined with wavelet transform is proposed. This process uses data from upper ocean observation buoys placed in the Arctic Ocean (A.O.) to predict the sensor analogue of chlorophyll-a (C.A.) in the upper ocean of the Arctic Ocean. Choose the best wavelet transform method and prevent the LSTM gradient from disappearing. A model combining SAE (stacked autoencoder) Bi (bidirectional) LSTM (long short-term memory) and wavelet transform is proposed. Experiments were conducted to compare the predictive performance of buoy data input as univariate at two different times and locations in the Arctic Ocean. The results show that compared with other models (such as LSTM), in the SAE Bi LSTM model, the data of the two sites have the highest prediction accuracy. The best wavelet transform methods are fourth-order four-layer and first-order four-layer. The observational data of the Chukchi Sea from 2018 to 2019 obtained the best prediction results. The root mean square error (RMSE) value is 0.02003 volts; the average absolute error (MAE) is 0.0841 volts. This research provides a new method for predicting the chlorophyll sensor parameters in the upper ocean through the sea ice buoy observed at a given point, which helps to improve the accuracy of the ocean sensor parameter prediction on the Arctic ice buoy.

TI  - An Urban Water Extraction Method Combining Deep Learning and Google Earth Engine
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban water is important for the urban ecosystem. Accurate and efficient detection of urban water with remote sensing data is of great significance for urban management and planning. In this article, we proposed a new method by combining Google Earth Engine (GEE) with a multiscale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to extract urban water from Landsat images, which can be summarized as & x201C;offline training and online prediction & x201D; (OTOP). That is, the training of MSCNN is completed offline, and the process of urban water extraction is implemented on GEE with the trained parameters of MSCNN. The OTOP can give full play to the respective advantages of GEE and the convolutional neural network (CNN), and can make the use of deep learning method in GEE more flexible. The proposed method can process the available satellite images with high performance, without data download and storage, and the overall performance of urban water extraction in the test areas is also higher than that of the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and random forest classifier. The results of the extended validation in the other major cities of China also showed that OTOP is robust and can be used to extract different types of urban water, which benefits from the structural design and training of MSCNN. Therefore, OTOP is especially suitable for the study of large-scale and long-term urban water change detection in the background of urbanization.

Data from one MODIS tile in northern China for the whole year 2018 is compared. The results reveal that MAIAC SR has good stability for the full range of AOD for which SR is reported, whereas MOD09 SR shows increasing high bias with AOD increases. The cross-comparison of spectral characteristics between MAIAC SR and MOD09 SR shows a systematic MAIAC-MOD09 difference increasing from NIR to Blue. This pattern is consistent with the bias caused by Lambertian assumption used in MOD09 SR algorithm.

Our work compared the results of GWR model accuracy with ordinary least squares (OLS) model. The results indicated that GWR method yielded better goodness of fit and higher model accuracy than OLS. Moreover, the GWR model could deeply reveal the complex relationship between NDVI and climate factors. At the same time, the research results could also provide scientific basis for vegetation modeling in Inner Mongolia and similar areas.

AB  - Wavelet-feature Markov clustering algorithm for the remotely sensed data is based on an accurate description of abrupt spectral features and an optimized Markov clustering in the wavelet feather space. The peak points can be captured and identified by applying wavelet transform on the expanded multispectral data. The correlation ratio between the two samples is a statistical calculation of the matched peak point positions on the wavelet-feature within an adjustable spectrum domain or a range of wavelet scales. The evenly sampled data can be used to create class centers, depending on the correlation ratio threshold at each Markov step, accelerating the clustering speed by avoiding computation of Euclidean distance for traditional clustering algorithms, such as K-means and ISODATA. By applying a simulated annealing method and gradually shrunk clustering size, Markov clustering leads to the best class centers quickly at each clustering temperature. The experimental results about TM data have verified its acceptable clustering accuracy and high convergence velocity.

TI  - A Geographically Weighted Regression Approach to Understanding Urbanization Impacts on Urban Warming and Cooling: A Case Study of Las Vegas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect is one of the most significant consequences of urbanization. Great progress has been made in evaluating the SUHI with cross-sectional studies performed in a number of cities across the globe. Few studies; however, have focused on the spatiotemporal changes in an area over a long period of time. Using multi-temporal remote sensing data sets, this study examined the spatiotemporal changes of the SUHI intensity in Las Vegas, Nevada, over a 15-year period from 2001 to 2016. We applied the geographically weighted regression (GWR) and advanced statistical approaches to investigating the SUHI variation in relation to several important biophysical indicators in the region. The results show that (1) Las Vegas had experienced a significant increase in the SUHI over the 15 years, (2) Vegetation and large and small water bodies in the city can help mitigate the SUHI effect and the cooling effect of vegetation had increased continuously from 2001 to 2016, (3) An urban heat sink (UHS) was identified in developed areas with low to moderate intensity, and (4) Increased surface temperatures were mainly driven by the urbanization-induced land conversions occurred over the 15 years. Findings from this study will inspire thoughts on practical guidelines for SUHI mitigation in a fast-growing desert city.

AB  - Drought is one of the most common natural disasters which may harm ecosystem and economy, and thus, it is important to accurately grasp the change of drought. In this study, an innovative multisource remote sensing drought index improved Temperature-Vegetation-Soil Moisture Dryness Index (iTVMDI) based on passive microwave remote sensing data of FengYun (FY)3B and optical/infrared data is proposed to monitor the drought in Shandong Province, China in 2016. The monitoring results were verified by meteorological data. Results showed that iTVMDI has a negative correlation (R = - 0.73) with precipitation and the average correlation coefficient with temperature is 0.76. Overall, iTVMDI can be applied to monitor the temporal and spatial variation of drought conditions.

TI  - Mapping of Himalaya Leucogranites Based on ASTER and Sentinel-2A Datasets Using a Hybrid Method of Metric Learning and Random Forest
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The widely distributed leucogranite belt in the Himalayan orogeny is expected to have excellent potential for developing rare metal mineralization. Finding a way to effectively map the spatial distribution of leucogranites would be a significant contribution to rare metal exploration. Research shows remote sensing technology has long been recognized the significance in geological works, which greatly promoted mineral exploration in a cost-effective manner, especially in the Himalayan orogenic belt with poor natural environment. However, several challenges still exist in relation to the limited spectral band and spatial resolution of remote sensing images, as well as the onerous data processing. In this context, this study sought to resolve these two issues by applying a hybrid approach that comprises image fusion, metric learning, and random forest methods. For the first challenge, multisource and multisensor remote sensing data were integrated to provide more comprehensive spatial texture characteristics and spectral information. To address the second challenge, this study used a hybrid method of metric learning and random forest to promote computing efficiency and classification accuracy. This process is illustrated through a case study of lithological mapping in Cuonadong dome, the northern part of the Himalayan orogeny belt. Seven target lithological units were effectively discriminated with an 85.75% overall accuracy. This provides an important scientific basis for further exploration for rare metal deposits in the Himalayan orogeny belt, and a way of thinking for detecting geological features under harsh natural conditions.

M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated genetic variability among the blood groups Kell (c.578C> T and c. t790T> C), Kidd (c.838A> G), Duffy (c.125A > G, c.265C > T and c.1-67T> C), Diego (c.2561C > 7), MNS (c.143T > C) and Rh (c.676G > C) in Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil. Genetic profiling from 382 volunteer blood donors was performed through allelic discrimination assays using a hydrolysis probe (TaqMane) with a real-time PCR system. The sample was divided into two groups: Euro-Brazilian and Afro-Brazilian. A comparison with studies from other regions of Brazil and the 1000 Genomes Database showed significant differences for almost all polymorphisms evaluated in our population. Population differentiation between the Euro- and Afro-Brazilian groups was low (F-sT value 0.055). However, when each locus was evaluated individually, KEL*06 and Fr*02N.01 allele frequencies were significantly higher in the Afro-Brazilian group than in the Euro-Brazilian group. Ethnic classification that uses phenotypic criteria to find blood units with rare antigens may be important when there is a need to detect blood units with an absence of Duffy antigens. There is also a greater probability of finding donors in the Afro-Brazilian group. Taken together, the data indicate strong European and African contributions to the gene pool, with intense admixture.

TI  - Multiple lqualitative procedures to elicit reverse culture shock experience
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - This study elaborates the research design and methodology to investigate the reverse culture shock (RCS) experience of young Thai tourists in the tourism field. Taking the worldview position of relative ontology and interpretivist/constructivist paradigms, this paper employs qualitative design using multiple research methods, namely, essay writing, graph plotting and semi-structured interview. Essay writing and graph plotting are initially used as pre-interview activities as part of the memory recall procedures. This stage is important because it helps curtail memory distortion and enrich insight into the participant's past RCS experience. The semi-structured interview with young Thai tourists is subsequently conducted to elicit individual perceptual and emotional experiences and coping mechanism after they returned home. The three research methods complement one another to draw out rich travellers' experience in the tourism study and can be beneficial to the extended disciplines of social science and psychology.Advantages of this article include:Practical and feasible processes for a qualitative study in social science and psychology, particularly when recall of memory is involved.The ability to gain enriched information of experience.The ability to elicit emotional aspects from the study of experience through graph plotting.

TI  - A time-frequency analysis of the thermal radiation background anomalies caused by large earthquakes: A case study of the Wenchuan 8.0 earthquake
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Strong earthquakes have an impact on the regional thermal radiation background, which has been both observed and confirmed. This effect produces anomalies in the thermal radiation background (TRBA) and increases the difficulty of extracting a thermal radiation anomaly (TRA) that is associated with an earthquake occurring during the same time period. The extraction and identification of such anomalies has been ignored by previous studies. In this study, we investigate the time-frequency analysis (TFA) method, together with the wavelet filtering of the Daubechies method and the relative power spectrum analysis of the Fourier Welch method to extract and analyse the TRBA caused by the 2008 Wenchuan Ms 8.0 earthquake and the TRA of the 2013 Minxian-Zhangxian Ms 6.6 earthquake using data concerning the brightness temperature of a black body (TBB) from the Fengyun-2 series of geostationary meteorological satellites developed by China. The result showed that this method can effectively extract and analyse the TRBA caused by the Wenchuan earthquake and the TRA of the Minxian-Zhangxian earthquake form a complex background environment. Furthermore, we discussed the impact of the earthquake on the TRBA and segmented the process. The impact is mainly reflected by three aspects; the characteristic period of the TRBA changes, the TRBA occurs at the same time every year, which is identical to the time at which the earthquake anomaly occurred, and the impact process is in stages. We also summarized the correlation between the characteristic parameters of a TRA and the regional thermal radiation background, geography, and climatic factors.

T2  - JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the behavior of high-strength circular concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) short columns. An experimental database consisting of 87 tests conducted on high-strength circular CFST short columns was compiled, and gaps in the existing research were identified. A total of 20 tests were then conducted to address the gaps in the database. The test parameters were the diameter-to-thickness ratio of the steel tubes D/t, the yield stress of steel F-y, and the compressive strength of concrete f'(c). The tests indicated that the strength of high-strength circular CFST short columns increases with increasing F-y and f'(c), but decreases with increasing D/t. All tested high-strength circular CFST short columns had acceptable ductility. Four of the specimens did not have any strength degradation, while the other 16 specimens retained at least 70% of their strength at strains of 5%. Results from the tests conducted in this research were combined with those from the compiled database; the combined results were used to evaluate the applicability of current design equations for estimating the cross-sectional strength of high-strength circular CFST columns. The evaluations indicated that the Japanese code provides the most accurate estimation. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Atmospheric fine particulate matters (i.e., PM1, PM2.5) are highly related to climate change and human life. This study aims to produce ground-level PM1 and PM2.5 concentrations at a 1-km spatial resolution across China based on the newly released MODIS MAIAC AOD product using a newly developed space-time extremely randomized trees (STET) model. Daily PM1 and PM2.5 concentrations were estimated from insitu surface PM2.5 measurements, meteorological and ancillary variables. The 10-fold cross-validation (CV) approach is selected for model validation. The results show that the STET model shows a high accuracy in daily PM1 (PM2.5) estimates in 2018 with a high coefficient of determination equal to 0.76 (0.89), a low root-mean-square error of 9.5 (10.3) mu g/m(3), and a low mean prediction error of 5.9 (6.7) mu g/m(3). The STET model is robust and can outperform most previous studies, benefitting from the ensemble regression approach and the synergy of space-time information. This high-resolution and high-quality PK data set in China (i e , ChinaHighPM(x)) may thus be very useful for related air pollution and human health studies, especially for urban areas.

TI  - Transparency Estimation of Narrow Rivers by UAV-Borne Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban rivers are often narrow, and general remote sensing data cannot meet the needs of water quality monitoring. In the process of monitoring of river water quality by remote sensing, the spectral and spatial dimension of satellite-borne images cannot be taken into consideration at the same time, making fine pollution monitoring of urban rivers difficult. Transparency is one of the core indicators for evaluating water quality, and hyperspectral remote sensing data are rich in spectral information and can be used for quantitative transparency estimation. The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)remote sensing effectively makes up for the deficiencies in satellite remote sensing monitoring. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposed the use of the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regression algorithm for the quantitative inversion of urban river transparency. The spatial resolution of the collected imagery is 18.5 cm, which is suitable for urban rivers that are almost ten meters wide. Compared with five traditional empirical models, integrated algorithms such as gradient regression and random forest get much better results. Moreover, the accuracy of transparency estimation using the XGBoost regression algorithm was significantly improved, and the inversion model R-2 in both study areas reached over 0.97. Finally, the established transparency inversion models were used to generate transparency distribution maps of the two study areas. The results showed that the distribution of the water transparency was consistent with the results of the field monitoring, indicating that it is feasible to use the XGBoost algorithm for the inversion of urban river transparency in UAV-borne hyperspectral imagery.

TI  - Precise and Robust Ship Detection for High-Resolution SAR Imagery Based on HR-SDNet
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection in high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is a challenging problem in the case of complex environments, especially inshore and offshore scenes. Nowadays, the existing methods of SAR ship detection mainly use low-resolution representations obtained by classification networks or recover high-resolution representations from low-resolution representations in SAR images. As the representation learning is characterized by low resolution and the huge loss of resolution makes it difficult to obtain accurate prediction results in spatial accuracy; therefore, these networks are not suitable to ship detection of region-level. In this paper, a novel ship detection method based on a high-resolution ship detection network (HR-SDNet) for high-resolution SAR imagery is proposed. The HR-SDNet adopts a novel high-resolution feature pyramid network (HRFPN) to take full advantage of the feature maps of high-resolution and low-resolution convolutions for SAR image ship detection. In this scheme, the HRFPN connects high-to-low resolution subnetworks in parallel and can maintain high resolution. Next, the Soft Non-Maximum Suppression (Soft-NMS) is used to improve the performance of the NMS, thereby improving the detection performance of the dense ships. Then, we introduce the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) evaluation metrics, which provides not only the higher quality evaluation metrics average precision (AP) for more accurate bounding box regression, but also the evaluation metrics for small, medium and large targets, so as to precisely evaluate the detection performance of our method. Finally, the experimental results on the SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) and TerraSAR-X high-resolution images reveal that (1) our approach based on the HRFPN has superior detection performance for both inshore and offshore scenes of the high-resolution SAR imagery, which achieves nearly 4.3% performance gains compared to feature pyramid network (FPN) in inshore scenes, thus proving its effectiveness; (2) compared with the existing algorithms, our approach is more accurate and robust for ship detection of high-resolution SAR imagery, especially inshore and offshore scenes; (3) with the Soft-NMS algorithm, our network performs better, which achieves nearly 1% performance gains in terms of AP; (4) the COCO evaluation metrics are effective for SAR image ship detection; (5) the displayed thresholds within a certain range have a significant impact on the robustness of ship detectors.

AB  - Drought, as a natural disaster, affects the local environment and agricultural production. Drought monitoring plays a crucial role in preventing and mitigating drought, especially Meteorological and Agricultural Drought (IMAD) monitoring. To better monitoring IMAD, a new comprehensive drought index, called Meteorological and Agricultural Drought Index (MADI), was developed in this study, which combined the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI). And, the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought were analyzed by the methods of the frequency, comparison and regionalization in Gansu Province of China during 2000-2016. The results showed that: (1) The meteorological and agricultural drought always occurred, while there was a difference in time of appearance; the IMAD in Gansu Province was mainly light and moderate, becoming serious from southeast to northwest. (2) MADI was temporally well-matched to the drought affected area, soil moisture and NPP. (3) The IMAD based on MADI can reflect both meteorological and agricultural drought well in time and space. (4) According to the drought frequency, the study area was divided into six regions, and most of the study area was the stable drought type. For different regions, government should take timely measures to prevent drought.

TI  - Retrodirective Antenna for Inter-Satellite Data Transmission
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new X-band retrodirective antenna based on superheterodyne mixer and phase conjugating technology is proposed for inter-satellite data transmission in this paper. The novel phase conjugating circuit, utilizing the reciprocity of the passive mixers, achieves high RF-IF and LO-IF isolations, high communication link gain, and a very compact low profile layout with all antenna elements and circuit components arranged at one common layer of a double-sided printed circuit board (PCB). Its mathematical principles of circuit design are derived, and the effect of up and down conversion loss deviation of mixers on the amplitude and phase error of the circuit, thus on the beam pointing error and the side-lobe of the antenna is discussed. A prototype of circularly polarized one dimension retrodirective antenna is fabricated, and its bistatic RCS measurement in an anechoic chamber is implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed antenna array. The results show that, within the scanning range from & x2212;30 & x00B0; to & x002B;30 & x00B0;, the array has good retrodirective performance. The proposed antenna would be a good choice for the inter-satellite data transmission inside a distributed satellite cluster.

TI  - A Comparative Assessment of Multisensor Data Merging and Fusion Algorithms for High-Resolution Surface Reflectance Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The improvement of the spatial and temporal resolution of reflectance data products has been challenging due to the diversity of data sources and availability of many data merging and fusion algorithms. In the algorithmic domain, methods for data merging and fusion may include, but are not limited to, the modified quantile-quantile adjustment (MQQA), the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME), and the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM). This article presents a synergistic integration of the data merging and fusion algorithms of MQQA and BME in dealing with heterogeneous and nonstationary surface reflectance data at both the top of atmosphere (TOA) and land surface for a comparative study. Emphasis has been placed on the distinctive performance between BME and MQQA-BME algorithms in the spatial domain and the MQQA-BME and STARFM in the temporal domain at both TOA and land surface levels. The results indicate that the BME and MQQA-BME outperform the MQQA in terms of the spatial coverage at both TOA and land surface levels. Moreover, the MQQA-BME algorithm shows a higher prediction accuracy than STARFM at the blue band over the temporal domain at both TOA and land surface levels. The results of this comparison will greatly empower the MQQA-BME to be used for urban air quality monitoring and related epidemiological assessment in the future, once finer aerosol optical depth predictions via integrated data merging and fusion can be made possible.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th Symposium on Novel Optoelectronic Detection Technology and Applications

AB  - Atmospheric particulate pollution causes a serious threat to the environment, economic, and human health. The temporal and spatial distribution of Particulate Matter (PM) obtained by remote sensing helps to study atmospheric particulate pollution study and formulate policies. In this paper, a semi-empirical method is established to estimate the Total Suspended Particles TSP mass concentration based on ground-based remote sensing. In the method, a key transformed ratio of TSP aerosol volume (V) to its optical depth (AOD) is defined aerosol Volume-to-Extinction (VE). The properties of VE are analyzed for the different aerosol types by using AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) data at seven sites including Beijing (urban/industrial), GSFC (urban/industrial), CUIABA MIRANDA and Mongu (biomass burning), Solar Village (desert dust), and Ascension Island and Lanai (oceanic) sites for about 10 years. It is found that VE for different aerosol types is a function of fine mode aerosol Volume-to-Extinction VEf and coarse mode aerosol Volume-to-Extinction VEc. The VEf is a function of Fine Mode Fraction (FMF) which is put forward by Zhang & Li (2015). VEc is also put forward as a function of FMF in this study. The results show the proportion of samples with the relative error of less than 16.7% is about 64%, and that with relative error of less than 50% is approximately 92%. Combined with the other assumptions including the aerosol vertical distribution and the light extinction of water uptake, the dry TSP mass concentration near the ground can be obtained. And the similar trend of the remote sensing TSP results and the in-situ PM10 measurements in Beijing is obtained, with the correlation coefficient of 0.78.

CP  - 38th International Conference on Ground Control in Mining
CL  - Morgantown, WV
AB  - Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR), a satellite-based remote sensing technique, has application for monitoring subsidence with high resolution over short periods. DInSAR uses radar images to measure centimeter-level surface displacements. In the images, ground resolution can be relatively high, with each data point (pixel) representing the average displacement over an area of several square meters. The image data are acquired regularly which allows subsidence to be monitored sequentially over short periods; imaging periods typically range from weeks to months. Monitoring subsidence over short periods with high spatial resolution has potential to provide insight into the dynamics of subsidence and into relationships between mine advance and subsidence. In this study, for three longwall mines in the western United States, initial subsidence occurring at the start of longwall advance is quantified over short periods (12-72 days). C-band interferometric wide swath Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from the Sentinel satellites are used to quantify the subsidence. Overall, the data show initial development of subsidence, expansion of the subsidence trough, and the advance of subsidence in the direction of mining.

AB  - In order to test the in-orbit radiation characteristics of GF-1 and GF-4, and obtain accurate radiometric calibration coefficients, this paper proposes a MODIS and LandSat 8 cross-calibration method based on Dunhuang radiation correction field and a method for comparing the radiance error of GF-1 and GF-4 satellite images based on uniform regions. First, this article introduces the cross-calibration principle and the overview of the uniform target sample area, and compares the band matching and spectral response of the four remote sensors. Then, cross-calibration based on the scenes of the same area at the same time of GF-1, GF-4, MODIS, and LandSat 8 on 28 July 2017. The results show that the calibration coefficient error obtained by this method is within 6%. The error of the calibration coefficient obtained by cross-calibration with LandSat 8 satellite is smaller, which satisfies the basic remote sensing quantitative demand. The GF-1 satellite has high calibration accuracy and is suitable for cross-calibration research of China's independent satellite remote sensors. It is of great significance for the establishment of China's in-orbit calibration system.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Islands face increasingly prominent environmental problems with rapid urbanization. Hence, timely and objective monitoring and evaluation of island ecology is of great significance. This study took the Pingtan Comprehensive Experimental Zone (PZ) in the east sea of Fujian Province of China as the research object. Based on remote sensing technology, four Landsat images from 2007 to 2017 and the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) were used to explore the ecological status and space-time change. The results showed that from 2007 to 2011, the average RSEI decreased from 0.519 to 0.506, indicating that the ecological quality generally showed a slight downward trend, mainly due to large-scale development brought by the construction; by 2014, although the ecology of the original area improved, the overall ecology was still declining with 0.502 mean RSEI mainly because of large-scale reclamation projects; by 2017, the average RSEI rebounded to 0.523, which was attributed to the fact that ecological construction and protection were emphasized in the construction of PZ, especially in reclamation areas. In conclusion, the increase of large area bare soil will lead to the decline of regional ecology, but the implementation of scientific ecological planning is conducive to ecological restoration and construction.

TI  - Desertification detection model in Naiman Banner based on the albedo-modified soil adjusted vegetation index feature space using the Landsat8 OLI images
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The current desertification feature space models are almost linear and ignore the complicated and nonlinear relations that exist among variables when monitoring desertification. Herein, point-to-point and point-to-line models have been proposed by completely considering the nonlinear relations between the Albedo-Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) and the effects of soil background. Further, the applicability of these models for monitoring different levels of desertification information was compared and analyzed. The point-to-line feature space model exhibited a larger inversion accuracy (93.8%) for Naiman Banner with respect to albedo-MSAVI when compared with that exhibited by the point-to-point model (88.9%). In addition, the monitoring accuracy is observed to slightly differ for different levels of desertification, and slight and mild desertification exhibit the best inversion accuracy in case of both point-to-point and point-to-line models. Furthermore, the point-to-line model exhibits better applicability in case of intensive (92.7%) and severe (93.3%) desertification when compared with those exhibited by the point-to-point model (87.5% and 88.9%, respectively). The results obtained in this study can provide improved data and decision support for preventing and managing land degradation.

AB  - Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been widely used to estimate surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations. To understand the temporal and spatial variation of PM2.5 distribution at various scales, we developed techniques for estimating hourly PM2.5 concentration from visible and infrared imagers onboard Himawari-8, GK-2A and FY-4A satellites. During daytime, satellite observed reflectance at the top of atmosphere (TOA) is directly converted to PM2.5 through a machine-learning algorithm. At night, the thermal channel data from satellites are tested for PM estimation through using the aerosol absorbing properties. It is found that the PM concentration is higher in the morning and lower in the afternoon in east central China. PM concentrations also exhibit a northto-south decreasing gradient with the highest one in winter and the lowest in summer. From AHI PM data collected in the past five years, we found a decreasing trend of PM2.5 concentration in most of areas of China.

CP  - Conference on Sensors, Systems, and Next-Generation Satellites XXIV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Vicarious calibration approaches using in-situ measurements is a key technique applied to on-orbit remote sensors. The in-situ measurements have advantages in terms of traceability and quantifiable accuracy making them ideal for inter-consistency studies of on-orbit sensors. The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration and Validation (WGCV) Infrared Visible Optical Sensors (IVOS) initiated the Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet) to provide automated surface and top-of atmosphere reflectance data from multiple participating ground sites to the world-wide user community. RadCalNet standardizes protocols for collecting data, processing to top-of-atmosphere reflectance, and provides SI-traceable uncertainty budgets for the 4 currently operating sites. RadCalNet data from the Railroad Valley Playa, Nevada site was used to provide an SI-traceable, absolute radiometric calibration of the Enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS) as part of an overflight of opportunity during the FIREX-AQ campaign. The results shown here demonstrate the utility of RadCalNet data for absolute radiometric calibration of airborne imagers making flights of opportunity without the need for coordination with a field validation team.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease of non-traditional origin in Mesoamerica: a disease primarily driven by occupational heat stress
T2  - REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The death toll of the epidemic of chronic kidney disease of nontraditional origin (CKDnt) in Mesoamerica runs into the tens of thousands, affecting mostly young men. There is no consensus on the etiology. Anecdotal evidence from the 1990s pointed to work in sugarcane; pesticides and heat stress were suspected. Subsequent population-based surveys supported an occupational origin with overall high male-female ratios in high-risk lowlands, but small sex differences within occupational categories, and low prevalence in non-workers. CKDnt was reported in sugarcane and other high-intensity agriculture, and in non-agricultural occupations with heavy manual labor in hot environments, but not among subsistence farmers. Recent studies with stronger designs have shown cross-shift changes in kidney function and hydration biomarkers and cross-harvest kidney function declines related to heat and workload. The implementation of a water-rest-shade intervention midharvest in El Salvador appeared to halt declining kidney function among cane cutters. In Nicaragua a water-rest-shade program appeared sufficient to prevent kidney damage among cane workers with low-moderate workload but not among cutters with heaviest workload. Studies on pesticides and infectious risk factors have been largely negative. Non-occupational risk factors do not explain the observed epidemiologic patterns. In conclusion, work is the main driver of the CKDnt epidemic in Mesoamerica, with occupational heat stress being the single uniting factor shown to lead to kidney dysfunction in affected populations. Sugarcane cutters with extreme heat stress could be viewed as a sentinel occupational population. Occupational heat stress prevention is critical, even more so in view of climate change.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - There are several factors that should be considered for robust terrain classification. We address the issue of high pixel-wise variability within terrain classes from remote sensing modalities, when the spatial resolution is less than one meter. Our proposed method segments an image into superpixels, makes terrain classification decisions on the pixels within each superpixel using the probabilistic feature fusion (PFF) classifier, then makes a superpixel-level terrain classification decision by the majority vote of the pixels within the superpixel. We show that this method leads to improved terrain classification decisions. We demonstrate our method on optical, hyperspectral, and polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data.

TI  - A semi-automated approach for quantitative mapping of woody cover from historical time series aerial photography and satellite imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Savanna landscapes are characterised by a canopy of discontinuous tree cover overlying an understorey of shrubs and continuous grass cover. The distribution of trees (woody cover) is variable both spatially and temporally. Analysis of woody cover dynamics can provide a spatial and temporal envelope encompassing variability is useful for informing mine closure criteria. With the impending closure of Ranger uranium mine, ecologically appropriate closure criteria for ecosystem restoration are being developed through a framework of rehabilitation standards. One such closure criteria is canopy cover and historical woody cover is being used to derive the range in woody cover that can be expected over time once the mine site has been revegetated. This study reports on the development and testing of a technique for extracted woody cover from remotely sensed data (in the form of historical aerial photography and satellite imagery) in the areas adjacent to Ranger uranium mine in the World Heritage listed Kakadu National Park, northern Australia. An object-based image analysis technique was applied to four data sets from four different dates: greyscale, true colour and colour infrared aerial photo mosaics (from 1964, 1976 and 1981 respectively) and a high spatial resolution satellite image (from 2010). Overall accuracies of woody cover from each of the data sets exceeded 94%. In addition, proportional cover derived from this method displays linear relationships to cover derived from visual estimates. Due to the success of the technique, it will be applied to more data sets from different dates over the study area to assess the variability of woody cover over time to inform ecosystem restoration criteria for the mine closure.

TI  - Hybrid Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted Satellite Images Using Fluctuation Modification Extraction and Reed-Solomon Code Embedding
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In conventional hybrid reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDHEI), the error-free extracted-bit rate condition in recovered images cannot be fully achieved (reversible) as the block size decreases because of the fluctuation function used, which cannot reduce the bit error, as indicated by the high extracted-bit error rate (EER) and low peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Therefore, this work proposes improving the accuracy of hybrid RDHEI performance for remote sensing satellite images by modifying the fluctuation function in the data extraction process with and without the Reed-Solomon (RS) codes in the data embedding process. The proposed fluctuation function takes the absolute difference in the actual value of two adjacent pixels in horizontal and vertical pixels. The modified fluctuation function algorithm in the extraction process both with and without RS codes in the embedding data process is derived, and performance results are obtained through simulations of SPOT-6, SPOT-7, and Pleiades-1A satellite images. The simulation results show that the proposed hybrid RDHEI algorithm with modification of the fluctuation function without an RS encoder can achieve error-free extracted-bit and maximum PSNR (infinity) values at a block size of 18 x 18 for SPOT-6 and SPOT-7 test images, as well as a block size of 20 x 20 for the Pleiades-1A test image. It is proven that the proposed hybrid RDHEI succeeds in reducing the minimum block size from reference systems. In addition, it can also be seen that the proposed hybrid RDHEI with modification of the fluctuation function and RS coding in data embedding can reduce the minimum block size to achieve error-free extracted bits to 9 x 9 for SPOT-6 and SPOT-7 test images and $10\times 10$ for the Pleiades-1A test image.

AB  - Dieng highland in Central Java provides high potential habitat for the endemic Javan gibbon. In order to conserve the sustainability of Javan gibbon population and its habitat in Dieng, the conservation priority for high suitable habitat should be maintained. This study aimed to identify the HSM for Javan gibbon in Dieng highland and the most contributing biophysical variables. Medium-resolution variable layers, which interpret the biophysical environment of gibbon habitat, were derived and pre-processed from Sentinel-2 image and Indonesian elevation model product. A total of 305 occurrence data recorded in extensive field survey non-correlated 11 variables were maintained for HSM in presence-only machine learning, maximum entropy (MaxEnt). Suitable gibbon habitats were predicted as 81.286 km(2). The area under the curve value estimated to be 0.971 and 83.516 % of validating points was on suitable habitat. The final model pointed out that the suitable areas were fragmented. Relatively large of the suitable patch for Javan gibbon located in Sokokembang, Linggoasri-Mendolo, and western of Kembanglangit were considerable to get the conservation priority. The most contributed variables were a natural forest, elevation, distance to cropland and land surface temperature, which are important factors to be considered when generating a conservation strategy for Javan gibbon.

T2  - TROPICAL WETLANDS - INNOVATION IN MAPPING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Workshop on Tropical Wetlands - Innovation in Mapping and Management
CL  - Banjarmasin, INDONESIA
AB  - Peatland mapping is an important national agenda in Indonesia, due to human disturbances and other prominent issues related to conservation and environment. The exposure of mineral soils underlying these peatlands can further increase potential environmental problems when it contains acid sulfate soil ( ASSoils -FeS2), harmful mineral when exposed to oxygen. Remote sensing applications on peatland mapping are commonly utilized to identify its extent, but never examined its ASSoils potential area. This study aims: 1) to map the coastal ASSoil occurrence probability based on a hybrid remote sensing and hydrogeomorphical approaches and 2) to examine the ability of remote sensing in assisting the development of digital ASSoils mapping in tropical peatland. This study utilized the legacy peatland data of Kubu Raya and Ketapang areas provided by the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture. The hybrid remote sensing image analysis approach consists of a combination of visual interpretation and digital image analysis. Multi-temporal satellite imageries (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2) representing rainy and dry seasons were processed to derive wetness, vegetation density indices and landcover maps. Soil characteristics data included the thickness of peat, underlying materials, and ASSoils distributions. Processed hydrological and topographical data produces maps of tidal, salinity, and sea water intrusion and micro-elevation accordingly. Visual remote sensing image interpretation was conducted to identify existing coastal landforms. Both intermediary maps are associated to the field survey data and are used to determine the peatland ASSoil hydro-geomorphology units. The development of this digital ASSoils mapping is important to underpin the strategic regional and national planning in the peatland environment.

TI  - EVALUATION OF DEFORMATIONS IN THE URBAN AREA OF OLSZTYN USING SENTINEL-1 SAR INTERFEROMETRY
T2  - ACTA GEODYNAMICA ET GEOMATERIALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents an analysis of the possibilities of using a data set of Sentinel-1 (S-1) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) for urban monitoring. The study was conducted in the Olsztyn area, where by using the PSI (Persistent Scatterer InSAR) method the amount of deformation was determined, calculated using a multi-time SAR data series. Displacement values were estimated by reducing error sources related to temporal and geometrical decorrelation and atmospheric phase delay.Based on the defined assumptions, three calculation cases were prepared. This processing is based on the data from more than 648 Sentinel-1A/B images over ascending and descending orbits acquired between October 2014 and August 2018 to determine the value of the Line of Sight (LOS) ground deformation rates. Regular acquisition of SAR images from the Sentinel-1 satellite sensor in an interval of 2 days enabled the detection of more than 1000 PSI points per 1 km 2 in the 10 x 10 km(2) urban area. The mean LOS velocity of surface change was determined on the basis of four large data sets. Comparable values were obtained from ascending tracks 29, 102 and descending tracks 51, 124 where mean velocity ranges respectively: A29 from -4.3 to 3.4 mm/yr, A102 from -3.9 to 3.5 mm/yr and D51 from -3.9 to 3.1 mm/yr, D124 from -3.8 to 3.2 mm/yr. Then the results of geometries were combined in pairs to compute the actual vertical motion component.In the presented work, an analysis of the terrain deformation was performed for selected characteristic objects located within the Olsztyn area. In the first case study, a detailed analysis of urban infrastructure facilities was carried out, including buildings and a section of the railway line. The other case study covers an area along the river bank. A large number of observations allowed to accurately determine the deformation model and to produce the history of deformations on the tested area, based on the analysis of time series of interferograms.The paper presents solutions using InSAR data in urban monitoring and shows why this technology is a useful tool for studying measuring urban subsidence. The results are displayed in the form of a deformation map showing the magnitude of the measured movement.

TI  - Climate variability and implications for keeping rivers cool in England
T2  - CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water temperature (Tw) is a primary determinant of river ecosystem health and function that is strongly controlled by climate variability and change but mediated by catchment properties. We apply a nested analysis to: (1) evaluate how annual and seasonal mean Tw varied across England during the period 2000-2018; (2) assess the extent to which these regional-temporal dynamics correlate with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO); and (3) quantify the impact of local climate variability on modelled daily maximum Tw for open, shaded and spring-fed river reaches. Such information is used to identify sentinel locations for long-term monitoring and reporting, to evaluate the true benefit of riparian shade management, and to assess the impacts of climate change on Tw. We draw on a national archive of nearly 1 million Tw values and data from a high resolution field experiment in central England. Nationally, annual mean Tw changed by-0.4 degrees C/ decade over the period 2000 to 2018, broadly in line with Central England Temperatures, although summer Tw changed by +0.6 to +1.1 degrees C/decade in parts of central and northern England. There were significant associations between summer Tw and NAO (rho = 0.64, p < 0.05), especially at sites above 300 m altitude (rho = 0.70, p < 0.01). The regional analysis reveals strongest links between summer Tw and NAO in northeast England and weakest associations in lowland regions of southern and east England with major aquifers. Hence, places with significant groundwater flows offer the greatest chance of detecting long-term signals in Tw that are not being driven by the NAO. Site-specific, logistic regression models of daily maximum Tw are found to be sensitive to the prevailing NAO phase during calibration periods. Such models show a thermal benefit for shaded sites compared with open sites that is one average 0.2 degrees C under negative NAO but 2.8 degrees C under positive NAO. Based on the findings from our nested analysis we suggest ways of optimising monitoring networks plus improving the appraisal of measures intended to keep rivers cool. In particular, we call for the creation of a national indicator of Tw for use in UK Climate Change Risk Assessments.

TI  - An agro-pastoral palimpsest: new insights into the historical rural economy of the Milesian peninsula from aerial and remote-sensing imagery
T2  - ANATOLIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Examination of a number of satellite and aerial images of the Milesian peninsula has allowed the mapping of a large number of apparently ancient linear features across the landscape. These are here interpreted, for the most part, as relicts of agro-economic field systems of unknown date, but most plausibly established during the Archaic, Hellenistic or late antique periods and perhaps used for centuries after, before the economic decline of the region in the second millennium AD. While earlier survey work has noted the existence of terracing and rural divisions at certain points in the landscape, the new remote-sensing data have provided an unprecedented large-scale insight into the extent and variety of forms of division, as well as documenting the stripping of macquis overgrowth by modern farming practices, which has, on the one hand, exposed these ancient landscapes but also, on the other, poses a threat to their preservation. The extent of the linear features suggests a high degree of land use on the peninsula at certain points in the past. Further investigation of these important features has the potential to provide critical insights into the economic history of rural and urban Miletos over the last 2,000 to 5,000 years.

TI  - Developing and Validating a Primary Care EMR-based Frailty Definition using Machine Learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POPULATION DATA SCIENCE (IJPDS)
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionIndividuals who have been identified as frail have an increased state of vulnerability, often leading to adverse health events, increased health spending, and potentially detrimental outcomes.ObjectiveThe objective of this work is to develop and validate a case definition for frailty that can be used in a primary care electronic medical record database.MethodsThis is a cross-sectional validation study using data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) in Southern Alberta. 52 CPCSSN sentinels assessed a random sample of their own patients using the Rockwood Clinical Frailty scale, resulting in a total of 875 patients to be used as reference standard. Patients must be over the age of 65 and have had a clinic visit within the last 24 months. The case definition for frailty was developed using machine learning methods using CPCSSN records for the 875 patients.ResultsOf the 875 patients, 155 (17.7%) were frail and 720 (84.2%) were not frail. Validation metrics of the case definition were: sensitivity and specificity of 0.28, 95% CI (0.21 to 0.36) and 0.94, 95% CI (0.93 to 0.96), respectively; PPV and NPV of 0.53, 95% CI (0.42 to 0.64) and 0.86, 95% CI (0.83 to 0.88), respectively.ConclusionsThe low sensitivity and specificity results could be because frailty as a construct remains underdeveloped and relatively poorly understood due to its complex nature. These results contribute to the literature by demonstrating that case definitions for frailty require expert consensus and potentially more sophisticated algorithms to be successful.

TI  - Spatial variability in Ontario Riesling Vineyards: I. Soil, vine water status and vine performance
T2  - OENO ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: The major focus of this research was to explain the so-called terroir effects that impact grapevine yield components, berry composition, and wine varietal character. To elucidate potential contributors to the terroir effect, vine water status [midday leaf water potential (.)] was chosen as a major determinant. The hypothesis of this component of the study was that consistent leaf. zones could be identified within vineyard sites and that vine water status would play a major role in vine performance and yield components. Soil texture was anticipated to play a role indirectly through its water-holding capacity.Methods and materials: To test this hypothesis, ten Riesling vineyards representative of each Vintners Quality Alliance of Ontario sub-appellation were selected within the Niagara Peninsula. These vineyards were delineated using global positioning systems and 75-80 sentinel vines were geo-referenced within a sampling grid for data collection. During the 2005-2007 growing seasons, leaf. measurements were collected bi-weekly from a subset of these sentinel vines. Data were collected on soil texture and composition, soil water content (SWC), vine performance and yield components. These variables were mapped using geographical information systems software and relationships between them were elucidated.Results: Vineyards were variable in terms of soil texture, composition, nutrition, and moisture. However, in general, few consistent relationships with soil composition variables were found. As hypothesized, consistent leaf. zones were identified within vineyards in all three vintages. Some geospatial patterns and relationships were spatially and temporally stable within vineyards. In many cases, spatial distribution of leaf. was temporally stable within vineyards despite different weather conditions during each growing season. Spatial trends within vineyards for SWC and leaf. were temporally stable over the 3-year period for eight vineyards. Generally, spatial relationships between leaf., SWC, vine size, berry weight and yield were also temporally stable. Some inconsistencies in spatial distribution of variables were attributable to winter injury.Conclusions: Many viticultural variables such as leaf., vine size, berry weight, and yield were spatially variable and, as hypothesized, consistent leaf. zones were identified within vineyards in three distinct vintages. Many geospatial patterns and relationships were determined and were temporally stable, and this temporal stability in these variables occurred despite different growing seasons. The strongest relationships were those concerning leaf., SWC, vine size, and berry weight. No consistent relationships were found concerning soil composition. The most consistent soil variables that impacted vine performance and yield components were physical properties, particularly texture.Significance and impact of the study: Soil had some indirect effects, but leaf. was more likely a major contributor to the terroir effect, as it had a major impact on vine size, berry weight and yield in many vineyards across multiple vintages. Temporal stability is required for many practical geomatic applications to be initiated in vineyards, but it is also of importance to future research endeavors for this project as well as others.

AB  - Our goal is to develop technique for assessing bathymetry maps, which show the topography of the floors of water-bodies, using satellite or aerial imagery. The advent of deep neural networks has enabled the use of new techniques in analysing and creating depth maps from high resolution satellite images. In this paper we report a pilot study in exploring the potential use of a deep learning architecture by framing bathymetry problem as a pixel-wise classification task. We took the Sentinel-2 bands as the satellite image and independent depth measurements from Humminbird (TM) data. The data for the supervised training was carefully prepared and processed to facilitate the use of a powerful deep learning segmentation models. The efficiency of the model was quantified by the average F1-score (Dice score) on the held out dataset on quantized depth bands.

Environmental events can be identified using an easy-to-use web interface and customizable maps and graphs. Machine-to-machine data access is provided via RESTful web services. These features of ERDDAP reduce the barriers to data access, and can lead to increased use of remote sensing data across disciplines, including use in education by students and by educators. In this paper we describe the basic functionality of ERDDAP, including examples of its visualization capabilities.

AB  - Due to the extensive spatial and temporal coverage of ocean satellite data products, these data have great potential for operational oceanographic applications. Yet these data are underutilized in many operational activities of NOAA, including stock assessments. Here we describe two different efforts underway to increase the transition of oceanographic satellite data into operational usage. The West Coast Node (WCN) of CoastWatch has been collaborating with the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) to develop an online tool that will make it easier for stock assessment scientists to incorporate environmental satellite data into their annual stock assessments. This specialized webpage serves time-series of remotely sensed products (e.g., chlorophyll and sea-surface temperature data) for fisheries management regions around Alaska. WCN has also been working to increase oceanographic satellite data utilization through the NOAA CoastWatch Ocean Satellite Course that they have been teaching since 2006.

CP  - Conference on Sensors, Systems, and Next-Generation Satellites XXIV

AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra and Aqua platforms is a multi-spectral, whiskbroom scanning radiometer with 36 spectral bands covering wavelengths from 0.4 - 14.2 mu m. Among these bands, the 20 reflective solar bands (RSB, 0.4 - 2.1 mu m) use an on-board solar diffuser (SD) and SD stability monitor (SDSM) to track the detector gain changes on orbit. In addition to this, lunar and Earth-view (EV) observations are used in order to characterize the scan-mirror response versus scan angle (RVS), which improves the Earth-view retrieval over the full width of each scan. For the short-wave infrared bands (SWIR, 1.2 - 2.1 mu m), the prelaunch RVS has been used for both Aqua and Terra MODIS throughout each mission. While these bands are not expected to have a significant change in the RVS on-orbit, issues such as electronic crosstalk and an out-of-band optical leak have prevented the use of the Moon for deriving the on-orbit RVS for validation. However, recent improvements to the MODIS lunar calibration for the SWIR bands allow us to mitigate the electronic crosstalk impact and derive the RVS for the SWIR bands. In this work, we will assess the impact of this newly derived RVS on the EV data compared to MODIS Collection 6.1. By comparing to EV data obtained from pseudo-invariant calibration sites at different angles-of-incidence on the scan mirror, we can assess the effectiveness of the newly derived RVS from the Moon. We find that while the change in the RVS on-orbit for the SWIR bands is relatively small, applying a correction to the RVS based on the Moon and SD data can provide an improvement for some bands.

AB  - Subduction zone located beneath Sumatra, Indonesia causes the formation of volcanic sequences, which can be associated with the potential of geothermal energy. One of them is Lumut Balai area in South Sumatra. A study of using remote sensing method was conducted as one of the preliminary methods to find out the geothermal potential in the Lumut Balai area. In this case, an analysis of regional geology maps, Landsat 8 OLI / TIRS, and digital elevation model (DEM) was carried out. The geothermal potential is obtained based on a combination of anomalies in land surface temperature (LST), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and distribution of alteration zones. The analysis of NDVI result shows the Lumut Balai area dominated by mostly moderate to high level of vegetation density up to 0.88. Whereas, the LST result shows the maximum value, which is 40.3 degrees C located at the residential area in the north and the open land in the northwest of Lumut Balai. The correlation between the results of LST and NDVI has been shown in geothermal surface manifestations, that have vegetation less than 0.88 while the temperatures show a higher value up to 40 degrees C than the surrounding its area. While the results of the DEM analysis provide topographic information, the slope in the study area used to determine the area for development of power plant. The power plant more likely to be located in the southwest and northeast of Lumut Balai where it has flat terrain and not in the near-fault area.

TI  - The CHIMAERA system for retrievals of cloud top, optical and microphysical properties from imaging sensors
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuity and consistency of geophysical retrieval products obtained from different Earth-observing spacebome or airborne atmospheric multispectral imagers can be challenging due to inherent differences in the instruments and/or the use of different retrieval algorithms. The Cross-platform High resolution Multi-instrument AtmosphEric Retrieval Algorithms (CHIMAERA) system addresses the latter aspect of the inter-sensor continuity problem for cloud property retrievals by removing retrieval methodology and implementation as a source of inconsistency when applied to instruments that share common measurement capabilities.Transferring an existing retrieval algorithm to a new sensor oftentimes is a nontrivial task, as it is common for an algorithm code to be tightly coupled to the sensor for which it was developed. By creating a clear division between the science algorithm and the instrument I/O codes, CHIMAERA allows easy migration of science algorithms to different sensors. CHIMAERA is built from C and FORTRAN source code, and can operate in a variety of environments ranging from a personal laptop to a high-performance computing environment for near real-time satellite data production. It is highly adaptable, low-maintenance and allows for easy expansion such that adding new instruments into the system requires only instrument-specific I/O and provision of any external lookup tables specific to the instrument's spectral characteristics.CHIMAERA currently supports 14 spacebome and airborne atmospheric imagers from a single code base, and has been in use since 2007. In this paper we describe the engineering aspects of CHIMAERA and briefly discuss a few examples from its many current applications.

TI  - Accuracy of Magnetometer-Guided Sentinel Lymphadenectomy after Intraprostatic Injection of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles in Prostate Cancer: The SentiMag Pro II Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radioisotope-guided sentinel lymph node dissection (sLND) has shown high diagnostic reliability in prostate (PCa) and other cancers. To overcome the limitations of the radioactive tracers, magnetometer-guided sLND using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) has been successfully used in PCa. This prospective study (SentiMag Pro II, DRKS00007671) determined the diagnostic accuracy of magnetometer-guided sLND in intermediate- and high-risk PCa. Fifty intermediate- or high-risk PCa patients (prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >= 10 ng/mL and/or Gleason score >= 7; median PSA 10.8 ng/mL, IQR 7.4-19.2 ng/mL) were enrolled. After the intraprostatic SPIONs injection a day earlier, patients underwent magnetometer-guided sLND and extended lymph node dissection (eLND, followed by radical prostatectomy. SLNs were detected in in vivo and in ex vivo samples. Diagnostic accuracy of sLND was assessed using eLND as the reference. SLNs were detected in all patients (detection rate 100%), with 447 sentinel lymph nodes SLNs (median 9, IQR 6-12) being identified and 966 LNs (median 18, IQR 15-23) being removed. Thirty-six percent (18/50) of patients had LN metastases (median 2, IQR 1-3). Magnetometer-guided sLND had 100% sensitivity, 97.0% specificity, 94.4% positive predictive value, 100% negative predictive value, 0.0% false negative rate, and 3.0% additional diagnostic value (LN metastases only in SLNs outside the eLND template). In vivo, one positive SLN/LN-positive patient was missed, resulting in a sensitivity of 94.4%. In conclusion, this new magnetic sentinel procedure has high accuracy for nodal staging in intermediate- and high-risk PCa. The reliability of intraoperative SLN detection using this magnetometer system requires verification in further multicentric studies.

TI  - ELEMENTS OF THE SLAVIC FOLKLORE IN THE ANDREI RUBANOV'S NOVEL <i>FINIST YASNYY</i> SOKOL
T2  - ROCZNIKI HUMANISTYCZNE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is about the latest novel written by contemporary Russian writer Andrei Rubanov entitled [Finist yasnyy sokol]. The novel was qualified by the author and critics to the Slavic fantasy genre. This genre is gaining more and more popularity among writers and readers on the wave of the Renaissance fairy tale phenomenon in Russian literature at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries. The plot of the novel by Andrei Rubanov is based on the motifs of Russian folk tales. Constructing the world, the artist presented primarily the texts of Russian folklore, but in order to substantiate the events, he also used ethnographic and historical knowledge about the life of the Early Slays. The aim of the article was to present and discuss elements of Slavic folklore in the work of Andrei Rubanov. The author of the paper focused on the area of Slavic beliefs: mythology, demonology, pagan rituals and rituals. Elements of Slavic folklore such as the culture of folk laughter and flaw narrative were also presented. One of the basic problems of the novel was pointed out, the disintegration of oral culture and the disappearance of primitive magical thinking in favor of writing culture and Christian worldview.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper attempts to examine the paradigm maintained by Sonimgut to position it in relation to reality as well as narrative. To this end, the study first examines the overall syntactic flow of Sonimgut, which is a cumulative structure that conveys and affirms the importance of welcome- hospitality-farewell to guest gods in stages. This structure has one paradigm, which can be called a kind of social(goodwill) paradigm, as it sees the guest god as an object of welcome, hospitality, and farewell. In order to examine the specificity of such a paradigm, we explore what this paradigm aims for in the society and culture in which the Gut is performed. Reinterpreting smallpox from a biological or medical point of view emphasizes that the social modeling of diseases built by this text is cultural and special rather than inherent and essential. These paradigms are repeated, reaffirmed, and rebuilt at every Sonimgut, driving some attitude toward the disease in its audience: a particular worldview. It is a human-made worldview that sees that human behavior and choice can lead to disease and recovery from disease. Finally, this paper recognizes that in the Pandemic-era, the source and result of Sonimgut can introduce recognizesmeaningful questions and answers to this worldview.

TI  - A Casemix: Congestive Heart Failure Readmission Rate and its Associated Factors in a Tertiary Teaching Hospital in Kuala Lumpur
T2  - MEDICINE AND HEALTH-KUALA LUMPUR
M3  - Article
AB  - Cardiovascular mortality is within the top five causes of death from non-communicable disease based on World Health Organization profile. Around 20% of heart failure patients are readmitted within 30 days worldwide. Readmission within 30 days for congestive heart failure often related to non-compliant to fluid restriction, natural progression of the disease or pre-mature discharge. The study aims to evaluate the 30 days readmission rate of congestive heart failure in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC) from the year 2016-2017 using casemix data and to determine the associated factors related to it. Based on the data coding, cost of readmission incurred was calculated. The 30-days readmission rate of heart failure to UKMMC in the year 2016-2017 was 53.5% & 43.5%, higher than the developed countries standard but similar to that of local teaching hospitals. After adjustment, age and level of severity are the only significant associated factors for the 30-days readmission rate. Shorter average length of stay (ALOS) & lower extra-tariff were achieved for readmission of heart failure. Total of RM80,329.73 was saved in the year 2017 from prompt treatment and comprehensive care plan of treating 19.3% level 3 severity patients at level 1 ALOS and tariff-cost. The 30- days readmission rate for heart failure in UKMMC was comparable to local teaching hospitals. The reduction of 30-days readmission rate in 2017 saved much cost, shows good clinical governance and advanced treatment strategy. Casemix can be used to guide budget allocation for the cardiology department of UKMMC.

TI  - Artificial intelligence mobile health platform for early detection of COVID-19 in quarantine subjects using a wearable biosensor: protocol for a randomised controlled trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction There is an outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide. As there is no effective therapy or vaccine yet, rigorous implementation of traditional public health measures such as isolation and quarantine remains the most effective tool to control the outbreak. When an asymptomatic individual with COVID-19 exposure is being quarantined, it is necessary to perform temperature and symptom surveillance. As such surveillance is intermittent in nature and highly dependent on self-discipline, it has limited effectiveness. Advances in biosensor technologies made it possible to continuously monitor physiological parameters using wearable biosensors with a variety of form factors. Objective To explore the potential of using wearable biosensors to continuously monitor multidimensional physiological parameters for early detection of COVID-19 clinical progression. Method This randomised controlled open-labelled trial will involve 200-1000 asymptomatic subjects with close COVID-19 contact under mandatory quarantine at designated facilities in Hong Kong. Subjects will be randomised to receive a remote monitoring strategy (intervention group) or standard strategy (control group) in a 1:1 ratio during the 14 day-quarantine period. In addition to fever and symptom surveillance in the control group, subjects in the intervention group will wear wearable biosensors on their arms to continuously monitor skin temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation and daily activities. These physiological parameters will be transferred in real time to a smartphone application called Biovitals Sentinel. These data will then be processed using a cloud-based multivariate physiology analytics engine called Biovitals to detect subtle physiological changes. The results will be displayed on a web-based dashboard for clinicians' review. The primary outcome is the time to diagnosis of COVID-19. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from institutional review boards at the study sites. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

AB  - In this paper, a band-ratio model is developed and validated using data collected in the coastal waters of Singapore to obtain the absorption coefficient (at 440nm) of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from Sentinel-2 images. Sentinel-2 is a suitable sensor for the monitoring of Singapore's coastal waters given the high temporal and spatial resolution which minimizes land and cloud contamination A simple band-ratio model is used such that the model could be easily operationalized and allow for the useful monitoring of CDOM in this region. The leave-one-out-cross-validation scheme was used to validate the model due to the small number of data points. This model is further tested with coincident Sentinel-2 images within +/- 24 hours from the in-situ measurements.

TI  - Can Linked Electronic Medical Record and Administrative Data Help Us Identify Those Living with Frailty?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POPULATION DATA SCIENCE (IJPDS)
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionFrailty is a complex condition that affects many aspects of patients' wellbeing and health outcomes.ObjectivesWe used available Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and administrative data to determine definitions of frailty. We also examined whether there were differences in demographics or health conditions among those identified as frail in either the EMR or administrative data.MethodsEMR and administrative data were linked in British Columbia (BC) and Manitoba (MB) to identify those aged 65 years and older who were frail. The EMR data were obtained from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) and the administrative data (e.g. billing, hospitalizations) was obtained from Population Data BC and the Manitoba Population Research Data Repository. Sociodemographic characteristics, risk factors, prescribed medications, use and costs of healthcare are described for those identified as frail.ResultsSociodemographic and utilization differences were found among those identified as frail from the EMR compared to those in the administrative data. Among those who were >65 years, who had a record in both EMR and administrative data, 5%-8% (n=191 of 3,553, BC; n=2,396 of 29,382, MB) were identified as frail. There was a higher likelihood of being frail with increasing age and being a woman. In BC and MB, those identified as frail in both data sources have approximately twice the number of contacts with primary care (n=20 vs. n=10) and more days in hospital (n=7.2 vs. n=1.9 in BC; n=9.8 vs. n=2.8 in MB) compared to those who are not frail; 27% (BC) and 14% (MB) of those identified as frail in 2014 died in 2015.ConclusionsIdentifying frailty using EMR data is particularly challenging because many functional deficits are not routinely recorded in structured data fields. Our results suggest frailty can be captured along a continuum using both EMR and administrative data.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of clubhead velocity through regression analysis on the magnitude and time difference of the forward-backward, medio-lateral, and vertical ground reaction peak forces generated by force plate during golf swing.Method: 16 subjects (age: 20.5±4.2 yrs, height: 176.0±5.4 cm, weight: 77.8±5.9 kg, handy: 2.4±1.7) who is elite golf player in high school and university, participated in this study. The study method adopted three-dimensional analysis with 8 cameras and ground reaction force measurement with two force plate. The analysis variables were clubhead velocity, and ground reaction analysis variables set four events in each graph based on the peak forces commonly generated in Fx, Fy, and Fz graphs of the ground reaction data during the golf swing.Results: As a result of analyzing the influence of ground reaction magnitude difference on clubhead velocity, the influence on clubhead velocity was ym4, zm1, xm4, zm2. The larger ym4, xm4, zm1, the faster the clubhead velocity, but the smaller the zm2, the faster the clubhead velocity. And in time difference, the influence on the clubhead velocity was in the order of xt4, zt1, zt3. The shorter xt4, zt1, zt3 showed faster clubhead velocity.Conclusion: The left foot played a leading role in increasing the velocity of the clubhead. Although the result was caused by the interaction of the right foot and the left foot during the swing, the role of the left foot is relatively large.

AB  - Artifacts in imagery captured by remote sensing, such as clouds, snow, and shadows, present challenges for various tasks, including semantic segmentation and object detection. A primary challenge in developing algorithms for identifying such artifacts is the cost of collecting annotated training data. In this work, we explore how recent advances in multi-image fusion can be leveraged to bootstrap single image cloud detection. We demonstrate that a network optimized to estimate image quality also implicitly learns to detect clouds. To support the training and evaluation of our approach, we collect a large dataset of Sentinel-2 images along with a per-pixel semantic labelling for land cover. Through various experiments, we demonstrate that our method reduces the need for annotated training data and improves cloud detection performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neisseria gonorrhoeae (commonly known as gonorrhea) has developed resistance to all first-line therapy in Southeast Asia. East Africa has historically had absent or rudimentary gonorrhea surveillance programs and, while the existence of antimicrobial-resistant gonorrhea is recognized, the extent of its resistance is largely unknown. In 2016, the World Health Organization's Enhanced Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (EGASP) was initiated in Uganda to monitor resistance trends.OBJECTIVE: This study characterizes gonorrhea and antibiotic resistance in a large surveillance program of men with urethral discharge syndrome from Kampala, Uganda.METHODS: Men attending sentinel clinics with urethritis provided demographic information, behavior data, and a urethral swab in line with the World Health Organization's EGASP protocols for culture, identification, and antibiotic-sensitivity testing using 2 methods-disk diffusion (Kirby-Bauer test) and Etest (BioMerieux Inc). A subset of samples underwent detailed antimicrobial resistance testing.RESULTS: Of 639 samples collected from September 2016 to February 2018, 400 (62.6%) were culture-positive though 414 (64.8%) had microscopic evidence of gonorrhea. The mean age of the men from whom the samples were collected was 26.9 (SD 9.6) years and 7.2% (46/639) reported having HIV. There was high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and penicillin (greater than 90%) by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion and 2.1% (4/188) had reduced azithromycin sensitivity by Etest. Of the early isolates that underwent detailed characterization, 60.3% (70/116) were culture-positive, 94% (66/69) isolates were either ciprofloxacin-resistant or ciprofloxacin-intermediate by Etest, 96% (65/68) were azithromycin-sensitive, and 96% (66/69) were gentamicin-sensitive. Resistance profiles were comparable between methods except for ceftriaxone (disk diffusion: 68/69, 99%; Etest: 67/69, 97%) and for gentamicin (disk diffusion: 2/8, 25%; Etest: 66/69, 96%) sensitivity.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report from a systematic gonorrhea surveillance program in Uganda. Findings demonstrated resistance or increased minimum inhibitory concentration to all key antigonococcal antibiotics. There was evidence of poor antibiotic stewardship, near-universal resistance to several antibiotics, and emerging resistance to others. Individuals in the population sampled were at exceptionally high risk of STI and HIV infection requiring intervention. Ongoing surveillance efforts to develop interventions to curtail antimicrobial-resistant gonorrhea are needed.

AB  - In this study, soil moisture (SM) products from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission are assessed for their validity in heterogeneous, irrigated agricultural regions. SMAP products at 36 km and at enhanced 9 km resolution are compared with in situ SM data from an operational farm in Florida during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons for field corn and peanuts. SMAP has a strong positive SM bias which may be caused by unrealistic vegetation water content (VWC) values being used in the SM retrieval algorithm. To determine whether higher spatial resolution VWC information can improve the SM retrieval algorithm, Sentinel-1 derived VWC will be used to form a SM regression model. The model will be calibrated on a Florida research site and tested on the study farm.

AB  - The Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been maintained its nominal operations since it was launched in December 1999 on Terra and May 2002 on Aqua spacecraft, respectively. MODIS is a scanning radiometer with a two-sided mirror that scans the Earth over an angular range from -55 degrees to +55 degrees off nadir and covers a wavelength range from 0.4 to 14.4 mu m in 36 spectral bands. The sensitivity to polarization was fully characterized during prelaunch characterization for each reflective solar band (RSB), detector and mirror side as a function of scan angle. It was observed that while on-orbit polarization sensitivity for Aqua MODIS has been stable over the course of mission, the Terra MODIS polarization sensitivity at a few short wavelengths showed a significant increase near the end of scan angle after a few years in the mission. Our previous study examined the impact of polarization on the measured top-of-atmosphere reflectances obtained over the pseudo-invariant desert sites. There are up to 25% change in gain and 30% seasonal variation in select Terra RSBs due to the increase in polarization sensitivity. In this study, we examine relative changes in the polarization sensitivity of detectors within a band. Results from prelaunch tests indicate that there is a noticeable detector dependent polarization sensitivity and it is expected that such a dependency could change on orbit, particularly for Terra MODIS. Results of this study provide useful information on polarization impact and implementation of the correction algorithm.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Sensors, Systems, and Next-Generation Satellites XXIV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is the key instrument of the NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra and Aqua missions, launched in December 1999 and May 2002, respectively. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) expands the MODIS legacy, launched onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite in October 2011 and NOAA20 satellite in November 2017, respectively. The MODIS and VIIRS sensors have a similar design with spectrally matched reflective solar spectral bands (RSB). Their on-board calibration components include a solar diffuser and a solar diffuser stability monitor for RSB, a V-grooved blackbody for the thermal emissive bands (TEB), and a space view as a background reference. This study evaluates the calibration consistency of the Terra and Aqua MODIS RSB based on the current Collection 6.1 L1B data products generated by the NASA MODAPS, which have used consistent calibration coefficient look up tables (LUT) for the entire data-record. In the case of SNPP and NOAA20 VIIRS, the latest L1B data produced by NASA Land SIPS are used. Several independent vicarious approaches are used to examine the stability and consistency of the at-sensor reflectance among MODIS and VIIRS instruments. Vicarious approaches include observations from simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNO), the Libya-4 desert and Dome C snow sites, as well as deep convective clouds (DCC). Impact of existing band spectral difference on the reflectance is corrected using hyperspectral observations provided by Europe Space Agency's SCIAMACHY sensor. Results of this study provide comprehensive assessments of calibration performance, radiometric agreement and associated uncertainties.

TI  - Regional Actual Evapotranspiration Estimation with Land and Meteorological Variables Derived from Multi-Source Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the components in the water cycle and the surface energy balance systems. It is fundamental information for agriculture, water resource management, and climate change research. This study presents a scheme for regional actual evapotranspiration estimation using multi-source satellite data to compute key land and meteorological variables characterizing land surface, soil, vegetation, and the atmospheric boundary layer. The algorithms are validated using ground observations from the Heihe River Basin of northwest China. Monthly data estimates at a resolution of 1 km from the proposed algorithms compared well with ground observation data, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.80 mm and a mean relative error (MRE) of -7.11%. The overall deviation between the average yearly ET derived from the proposed algorithms and ground-based water balance measurements was 9.44% for a small watershed and 1% for the entire basin. This study demonstrates that both accuracy and spatial depiction of actual evapotranspiration estimation can be significantly improved by using multi-source satellite data to measure the required land surface and meteorological variables. This reduces dependence on spatial interpolation of ground-derived meteorological variables which can be problematic, especially in data-sparse regions, and allows the production of region-wide ET datasets.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction of GOCI Using Quasi-Synchronous VIIRS Data in Highly Turbid Coastal Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) sensor, with high temporal and spatial resolution (eight images per day at an interval of 1 hour, 500 m), is the world's first geostationary ocean color satellite sensor. GOCI provides good data for ocean color remote sensing in the Western Pacific, among the most turbid waters in the world. However, GOCI has no shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands making atmospheric correction (AC) challenging in highly turbid coastal regions. In this paper, we have developed a new AC algorithm for GOCI in turbid coastal waters by using quasi-synchronous Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data. This new algorithm estimates and removes the aerosol scattering reflectance according to the contributing aerosol models and the aerosol optical thickness estimated by VIIRS's near-infrared (NIR) and SWIR bands. Comparisons with other AC algorithms showed that the new algorithm provides a simple, effective, AC approach for GOCI to obtain reasonable results in highly turbid coastal waters.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Sharpening via Parallel Residual Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 data is of great utility for a wide range of remote sensing applications due to its free access and fine spatial-temporal coverage. However, restricted by the hardware, only four bands of Sentinel-2 images are provided at 10 m resolution, while others are recorded at reduced resolution (i.e., 20 m or 60 m). In this paper, we propose a parallel residual network for Sentinel-2 sharpening termed SPRNet, to obtain the complete data at 10 m resolution. The proposed network aims to learn the mapping between the low-resolution (LR) bands and ideal high-resolution (HR) bands by three steps, including parallel spatial residual learning, spatial feature fusing and spectral feature mapping. First, rather than using the single branch network, the parallel residual learning structure is proposed to extract the spatial features from different resolution bands separately. Second, the spatial feature fusing is aimed to fully fuse the extracted features from each branch and produce the residual image with spatial information. Third, to keep spectral fidelity, the spectral feature mapping is utilized to directly propagate the spectral characteristics of LR bands to target HR bands. Without using extra training data, the proposed network is trained with the lower scale data synthesized from the observed Sentinel-2 data and applied to the original ones. The data at 10 m spatial resolution can be finally obtained by feeding the original 10 m, 20 m and 60 m bands to the trained SPRNet. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets indicate that the proposed SPRNet obtains good results in the spatial fidelity and the spectral preservation. Compared with the competing approaches, the SPRNet increases the SRE by at least 1.538 dB on 20 m bands and 3.188 dB on 60 m bands while reduces the SAM by at least 0.282 on 20 m bands and 0.162 on 60 m bands.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Fusion With Only Two Remote Sensing Images as Input
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal data fusion is an effective way of generating a dense time series with a high spatial resolution. Traditionally, the spatiotemporal fusion models, especially the popular ones such as the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model, require at least three images as input, i.e., a coarse-resolution image on the target date and a pair of fine- and coarse-resolution images on the reference date. However, this cannot always be satisfied, as the high-quality coarse-resolution image on the reference date may be unavailable in some application scenarios. This led to efforts to achieve data fusion only using the other two images as input. In this article, we proposed an effective strategy that can be combined with any spatiotemporal fusion model to accomplish the fusion with simplified input. To confirm the validity of the method, we comprehensively compared the fusion performances under the two input modalities. In total, 38 tests were conducted with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat, and Sentinel-2 land surface reflectance products. Results suggest that by applying the proposed method, the fusion performance with only two input images is comparable or even superior to that with three input images. This article challenges the stereotype that spatiotemporal data fusion strictly needs at least three input images. The proposed method extends the application scenarios of spatiotemporal fusion, and creates opportunities to fuse sensors with barely overlapping temporal coverages, such as the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument.

TI  - Alleviation of Alcoholic Liver Injury by Mogroside V Involves in Anti-inflammatory Effect via TLR4 Pathway in Rats
T2  - LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mogroside V (MV) is one of the main bio-active ingredient, extracted from fruit of Siraitia grosvenorii (Swingle) C. Jeffrey ex A.M. Lu & Z.Y. Zhang which is a traditional Chinese medicine and has the function of protecting liver in folk. In order to figure out whether or not the function is related to MV treatment and the mechanism of it, hepatoprotective effect and anti-inflammatory activity of MV, and its underlying mechanism were studied using ethanol-induced fatty liver (EFL) rat model. The results showed that MV treatment significantly decreased the serum levels of ALT, AST, TBIL and endotoxin, hepatic tissue contents of TG, dramatically down-regulated expression of TLR4 and MyD88, and accordingly suppressed levels of NF-kappa B p65, TNF-alpha, iNOS, COX-2 and IL-6 in EFL rats. The findings indicate that MV treatment effectively improves the EFL injury, and its possible mechanism involves in anti-inflammatory effect via TLR4 signal path.

AB  - Based on Landsat TM/ETM+ images acquired in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 respectively, land use maps of Jiaodong Peninsular were created to analyze the characteristics of land use change. Then the Logistic-CA-Markov model was selected to simulate the spatial -temporal patterns of land use changes in 2010, 2015 and 2020 at 100 m spatial scale and five-year time interval. The results showed that: (1)During the period 2000-2015, areas of farmland decreased continuously, while urban area, rural settlement and independent industrial -mining increased continuously and rapidly; (2) Ten impact factors were chosen as the independent variables of Logistic regression analysis to establish eight logistic regression equations for eight land use types; (3) As the Logistic-CA-Markov model has a good performance in the simulation of land use maps in 2010 and 2015, it was further used to simulate land use change in 2020. (4)The simulation results showed that farmland, forest would decline during 2015 and 2020; Urban area would still increase.

TI  - Multi-Type Forest Change Detection Using BFAST and Monthly Landsat Time Series for Monitoring Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Forests in Subtropical Wetland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover changes, especially excessive economic forest plantations, have significantly threatened the ecological security of West Dongting Lake wetland in China. This work aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of forests in the West Dongting Lake region from 2000 to 2018 using a reconstructed monthly Landsat NDVI time series. The multi-type forest changes, including conversion from forest to another land cover category, conversion from another land cover category to forest, and conversion from forest to forest (such as flooding and replantation post-deforestation), and land cover categories before and after change were effectively detected by integrating Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) and random forest algorithms with the monthly NDVI time series, with an overall accuracy of 87.8%. On the basis of focusing on all the forest regions extracted through creating a forest mask for each image in time series and merging these to produce an 'anytime' forest mask, the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest were analyzed on the basis of the acquired information of multi-type forest changes and classification. The forests are principally distributed in the core zone of West Donting Lake surrounding the water body and the southwestern mountains. The forest changes in the core zone and low elevation region are prevalent and frequent. The variation of forest areas in West Dongting Lake experienced three steps: rapid expansion of forest plantation from 2000 to 2005, relatively steady from 2006 to 2011, and continuous decline since 2011, mainly caused by anthropogenic factors, such as government policies and economic profits. This study demonstrated the applicability of the integrated BFAST method to detect multi-type forest changes by using dense Landsat time series in the subtropical wetland ecosystem with low data availability.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis: To describe outcomes of a single institution experience with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.Study Design: Retrospective case series.Methods: Chart review was performed for patients who presented with clinically node negative cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck between December 2007 and May 2018. Patients who met high-risk criteria underwent SLNB and excision, with or without adjuvant therapy. Patients who underwent prior neck dissection were excluded. The main outcomes were SLNB result, lymph node spread, recurrence-free survival, disease-specific survival, and overall survival.Results: Eighty-three patients underwent successful SLNB, and one patient underwent selective neck dissection for intraoperatively identified occult lymph node metastasis. Five patients (6%) had a sentinel node positive for tumor, of whom 4/5 received further treatment (neck dissection, radiation, and/or systemic therapy) with no further recurrence at the time of last follow-up. SLNB had a negative predictive value of 95% to 100%. Recurrent tumor at presentation, tumor arising from an area of chronic inflammation, and immunosuppression were significantly associated with increased risk of subsequent recurrence, with a mean follow-up of 19.9 months.Conclusions: SLNB can be used to identify regional lymph node metastases in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with a high negative predictive value (95%-100%). Factors associated with recurrence were tumor being locally recurrent at presentation, arising from an area of chronic inflammation, and immunosuppression.

TI  - Classification of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images in the Feilaixia Reservoir Based on a Fully Convolutional Network
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In technologically underdeveloped areas, water pollution threatens the living environment of local residents, so remote sensing monitoring of the features around reservoirs is necessary. Fully convolutional networks (FCNs) offer great potential for extracting high-resolution features due to their unlimited input image size and higher accuracy compared to convolutional neural networks. Therefore, a proposal to classify WorldView-2 images is implemented with a sixty-eight thousand iterations of fine-tuning and fully trained combined training method based on a fully convolutional network (SEFCN). The chosen images depict the urban area of Yingde, which is located to the northeast of the Feilaixia Reservoir, Qingyuan, Guangdong Province, China. The SEFCN combines an FCN-32s and FCN-16s to better integrate the deep features and shallow features and effectively improve the classification accuracy. Additionally, the loss value fully converges with enough iterations, and the overfitting caused by the superposition of two full trainings is avoided. The SEFCN model achieves the highest accuracy among all compared classification models and obtains the best classified results on the WorldView-2 images, as demonstrated by attaining the highest F1 scores in each category. After the classified images are optimized using a conditional random field, the current status of the study area is analyzed, and several suggestions for land use in the urban area of Yingde are made. The experiments still have deficiencies in the application of high-resolution remote sensing image classification with different sensors, and the classification results can be optimized and improved in other aspects.

TI  - Effect of Typhoon Kalmaegi (2014) on northern South China Sea explored using Muti-platform satellite and buoy observations data
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on observational data from a buoy/mooring array and satellite remote sensing data for sea-surface winds, temperature, and height during the passage of Typhoon Kalmaegi (2014), a systematic analysis is performed on the atmospheric and oceanic variables of winds, sea-level air pressure, surface air temperature, sensible and latent heat fluxes, rainfall, water temperature, salinity, and ocean currents. Kalmaegi passed through the South China Sea (SCS) with a mean non-dimensional speed of similar to 2.87, typical of a fast-moving storm with a predominantly baroclinic oceanic response. In addition to some well-documented response features such as right-ward-biased intensifications in sea-surface cooling and currents, a much deeper mixed layer to the right side of the storm, and a strong near-inertial oscillation in the thermocline, we here identify several new features, as follows. (1) The current velocity to the right side of the track decays faster than that to the left side. (2) On the right side of the track, the typhoon-induced water temperature anomaly exhibits a three-layered 'cooling-warming-cooling' structure in the vertical, with salinity and density anomaly profiles sharing a similar pattern. (3) On the left side of the track, the whole upper ocean is cooled, whereas salinity shows no variation in the uppermost 20-m layer, with a negative anomaly for water at depths from 20 to 50 m and a positive anomaly below 50 m. The associated mechanisms are discussed in the text. (4) The storm-induced maximum cooling is not unique to Kalmaegi (2014). In fact, storms with tracks similar to that of Kalmaegi (2014) may induce similar maximum cooling in the northern SCS, which may be useful in predictions of where such storms would induce the maximum cooling.

TI  - Radioactive polymeric nanoparticles for biomedical application
T2  - DRUG DELIVERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, emerging radiolabeled nanosystems are revolutionizing medicine in terms of diagnostics, treatment, and theranostics. These radionuclides include polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), liposomal carriers, dendrimers, magnetic iron oxide NPs, silica NPs, carbon nanotubes, and inorganic metal-based nanoformulations. Between these nano-platforms, polymeric NPs have gained attention in the biomedical field due to their excellent properties, such as their surface to mass ratio, quantum properties, biodegradability, low toxicity, and ability to absorb and carry other molecules. In addition, NPs are capable of carrying high payloads of radionuclides which can be used for diagnostic, treatment, and theranostics depending on the radioactive material linked. The radiolabeling process of nanoparticles can be performed by direct or indirect labeling process. In both cases, the most appropriate must be selected in order to keep the targeting properties as preserved as possible. In addition, radionuclide therapy has the advantage of delivering a highly concentrated absorbed dose to the targeted tissue while sparing the surrounding healthy tissues. Said another way, radioactive polymeric NPs represent a promising prospect in the treatment and diagnostics of cardiovascular diseases such as cardiac ischemia, infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, and other type of cancer cells or tumors.

TI  - Response of the Water Conservation Function to Vegetation Dynamics in the Qinghai&x2013;Tibetan Plateau Based on MODIS Products
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing demand for global water resources and general deterioration of the ecological environment of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, changes to the water conservation functions of ecosystems and the impact mechanisms have attracted great attention. Currently, the research on water conservation has mainly focused on a single biome type, in particular, forests. Few studies explore the differences in water conservation functions of different biome types. Research on this topic mostly utilizes field investigations and sample plot settings to explore the differences in water conservation capacity of a small number of tree species, but these methods are limited in time and space. Therefore, this study uses MODIS products to evaluate the water conservation function of different biome types in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Dynamic monitoring of the vegetation and water conservation capacity in the study area and research on the responses of the water conservation functions of different biome types were conducted. The results indicate that the vegetation of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau increased slightly from 2000 to 2015; however, due to the dual influence of climate and topographic factors, the water conservation capacity showed a slight decline. The water conservation service function mainly comes from grassland ecosystems, which are closely related to vegetation density and biome types. Therefore, to greatly improve the water conservation service function of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the management and planting of vegetation should be conducted according to the optimal vegetation coverage area, vegetation quantities and biome types.

TI  - Geo-Object-Based Land Cover Map Update for High-Spatial-Resolution Remote Sensing Images via Change Detection and Label Transfer
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover (LC) information plays an important role in different geoscience applications such as land resources and ecological environment monitoring. Enhancing the automation degree of LC classification and updating at a fine scale by remote sensing has become a key problem, as the capability of remote sensing data acquisition is constantly being improved in terms of spatial and temporal resolution. However, the present methods of generating LC information are relatively inefficient, in terms of manually selecting training samples among multitemporal observations, which is becoming the bottleneck of application-oriented LC mapping. Thus, the objectives of this study are to speed up the efficiency of LC information acquisition and update. This study proposes a rapid LC map updating approach at a geo-object scale for high-spatial-resolution (HSR) remote sensing. The challenge is to develop methodologies for quickly sampling. Hence, the core step of our proposed methodology is an automatic method of collecting samples from historical LC maps through combining change detection and label transfer. A data set with Chinese Gaofen-2 (GF-2) HSR satellite images is utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of our method for multitemporal updating of LC maps. Prior labels in a historical LC map are certified to be effective in a LC updating task, which contributes to improve the effectiveness of the LC map update by automatically generating a number of training samples for supervised classification. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the automation degree of LC map updating and allows for geo-object-based up-to-date LC mapping with high accuracy. The results indicate that the proposed method boosts the ability of automatic update of LC map, and greatly reduces the complexity of visual sample acquisition. Furthermore, the accuracy of LC type and the fineness of polygon boundaries in the updated LC maps effectively reflect the characteristics of geo-object changes on the ground surface, which makes the proposed method suitable for many applications requiring refined LC maps.

TI  - Cloud Extraction Scheme for Multi-Spectral Images Using Landsat-8 OLI Images With High Brightness Reflectivity Covered
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud extraction is a vital step in remote sensing image processing. Although many advanced cloud extraction methods have been proposed and confirmed to be effective in recent years, there are still difficulties in cloud extraction in areas of high brightness reflectivity covered. High brightness reflectivity cover can have similar spectral characteristics as clouds, and thus, it is easily confused with clouds in cloud extraction schemes. This work presents a novel scheme designed to extract clouds in satellite imagery with high brightness reflectivity covered. The fractal summation method and spatial analysis are used to extract the clouds in the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images containing high brightness reflectivity covered. The scheme consists of three main steps: cloud extraction based on pixel values, Anselin Local Moran's I value, and anisotropy. Pixel values were applied to extract the clouds associated with anomalies, and the last two steps were conducted to eliminate false anomalies. The findings showed that the cloud-associated anomaly pixel-values well approximate a power-law function, but both the real and fake anomaly patches (e.g., snow/ice, desert, etc.) routinely coexist within the same (fractal) scaleless segments, and that the latter seems to be more significant than the former. Consequently, these results indicate that the diagnostic difference between true and false anomalies must lie in their spatial distribution patterns. Furthermore, experiments confirmed that the fractal dimension and spatial distribution (i.e. Anselin Local Moran's I index and anisotropy) difference between the real and false anomalies displayed a certain universality. The proposed scheme effectively reduces the confusion and misclassification caused by cloud, snow and the highlighted underlying surface. It is of great significance for cloud restoration processing, image analysis, image matching, target detection and extraction, and effective extraction and utilization of remote sensing data.

TI  - New Scheme for Impervious Surface Area Mapping From SAR Images With Auxiliary User-Generated Content
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a new scheme to extract impervious surface area from synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images exploiting auxiliary user-generated content (UGC). The presented scheme includes the automatic generation of training samples based on the combination of UGC and SAR data, and SAR data preprocessing, leading to impervious surface area classification through a clustering-based one-class support vector machine approach. Two areas-namely, the cities of Beijing and Taipei, have been analyzed using the Sentinel-1 SAR data to test and validate the proposed methodology. Experimental results show that the presented scheme improves the automatic selection of impervious surface training samples. Moreover, this scheme achieves a comparable classification performance to traditional methods without requiring time-consuming training point manual extraction. Results in this study will help to promote the application of UGC for urban remote sensing data interpretation.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity of climate variation and vegetation response for Arctic and high-elevation regions from 2001-2018
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, an amplification of warming in Arctic and high-elevation regions has been widely observed, along with a general enhancement of vegetation growth. However, driven by variability in controlling factors and complex mechanisms, climate and vegetation changes can be highly heterogeneous in space and time. In this study, an analysis is performed separating Arctic and Tibetan Plateau (TP) vegetated areas into various units according to a map of terrestrial ecoregions. The most recent variations of heat, moisture, and vegetation growth (MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) are evaluated over 2001-2018. Relationships among the climate and vegetation variables are assessed. Six distinct change patterns are identified: (1) synchronized increase of day and night temperature and precipitation during April to October coinciding with strong vegetation greening, (2) profound warming with no change in precipitation and vegetation, (3) an increase of summer temperature and vegetation with a negative latitudinal gradient, (4) greening under increased precipitation without warming, (5) browning not likely being driven by climate, (6) warming only during the nighttime and moderately enhanced vegetation growth. It is demonstrated that vegetation growth in the Arctic and TP is largely controlled by nighttime temperature and precipitation, as opposed to daytime temperature. The exception is the Canadian Arctic, where greening is directly related to summer daytime warming, and a contrasting relationship is observed on the TP. The underlying causes of these patterns are discussed, relating them to multiple mechanisms reported in the literature. These findings may help to further understand the changing Arctic and high-elevation climate and its effects on vegetation growth.

AB  - Crop yield estimation at the field scale is essential for farmers, crop insurance companies to make informed decisions. Methodologies based on assimilating remote sensing LAI into crop growth models have shown advantages in crop yield estimates. Compared with MODIS and Landsat, Sentinel-2 satellites provide higher spatial and temporal resolution data, which brings revolutionary opportunities for crop monitoring. This study is to evaluate the performance of assimilating Sentinel-2 LAI into the WOFOST model for winter wheat yield estimation using the Ensemble Kalman Filter algorithm. The results showed that assimilating Sentinel-2 LAI improved the yield estimation (R-2 = 0.45; RMSE = 512 kg/ha) compared to the situation without data assimilation (R-2 = 0.27; RMSE = 818 kg/ha), which demonstrated the potential usage of the Sentinel-2 LAI for yield estimation at the field scale.

AB  - Here we jointly analyzed L-band ALOS PALSAR data and more than 200 soil samples in order to determine soil properties that control the seasonal freeze-thaw process of the active layer. We found that the magnitude of the seasonal freezethaw (FT) deformation strongly correlates with land vegetation cover types. This is because the seasonal FT deformation is a direct measure of the active layer soil water content, and the amount of water in the soil limits the type of vegetation that can grow. Furthermore, we found that soil carbon amount also correlates with land cover types. Soils that contain more carbon in the active layer also tend to produce larger seasonal FT deformation. Our results suggest that there are many previously unrecognized ways that InSAR can be used for monitoring changes in hydrological and ecological characteristics in soils above continuous permafrost.

M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fire patterns are likely to be altered by climate change. We used boosted regression trees modelling and the MODIS Global Fire Atlas dataset (2003-15) to characterise relative influences of nine natural and human variables on fire patterns across five forest zones in China. The same modelling approach was used to project fire patterns for 2041-60 and 2061-80 based on two general circulation models for two representative concentration pathways scenarios. The results showed that, for the baseline period (2003-15) and across the five forest zones, climate variables explained 37.4-43.5% of the variability in fire occurrence and human activities were responsible for explaining an additional 27.0-36.5% of variability. The fire frequency was highest in the subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests zone in southern China, and lowest in the warm temperate deciduous broadleaved mixed-forests zone in northern China. Projection results showed an increasing trend in fire occurrence probability ranging from 43.3 to 99.9% and 41.4 to 99.3% across forest zones under the two climate models and two representative concentration pathways scenarios relative to the current climate (2003-15). Increased fire occurrence is projected to shift from southern to central-northern China for both 2041-60 and 2061-80.

In this paper, we use binning and resampling to evaluate the relationship between IASI-retrieved NH3 concentration and MODIS-retrieved vegetation indices from 2008 to 2016. As the results show, there is a significant positive correlation between NH3 concentration and vegetation conditions. The relationship has a clear intraannual pattern, while it has great spatial heterogeneity. Another finding is that nighttime NH3 observations generally have a better correlation with vegetation conditions. Still, deeper investigations and model simulations are needed to explain the mechanism behind this relationship and its spatial and temporal patterns.

AB  - Reliable information on the spatial distribution of snow in mountain ranges are critical for risk assessments, outdoor activities, water resource management and alpine ecology. Despite it's importance, we lack an accurate monitoring of the continuous distribution of snow in space and time, which currently constitutes one of the most important unsolved problems in mountain hydrology. In this study, we present a novel approach for snow depth mapping based on satellite data and ground station networks, that takes topographical and meteorological differences into account. The resulting maps provide snow depth quantities for entire mountain ranges in a 20 m spatial resolution on a daily basis. We validate our geo-statistical model based on 61 airborne snow depth surveys from the European Alps and Rocky Mountains. Overall, the average correlation coefficients and RMSE is 0.32 and 0.85 m in the US and 0.22 and 0.53 m in Switzerland, respectively. Given the highly variable nature of snow depths, these numbers indicate an important milestone towards improved snow monitoring in alpine regions with versatile applications.

TI  - Evaluation of the accuracy of the Sentinel-5 Precursor operational SO<sub>2</sub> products over China
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-5 Precursor (S-5P) was launched into low earth orbit with a single payload TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on 13 October, 2017. TROPOMI is able to provide atmospheric composition observations including sulfur dioxide (SO2) daily and globally. It has a higher spatial resolution, specifically with a ground resolution of 7 kmx3.5 km in the nadir, than previous satellite instruments such as Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI, 13 kmx24 km) and Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS, 50 kmx50 km). The three types of S-5P operational SO2 products (offline (OFFL), Reprocessing (RPRO) and Near Real Time (NRTI)) are on basis of the differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) algorithm, and available from the S-5P Pre-Operations Data Hub. To evaluate these data, the results of OFFL are compared to the measurements obtained by ground-based Multi-Axis DOAS (MAX-DOAS) and China National Environmental Monitoring Center (CNEMC). We find that the S-5P operational SO2 products significantly overestimate SO2 concentrations over Northern China. Compared with four ground-based MAX-DOAS measurements in terms of the weekly average SO2 vertical column densities (VCDs), the S-5P operational SO2 products exhibit an overestimation of 61%-140%, with the correlation coefficient less than 0.5. The a priori SO2 profiles in S-5P operational products are from daily Tracer Model (TM5) simulations. SO2 surface concentrations are converted by the S-5P operational SO2 products and a priori SO2 profiles used in the retrievals. The correlation coefficient between the SO2 surface concentrations measured by CNEMC over Northern China and those from the S-5P operational products is higher than 0.5, and the S-5P operational products at these CNEMC sites show an overestimation of about 54.6% on average. In this study, the SO2 products (TROPOMI USTC SO2 products) are retrieved by the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) with the optimal estimation algorithm (OE) from TROPOMI measurements, with the a priori SO2 profiles from monthly average GEOS-Chem simulations. The mean biases between the TROPOMI USTC SO2 products and the ground-based MAX-DOAS measurements are reduced significantly (-4.8%-22%), together with an improvement in the correlation coefficients (0.72-0.89). TROPOMI USTC SO2 surface concentrations are transformed by the TROPOMI USTC SO2 products and a priori SO2 profiles in the retrievals. Based on the evaluation statistics of the S-5P operational SO2 products, a smaller mean bias of -25.8% is found between the TROPOMI USTC SO2 surface concentrations and CNEMC measurements over Northern China. Compared to the TROPOMI USTC SO2 products in the heavily polluted area (33 degrees-45 degrees N, 110 degrees-122 degrees E), the S-5P operational SO2 products have an overestimation of around 41.3%, with a correlation coefficient of 0.73. In addition, S-5P operational SO2 products show a larger area of heavy pollution than TROPOMI USTC SO2 products. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis indicates many influential factors of the SO2 retrievals using OE algorithm, such as radiative calibration, fitting window and a priori SO2 profiles. In the fitting window of 310.5-326.0 nm, the SO2 columns retrieved by the a priori profiles from monthly GEOS-Chem simulations show better agreement with the MAX-DOAS measurements than those from daily TM5 simulations. A possible reason is that the emission inventory used in GEOS-Chem is based on a Chinese power sector database for 31 provinces supported by CMEP (Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection), resulting in a better performance of GEOS-Chem than that of TM5 over China in simulations. And the overestimation of the S-5P operational SO2 products over Northern China may be attributed to the fitting window used.

AB  - Cloud cover is one of the main factors affecting the quality of remote sensing images, and cloud detection is the first problem to be solved in remote sensing data production. Therefore, cloud judgment becomes one of the primary tasks and key technologies of remote sensing image processing. The main detection objects include thin cloud, thick cloud and cloud shadow. The main interference factors include snow, gobi, desert, reflective buildings and other highlights. Firstly, the high reflectance characteristics of clouds are used to analyze the distribution of near-infrared and red bands in multispectral remote sensing images to realize preliminary cloud detection. And then using the detected suspected cloud region, different morphological features to distinguish the cloud from other highlight features, and the higher cloud detection accuracy in high-resolution satellite images is achieved.

TI  - Is the phenology-based algorithm for mapping deciduous rubber plantations applicable in an emerging region of northern Laos?
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Updated information of rubber plantations is essential for assessing socioeconomic and environmental impacts, especially in the emerging region of northern tropics. Here, a phenological method was modified to detect rubber plantations using Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery in Phongsaly Province of northern Laos, where it begun a rubber boom in the mid-2000s due to geoeconomic cooperation. It highlighted the landscape and pixel differences of deciduous rubber plantations in the tri-temporal phases (i.e., pre-defoliation, defoliation, and foliation) during the dry season due to phenological changes. Six commonly used vegetation indices (VIs), including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR and NBR2) derived from OLI imagery during 2013-2016 were compared to determine the most suitable VI for discriminating the phenological differences of rubber plantations from natural forests. Then, the Differences of Normalized Burn Ratio (DNBR) was applied to generate the 30 m map of rubber plantations in 2016, by combining two masks of Landsat-derived forest and suitable elevation for rubber trees cultivation. The resultant map of rubber plantations had a classification accuracy of 93.7% and the Kappa coefficient of 0.848. Our study demonstrated the usefulness of the Landsat-derived tri-temporal phenological DNBR approach in an emerging region of northern Laos, despite requiring more scenes compared with single- and double temporal window methods.

TI  - Coastal Mangrove Response to Marine Erosion: Evaluating the Impacts of Spatial Distribution and Vegetation Growth in Bangkok Bay from 1987 to 2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long time-series monitoring of mangroves to marine erosion in the Bay of Bangkok, using Landsat data from 1987 to 2017, shows responses including landward retreat and seaward extension. Quantitative assessment of these responses with respect to spatial distribution and vegetation growth shows differing relationships depending on mangrove growth stage. Using transects perpendicular to the shoreline, we calculated the cross-shore mangrove extent (width) to represent spatial distribution, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to represent vegetation growth. Correlations were then compared between mangrove seaside changes and the two parameters-mangrove width and NDVI-at yearly and 10-year scales. Both spatial distribution and vegetation growth display positive impacts on mangrove ecosystem stability: At early growth stages, mangrove stability is positively related to spatial distribution, whereas at mature growth the impact of vegetation growth is greater. Thus, we conclude that at early growth stages, planting width and area are more critical for stability, whereas for mature mangroves, management activities should focus on sustaining vegetation health and density. This study provides new rapid insights into monitoring and managing mangroves, based on analyses of parameters from historical satellite-derived information, which succinctly capture the net effect of complex environmental and human disturbances.

AB  - In this paper, GF-1 WVF image and Sentinel-1 SAR image covering Huixian wetland area are used as data sources. The Gram Schmidt (GS) algorithm is first used to fuse GF-1 images and SAR images with different polarization modes, and then the Random Forest (RF) algorithm is used for supervised classification. Finally, the accuracy of classification results and the ability to extract information are compared. The experimental results show that the fusion image has obvious texture features and prominent karst landform features, compared with the GF-1 WVF image. Compared with the Sentinel-1 SAR image, the fusion image has obvious spectral features. Spectral differences between typical features are large; The overall classification accuracy of GF-1 images, GF-1 and Sentinel-1 VV polarization fusion images, and GF-1 and Sentinel-1 VH polarization fusion images have reached over 80%. The classification accuracy of GF-1 and Sentinel-1 VV polarization fusion images reaches 85.15%, which is better than GF-1 and Sentinel-1 VH polarization fusion images. The classification accuracy of water bodies in the VV polarization fusion image is better than that of GF-1. Bare ground has the highest classification accuracy among all fused images.

TI  - Combining Support Vector Machines with Distance-based Relative Competence Weighting for Remote Sensing Image Classification: A Case Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A classification problem involving multi-class samples is typically divided into a set of two-class sub-problems. The pairwise probabilities produced by the binary classifiers are subsequently combined to generate a final result. However, only the binary classifiers that have been trained with the unknown real class of an unlabeled sample are relevant to the multi-class problem. A distance-based relative competence weighting (DRCW) combination mechanism can estimate the competence of the binary classifiers. In this work, we adapt the DRCW mechanism to the support vector machine (SVM) approach for the classification of remote sensing images. The application of DRCW can allow the competence of a binary classifier to be estimated from the spectral information. It is therefore possible to distinguish the relevant and irrelevant binary classifiers. The SVM CDRCW classification approach is applied to analyzing the land-use/land-cover patterns in Guangzhou, China from the remotely sensed images from Landsat-5 TM and SPOT-5. The results show that the SVM CDRVW approach can achieve higher classification accuracies compared to the conventional SVM and SVMs combined with other combination mechanisms such as weighted voting (WV) and probability estimates by pairwise coupling (PE).

AB  - Video satellite is of great significance in change detection and military reconnaissance due to its high temporal resolution. However, restricted by the hardware conditions, spatial resolution must be sacrificed if temporal resolution is to be guaranteed. Because of this, how to reconstruct super resolution (SR) video satellite data is particularly important. Based on the proposed SR Residual Network (SRResNet), we proposed a Pyramid Residual Network (PySRResNet) model, using a pyramid structure to obtain features of different scales, including 1, 1/2 and 1/4, and concatenate them together to provide more detailed information for SR reconstruction. In addition, we reduced the number of blocks and removed the batch normalization layer to achieve good performance. Training with "Jilin-1" video satellite images, our PySRResNet can get superior grades than other comparing models both in PSNR and SSIM, which demonstrates the effectiveness of PySRResNet in video satellite imagery SR reconstruction.

AB  - The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a global development strategy adopted by the Chinese government in 2013. Some experts believe that this project is an attempt to spread Chinese dominance in the region and adjacent territories through the economical initiative. But together with the economic purposes, the BRI aims spreading the Chinese cultural and citizenship values over the local cultures of the countries involved by forming a common cultural space. This article aims to show how the Chinese government uses the BRI Project to demonstrate the achievements of Chinese society in social and cultural life, introduce the modern China to the world, level stereotypes about the Chinese worldview and lifestyle, which were formed in the world due to a certain isolation of China, lack of reliable information about China in the world and some other reasons. At the article the following methods, typical for theoretical research, were used: observation, analysis, synthesis, analogy, comparing, narration, conclusion making etc. The result of the research is the summation of implicit information and the confirmation of the hypothesis that this project is of great cultural importance (to familiarize the world with modern China and its socio-cultural achievements more than in the opposite direction) and uses a wide range of tools to achieve goals.

AB  - Wildfire is one of the major environmental issue in economic, social and environmental damages globally. Three major forces are essential for understanding the wildfire occurrence, fuel, weather and topography, as regulated by the 'fire environment triangle'. Within this concept, a big database that involved all the satellite-derived fuel parameters (fuel moisture content and its derived variables, Leaf area index and vegetation type), weather parameters (relative humidity, air temperature, precipitation, wind speed), satellite-derived topography parameters (slope, aspect, elevation) and corresponding historical wildfires events that calculated from the MODIS burned area product (MCD64A1) was built from 2001-2018 over China. To explore the relations between wildfires and these parameters, the random forest model was developed to mine the relations between the explanatory variables (fuel, weather and topography parameters) and the dependent variable (historical wildfires events). Results showed that the models obtained a high accuracy level in fire spatial pattern distribution, indicating reasonable capacity in predicting wildfire occurrence in China.

AB  - In recent years, remote sensing technology has been widely used to predict forest stand parameters. In order to explore the effects of different features of remote sensing images and topographic information on the prediction of forest stand parameters, multivariate stepwise regression analysis method was used to build estimation models for important forest stand parameters (basal area, tree canopy cover and stand volume) by using textural, spectral features as well as topographic information of SPOT-5 satellite images in northeastern Heilongjiang Province in China as independent variables. The study results show that the highest accuracy was achieved when predicting the stand volume (R-adj(2) =0.82), followed by basal area (R-adj(2) =0.78). With the inclusion of topographic information, the accuracy of prediction of models was improved, of which elevation and slope aspect have the most significant effect. The results show that models combined use of textural, spectral features and topographic information of SPOT-5 images have a good application prospect in predicting forest stand parameters.

TI  - GlacierNet: A Deep-Learning Approach for Debris-Covered Glacier Mapping
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rising global temperatures over the past decades is directly affecting glacier dynamics. To understand glacier fluctuations and document regional glacier-state trends, glacier-boundary detection is necessary. Debris-covered glacier (DCG) mapping, however, is notoriously difficult using conventional geospatial technology methods. Therefore, in this research for automated DCG mapping, we evaluate the utility of a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a deep learning feed-forward neural network. The CNN inputs include Landsat satellite images, an Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) digital elevation model (DEM) and DEM-derived land-surface parameters. Our CNN based deep-learning approach named GlacierNet was designed by appropriately choosing the type, number and size of layers and filters, and encoder depth based on the properties of the input data, CNN segmentation process and empirical results. The GlacierNet was then trained using input data and corresponding glacier boundaries from the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) database, and tested on glaciers in the Karakoram and Nepal Himalaya. Our results show proof-of-concept that GlacierNet reasonably identifies the boundaries of DCGs with a relatively high degree of accuracy, and that morphometric parameters improves boundary detection.

TI  - A Transformed Triangular Vegetation Index for Estimating Winter Wheat Leaf Area Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key parameter in plant growth monitoring. For several decades, vegetation indices-based empirical method has been widely-accepted in LAI retrieval. A growing number of spectral indices have been proposed to tailor LAI estimations, however, saturation effect has long been an obstacle. In this paper, we classify the selected 14 vegetation indices into five groups according to their characteristics. In this study, we proposed a new index for LAI retrieval-transformed triangular vegetation index (TTVI), which replaces NIR and red bands of triangular vegetation index (TVI) into NIR and red-edge bands. All fifteen indices were calculated and analyzed with both hyperspectral and multispectral data. Best-fit models and k-fold cross-validation were conducted. The results showed that TTVI performed the best predictive power of LAI for both hyperspectral and multispectral data, and mitigated the saturation effect. The R-2 and RMSE values were 0.60, 1.12; 0.59, 1.15, respectively. Besides, TTVI showed high estimation accuracy for sparse (LAI < 4) and dense canopies (LAI > 4). Our study provided the value of the Red-edge bands of the Sentinel-2 satellite sensors in crop LAI retrieval, and demonstrated that the new index TTVI is applicable to inverse LAI for both low-to-moderate and moderate-to-high vegetation cover.

TI  - Modeling Year-to-Year Variations of Clear-Sky Land Surface Temperature Using Aqua/MODIS Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) and its annual or inter-annual variations play an important role in understanding global climate change, urban heat island, and the process of land-atmosphere energy exchange. Many annual temperature cycle (ATC) models [i.e., ATC with three or five parameters (ACP3 or ACP5)] have been proposed to analyze the annual variations of LST in the past decades. In this study, two year-to-year continuous and derivable models (YYCD_ACP3 and YYCD_ACP5 models) were proposed to model several years of ATCs. The fitting results of the YYCD_ACP3 model with global Aqua/MODIS daytime LSTs from 2014 to 2018 show that the YYCD_ACP3 model achieved a good performance in fitting the time-series LSTs with an overall normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) of 0.21, coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.74, and refined index of agreement ( $d$ ) of 0.85. In addition, the modeling results of ten representative samples covering different climatic conditions and land cover worldwide show that, except for two sites located in tropical and Antarctic, the YYCD_ACP3 model could show a good performance with R-2 greater than 0.6. Although the ACP3 model shows similar performance to the YYCD_ACP3 model, the fitting curve of the YYCD_ACP3 model is continuous and smooth for describing the interannual variations of LST. When the LSTs of 2014-2018 are fitted as a whole by using both models, the YYCD_ACP3 model shows a slightly better performance than that of the ACP3 model. The application of the YYCD_ACP3 model with the global MODIS LSTs from 2003 to 2018 indicates that the results of the YYCD_ACP3 model have the potential to reveal the interannual variations of LST. Therefore, we conclude that the YYCD models are valuable for modeling the variations of LST over several years and can be widely applied.

TI  - A Deep Cross-Modality Hashing Network for SAR and Optical Remote Sensing Images Retrieval
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The content-based remote sensing image retrieval (CBRSIR) has recently become a hot topic due to its wide applications in analysis of remote sensing data. However, since conventional CBRSIR is unsuitable in harsh environments, this article focuses on the cross-modality CBRSIR (CM-CBRSIR) between synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images. Besides the large interclass and small intraclass in CBRSIR, CM-CBRSIR is limited by prominent modality discrepancy caused by different imaging mechanisms. To address this limitation, this study proposes a deep cross-modality hashing network. First, we transform optical images with three channels into four different types of single-channel images to increase diversity of the training modalities. This helps the network to mainly focus on extracting the contour and texture shared features and makes it less sensitive to color information for images across modalities. Second, we combine any type of randomly selected transformed images and its corresponding SAR or optical images to form image pairs that are fed into the networks. The training strategy, with paired image data, eliminates the large cross-modality variations caused by different modalities. Finally, the triplet loss, in combination with the hash function, helps the modal to extract the discriminative features of images and upgrade the retrieval efficiency. To further evaluate the proposed modality, we construct a SAR-optical dual-modality remote sensing image dataset containing 12 categories. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method with regards to efficiency and generality.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Aqua MODIS has successfully operated for more than 18 years since its launch in May 2002 and has generated numerous science products in support of studies of the Earth's system and its changes via a set of geophysical and environmental parameters. On-orbit calibration and characterization activities have played a vital role in maintaining the quality of MODIS data products. In addition to data collected from sensor on-board calibrators (OBC), near-monthly lunar observations and select earth view targets have been used to monitor and characterize on-orbit changes in sensor responses and to derive and update the calibration look-up tables. In this paper, we provide an overview of Aqua MODIS on-orbit operations, calibration activities and approaches, and algorithm improvements and also illustrate the sensor on-orbit performance using examples derived from various calibration sources and targets. We will focus on issues identified from instrument operations and calibrations, such as solar diffuser degradation, electronic crosstalk, variations in the cold focal plane temperatures, and changes in response versus scan-angle. Also discussed in this paper are remaining challenges and future improvements.

TI  - How the three Gorges Dam affects the hydrological cycle in the mid-lower Yangtze River: a perspective based on decadal water temperature changes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Three Gorges Dam (TGD), the world's largest hydroelectric project in terms of installed capacity, alters the discharge and thermal regime of the Yangtze River in China, thereby threatening the aquatic biodiversity along the mid-lower Yangtze River. Thus, the influence of the TGD impoundment on the river temperature (T-w) and water cycle warrants in-depth examination. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use decadal (2001-2013) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer temperature data to assess the impacts of TGD impoundment on the inland water cycle. We found that (1) spatially, the multiyear T-w decreased by 5 degrees C along the mid-lower Yangtze River, (2) temporally, T-w exhibited a warming trend after the operation of the TGD began, with most warming occurring from October to December directly after the TGD impoundment, and (3) the correlations between discharge and T-w in the pre- and post-TGD periods have changed; specifically, the closer to the TGD a location is, the greater the change in the relationship. Our analysis implies that downstream water temperature alteration is mainly attributed to the TGD management regime, and the influence is obvious along the 260 km river downstream of the TGD. It is likely that the impoundment of the TGD has increased the water residence time and slowed the water speed downstream.

TI  - Kinematic Coregistration of Sentinel-1 TOPSAR Images Based on Sequential Least Squares Adjustment
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1 provides an unprecedented opportunity for InSAR research and applications, especially in the field of fast and accurate damage assessment, thanks to its extra wide swath, short revisit interval, and free policy. Challenges also exist in Sentinel-1 terrain observation by progressive scans mode synthetic aperture radar (TOPSAR) interferometric processing, for example, the coregistration of TOPSAR images requires an accuracy of 0.001 pixels to reduce the phase jumps at the burst overlap region to 3 degrees. To obtain the accuracy of 0.001 pixels for the coregistration of a stack of multitemporal TOPSAR images, joint estimation method and network-based method were proposed and implemented statically. However, when new images are added, the existing methods cannot coregister them kinematically. In order to resolve this issue, we first give a brief review for the existing static methods, including the single master-, temporally transferred-, and network-based methods, for coregistering multitemporal TOPSAR images. Then, we propose a kinematic coregistration method to coregister newly added TOPSAR images by introducing the sequential weighted least square adjustment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve an accuracy of 0.001 pixels for kinematic coregistrations of multitemporal TOPSAR images. Compared with the static network-based coregistration method, the proposed method is superior in terms of both coregistration accuracy and computational efficiency. It will contribute a great deal to the globally acquired big SAR data (e.g., Sentinel-1 TOPSAR) and their near real-time processing.

TI  - y Monitoring Surface Soil Moisture Content over the Vegetated Area by Integrating Optical and SAR Satellite Observations in the Permafrost Region of Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM), the average water content of surface soil (up to 5 cm depth), plays a key role in the energy exchange within the ecosystem. We estimated SSM in areas with vegetation cover (grassland) by combining microwave and optical satellite measurements in the central Tibetan Plateau (TP) in 2015. We exploited TERRA moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations to estimate SSM through a simplified water-cloud model (sWCM). This model considers the impact of vegetation water content (VWC) to SSM retrieval by integrating the vegetation index (VI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), or the normalized difference infrared index (NDII). Sentinel-1 SAR C-band backscattering coefficients, incidence angle, and NDWI/NDII were assimilated in the sWCM to monitor SSM. The soil moisture and temperature monitoring network on the central TP (CTP-SMTMN) measures SSM within the study area, and ground measurements were applied to train and validate the model. Via the proposed methods, we estimated the SSM in vegetated area with an R-2 of 0.43 and a ubRMSE of 0.06 m(3)/m(3) when integrating the NDWI and with an R-2 of 0.45 and a ubRMSE of 0.06 m(3)/m(3) when integrating the NDII.

AB  - With the development of coding metasurface antennas, here a generalized SAR modality named variable-resolution (VR) SAR is proposed, which involves diverse radiation pattern and inhomogeneous pulse repetition frequency (PRF) to achieve continuously variable azimuth resolution. Optimization of PRF has been conducted by making resolution of some unimportant details decline with no azimuth ambiguities. There are two potential advantages of VR SAR mode: 1) simultaneously offers the higher resolution for the concerned parts of whole scenes and larger image sizes than would otherwise be possible in stripmap and spotlight SAR modes and 2) relaxes the pressure of data storages and brings a high imaging efficiency. The mathematical model of VR SAR system is built up and feasibilities are demonstrated through a series of simulations and an equivalent experiment based on RADARSAT-1 raw data. This VR SAR opens a new venue for earth observation, space-borne remote sensing and related SAR images processing, heading for agile frequencies, beam pattern and beyond.

TI  - Automatic extraction of lineaments based on wavelet edge detection and aided tracking by hillshade
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lineaments refer to the linear or curvilinear textures on remote sensing image, whose general spatial distribution characteristics are often the response of deep geological sturcture at the surface. Firstly, we use wavelet modulus maximum transformation to detect the edges with 4 scales on Landsat - 8 OLI B5 image and analyze their multi-scale characteristics. As the result, it is determined that the optimal scale of edge detection is 4, and the outline that consist of the edge pixels is roughly corresponding to the geological structure of mine area. Thus the incomplete lineaments have been extracted by using the 2D otsu algorithm. Secondly, the hillshade map generated based on DEM is processed to generate binarized linear shadow. Finally, the linear shadow is superimposed on the lineaments preliminarily extracted to obtain the optimized lineaments. Experiment results show that, based on the method, there are some deformation and displacement between the lineaments extracted and the actual geological structure, and it fail to effectively extract Qilinchang Fault, but lineaments are in good correspondence with Kuangshanchang Fault, Dongtou Fault and Niulan River Fault, which are basically in accord with the geological structure framework of the mine area.

AB  - Satellite based remote sensing has been widely used to map water turbidity. However, mapping water quality parameters with remote sensing imagery at a basin or regional scale has been difficult, since traditional empirical models do not have spatial transferability and their prediction accuracy is limited. This study presents a multi-predictor ensemble model to assess water turbidity of rivers and streams in the Mobile-Tombigbee Basin based on Landsat 8 multispectral data. The ensemble model exploits a set of empirical models to obtain optimal estimation of turbidity in different water conditions and exhibits a strong spatial transferability. Our analyses show that the ensemble model improved the turbidity estimation accuracy by 48%, compared with the best traditional empirical model. Our analysis suggests that the turbidity of rivers and streams has an apparent spatial gradients and geographical differences in the basin.

M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal wetlands in Liaohe Delta are increasingly threatened. Monitoring their dynamic changes can provide scientific basis for the restoration and sustainable management of wetland ecosystem health. Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing images from 1995, 2000, 2005, 2009, 2014 and 2018 are used as data sources, and wetland distribution map was obtained by object-oriented classification method. The total accuracy of classification results was 93.67%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.91. The transformation of wetland types and non-wetland types was analysed. The results show that the total area of natural wetlands (including marsh, tidal flat, river and lake) decreased by 5.33% from 1995 to 2018, about 215.8 km(2). Constructed wetlands (including paddy field, reservoir, salt pan and marine farm) decreased by 32.75%, about 111.36 km(2), and increased first and then decreased. Most of the new paddy field area comes from marshes, and most of the new construction land area comes from paddy field, the area of tidal flat has been reduced most dramatically. Most wetlands are converted to non-wetlands, and the area of natural wetlands is severely reduced. The protection of existing wetlands should be strengthened to maintain a sustainable and good ecological environment.

TI  - Distribution Shift Metric Learning for Fine-Grained Ship Classification in SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-grained ship classification in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a challenging task, since SAR images can only provide limited discriminative information due to the limitation of SAR imaging mechanism. Distance metric learning (DML) methods have the ability to improve the discriminative ability of the feature representations through preserving the supervisory information of ship samples. In this article, we proposed a novel DML method, termed as distribution shift metric learning (DML-ds), which improves the original Laplacian regularized metric learning by adding an interclass distribution shift regularization term. Extensive experiments and in-depth analysis demonstrate that the proposed DML-ds can effectively increase the interclass separability and the intraclass compactness, thereby improving the fine-grained ship classification performance in SAR images, and outperforms most of state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Determining the accuracy of lake water levels calculated based on Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data mainly relies on identifying lake water footprints (LWFs), which are obtained using an overlay analysis of lake water masks (LWMs) and ICESat tracks. However, most previous studies that have conducted a buffer analysis based on LWMs have set the buffer size subjectively without providing a detailed explanation for this or conducting a system analysis. In this study, the effects of using inside and outside buffers to obtain LWMs for seven lakes are analyzed. The Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) was applied to extract LWMs from Thematic Mapper (TM) images. The boxplot was used to remove footprints with abnormal elevations, and then the average of the remaining footprints was calculated as the ICESat water level. To compare with the in situ measured data, the root mean square error (RMSE) was used for accuracy evaluation. Results show the following: (1) for Yamzhog Yumco, which is a narrow lake, the altimetry accuracy is higher when using the outside buffer than for the inside buffer or with no buffer, and the highest accuracy is obtained with an outside buffer of approximately 100 m. (2) For other relatively wide lakes, such as Lake Michigan, Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Ontario and Lake Superior, the inside buffer method does not always improve altimetry accuracy, and this result differs from those presented previously. (3) For different lakes, the range of change in altimetry accuracy is affected by the number of LWFs. This study is of value for use in studies that apply ICESat altimetry data to obtain changes in lake water levels, especially for relatively narrow lakes, and the results imply that the altimetry accuracy can be improved by using the outside buffer.

TI  - Trends in Global Vegetative Drought From Long-Term Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - in this article, the trends in global vegetative drought were investigated using MODIS- and AVHRR-based NDVI products. A set of selected methods were employed to perform trend analysis including trend test, trend location detection, and trend estimates. Accounting for the effect of the global geographical heterogeneity on trend analysis, the NDVI dataset was aggregated on designated divisions in view of latitude ranges and climate zones. From the results, it was concluded that: AVHRR has longer-term records that provide a critical historical perspective on vegetation activities necessary for global change research, and continuity and correctness is achievable from AVHRR VCI given the systematic offset between the NDVI values derived from the two sensors and the characteristics of the VCI algorithm. From a pixel level global trend analysis map, the proportion of pixels with rising trends is 54.7% in the world, 67.6% and 47.5% in the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere, respectively, which means there is an overall rising trends in the global VCI values, especially in the northern hemisphere. The North Temperate and the South Tropical have overall increases in the VCI values while all climate zones have overall increases in the VCI values. The piecewise trends basically adhere to the results of overall trend identification although there are some local variations. There are obvious rising trends during the latest years for all the climate zones. Dominant down trends were identified in A, B, Cw, Ds, and E while the piecewise trends for both Cs and Df are dominantly rising before 2000. An average of about four breakpoints were detected from both the climate zone- and latitude range-aggregated divisions Thus, the mean duration for a piecewise trend is 7-9 years.

AB  - Due to the low spatial resolution of MODIS data, the accuracy of small-area plaque extraction with high degree of landscape fragmentation is greatly limited. To this end, the study combines Landsat data with higher spatial resolution and MODIS data with higher temporal resolution for decision-level fusion. Considering the importance of the land heterogeneity factor in the fusion process, it is superimposed with the weighting factor, which is to linearly weight the Landsat classification result and the MOIDS classification result. Three levels were used to complete the process of data fusion, that are the pixel of MODIS data, the pixel of Landsat data, and objects level that connect between these two levels. The multilevel decision fusion scheme was tested in two sites of the lower Mekong basin. We put forth a comparison test, and it was proved that the classification accuracy was improved compared with the single data source classification results in terms of the overall accuracy. The method was also compared with the two-level combination results and a weighted sum decision rule-based approach. The decision fusion scheme is extensible to other multi-resolution data decision fusion applications.

AB  - There are a lot of landslides occur in Malaysia and one of the landslide prone areas in Malaysia is Ulu Kelang. Integration of satellite remote sensing data which is called ArcGIS software is one of the applicable software to detect the landslide mapping and identification of high landslide risk in a certain area. Since 1993, several landslides have been reported in Ulu Kelang, Malaysia. These landslides would cause the property damaged and economic losses. The landslides cause which are geological covering the aspect such as rainfall, hilly areas, highland areas, morphological, physical and human causes. These are the major role in inducing the landslides in the study area. The objective of this research is to analyse and validate the data of the soil moisture index (SMI), temperature index (LST) and water index (NDWI) from the remote sensing Landsat Images with the electronic tool devices. There are two methods for this research paper which are by using a remote sensing and a ground-based measurement. The remote sensing software is ArcGIS. The U.S Geological Survey, USGS in coordination with NASA operates and distributes data from Landsat satellites and provides access to the space-based land remote sensing data. The ground-based measurement method, the electronic tool devices are called as LCD Soil Tester Meter and Digital Temperature Humidity Time Display. These devices are to detect the moisture of the soil, calculate the surrounding's temperature & humidity. Also, the rainfall data has been taken for supporting the water index information. The results of the three specified parameters; soil moisture, temperature and water index; SMI, LST and NDWI shown the more moisture of the soil, the more the tendency of the landslides to occur. This research founds out that the lower the temperature, the higher possibilities on occurrences of the landslides. While, the NDWI results are depends on the data rainfall. The higher the distribution of the rainfall leads the higher possibilities on the landslide's occurrences.

AB  - Knowledge about the spatial-temporal distribution of precipitation is important for a multitude of scientific and operational applications, and in agricultural monitoring particularly. Due to the irregularity of the network of meteorological stations and their small number in Central Siberia, a problem arises of filling in the missing data. Different ways are possible to solve this problem. This article addresses the problem of comparing data on the amount of accumulated precipitation received from ground-based weather stations and processed in various ways to reconstruct the spatial picture. Data analysis show that of all options considered, the use of a unified NOAA CPC dataset seems more appropriate in further agro-climatic studies. Only the satellite data can provide more complete and more accurate information.

TI  - Preventing Peatland Fires in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia: The Role of Economic Incentives and Social Norms
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the role of economic incentives and social norms in farmers' fire prevention behaviors using survey and remote sensing data. We focus on Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, where large peatland fires cause environmental and social problems. Our regression results indicate that farmers' prevention behaviors are positively associated with agricultural economic returns and participation in local community mutual assistance activities. On the contrary, economic returns on non-agricultural activities are negatively associated with prevention behavior. In addition, we find no difference in fire prevention activities between villages participating in the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation scheme and non-participating villages. These results suggest that a performance-based incentive is important to improve the effectiveness of policies designed to prevent peatland fires and mitigate the risk of climate change.

AB  - Objective. To describe outcomes after cartilage-sparing wide local excision for primary melanoma of the external ear.Study Design. Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing external ear melanoma excision using a cartilage-sparing approach at a university-based tertiary care center between 2010 and 2018.Setting. University-based tertiary care center.Subject and Methods. Chart review was performed for all patients over age 18 who were treated for melanoma of the external ear at Massachusetts Eye and Ear between 2010 and 2018. Patients with melanoma in situ or with melanomas in noncartilaginous areas of the ear (eg, lobule) were excluded.Results. A total of 8 patients underwent cartilage-sparing excision. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 7 patients, with positive lymph nodes in I of 7 cases. Positive margins and local recurrence occurred in I of 8 (12.5%) patients during a mean (SD) follow-up time of 22.5 (15.1) months (SE, 5.3 months). No distant metastasis or death was observed.Conclusion. Cartilage-sparing wide local excision for melanoma of the external ear is a surgical approach that enables surgeons to follow guideline-recommended oncologic excision margins but has the added benefit of improved postoperative aesthetic outcomes as well as reconstructive options through preservation of the auricular cartilage framework.

TI  - Improving the Efficiency of Deep Learning Methods in Remote Sensing Data Analysis: Geosystem Approach
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article proposes a solution for the problem of high-resolution remote sensing data classification by applying deep learning methods and algorithms in conditions of labeled data scarcity. The problem can be solved within the geosystem approach, through the analysis of the genetic uniformity of spatially adjacent entities of different scale and hierarchical level. Advantages of the proposed GeoSystemNet model rest on a large number of freedom degrees, admitting flexible configuration of the model contingent upon the task at hand. Testing GeoSystemNet for classification of EuroSAT dataset, algorithmically augmented after the geosystem approach, demonstrated the possibility to improve the classification precision in conditions of labeled data accuracy by 9% and to obtain the classification precision with a larger volume of training data (by 2%) which is slightly inferior in comparison with other deep models. The article also shows that synthesis of the geosystem approach with deep learning capabilities allows us to optimize the diagnostics of exogeodynamic processes, owing to the calculation of landscape differentiation regularities. Application of the presented approach enabled us to improve the accuracy in detecting landslides at the testing site "Mordovia" by 5% in comparison with the classical approach of using deep models for remote sensing data analysis. The authors advocate that application of the geosystem approach to improve the efficiency of remote sensing data classification through methods, proposed in the article, requires an individual project-based approach to source data augmentation.

TI  - Construction of knowledge rule sets for the classification of land cover information for the coastal zone of Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat images have large advantages for studying land cover changes over long time periods and have become the main data source for the extraction of large-scale land cover. However, due to the image resolution limitations, it is difficult to classify second-class land cover types with high accuracy through only traditional automatic classification methods. This study selected the coastal zone of Peninsular Malaysia in Southeast Asia as the experimental area for studying the knowledge rule sets classification method. First, a system for the classification of coastal land cover suitable for Southeast Asia was established based on regional characteristics, which included 8 first-class and 18 second-class types. Then, through the combination of multiple geoscience knowledge rules, a set of knowledge rules for extracting the second-class types was established by integrating multiple sources of information, such as the temporal features, topographic features, texture features, shape features, topological features and spectral features. The experimental results showed that the knowledge rule sets were effective in the extraction of the secondary land types in the coastal zones. The overall classification accuracy was over 85%, and the Kappa coefficient was higher than 0.8. Compared with the traditional supervised classification method, the classification accuracy was obviously improved.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a method for radiometric calibration of Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) MERSI-II TIR, bands 24 and 25 that combines vicarious and cross-calibration of the corresponding bands of Aqua MODIS, bands 31 and 32. A field campaign was conducted on lake Qinghai, China, on August 18, 2019. The surface measurements were performed before and after the passing time of Terra MODIS and FY-3D MERSI-II. Path radiance and transmittance were then calculated via the radiative transfer code MODTRAN 4.0, and the difference caused by the relative spectral response (RSR) of the sensors was eliminated by the spectral matching. Our experimental results indicate that the obtained radiometric calibration accuracy of FY-3D MERSI-II is stable during on-orbit operation.

AB  - As one of the most important natural ecosystems on the earth's surface, the wetland is a natural geographical complex with multiple features and functions. Developing a wetland sample set at the national level is a major challenge. The function of the existing sample set is seriously limited due to the change of wetland types and lack of seasonal infounation. With higher spatial and temporal resolution satellite data and enhanced computing power, samples can be generated from time-series satellite data instead of field sampling. We used Sentinel 1 time-series data and Joint Research Centre Global Surface Water Survey and Mapping layer products to evaluate the existing 60661 wetland samples, and used the Nounalized Difference Vegetation Index and Nounalized Difference Water Index time series of Landsat 8 images to establish a wetland samples classification system and foul' a set of wetland samples with seasonal infounation, which was randomly sampled and evaluated by wetland experts combined with high spatial-temporal resolution image, and the result shows that the sample set has high accuracy.

AB  - Radar maritime target recognition, not affected by weather and illumination, plays a vital role in sea state detection. But the development of radar ship target recognition has been obstructed due to complicated sea conditions and difficult data acquisition. Traditional recognition methods are difficult to extract robust and highly discriminative features. CNNs is widely used in radar target recognition because of its self-learning. But CNNs has low learning efficiency and poor classification performance under small sample conditions. In this paper, prototype-based metric learning method(PML) is proposed. Specifically, we sample two subsets from original training data as a support set and a query set. The mean of a class's support vectors is calculated to get its centroid in the embedding space, which is called prototype. We find the nearest category prototype for embedded query points to make a classification. It is because our model is more convenient for extracting highly discriminative features and easy to train that it has higher learning efficiency. The experiments is based on OpenSARShip classification dataset in TOPSAR data of the Sentinel 1 satellites for algorithm verification. Experimental results show that recognition accuracy of our model is significantly higher than those achieved by CNNs and traditional radar target recognition models, especially in the limited-data regime.

TI  - Multifeature Fusion Neural Network for Oceanic Phenomena Detection in SAR Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanic phenomena detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is important in the fields of fishery, military, and oceanography. The traditional detection methods of oceanic phenomena in SAR images are based on handcrafted features and detection thresholds, which have a problem of poor generalization ability. Methods based on deep learning have good generalization ability. However, most of the deep learning methods currently applied to oceanic phenomena detection only detect one type of phenomenon. To satisfy the requirements of efficient and accurate detection of multiple information of multiple oceanic phenomena in massive SAR images, this paper proposes an oceanic phenomena detection method in SAR images based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The method first uses ResNet-50 to extract multilevel features. Second, it uses the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module to extract multiscale features. Finally, it fuses multilevel features and multiscale features to detect oceanic phenomena. The SAR images acquired from the Sentinel-1 satellite are used to establish a sample dataset of oceanic phenomena. The method proposed can achieve 91% accuracy on the dataset.

TI  - A Blocky and Layered Management Schema for Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the era of rapid data expansion and computer technology development, discrete storage, multiband push and fuzzy query remote sensing data management methods are no longer suitable for the data analysis needs of users, including the needs for long time series, global regions and multidata fusion. After analyzing traditional data management techniques, this paper discusses the existing achievements and development trends of current technologies. This paper aims to solve the problem of data sharing difficulties and organizational inconsistency caused by the use of different formats for the same spatial object. Based on a discrete global grid, this paper studies the blocky division method and coding specification of Google S2 and then accomplishes the layered storage of remote sensing data in HBase. Finally, Kylin is used to build a cube model to discuss the information mining analysis changes in the new data management model. Experiments show that the blocky and layered management schema (BLMS) can realize the unified management of global remote sensing data with multisource, heterogeneous, multiscale, and long-term characteristics and provide accurate data services on demand.

TI  - An Ensemble Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network Method for Road Extraction From High Resolution Remote Sensing Images in Rural Areas
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Road extraction from high resolution remote sensing (HR-RS) images is an important yet challenging computer vision task. In this study, we propose an ensemble Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) method called E-WGAN-GP for road extraction from HR-RS images in rural areas. The WGAN-GP model modifies the standard GANs with Wasserstein distance and gradient penalty. We add a spatial penalty term in the loss function of the WGAN-GP model to solve the class imbalance problem typically in road extraction. Parameter experiments are undertaken to determine the best spatial penalty and the weight term in the new loss function based on GaoFen-2 dataset. In addition, we execute an ensemble strategy in which we first train two WGAN-GP models using the U-Net and BiSeNet as generator respectively, and then intersect their inferred outputs to yield better road vectors. We train our new model with GaoFen-2 HR-RS images in rural areas from China and also the DeepGlobe Road Extraction dataset. Compared with the U-Net, BiSeNet, D-LinkNet and WGAN-GP methods without ensemble, our new method makes a good trade-off between precision and recall with F-1-score = 0.85 and IoU = 0.73.

TI  - Cirrus Detection Based on Tensor Multi-Mode Expansion Sum Nuclear Norm in Infrared Imagery
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Infrared small target detection systems are an important part of space infrared imaging satellites. However, small infrared target detection is often affected by cirrus false alarm sources with similar grayscales. In this article, an infrared cirrus detection method based on the tensor robust principal component analysis model (TRPCA) is proposed. The method treats multiple bands of remote sensing data as tensors, but classical tensor nuclear norms cannot represent the tensor rank well; therefore, we use tensor multi-mode expansion sum nuclear norm (TMESNN) to approximate the tensor rank better. First, a set of Landsat-8 data is transformed into a tensor model, and a TRPCA model is constructed by TMESNN and the L-1 norm. Then, this model is solved by Ket augments and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Finally, Mallat wavelet transform is used to supplement information and remove clutter, and the final detection result is obtained by adaptive threshold segmentation. Compared with other optimization-based methods, this method has better detection performance and accuracy.

AB  - Heidegger's ontological question was influenced by modern philosophers who attacked Western philosophical traditions. First, Heidegger embraced much stimulus from the philosophical thought of Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911) and testimony of existential belief such as that from Soren Kierkegaard (1813-1844). Of course, Heidegger's early lectures at Freiburg University dealt not only with Dilthey and Kierkegaard but also with Paul, Augustine, Luther, Bergson, Husserl, and Aristotle in detail. In particular, witnesses of faith, such as Luther and Kierkegaard, argued the importance of experiencing Christianity entirely from its origin, and this perception closely influenced the young Heidegger. Modern historical thinking promoted by philosophical reflection started differently in Dilthey than in Heidegger, but the association is contradictory; early Christian faith placed emphasis on the experience history rather than modern historical thinking. Despite criticism of Dilthey's historicity of life, Heidegger does not deny his influence in "Sein und Zeit", indeed he emphasizes the importance of individual understanding as the achievement of Diltheyian philosophy. Moreover, Heidegger's understanding of existential time in "Sein und Zeit" is greatly influenced by Dilthey's "Technical Analytical, Psychology" and "Introduction to Psychology," particularly in terms of historicity and the relationship between life, history, psychology, and anthropology. Heidegger specifically researched Dilthey's theory of psychology and his distinction between the natural and psychological sciences by exploring multiple human, social, and political disciplines and constantly interrogating academic theory, academic history, and hermeneutical-psychological inquiry, and their points of intersection. Building on this knowledge of Heidegger's life and historical considerations, I present a limited look at Heidegger's "Sein und Zeit" and "Wilhelm Dilthey's Exploration and Historical Worldview." I will focus on Heidegger's interpretation of the Diltheyian worldview by discussing the life and history of Dilthey and his psychology and anthropology as identified by Heidegger, and we will look at how Heidegger overcomes the historicity of the present through deal analysis.

AB  - The urban spatial structure change caused by urban expansion is the most intuitive manifestation of urbanization in space. In this study, Landsat TM remote sensing image maps from 2000, 2010, and 2017 were used as the main data sources. A combination of supervised classification and manual visual interpretation was used to extract the current distribution maps of the three impermeable surfaces in Urumqi Based on the dynamic changes from 2000 to 2010 and 2000 to 2017, the changes in Urumqi's built-up areas from 2000 to 2017 were analyzed, and the characteristics and causes of urban expansion in Urumqi were analyzed. The results show that the interior of Urumqi city tends to be saturated. Due to the limitation of topographical factors outside the urban area, the overall urban form is axially distributed in a diagonal "T" shape. From 2000 to 2010, the area increased from 163.31km(2) to 332.66km(2), with a net increase of 169.35km(2). The average annual growth rate was 10.37%, and from 2010 to 2017, the area increased to 434.02km(2), a net increase of 101.36km(2), the average annual growth rate was 3.05%. The average annual growth rate from 2000 to 2010 was greater than 2010 to 2017; Comparing the area and changes of various jurisdictions, the development advantages of the new urban area are obvious. From 2000 to 2010, the development advantages of the new urban area were obvious. Midong District and Toutunhe District developed rapidly, while Shaibak District had the fastest growth.

TI  - Hyper-temporal remote sensing data in bare soil period and terrain attributes for digital soil mapping in the Black soil regions of China
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image data are often used as input in digital soil mapping (DSM). However, it is difficult to distinguish and identify soil types with less difference in reflectance spectral characteristics, because a small amount of input is not enough to provide enough common features. We consider that the hyper-temporal remote sensing data can be used to extract more common features of soil. The accuracy of DSM is improved by using the common features of soil or effective terrain attributes. We took Mingshui County of the Songnen Plain in northeast China as study area, which is known as a Black soil region. STRM DEM, legacy soil data, and 20 scenes Landsat images of bare soil period from 1984 to 2018 (April and May are considered a period of cultivated soil exposure in the study area), were used, with a maximum likelihood method classifier. A digital soil mapping model was constructed based on hyper-temporal data. Results from the study show that the accuracy of mapping with hyper-temporal classification characteristics, with an overall accuracy of 85.18% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.772, is higher than that of mono-temporal classification characteristics, with an average overall accuracy of 64.35% and an average Kappa coefficient of 0.467. After the introduction of relief degree of land surface (RDLS), the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of hyper-temporal mapping were 88.22% and 0.818, higher than the accuracy of other terrain factors. The research results signal the advantages of hyper-temporal remote sensing data in DSM, and the common features were able to improve the accuracy of DSM extracted from hyper-temporal data. This paper provided new insight to explain the impact of diverse terrain on DSM of Black soil region, and the mapping of soil type level could be accomplished more easily by the combination of the two characteristics.

AB  - This thesis seeks to determine the methods of philosophical practice within a university’s educational fields. Philosophical practice helps us awaken to the narrow- minded perspective of understanding our problems through training in philosophical thinking, allowing us to find various alternatives. Currently, thought experiments applying philosophy are widely used as a methodology for various philosophical practices. However, I take issue with the fact that the designer of thought experiments is a philosophical practitioner (or professor) and argue that true philosophical practice should be led by the participants. Thus, in the following chapters, the method of thought experiment is designed for the persons in question. This process is the same as the activity of naming and is summarized as follows: 1) naming our interests, 2) naming our world, and 3) role-playing by the name we take. Although life can be difficult for anyone, one has many ways to deal with it; this is because different people have different interpretations of their lives. Expressing the interpretation of the world by name and presenting it through demonstrations helps us gain insights into how we understand and interpret the world and can be an opportunity to create a better worldview. My philosophical practice is based on Kant’s aesthetics. Kant pays attention to the autonomous actions of the appreciators and artists in relation to the work. The reason why appreciators voluntarily share their evaluation of artwork with others, and artists do not give up their difficult life of creation, is because their power of judgment is to shake the mind intensely. In that sense, I aim to show what “naming” is as a way of stimulating this power of judgment through the works of actual students, and how such activities make us voluntarily design a particular worldview.

TI  - Research on vegetation coverage optimisation of urban landscape based on vegetation index
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to overcome the problem of fuzziness and randomness of remote sensing data, a vegetation coverage optimisation of urban landscape based on vegetation index is designed. The remote sensing image of vegetation cover is preprocessed by the principal component analysis. According to the fuzzy principal component image, GIS software is used as the platform of input data, and Fragstat software package is used to calculate the vegetation index of urban landscape. The NDVI value of shadow pixels is changed into background value, and Band Math is used on ENVI platform to get the NDVI data after removing the outliers. According to the principle of pixel dichotomy, the mixed pixel decomposition model is established to estimate the vegetation coverage and realise the vegetation coverage optimisation of urban landscape. The experimental results show that the vegetation coverage rate is 53%, the performance breakthrough is achieved and the pixel accuracy is more than 90%.

AB  - One of the key variables describing global seasonal snow cover is snow water equivalent (SWE). The GlobSnow-2 SWE product is widely used in in many research areas due to the high accuracy level and a long historical record (1979 to the present) in Globally. The satellite data used in GlobSnow-2 are mainly from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS). However, there is no launching plan for these sensors in the future. To ensure a continuation of GlobSnow-2 product, this paper assesses the consistency of SWE estimates between the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) and SSMIS in GlobSnow-2 retrieval scheme. The analysis is conducted in three regions (Finland, Russia and China) over the Northern Hemisphere. The results show that the SWE difference between MWRI and SSMIS is small and even can be negligible. This study provides a scientific basis for treating the MWRI dataset as one continuous record.

TI  - Remote sensing images destriping using unidirectional hybrid total variation and nonconvex low-rank regularization
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel model for remote sensing images destriping, which includes the Schatten 1/2-norm and the unidirectional first-order and high-order total variation regularization. The main idea is that the stripe layer is low-rank, and the desired image possesses smoothness across stripes. Therefore, we use the Schatten 1/2-norm regularization to depict the low-rankness of stripes, and use the unidirectional total variation and the unidirectional high-order total variation to guarantee the smoothness of the underlying image. We develop the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm to solve the proposed model. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data are reported to show the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative assessments.

TI  - Accuracy of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer: Pitfalls in the Application of Single Tracers
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Radioisotopes and blue dyes are used as dual tracers in the current gold standard procedure of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) performed for breast cancer. However, the blue dye or the radioisotope as a single tracer is also being applied in some institutes. We aimed to explore the risk factors for the miss-detection of SLNs with the radioisotope and the blue dye and to describe the distribution of SLNs missed by each tracer.Patients and Methods: Patients undergoing SLNB with radioisotope and blue dye as dual mapping agents were enrolled between August 2010 and August 2018. Radioactivity count, blue dye staining status, and size and location of each SLN were prospectively documented.Results: In total, 2382 SLNs from 1010 patients were included for statistical analyses. The sentinel node identification rate was 100% for dual tracers, 99.4% for radioisotope, and 89.1% for blue dye. SLN identification using the blue dye was more likely to fail in patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery (p < 0.001) and mastectomy with reconstruction (p = 0.005). Furthermore, miss-detection was significantly more frequent in smaller and uninvolved nodes. Among all SLNs, 8.2% were located in level II and one was in level III. Notably, single tracer of blue dye tended to fail in the detection of lymph nodes in higher levels (p < 0.001).Conclusion: This study explored the association between features and the incidence of the failure to detect SLNs using radioisotope and blue dye. The locations of the miss-detected SLNs are demonstrated to provide a reference for SLNBs conducted using blue dye or radioisotope as a single tracer.

AB  - All nations have their own unique worldview and values, their own way of life, etc., as well as cultural similarity and universality with other nations.Indigenous peoples of the Arctic region have also maintained their traditional way of life and economic activity in their territories through historical practice, legal rights and status, and support of international indigenous regimes.However, the climate change crisis, which started with global warming, is bringing a lot of change to the Arctic region today. The Arctic territory, which has long been their home, and the entire territorial waters are being deprived of industrialization. In addition, it can be seen that the social infrastructure in the relationship between migrants and indigenous peoples is becoming more damaged as the population persistence and migration change are accompanied.In order to overcome this crisis, a new approach to the survival and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples in the Arctic region must be created. And this approach should be made by reinterpreting and reconstructing the lives of indigenous peoples of the Arctic region with cultural potential values ​​so that they can share with their contemporaries. This is an immediate task of the times, and it is an ongoing study that is given to this author.

AB  - In the context of global warming, high-temperature heat damage to summer maize has occurred in recent years, which has seriously affected the country's food security. At present, the research on high-temperature heat damage of summer maize is mainly based on point source data from ground observation stations, which lacks representativeness for large areas. Therefore, the remote sensing data and ground temperature data were combined to establish a high-temperature heat damage assessment model for summer maize production. The accuracy coefficients R-2 of the model are all above 0.8, and the root mean square error (RMSE) fluctuates within a small range of 2 degrees C. The results showed that the high-temperature heat damage of summer maize production area in North China was relatively obvious in 2017 and 2018. And these damaged area mainly distributed in the southeast of Hebei Province, most of Henan Province and western Shandong Province. And the results are consistent with the actual statistics.

AB  - Based on time series of MODIS/Terra daily LST product from 2000 to 2018, the spatial and temporal variations in the land surface temperature (LST) of the Tibetan Plateau was analyzed in this study. Due to the influence of cloud cover, it is not possible to obtain daily LST with full spatial coverage. Therefore, the annual temperature cycle (ATC) model was used to extract the mean annual surface temperature (MAST) during the daytime and nighttime to reflect changes in LST. The average value of the MAST s from 2000 to 2018 showed a cross-distribution characteristic, and there are significant differences between daytime and nighttime. Combining the elevation map and the land cover map, it was found that terrain and land cover strongly affected the spatial distribution in LST. According to the interannual change rate of the estimated MAST over the 19 years, it revealed that the average change rate at the nighttime was higher than that at the daytime. The trend analysis based on linear regression also indicated that the LSTs of both daytime and nighttime have an increasing trend.

AB  - Vehicle identification is widely used in route planning, safety supervision and military reconnaissance. It is one of the research hotspots of space-based remote sensing applications. Traditional HOG, Gabor features and Hough transform and other manual design features are not suitable for modern city satellite data analysis. With the rapid development of CNN, object detection has made remarkable progress in accuracy and speed. However, in satellite map analysis, many targets are usually small and dense, which results in the accuracy of target detection often being half or even lower than the big target. Small targets have lower resolution, blurred images, and very rare information. After multi-layer convolution, it is difficult to extract effective information. In the satellite map data set we produced, the target vehicles are not only small but also very dense, and it is impossible to achieve high detection accuracy when using YOLO for training directly. In order to solve this problem, we propose a multi-feature fusion target detection method, which combines satellite image and electronic image to achieve the fusion of target vehicle and surrounding semantic information. We conducted a comparative experiment to demonstrate the applicability of multi-feature fusion methods in different detection models such as YOLO and R-CNN. By comparing with the traditional target detection model, the results show that the proposed method has higher detection accuracy.

AB  - Ship wake detection is of great importance in the characterisation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the ocean surface since wakes usually carry essential information about vessels. Most detection methods exploit the linear characteristics of the ship wakes and transform the lines in the spatial domain into bright or dark points in a transform domain, such as the Radon or Hough transforms. This paper proposes an innovative ship wake detection method based on sparse regularisation to obtain the Radon transform of the SAR image, in which the linear features are enhanced. The corresponding cost function utilizes the Cauchy prior, and on this basis, the Cauchy proximal operator is proposed. A proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) based Bayesian method, the Moreau-Yoshida unadjusted Langevin algorithm (MYULA), which is computationally efficient and robust is used to reconstruct the image in the transform domain by minimizing the negative log-posterior distribution. The detection accuracy of the Cauchy prior based approach is 86.7%, which is demonstrated by experiments over six COSMO-SkyMed images.

AB  - Water is the source of life and monitoring water quality is very important. Traditional water quality monitoring often uses artificial methods, taking water samples on the spot, and then analysing them in the laboratory. This method is time-consuming and labour-intensive, and is affected by time, weather and human activities. It is not only inaccurate, but also difficult to multi-period. It is difficult to monitor large areas of water. This study proposes an intelligent water quality monitoring system- Simulation System of Lake Eutrophication Evolution based on RS & GIS Technology (SSLEE). Based on the .NET Framework, the system interface design is completed through Windows Form platform. C#, IDL and ArcGIS Engine are used to develop the whole system. The system can manage the measured data, remote sensing image data, preprocess the remote sensing image and retrieve the chlorophyll a concentration. Taking Wuhan East Lake as an example, the applicability of SSLEE system is demonstrated. Compared with the measured results, the error is small, indicating that the system is reliable in water quality monitoring of inland lakes.

TI  - Evaluation and Comparison of Himawari-8 L2 V1.0, V2.1 and MODIS C6.1 aerosol products over Asia and the oceania regions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Himawari-8 aerosol products are useful for forecasting weather, environmental monitoring, and climate change research. In 2018, after receiving much attention from researchers, the Iiimawari-8 Level2 (L2) aerosol retrieval algorithm was updated from Version 1.0 (V1.0) to Version 2.1 (V2.1). Although previous studies have examined the accuracy of Himawari-8 aerosol products, only a few studies have evaluated and compared the V1.0 and V2.1 algorithms or described how the Himawari-8 aerosol products differ from those of MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). In this study, we validated and compared the Himawari-8 L2 V1.0 and V2.1 aerosol products at 500 rim using data from all Asian Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites for the period from 2016 to 2017. Furthermore, a comprehensive comparison between the Himawari-8 L2 V2.1 and MODIS C6.1 AOD (Terra and Aqua) products was conducted. The V1.0 and V2.1 AOD agreed well with AERONET AOD (R: 0.67-0.72) with 44.65% and 49.38% of retrievals fell within the EE, respectively. Meanwhile, V1.0 and V2.1 AOD bias increased with the AOD magnitude, but V1.0 AOD tended to underestimate the AOD. The underestimation has now improved in the V2.1 AOD products. Both V1.0 and V2.1 AOD performed better over forests and grasslands than croplands, as well as urban and barren lands and had the best performance in summer, while the worst in spring. Overall, the V2.1 AOD outperformed in term of retrievals falling within the EE compared to V1.0 AOD, but it still has large estimation uncertainties in high aerosol loadings areas and sparsely vegetated areas, which indicating the aerosol algorithm needed to improve in the future. Furthermore, the data quality of V2.1 AE/FMF products significantly improved compared to that of V1.0. Compared to the MODIS C6.1 AOD products, Himawari-8 L2 V2.1 AOD accuracy is slightly lower but demonstrates a similar spatial distribution.

AB  - In order to control the air pollution in China, the Chinese government issued an air pollution control action plan in Sep. 2013. The goal of the first phase of the plan is by 2017, the air quality was to improve significantly compared to 2012. In this study, the satellite aerosol product derived from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over East China were collected and processed to evaluate the effectiveness of the plan. The results show that the mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) over East China in 2017 has reduced about 23.17% compared to 2012, and the trends of the MODIS AOD during the period from 2010 to 2019 over the domain is -0.012 per year, which indicates that the air pollution plan has been well implemented to achieve the expected goals.

TI  - Utilisation of health services among urban patients who had an ischaemic stroke with different health insurance-a cross-sectional study in China
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives This study investigates the disparities in the utilisation of patient health services for patients who had a stroke covered by different urban basic health insurance schemes in China. Design We conducted descriptive analysis based on a 5% random sample from claims data of China Urban Employees' Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) and Urban Residents' Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) in 2015, supplied by the China Health Insurance Research Association. Setting Chinese urban social insurance system. Participants A total of 56 485 patients who had a stroke were identified, including 36 487 UEBMI patients and 19 998 URBMI patients. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome measures include annual number of hospitalisations, average length of stay (ALOS) and average hospitalisation cost. Out-of-pocket (OOP) cost is the secondary outcome measure. Results The annual mean number of hospitalisations of UEBMI patients was 1.21 and 1.15 for URBMI patients. The ALOS was significantly longer for UEBMI than for URBMI patients (13.93 vs 10.82, p<0.001). Hospital costs were significantly higher for UEBMI than for URBMI patients (US$1724.02 vs US$986.59 (p<0.001), while the OOP costs were significantly higher for URBMI than for UEBMI patients (US$423.17 vs US$407.81 (p<0.001). Patients with UEBMI had higher reimbursement rate than URBMI patients (79.41% vs 66.92%, p<0.001) and a lower self-paid ratio than URBMI patients (23.65% vs 42.89%, p<0.001). Conclusions Significant disparities were found in the utilisation of hospital services between UEBMI and URBMI patients. Our results call for a systemic strategy to improve the fragmented social health insurance system and narrow the gaps in China's health insurance schemes.

TI  - Pansharpening Based on Low-Rank Fuzzy Fusion and Detail Supplement
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is a technique used to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) multispectral (MS) image by combining an HR panchromatic (PAN) image with a low-resolution MS image. In recent years, the detail-injection model has demonstrated excellent performance in pansharpening, thus receiving wide attention. Obtaining appropriate details is vital for the detail-injection model. Therefore, this article presents a detail optimization approach to obtain more precise high-frequency (HF) details for pansharpening. The proposed method comprises two steps. In the first step, we design a low-rank fuzzy fusion model to fuse the HF details of the PAN and MS images. In this model, the high frequencies of the PAN and upsampled MS images are decomposed into low-rank and sparse components, and the corresponding fusion rules are designed according to their characteristics. Because some details of the PAN image are replaced with those of the MS image, using them directly as injection details may result in redundant information or spatial distortion. To solve this problem and further optimize the details, in the second step, we construct an adaptive detail supplement model. Based on the similarity and correlation between the fused HF and the original HF of the PAN image, the fused details are supplemented to obtain the final injection details. Experimental results on the IKONOS, Pleiades, QuickBird, and WorldView-2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is better than the state-of-the-art methods in maintaining spectral information and improving spatial details.

AB  - The popular enhanced deep blue (DB) algorithm, though performs well in aerosol retrieval over the entire land surfaces, limited by the low temporal resolution and insufficient satellite-derived products of most high resolution satellite sensors, is hardly to be applied to urban areas using high spatial resolution satellite imageries. In this paper, we developed a simplified deep blue algorithm to retrieve 30m spatial resolution aerosol optical thickness (AOT) over urban surfaces using Landsat 8 OLI measurements. With a few atmospheric correction surface reflectance-apparent reflectance pairs, robust relationships between visible (0.65 mu m and 0.48 mu m) and 2.2 mu m reflectance can be constructed by this algorithm. Difficulties described above are overcame, and high consistency with ground-based AERONET measurements are achieved over Beijing, with correlation coefficient (R-2) similar to 0.951, root mean square error (RMSE) similar to 0.005, mean absolute error (MAE) similar to 0.05 and 82.61% retrievals fall within the expected error (EE) envelop. This study demonstrates that the simplified deep blue algorithm has advantages in retrieval high spatial resolution AOTs over urban areas.

CL  - Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - As so far, studies based on remote sensing to explore ozone column concentration keep a watchful eye on the stratosphere or troposphere, while few focus on the near-surface, though it directly correlative to human health. In this paper, the regional near-surface total column ozone was inversed based on the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) for its extraordinary spatial resolution. First, the statistical synthetic regression algorithm was utilized to retrieve the first guess. A nonlinear physical iterative method was then employed to acquire final ozone profiles. Finally, after creating a unique database, the ozone column concentration was obtained by using the multivariable linear regression model. Compared with the measurements of ground monitoring sites, the retrieval results were over 95% accurate and its distribution consists with the actual situation. The method proposed in this paper can be applied to monitor air pollution.

AB  - Illumina high-throughput sequencing was applied to study the microbial community structure and seasonal variations in the mudflat sediments of Sansha Bay, China Significant seasonal differences of microbial communities were observed, and pH, total P, total N, and organic carbon concentration were important factors affecting the microbial communities. A total of 52 bacterial phyla were detected in the sediments, dominated by gamma-Proteobacteria (27.78%), delta-Proteobacteria (20.16%) and Bacteroidetes (10.58%). A total of 717 bacterial genera were detected, and among the top 100 genera with the highest abundances, 48 genera changed significantly (p <0.05) with seasons. The microbial community structure in summer was significantly different from others, and the environmental factors driving the changes were mainly temperature, organic carbon and total N concentration. The bacteria with higher abundances in summer were mainly attached bacteria, thermophilic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, and those involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling, while in other seasons, those with higher abundances were mainly aerobic bacteria, which could adapt to low temperatures and are involved in the degradation of cellulose and chitosan. However, the physicochemical indexes didn't change significantly, which indicated that the bacterial communities are more sensitive and can serve as a good sentinel for environmental changes.

AB  - Geothermal energy is one of the renewable energy sources that can be utilized to replace fossil fuels. The conventional geophysical methods have been applied to determine geothermal potential areas in the globe. These existing methods are costly and time-consuming for explorations in a wide range and unreachable volcano area. Thus, an alternative and challenging approach for identifying a geothermal prospecting area is remotely sensed thermal infrared imagery. This study aims to explore and evaluate the use of a sensor platform of Thermal Infrared Scanner (TIRS) and Operational Land Imager (OLI), Landsat 8 for mapping geothermal resource in Peut Sagou volcano. The mountain is an active volcano in Aceh Province, Indonesia that is possible to develop a geothermal power plant by an energy estimation of 100 MWe. The several processing techniques have been applied such as composite bands for lithological mapping that related to the geological aspect of the volcano, Normalize Deferential Vegetation Index (NDVI) threshold methods of spectral emissivity used for mapping the land cover area, and the Land Surface Temperature (LST) by split windows algorithm method to study the temperature distribution related to the activity of geothermal resources in the sub-surface. The composite band shows clearly the lineament of the faults, and alluvium deposits in the manifestation area, which is specifically located in the top of the volcano. NDVI data shows a low vegetation index (-0.4-0.5) in the manifestation area, while the Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) also allows mapping of a weak zones area that is characterized by low radiation index <0.98. The high-temperature value (21-30 C) from the LST map is obtained at the top of the volcano in response to the conduit zone area, which functions as a route for fluid discharge from the reservoir to the surface. The LST data also shows some areas with relatively high temperatures (19-20 C) in response to the weak zone areas such as faults and the distribution of surface manifestations. We conclude that TIRS d an OLI sensors from Landsat 8 demonstrate high efficiency for potential mapping of geothermal resources in the Peut Sagou volcano.

TI  - Identification of Alpine Glaciers in the Central Himalayas Using Fully Polarimetric L-Band SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To study the applicability of full polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to identify alpine glaciers in the central Himalayas, six polarimetric decomposition methods were used to obtain 20 polarimetric characteristic parameters based on the Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array type L-band SAR (PALSAR) data. Object-oriented multiscale segmentation was performed on a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image prior to classification, and the vector boundaries of different types of training samples were selected from the segmented results. We performed a support vector machine (SVM)-based classification on the characteristic parameters from each polarimetric decomposition. All 20 parameters were then screened and combined according to different requirements: the degree of separability of different types of training samples and the type of scattering mechanisms. The results show that the classification accuracy of the incoherent decomposition characteristics based on the covariance matrix is the best, reaching 87, and it can exceed 91 after adding the local incidence angle to the suite of classifiers. Eventually, more than 93 accuracy was achieved using a combination of multiple polarimetric parameters, which reduced the misclassification between bare ice and rock. We also analyzed the use of controlling factors on the accuracy of alpine glacier identification and found that the polarimetric information and aspect of the glacier surface are the most important factors. The former is the main basis for identification but the latter will confuse the feature distributions of different categories and cause misclassification.

TI  - Analysis of Ice Storm Impact on and Post-Disaster Recovery of Typical Subtropical Forests in Southeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice storms greatly affect the structure, dynamics, and functioning of forest ecosystems. Studies on the impact of such disasters, as well as the post-disaster recovery of forests, are important contents in forest biology, ecology, and geography. Remote-sensing technology provides data and methods that can support the study of disasters at the large-to-medium scale and over long time periods. This study took Chebaling National Nature Reserve in Guangdong Province, China, as the study area. First, field-survey data and remote-sensing data were comprehensively analyzed to demonstrate the feasibility of replacing the forest stock volume with the mean annual value of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), to study forest growth and change. We then used the EVI from 2007 to 2017, together with a variety of other remote-sensing and forest sub-compartment data, to analyze the impact of the 2008 ice storm and the subsequent post-disaster recovery of the forest. Finally, we drew the following conclusions: (1) Topography had a considerable effect on disaster impact and forest recovery in Chebaling. The forest at high altitudes (700-1000 m) and on steep slopes (25-40 degrees) was seriously affected by this disaster but had a stronger post-disaster recovery ability. Meanwhile, the hardest-hit area for coniferous forest was higher and steeper than that for broad-leaved forest. (2) In the same terrain conditions, coniferous forests were less affected by the disaster than broad-leaved forests and showed less variation during the post-disaster recovery process. Nevertheless, broad-leaved forests had faster recovery rates and higher recovery degrees; (3) Under the influence of human activities, the recovery and fluctuation degree for planted forest in the post-disaster recovery process was significantly higher than that for natural forest. The study suggests that forest has high disaster resistance and self-recovery ability after the ice storm, and this ability has a strong correlation with the type of forest and the topographic factors such as elevation and slope. At the same time, human intervention can speed up the recovery of forests after disasters.

TI  - Enabling the Big Earth Observation Data via Cloud Computing and DGGS: Opportunities and Challenges
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - In the era of big data, the explosive growth of Earth observation data and the rapid advancement in cloud computing technology make the global-oriented spatiotemporal data simulation possible. These dual developments also provide advantageous conditions for discrete global grid systems (DGGS). DGGS are designed to portray real-world phenomena by providing a spatiotemporal unified framework on a standard discrete geospatial data structure and theoretical support to address the challenges from big data storage, processing, and analysis to visualization and data sharing. In this paper, the trinity of big Earth observation data (BEOD), cloud computing, and DGGS is proposed, and based on this trinity theory, we explore the opportunities and challenges to handle BEOD from two aspects, namely, information technology and unified data framework. Our focus is on how cloud computing and DGGS can provide an excellent solution to enable big Earth observation data. Firstly, we describe the current status and data characteristics of Earth observation data, which indicate the arrival of the era of big data in the Earth observation domain. Subsequently, we review the cloud computing technology and DGGS framework, especially the works and contributions made in the field of BEOD, including spatial cloud computing, mainstream big data platform, DGGS standards, data models, and applications. From the aforementioned views of the general introduction, the research opportunities and challenges are enumerated and discussed, including EO data management, data fusion, and grid encoding, which are concerned with analysis models and processing performance of big Earth observation data with discrete global grid systems in the cloud environment.

TI  - A New Approach for Surface Urban Heat Island Monitoring Based on Machine Learning Algorithm and Spatiotemporal Fusion Model
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important indicator for assessing the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect. This paper presents a novel approach to derive LST estimates by integrating machine learning algorithm and spatiotemporal fusion model at high spatial and temporal resolution. The spatial resolutions of Landsat TM and Landsat 8 LST data were first downscaled using random forest (RF) algorithm from 120 m and 100 m, respectively, to 30 m. The resultant LST data were fused with MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data, by means of the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion method (FSDAF), in order to generate high spatiotemporal resolution summer daytime LST data covering the center of Chengdu city in China. The proposed new method was used to estimate the spatiotemporal variations of the summer daytime SUHI from 2009 to 2018 over Chengdu city. Results show that: (1) RF performs way better than the classical downscaling algorithm-thermal sharpening algorithm (TsHARP) for LST, and produces higher accuracy for different land covers; (2) the fused high spatiotemporal resolution summer daytime LST values were evaluated with in situ LST obtained from Chengdu Meteorological Office and the final validation results indicated that the proposed method, in generating LST dataset, can provide more details of urban thermal environment and produce higher accuracy than the traditional FSDAF; (3) significantly increasing trends of summer daytime SUHI intensity (SUHII) in the study area were observed. SUHII increased from 2.78 degrees C in 2009 to 4.04 degrees C in 2018. The highest and lowest summer daytime LST estimates were recorded over impervious surface area (ISA) and waters, respectively.

AB  - Zooxantellae is living symbionts in the body of giant clams. This research was conducted to determine the sensitivity of the loss of zooxanthellae (bleaching) from the body of giant clam as a tool to detect metal pollutants. Juvenile of giant clam was exposed to lead in concentrations of 0, 0.004, 0.008, 0.016, 0.032 mg/l for 24 hours. Zooxanthellae density data were analyzed with parametric anova. The zooxanthellae densities at treatments 0, 0.004, 0.008.0.016 and 0.032 mg / respectively were 32,322,222.2, 32,488,888.89, 24,977,777.78, 17,676,666.67, and 14,542,222.22 cell/g mantle. Statistical analysis showed that there were significant differences in zooxanthellae densities of control with 0.016 and 0.032 mg/l treatments. There was no mortality of the juvenile of giant clams during the experiment. Therefore, it was concluded that the loss of zooxanthellae from giant clam's body could be used as a sensitive biomarker to detect lead metal toxicity. Zooxanthella of Tridcana derasa is also considered as a sentinel organism that is potential for ecotoxicological studies.

AB  - The growth of Iskandar Malaysia as a regional development corridor is inescapable large and rapid. The study area has been transformed from predominantly agricultural and forest land prior to 1990s into the second largest and third most urbanized area in peninsular Malaysia. The aim of this paper is to map Iskandar land cover change from 1991 to 2019 using sequential Landsat multi-spectral images with Normalized Difference Building Index (NDBI) analysis to assess spatio-temporal urban built up and its pattern. Accuracy assessment of kappa coefficient is used to measure the accuracy of classification. Research has proved a significant rapid land cover change and a vast transformation of agricultural and forest land into low density urbanized area scattered in Iskandar. A rapid land cover change of regional development corridor has significant influence on urban expansion especially to their periphery.

TI  - Automatic Coastline Extraction and Changes Analysis Using Remote Sensing and GIS Technology
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study highlights the coastline position changes of Qingdao coastal area from 2000 to 2019, using GIS and remote sensing technologies through Digital Shoreline Analysis System and LANDSAT images. Understanding the coastline movement by suitable method is an important challenge for this extremely dynamic coast. The shoreline changes were statistically measured using three techniques, namely; Linear Regression Rate, End Point Rate and Net Shoreline Movement. For the automatic coastline extraction, different methods were applied, but among them most suitable techniques is the canny edge algorithm technique, which gives the accurate result. The result show maximum accretion reached was 266.07m/yr, 2391.85m,124.47m/yr for End point rate, net shoreline movement and linear regression rate, respectively. While, the maximum erosion was -142.55m/yr, -1234.59m, -63.22m/yr for End point rate, net shoreline movement and linear regression rate, respectively. This paper hence presents the monitoring processes of coast and analyzing the coastline change by the use of geospatial techniques that would be helpful for the coastal planning and management of the Qingdao coast. The applicability of the proposed model is tested with other generic edge detection algorithms that include; Sobel, Prewitt, and Robert edge detection techniques and it was concluded that our model outperforming in accurately detecting the coastline.

AB  - Numerous cities around the world are facing the problem of land subsidence. In many cases, it is the excessive groundwater extraction to meet human needs that leads to this subsidence. Since land subsidence rates are very slow (a few centimeters per year), the subsidence usually remains unnoticed until it has progressed to the point of causing severe damage to buildings, houses, and/or other infrastructures. Therefore, it is very important to detect the presence of subsidence in advance. In this study, screening for the presence of land subsidence in the city of Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia is conducted. The Sentinel-1A/B SAR dataset, taken from October 2014 to June 2019, is processed using the SBAS DInSAR method. Subsidence is found in the districts of Denpasar Selatan, Denpasar Barat, and Kuta, which falls in the range of -100 mm to -200 mm in an area of about 93.03 ha. All the extracted points of interest show the subsidence having linear behavior. The spatio-temporal behavior of the subsidence in Denpasar is presented clearly. However, the mechanism and the deriving factors of the subsidence remain unclear. Therefore, further studies are needed.

TI  - The Optimized Small Incidence Angle Setting of a Composite Bragg Scattering Model and its Application to Sea Surface Wind Speed Retrieval
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized radar cross section (NRCS) of microwave backscattering from a rough sea surface can be described by a composite Bragg scattering (CBS) model, which is a combination of a two-scale backscatter model and a geometric optics model. For small local radar incidence angles that are smaller than a given angle setting, the two-scale backscattering mechanism of the sea surface is replaced by a geometric optics solution for specular reflection. In this study, an optimized setting of 18 degrees for the small incidence angle is determined by comparing the NRCSs between 52 RADARSAT-2 (R2) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and the CBS model with simultaneous sea surface wind derived by meteorological mooring buoys located in the northern South China Sea. By using the CBS model with the optimized incidence angle setting of 18 degrees and the nearly simultaneous wind directions of the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) as the input, sea surface wind speeds are retrieved from 46 R2 SAR images at C-band and from 2 COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) SAR images at X-band for the application study. The average root mean square error of the C-band R2 SAR retrieval results validated against nearly simultaneous measurements of ASCAT is 1.5 m/s, while the same value is 1.6 m/s for the X-band CSK SAR image. The results also indicate that the optimized small incidence angle setting of the CBS model found in this study is relatively reliable under sea surface wind speed conditions less than 14.0 m/s.

TI  - Berdyaev's Philosophy of Liberty: Existential <i>versus</i> Existentialistic
T2  - HERMENEIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study is to examine the worldviews and methodological foundations of Berdyaev's philosophy of liberty and concrete personalism in the context of his fundamental separation between existential philosophy and existentialism. The methodology of the study is to apply methods of analysis, synthesis, comparison, generalization, as well as the combination of cultural, religious and historical-philosophical approaches, which have made it possible to analyze the creative work by Berdyaev within the non-classical type of philosophizing. The scientific novelty attests to Berdyaev's worldview distance from the philosophy of classical existentialism and his affiliation with "non-academic" thinkers. For Berdyaev, human liberty and creativity are the basis for renewing the neglected spirituality of mankind and transforming the foundations of traditional Christianity. The conclusions emphasize that the most characteristic feature of Berdyaev's philosophical and religious ontological conception was the a priori of his entire categorical system of the phenomenon of liberty and its equation with the phenomenon of God. The spirit is associated by Berdyaev not with being, but with liberty, a creative act that takes place in the depths of human existence.

TI  - CULTURAL COMPONENTS IN KOREAN SOKDAM (속담 俗談) USING THE LEXICAL ELEMENT OF “DOG” IN COMPARISON WITH VIETNAMESE AND ENGLISH EQUIVALENTS
T2  - The Vietnamese Studies Review
T2  - 베트남연구
M3  - research-article
AB  - Recent researches on Korean sokdam have shown increasing interest in zodiac animals. As one of real-life animals, dogs are close to people from most countries in the world, but the way they are manifested in language as well as in human thoughts vary from one culture to another. In this research, we have selected 303 sokdam having “dog” as lexical elements from 986 idiomatic expressions gathered by Song Jae Seun in 1997. The sokdam are classified into 3 subgroups reflecting emotional and material life (16.1%), Koreans’ worldview, outlook on life and perspective of values (63.4%), and traditions, custom, religion, geographic-economic features (20.5%). It is found out that most sokdam express negative aspects of people’s life in which hard work, poverty, dependence and oppression are described in details. Koreans respect living values and they care about heredity, human’s nature and diversity, as well as laws of the society. Koreans pay attention to irrational or unrealistic elements and emphasize the differences in the world through subjective perception. That Koreans are profoundly influenced by Confucianism, Buddhism, folk beliefs in this research resembles Vietnamese people but contrasts to English.

TI  - Cluster Detection Mechanisms for Syndromic Surveillance Systems: Systematic Review and Framework Development.
T2  - JMIR public health and surveillance
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Systematic Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: The time lag in detecting disease outbreaks remains a threat to global health security. The advancement of technology has made health-related data and other indicator activities easily accessible for syndromic surveillance of various datasets. At the heart of disease surveillance lies the clustering algorithm, which groups data with similar characteristics (spatial, temporal, or both) to uncover significant disease outbreak. Despite these developments, there is a lack of updated reviews of trends and modelling options in cluster detection algorithms.OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to systematically review practically implemented disease surveillance clustering algorithms relating to temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal clustering mechanisms for their usage and performance efficacies, and to develop an efficient cluster detection mechanism framework.METHODS: We conducted a systematic review exploring Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Scopus. Between January and March 2018, we conducted the literature search for articles published to date in English in peer-reviewed journals. The main eligibility criteria were studies that (1) examined a practically implemented syndromic surveillance system with cluster detection mechanisms, including over-the-counter medication, school and work absenteeism, and disease surveillance relating to the presymptomatic stage; and (2) focused on surveillance of infectious diseases. We identified relevant articles using the title, keywords, and abstracts as a preliminary filter with the inclusion criteria, and then conducted a full-text review of the relevant articles. We then developed a framework for cluster detection mechanisms for various syndromic surveillance systems based on the review.RESULTS: The search identified a total of 5936 articles. Removal of duplicates resulted in 5839 articles. After an initial review of the titles, we excluded 4165 articles, with 1674 remaining. Reading of abstracts and keywords eliminated 1549 further records. An in-depth assessment of the remaining 125 articles resulted in a total of 27 articles for inclusion in the review. The result indicated that various clustering and aberration detection algorithms have been empirically implemented or assessed with real data and tested. Based on the findings of the review, we subsequently developed a framework to include data processing, clustering and aberration detection, visualization, and alerts and alarms.CONCLUSIONS: The review identified various algorithms that have been practically implemented and tested. These results might foster the development of effective and efficient cluster detection mechanisms in empirical syndromic surveillance systems relating to a broad spectrum of space, time, or space-time.

AB  - Economic analysis is a basic step in establishing disaster mitigation measures, but it is difficult to verify the results due to uncertainty. Therefore, the scope of investigation and analysis is wide. However, it is difficult to predict the amount of damage caused by flooding because the collection of relevant data is limited in the ungauged basin. In this study, distributed runoff analysis and flooding analysis were performed, and a method of estimating the amount of flood damage in the ungauged basin was proposed using collectible social and economic indicators and flood analysis results. For distributed runoff analysis and flooding analysis, GRM (Grid based Rainfall-runoff Model) and G2D (Grid based 2-Dimensional land surface flood model) developed by Korea Institute of Civil engineering and Building Technology were used. The method of substituting collectible social and economic indicators into the simple method and improvement method was used to estimate the amount of flood damage. As a result of the study, it was possible to estimate the amount of flood damage using satellite data and social and economic indicators in the ungauged basin.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to consider the Christian cognitive behavior therapy based on the cultural worldview analysis based on Hiebert's critical contextualization theory. Since the establishment and change of an individual's perception are based on the cultural world view, Christian cognitive behavioral therapy, which values the Christian world view, needs to consider this. To this end, the definition, characteristic role of culture, and critical contextualization were examined, and the application point of Christian cognitive behavioral therapy was confirmed based on this.Culture consists of a worldview of a unique lifestyle shared by a country or society. The world view is a lens that looks at reality, consisting of a cognitive, affirmative and evaluative dimension. Hibert emphasizes the critical contextualization of interpreting this view of the world from the perspective of the Gospel. This study applied the critical contextualization that promotes the change of Hibert's evangelical-based cultural worldview to Christian cognitive behavioral therapy, the main treatment method of Christian counseling. Christian cognitive behavioral therapy explores the people's distorted thinking and beliefs which causes depression and anxiety, promotes rational thinking ability, and presents a biblical view of certain thoughts and beliefs. This study goes further from the existing Christian cognitive behavioral therapy and suggests cognitive behavioral therapy based on cultural worldview analysis that encourages biblical changes in worldviews, a collection of holistic premises stemming from culture, rather than changes in fragmentary beliefs and thoughts. To this end, the world view's cognitive, affirmative and evaluative dimension were established biblically to derive the process of changing the system of thought and belief.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the Islamic worldview, the human has a prominent position such that perfect man (al-Insan al-Kamil) is introduced as successor and vicegerent of Allah on earth. But, this succession to the God and attainment of sublime status depends on characteristics and conditions taken into account in various respects. Islamic mysticism is one of the most important approaches in addressing the human and his/her role in the cosmos emphasized by various philosophers and scholars based on Islamic teachings. Position of perfect human and his dignity and esteem are investigated from perspective of two famous mystics and geniuses, Mawlana Jalal ad-Din Rumt and Hafiz-e Shirazi; that both of them were also influential and prominent in Persian poetry and literature, and have expressed their viewpoints in form of elegant and evocative poems. Thus, this study was conducted to unravelmany of the secrets and mysteries of humanity and providing a context for human spiritual development using religious teachings and intuition of discoveries, and experiences of Muslim mystics. Finally, transcendent values of the human's base and position were investigated in order of creation, as well as some human's characteristics and attributes and the purpose of human creation by examining a few poems of Mawlana and Hafiz using a descriptive analytical method.

TI  - Survival analysis of two <i>Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae</i> eradication methods
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is an important respiratory pathogen causing significant losses in the swine industry. Eradication of this bacterium from herds results in increased pig performance, productivity, and animal welfare. The objective of this study was to compare the time-to-detection of M. hyopneumoniae in breed-to-wean farms after the application of one of two methods for M. hyopneumoniae eradication. The two methods compared in this study were: 1) Herd closure and medication, and 2) Whole herd medication without extended closure. Fifty-six breed-to-wean farms located in the US Midwest constituted the cohort for this investigation. Herd closure and medication was applied in 45 farms, while whole herd medication was applied in 11 farms. Two mutually exclusive events were recorded for each farm, either detection of M. hyopneumoniae, which was considered the event of interest, or end of follow-up, which was the right-censored event. Farms were monitored until recording the event of interest, or until the end of follow-up, whichever occurred first. Detection of M. hyopneumoniae was assessed by identification of antibodies against the bacterium in sentinel pigs using a commercially available ELISA assay within 6 months post-eradication completion. Moreover, clinical presentation of disease was recorded if observed post-eradication completion. The censored event occurred at the end of the study in November 2016 (administrative censoring). Time-to-detection of M. hyopneumoniae was analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards model. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed using graphical methods. A sensitivity analysis to evaluate the assumption of outcome-independent censoring was also performed. The cumulative incidence of M. hyopneumoniae detection at the end of follow-up was 18.6 % (95% CI: 6.5%, 46.8%) for herd closure and medication, and 36.4% (95% CI: 15.5%, 70.3%) for whole herd medication. An interaction term between the type of eradication method and follow-up time was included in the model to account for the non-proportional hazards. An overall effect of eradication method was present (P = 0.0442). The hazard ratio associated to the time-invariant effect of eradication method was 29.2 (95% CI: 0.95, 894; P = 0.053). The hazard ratio associated with the interaction term was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.2; P = 0.405). Under these conditions, eradication using herd closure and medication reduced the likelihood of detecting cases of M. hyopneumoniae in breed-to-wean farms compared to whole herd medication. Detection of M. hyopneumoniae was concentrated during the first 64 months of follow-up in herd closure and medication, and in the first 8 months in whole herd medication.

AB  - Land change is one of the key determinants of ecosystem services provision in coupled social-ecological systems for sustainability. To date, however, the spatial and temporal impacts of land change on ecosystem service values have never been examined in entire North Korea. Here, this paper presents the first-ever national ecosystem service values in North Korea using Landsat-based land cover classification between the 1980s and 2000s and business as usual scenario through the 2030s. The results indicate that the ESVs per annum decreased from $7,477 million(KRW 8,972.4×109) to $6,864 million(KRW 8,236.8×109) between the 1980s and 2030s using global value coefficients from the widely cited 1997 publication by Costanza and colleagues. Moreover, North Korea is highly likely to suffer from triple environmental jeopardy, including loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, land degradation, and climate change through the 2030s. These findings suggest, in order for North Korea to develop in a sustainable manner, it will face great challenges in the next few decades to manage not only the land-use transitions between agricultural land and forest land, but the trade-offs between provisioning and regulating services, and social-ecological divide as well. Furthermore, the findings highlight that ecosystem services valuation and monitoring in North Korea is critical to sustain the natural capital and achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals in the Korean Peninsula through the 2030s.

AB  - This article examines the academic significance of the arguments of gi (氣) and su (數) discussed in the 17th century Yulgok School, focusing on the debate among Ki Jeong-Ik, Park Sang-Hyun, and Yoon Jeung. The Gi-su argument is a discussion about how to see the relationship between gi that makes up the real world and su that determines the fortune of the reality, and is a rather peculiar discourse that has not been dealt with in the study of Chosun's Confucianism. The main issue of the argument was whether to see gi and su identically or separately, and how to understand the variability and immutability of gi and su. The philosophical question implied in the argument is to ask how much a person can overcome and change the destiny that has been given since birth, based on the worldview of the li (理) and gi (氣) theory of Neo-Confucianism. In addition, this question can be said to be embodied in the agony of the Yulgok School, which explores how far human efforts beyond the limits are possible in the reality confined by gi. Ki Jung-Ik, who was at the center of the discourse, responds to the arguments of Park and Yoon, establishing his theories and deeply pondering the relationship between will and fate.

AB  - Crop classification is one of the foremost and most challenging applications of remote sensing. Crops exhibit both high intra-class variance across geographical locations, as well as low inter-class variance especially across seasons. As such, they require both spectral and temporal input, both of which are provided by the Sentinel 2 satellites. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of our multispectral and multitemporal crop classification analysis, on a region-wide scale, encompassing multiple climatological conditions and a high number of crop types. We have experimented using the ground-truth provided by the Farmer Registration System, with both well-known spectral and spatial shallow features and classifiers, at both pixel and field level, as well as with state of the art 3D convolutional neural networks. Our results show that Sentinel 2 imagery exhibit a strong potential as input for a systematic crop classification infrastructure.

AB  - With the modern worldview and rapid secularization people in the West expected the religions would be disappeared from human minds. But the expectation could not be a fact. The situation goes the opposite. As Peter Berger said de-secularization was going on and the influence of religious fundamentalism became stronger since mid-20th century. Rapid growing of fundamentalism in Islamic world is a good example.Muslim world is facing a challenge. Muslim worldview became rigid and Muslim society is isolated from non-Muslim worlds. It is an urgent question how Islamic world co-exists with other civilizations. Most of ordinary Muslims want to live with non-Muslims peacefully. Many Muslim intelligent who want to reform Islamic closed worldview try to find another way for the future of Islam. The challenge from inside is to rediscover Islamic identity, especially that of Islamic intellectuality.Nasr agrees that the crisis faced by Muslims in the contemporary globalized context is caused by Western secularism which rejects knowledge of the sacred. To overcome it, he argues for the re-sacralization of knowledge which can be accomplished by re-discovering the rich legacy of Islamic philosophy and re-constructing Islamic intellectuality which integrates both reason and spirituality. Nasr raises the critical issue of religious pluralism. Although Nasr believe that Islam is the true religion which contains the absolute truth, he also accepts there are genuine revelations apart from Islam.

TI  - Improving burn severity retrieval by integrating tree canopy cover into radiative transfer model simulation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Burn severity mapping greatly informs fire management and can be used to predict post-fire vegetation recovery. Satellite remote sensing is a cost-effective method for estimating burn severity, providing a comprehensive spatially explicit view of whole landscapes. However, the proportion of tree canopy cover (TCC) affects the reflectance signal, obscuring background char and ash. Consequently, traditional optical satellite remote sensing methods that do not account for variation in TCC misclassify burn severity, especially in areas with extremely low or high TCC. In this study, TCC data served to parameterize and constrain the inversion of the Forest Reflectance and Transmittance (FRT) radiative transfer model (RTM) to alleviate spectral confusion when retrieving burn severity. The methodology was evaluated using field measurements of burn severity for a series of wildfires in the fire-prone tropical savannas of northern Australia and the western United States. Burn severity classes were used for Australia while the Composite Burn Index (CBI) for US. Reflectance data from Sentinel-2A Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) corresponding to post-fire field survey dates were used to retrieve burn severity using FRT RTM (with and without using TCC information in its parameterization and inversion) and two standard empirical burn indices, dNBR and RdNBR, for comparison. Using FRT RIM without TCC constraint produced an overestimation for low burn severity in regions with low TCC and an underestimation for moderate and high burn severity in regions with high TCC. Burn severity estimation accuracy significantly improved by integrating TCC in the parameterization and inversion of FRT RTM. The overall accuracy in northern Australia increased from 65% to 81%, and the kappa coefficient increased from 0.35 to 0.55. In the western United States, R-2 between estimated and observed CBI, increased from 0.33 to 0.54, root mean square error (RMSE) reduced from 0.53 to 0.43, and in all instances, the method performed better than dNBR and RdNBR. The method used in this study achieved more accurate burn severity mapping, thus assisting land managers to better understand post-fire vegetation resilience and forest management.

AB  - Grassland height is one of the main factors used to evaluate grassland conditions. However, the retrieval of natural grassland height at the regional scale by remote sensing data and conventional statistical models will result in large errors, especially in the heterogeneous alpine grassland of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). In this article, we aimed to construct a model based on multiple variables (biogeographical, meteorological, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product) using a random forest (RF) algorithm to predict the spatial distribution of grassland height in the TP from 2003 to 2017. The results show the following conditions. 1) Seven variables (elevation, slope, aspect, enhanced vegetation index, reflectance in band seven of MODIS (B7), annual accumulated temperature (>= 0 degrees C), and annual precipitation) that were selected by recursive feature elimination from 11 variables have high importance in the RF model. The final model exhibits good performance, with mean R-2 and root mean squared error values of 0.51 and 6.15 cm, respectively, which were determined via 10-fold crossvalidation. 2) The mean grassland height (2003-2017) predicted by the RF model ranges from 5 to 10 cm in most areas of the TP, and the mean height is 10 cm. The grassland height in the east and southeast of the TP is significantly higher than that in other areas. 3) This article achieves a relatively accurate estimation of grassland height over a large spatial scale at 500-m spatial resolution, which plays an important role in accurately estimating aboveground biomass and evapotranspiration over grassland.

TI  - Optimizing Feature Selection of Individual Crop Types for Improved Crop Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop planting area information is of significance for understanding regional food security and agricultural development planning. While increasing numbers of medium resolution satellite imagery and improved classification algorithms have been used for crop mapping, limited efforts have been made in feature selection, despite its vital impacts on crop classification. Furthermore, different crop types have their unique spectral and phenology characteristics; however, the different features of individual crop types have not been well understood and considered in previous studies of crop mapping. Here, we examined an optimized strategy to integrate specific features of individual crop types for mapping an improved crop type layer in the Sanjiang Plain, a new food bowl in China, by using all Sentinel-2 time series images in 2018. First, an automatic spectro-temporal feature selection (ASTFS) method was used to obtain optimal features for individual crops (rice, corn, and soybean), including sorting all features by the global separability indices for each crop and removing redundant features by accuracy changes when adding new features. Second, the ASTFS-based optimized feature sets for individual crops were used to produce three crop probability maps with the Random Forest classifier. Third, the probability maps were then composited into the final crop layer by considering the probability of each crop at every pixel. The resultant crop layer showed an improved accuracy (overall accuracy = 93.94%, Kappa coefficient = 0.92) than the other classifications without such a feature optimizing process. Our results indicate the potential of the ASTFS method for improving regional crop mapping.

TI  - Interpretable POLSAR Image Classification Based on Adaptive-Dimension Feature Space Decision Tree
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Decision tree method has been applied to POLSAR image classification, due to its capability to interpret the scattering characteristics as well as good classification accuracy. Compared with popular machine learning classifiers, decision tree approach can explain the scattering process of certain type of targets by use of the polarimetric features at the tree nodes. Except the interpretability, decision tree approach could be transplanted to other data set without training process for the same terrain types, since the polarimetric features are inherently connected to the physical scattering properties. Currently, decision tree based classifiers, typically employ one single polarimetric feature at the nodes of the tree. The idea to increase the number of the polarization features at the decision tree node is expected to improve the classification result, which combine two or more polarimetric features to form a two or high dimension feature space. In this way, the classes which cannot be discriminated with one feature could possibly be separated with the space constructed by several features. However, it also inevitably leads to an increase in the computational burden. In fact, not all nodes require very high-dimensional feature space to achieve high classification precision. Therefore, in this article we proposed that the dimension of the feature space used in the decision tree nodes is adaptively changed from one to three, due to the separability of the classes under this node. The developed classification method is examined by the classical AIRSAR data in Flevoland area of the Netherlands, as well as GaoFen-3 data in Hulunbuir of China. The experiments show that the classification performance is superior to the fixed dimension feature decision tree methods, with less and reasonable computation time. Besides, the transferability of polarimetric features obtained by decision tree is preliminarily demonstrated in the application to another AIRSAR data.

AB  - To study a new framework for building detection from optical remote sensing image(RSI) that based on rectangle approximation and region growing. According to the geometric structures of buildings, a right angle detection method based on voting strategy is investigated to get building candidates. In order to accurately estimate the shape of buildings with non-convex properties, an algorithm is employed to reduce false positives by extracting outer corners of buildings from the detected right angles. Combining with similar spectral features of surfaces, a segmentation algorithm based on region growing is proposed to get the complete top surfaces of buildings. Using several RSIs of Florida and Nebraska areas in WorldView-3 image data, experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the precision ratio of 89.44% and recall ratio of 90.36%.

AB  - With the development of satellite technology, the resolution of remote sensing data has been continuously improved. The launch of remote sensing video satellites has provided new opportunities and challenges for traffic analysis, which are benefit to optimize the traffic conditions suffered by people especially in cities. In this paper, a method is proposed to analyze the traffic flow conditions using remote sensing satellite video. Firstly, vehicle targets are detected by combining with road network data, vehicle brightness characteristics and its contrast information with the surrounding background. Then, the traffic flow, density, and average vehicle speed are calculated. Finally, traffic flow information can be obtained, such as traffic congestion, traffic flow collection, abnormal vehicle behavior, etc. With the satellite video acquired by the International Space Station and Skysat-1, the proposed method is validated to vehicle detection and traffic flow analysis, including average travel speed, vehicle turning, traffic congestion and so on.

TI  - Local recurrence of breast cancer caused by core needle biopsy: Case report and review of the literature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Needle tract seeding is the implantation of tumor cells at the site of needle passage during needle biopsy. Histopathological examination of resected specimens after biopsy shows an incidence of 22%-50%. However, reports of actual local recurrence are extremely rare. Here we report such a case.PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 67-year-old woman was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma by histopathology and underwent right mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Histopathological examination revealed non-invasive ductal carcinoma. One year after the first operation, a mass was found at the site of the core needle biopsy (CNB) scar near the previous surgical wound on the right chest. Histological examination revealed the tumor as adenocarcinoma, and a skin lesion resection was performed. After surgery, radiation therapy and endocrine therapy were performed. She remains relapse-free as of this writing, 9 months after resection.DISCUSSION: Reports of local recurrence due to needle tract seeding are extremely rare. We found nine cases of mastectomy and seven cases of partial resection performed for the first surgery; six patients received radiation therapy and 10 did not. Histological diagnosis at the time of the first operation was invasive carcinoma in all cases.CONCLUSION: The risk of seeding is high with multiple punctures in CNB, in cases with a short period until surgery, and in mutinous carcinoma. Considering these factors, CNB puncture should preferably be at a site that is included in the resection area during surgery. If not resected, close follow-up is necessary considering the possibility of local recurrence. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IJS Publishing Group Ltd.

AB  - Damage detection due to Typhoon Hagibis was attempted on an agricultural field in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, using Synthetic Aperture Rada (SAR) data. Sentinel-1 data obtained immediately following the heavy rainfall was analyzed. Additionally, the possibility for damage detection by ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data obtained four days after the rainfall was examined. Image composition of Sentinel-1 data obtained directly after the rainfall and the flooding time during paddy rice transplanting is effective in detecting heavily flooded areas caused by dike breach. Flooding because of heavy rain causes a decrease in the backscattering coefficient in both the inside of the field and footpath between the fields. Pixel spacing of PALSAR-2 strip map mode data was 2.5 m and showed the disturbed pattern of the paddy fields caused by the receding floodwater.

AB  - Tirso was a leading playwright in Spain in the 17th century, and his work, Don Gil de las calzas verdes, is regarded as a play with an excellent comic identity in light of today's comedic theory of "different" and "unfamiliarity," young people's resistance to unfair practices related to marriage as a social judgment on absurdity, and the notion of harmony and reconciliation at the end of the play. The play also features a constant confrontation between the fictional story of Don Gil de las calzas verdes and the real story of Juana abandoned by her beloved man. Within this confrontation, the Baroque worldview of coincidence, chaos, and fantasy unfolds pleasantly with a comic touch. In other words, the play can be regarded as the epitome of Baroque comedy, which depicts the Baroque worldview using Tirso's unique comic touch.

Budonghang can be read as both first-person text or third-person text when second-person perspective and focalization are combined. Delay and gap as narrative technique contribute to the tragic worldview typical in Lee Moon-gu's early novels. The narrator of Budonghang has been regarded as participating in the story in the former research, but it is also possible to assume that the narrator is not participating in the story depending on the edition of the text. If the difference between the texts is an error happened during the editing process, it should be corrected immediately.

AB  - Recently, drones have been widely used in various fields. The most active field is aviation drones, where various drones are used in combat to conduct unmanned surveillance and attacks, and in recent years the US military has trained drones pilots. In addition, it is used in various fields such as forest fire monitoring, border surveillance, broadcasting, aerial surveys, environmental monitoring, and courier delivery. In recent years, the range of applications for personal use and leisure has been widening. The next most frequently used field is the automotive sector. In the case of vehicles, autonomous navigation is added to general automobiles, and unmanned vehicles are expected to be realized within 10 years. On the other hand, the use of drones in the marine sector is somewhat lower than in aviation or the field of vehicles. In particular, many companies are conducting research and development in the aviation and automobile fields, but only a few representative companies are conducting research and development in the marine field. Conventional marine drones are mostly utilized in the public and military fields, but MR-SENTINEL proposed in this paper is a system used for private sector such as aqua farming and marine environmental monitoring. The MR-SENTINEL designed and developed in this paper uses an electric propulsion motor with a length of 3 m. MR-SENTINEL's communication system basically uses WiFi and enables free operation without additional communication fee. In addition, existing systems used expensive sensors, but MR-SENTINEL uses low-cost sensors to lower the price, so it can be widely used in the private sector.

AB  - This paper examines (i) how Luis Sepulveda embodies the crisis and problems with the recovery of values in modern society in his work, and (ii) what prospects for a new future society he proposes. Three of his latest works, 『The story of Mix, Max, and Mex』, 『The snail realizes the importance of slowness』 and 『The story of a dog called Leal』, are mainly discussed for this purpose.These works are a series of fables that show the literary imagination of Luis Sepulveda, which diagnoses the crisis in modern society and the need for the recovery of values. Luis Sepulveda claims that all problems of modern civilization begin with the idea that the other is completely separated from ourselves. He, therefore, argues that it is crucial to care all of us together, not myself and others, separately. It presents a bright prospect that if other existence is recognized and communicated, the crisis in modern society will be resolved. This is the way we can confirm the perspective of “communal world vision through unity and solidarity” that is incorporated in his works.

AB  - In this study, we monitored temporal and spatial variability in summer cold water events in the East Sea of Korea. We defined cold water as seawater that is >= 5 degrees C colder than the surrounding area. When cold water expands or changes in propagation direction, the National Institute of Fisheries Science (NIFS) of Korea issues a cold water upwelling warning to prevent aquafarm damage. To understand cold water effects, we analyzed the causes of continuous and strong cold water events, and propagation thereof, using satellite and in situ data for summer to autumn in the period 2011-2019. To investigate the cold water life cycle, we used satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites Aqua and Terra, as well as in situ ocean surface current and wind data. Our results showed that cold water zones tend to expand in early summer and contract in late summer. The cycle of cold water expansion and contraction was repeated several times due to cold water events.

AB  - Purpose: In Korea, seasonal influenza is an important respiratory illness afflicting children every year. We aimed to investigate the childhood epidemiology in Jeju during the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 seasons.Methods: Children aged <13 years, who were tested for influenza at the Jeju National University Hospital during the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 influenza seasons, were included. Demographics and the influenza test results were retrospectively reviewed from their medical records.Results: This study included 5,219 cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) (2017–2018: n=2,279; 2018–2019: n=2,940). The mean age of the eligible children was 2.85±2.79 years, and the most common age among ILI patients in each season was 1 year group. There were 902 (17.3%, 902/5,219) confirmed influenza cases during the 2 seasons. The rate of influenza confirmed by rapid influenza diagnostic test or polymerase chain reaction among ILI patients in the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 seasons was 10.4% (236/2,279) and 10.3% (303/2,940) for influenza A, and 9.1% (208/2,279) and 5.3% (155/2,940) for influenza B, respectively. The mean age of influenza-confirmed cases was 4.09 years and 5.05 years in the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 seasons, respectively (P<0.05). Weekly distribution of influenza was similar to that of ILI in the clinical sentinel surveillance system in both seasons.Conclusion: The difference in the influenza epidemic trend and age-group distribution between the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 seasons was distinct in Jeju. Steady epidemiological studies on influenza in Jeju are needed for comparison with other regions of Korea.

AB  - Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (S AR) has a high application value in the observation of ship targets. After the ship is detected, the actual observation position of the moving ship and its motion parameters are worthy of concern, especially for some medium and large size valuable ships. In this paper, we propose a method of extracting the energy center of the ship signal trajectory to locate the ship first. Then according to the difference between the imaging position and the positioning position of the ship, the radial velocity estimation can be calculated. The proposed method does not need to construct a reference data box, and can directly locate the moving ship. The processing of the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) complex data verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - In modern society, due to excessive material civilization and rapid changes in social trends, the absence of humanity is getting worse day by day, and the values and mental degradation of those who live in this age are inevitable. In such a society, proper awareness of life and the world is important to avoid the right values and mental degradation of people. Correct recognition recognizes that all the phenomena surrounding human life are organic relations, and it is necessary to overcome the contradictions of both sides through imagination and to understand that God, human beings, and nature are organic relations. In such a society, proper awareness of life and the world is important to avoid the right values and mental degradation of people. Correct recognition recognizes that all the phenomena surrounding human life are organic relations, and it is necessary to overcome the contradictions of both sides through imagination and to understand that God, human beings, and nature are organic relations. For this insight, it is necessary to understand human beings and to make sound judgment based on the Christian worldview.I want to find God's image expressed in Confucian thought in the process of Confucianism formation and the acceptance of theology under the situation where the present Korea, where we live, is influenced by Confucianism in Confucian cultural soil. Christians often use the word “strength between spiritual life” or "filling the Holy Spirit”in prayer. I wanted to find out the meaning of "the strength between spirituality” and "the filling of the Holy Spirit" in the Bible, and also thought what is the equivalent in our country living on the basis of Confucianism.Therefore, it is found that there is a similarity with Zhu Xi's "theory of Li(Li-Gi)”which is representative of Chinese neo-Confucianism.As to the Spirit in the Bible, if the Spirit of God in the Old Testament is metaphysical in the transcendental sense as substantialism, then the Spirit of God in the New Testament can be seen as physical science in the theory of human nature. We humans live secular or fleshly life different from the Spirit of God. In other words, it is secular or fleshly life if we do not live according to the providence of God in our lives. In the process of living this secular or fleshly life, our values and mental decadence are inevitably accompanied. We believe that the Spirit of God always exists in our lives, and by pursuing and following it we can eliminate the human fleshly mind. By doing this, we humans can live as new born.In Zhu Xi's "theory of Li (Li-Gi)”, Li refers to Li as a transcendent being. It is a metaphysical concept that is the basis of all things creation, and is also called Taegeuk in the sense that it is the presider of all individual Li and the best Li.Zhu Xi describes the formation of all things in the real world as the action and the static work of Gi, which is called the dualism of Li Gi. It is different Li as the presider from Gi as the work. However, in the real world, Li and Gi are symbiotic relationships that can not be separated from each other. In order for this symbiotic relationship to be well done, it is indispensable to act as the presider in order to correct the wrong function of Gl.Therefore, in the theory of human nature the relationship between Li and Gi is the monism as the dualism of Li Gi. As we can see from the above, the Spirit in the Bible on the ontology is Li as the metaphysical meaning in the Zhu Xi's theory of Li (Li Gi), and the Spirit in the Bible on the theory of human nature means Li as the presenter in the real world which is like one of many Li upon same foundation in the Zhu Xi's theory of Li (Li Gi). In other words, the Spirit in ontology is not mixed as Li and Gi are not mixed, and the Spirit on the theory of human nature is not separated as Li and Gi are not separated. Therefore, in the theory of human nature the unity of body and soul in the Bible means the unity of human mind and the way of Zhu Xi. Therefore, the fact that the filling of the Holy Spirit of the Trinity God can escape from sin and make the unity of body and soul in the Bible can be regarded as achieving the unity of human mind and the way and Li as the presider works smoothly action of Gi.

TI  - Identifying Risk Factors for Regional Recurrence in Early-Stage Breast Cancer with pTI-2 and Negative Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Due to the low rate of regional recurrence (RR) in early-stage breast cancer with pT1-2 and negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), no regional therapy is suggested for them. However, whether there is a subset of patients who were with high risk of regional failure and may benefit from regional treatment is still unknown. The current study was designed to identify the patients with high risk of RR, thereby providing clues for enhanced regional therapy.Methods: We analyzed a total of 1124 breast cancer patients with pT1-2N0 from May 2004 to Dec 2014. All the patients were treated with breast-conservation surgery (BCS) and adjuvant whole-breast radiotherapy. The regional recurrence-free survival (RRFS), local regional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed by using the Kaplan Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to detect factors in predicting the RRFS.Results: In multivariable analysis, both T stage and molecular type were significant predictors of RRFS. Patients with T2 stage had a lower RRFS than those with T1stage. Triple-negative patients were more likely to suffer regional failure than the patients with other molecular types. The two predictors were then employed to divide all the patients into three groups based on the risk level of RR. Patients with both T2 and triple-negative molecular type had the lower RRFS, LRRFS, DFS and OS than the patients with one or no risk factor.Conclusion: For early-stage breast cancer patients with negative SLNB, those who were with both T2 stage and triple-negative molecular type had a high rate of RR and enhance regional therapy may be needed for them.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer is the second most common malignancy in developed countries and accurate staging is vital for determining the most appropriate management plan, in particular, whether adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended in addition to surgical resection. There is currently no consensus regarding standard practice for lymph node resection in colorectal cancer although there is increasing evidence to support the use of sentinel lymph node mapping to target lymph node sampling and facilitate ultra-staging of nodes.PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present the case of a 49 year old female who underwent a robotic right hemicolectomy and complete mesocolic excision for caecal adenocarcinoma using indocyanine fluorescence imaging (ICG FI) to guide nodal dissection.DISCUSSION: ICG FI may be useful for sentinel lymph node mapping in colorectal cancer. This technique can assist to identify the first draining lymph nodes and permit ultra-staging of lymph nodes.CONCLUSION: While there is still limited evidence to support ICG FI, the current body of literature suggests that it is likely to be a feasible and sensitive technique for guiding sentinel lymph node sampling in colorectal cancer.

T2  - Korean Jounal of Systematic Theology
T2  - 한국조직신학논총
M3  - research-article
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to show that even though the understanding of religion and relations between religions in Lindbeck’s cultural-linguistic approach has been understood as an exclusivism or independence theory, it can be interpreted as openness based on intrasystematic faithfulness, that is, intratex tuality. To this end, this paper analyzes Lindbeck’s understanding of religion in terms of his theory of truth. What is revealed in this analysis is that Lindbeck’s theory of truth is not a relativistic view of truth that recognizes only categorial and intrasystematic truth, but a weak realism that connects these two truths with ontological truth linguistically as well as practically. Based on this understanding of truth, Lindbeck described religion as a framework or structure for interpreting the reality of believers in a form similar to culture or language. Lindbeck explains the view that religion is the framework for interpreting the world with the concept of intratextuality. This intratextulity is revealed internally in the system as a practical fidelity to the worldview provided by the scriptures. At the same time, since the intratextuality has the characteristic of integrating all the realities experienced by the believer, it appears as an assimilative power externally. Lindbeck believes that this assimilative power is the non-universal and non-foundational basis for interreligious dialogues. In this regard, the foundation of the relationship between religions in the cultural-linguistic approach is not located in a common expe rience of ultimate reality as in the case of inclusivism or pluralism, but within the text which creates categories appropriate for ultimate reality and within the assimilative power which is faithful to intrasystematic rules generated by the text. In this respect, Lindbeck’s theory of religion, although seemingly having an exclusive character, does not result in closedness but opens up the ad ho but practical interreligious conversations, because this exclusive character is linked to the assimilative power based on the intratextuality. Moreover, Lindbeck’s exclusivist character based on faithfulness to the Bible and openness originated from this faithfulness may contribute to developing a theory of religion or that of a relationship between religions, which is realistically suited to a conservative Korean church. In addition, considering that Lindbeck’s theory was formed based on specific religious traditions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, it is necessary to make efforts to modify his theory considering the religious environments of Korea.

AB  - As the relationship between earthquakes and active faults is known, the necessity for the Korean active faults map has been raised. Therefore, the government recognized the necessity and National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) carried out a research project to produce a Korean active faults map from 2009.Although the project had successfully been finished, it was not enough to get agreement among experts for opening to the public. As a result, a new project was planned to upgrade this map, but the progress was struggled due to the lack of government interest and budget. In 2016, the project has suddenly emerged due to the 2016 Ulsan sea earthquake and Gyeongju earthquake. This project basically adopted advanced research techniques to complete the whole Korean active faults map in four stages for 20 years from 2017 starting from the Gyeongju area. It will investigate potential active faults (Quaternary faults) throughout South Korea and will eventually produce a national active faults map. For effective investigation, the Korea Active Fault Research Group (KAFRG) has been set up with experts from the relevant majors required for active fault research. The research group traces, analyzes, and interprets potential active faults using not only the recent remote sensing data such as airborne-LiDAR, but also geomorphology, paleoseismology, Quaternary age dating and structural geology. The data will be databased and properly serviced to public institutions and to the public on the website. Although there were some hurdles due to the lack of understanding by the government and the public for such a research, the research system is gradually being established. However, the issue of private land permission for excavation survey, the lack of professional manpower, and the tracing of active faults in urban areas remain important tasks to be successfully solved in the future.

AB  - The paper discusses the role of spirituality in the process of the development of society, as moral and worldview pluralism, the preservation of cultural identity against the background of globalization determine the need and set the conditions for the search for ways to overcome this situation, the renewal of humanity's social strategy. The accounting and intensification of the spiritual vector in socio-cultural development is seen as an important component of the way out of the resulting conflict, which threatens today to develop into a crisis of civilizational scale. At the same time, it is noteworthy that there is insufficient proper conceptual study of spirituality as a unit of philosophical knowledge, its socio-cultural aspect.

AB  - We analyze the decade-long (2007-2016) record of aerosol measurements from four distinctive sensors, namely CALIOP, MODIS, MISR, and IASI, to quantify the trans-Atlantic dust transport and deposition. These satellite sensors use different techniques to characterize particle size and shape properties; and we have developed sensor-specific methods (broadly categorized into size based and shape-based method) to derive dust optical depth (DOD). The size-based DOD from MODIS and IASI generally agrees better with AERONET-derived DOD than the shape-based DOD from CALIOP and MISR does. Overall, the shape-based DOD is smaller than the size-based DOD by about 25%, which is consistent with distinctive ways of accounting for coarse-spherical particles of dust-pollution internal mixture. While such dust-pollution mixtures are counted as dust in the size-based DOD, they are excluded in the shape-based DOD. DOD is not a good proxy for dust deposition. Instead, the dust deposition depends strongly on the gradient of DOD on a monthly basis and can be derived by calculating the meridional and zonal dust mass flux based on the three-dimensional distributions of dust. Among the remote sensing measurements, difference in dust deposition is smaller than that of DOD, suggesting that different satellites characterize the DOD gradient more consistently than DOD itself. Satellite measurements of dust deposition and DOD also provide an accurate estimate of the dust loss frequency (LF) that measures how efficient the dust is removed from the atmosphere. We found that these remote sensing measurements yield similar LF values of 0.078 - 0.102 d(-1), which however is factors of 2-5 smaller than model simulations. This analysis provides valuable insights into potential deficiencies in models' emission and transport/removal processes and hence helps guide model improvement.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Dust plumes originating from the Earth's major arid and semi-arid areas can significantly affect the climate system and human health. Many existing methods have been developed to identify dust from non-dust pixels from a remote sensing point of view. However, these methods use empirical rules and therefore have difficulty detecting dust above or below the detectable thresholds. Supervised machine learning methods have also been applied to detect dust from satellite imagery, but these methods are limited especially when applying to areas outside the training data due to the inadequate amount of ground truth data. In this work, we proposed an automatic dust segmentation framework using semi-supervised machine learning, based on a collocated dataset using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). The proposed method utilizes unsupervised machine learning for segmentation of VIIRS imagery, and leverages the guidance from the dust labels using the dust profile product of CALIPSO to determine the dust clusters as the final product. The dust clusters are determined based on the similarity of spectral signature from dust pixels along the CALIPSO tracks. Experiment results show that the accuracy of the proposed framework outperforms the traditional physical infrared method along CALIPSO tracks. In addition, the proposed method performs consistently over three different study areas, the North Atlantic Ocean, East Asia, and Northern Africa.

AB  - Remote sensing data fusion is an effective way to improve the land cover information extraction capability. In this paper, optical remote sensing images of GF-1 and SAR images of GF-3 were used to explore the potential in land cover classification. An area with different land cover types was selected as the study area. The spectral, texture, and vegetation indices extracted from panchromatic, multispectral and SAR images were all included in the object-oriented method to perform the land cover classification. It has shown that, GF-1 and GF-3 can be used in land cover classifications, and the accuracy of land cover classification can be improved by integrated using of the optical and SAR data. For several land cover types, e.g., building, bare land, and road, the SAR information introduced noises, resulting in classification accuracy decreasing comparing to the result that only using optical images.

TI  - A Simulation-Based Analysis of Topographic Effects on LAI Inversion Over Sloped Terrain
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Topography significantly complicates the radiative transfer process of vegetation and further causes variation in reflectance observed by remote sensors. Leaf area index (LAI) inversion based on reflectance data is subsequently influenced by topography. Neglecting the topographic effects may lead to large biases when estimating LAI over rugged terrain. How the topography influences the LAI inversion process has rarely been explored. In this article, the topographic effects on LAI inversion over sloped terrain are quantitatively investigated and analyzed based on a dataset generated from the discrete anisotropy radiative transfer model. An artificial neural network (ANN) model is established to represent the flat surface LAI inversion algorithms. Then, the reflectance of sloped terrain is input into the ANN model to obtain the biased LAI inversion values. The results reveal that topography effects on LAI inversion are related to canopy density and generally lead to an underestimation except for sparse canopies. The mean relative bias could reach 51% when the slope angle reaches 60 degrees. The variation trends of inverted LAI are closely related to the local incident angle. The different levels of bias in reflectance at red and near-infrared bands lead to different patterns of inversion errors for different canopies densities. Finally, we compared the existing strategies (geometric correction and topographic correction strategies) designed for LAI inversion over sloped terrain. It is found that these strategies apply in different situations. The results are helpful in understanding the topographic effects and further finding a better strategy for LAI inversion over sloped terrain.

AB  - Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a key parameter in land use/cover change and terrestrial modelling studies. With the accumulation of satellite records in the past few decades, the spatial-temporal prediction of vegetation index becomes feasible. In this paper, we established a convolutional GRU network (ConvGRU) to predict the short-term vegetation index considering the spatial and temporal patterns in the NDVI records. The predictive performance of the proposed method is evaluated for several vegetation types in different regions globally. The results demonstrate that the proposed model has sufficient ability in predicting satellite recorded NDVI. The validation on the MODIS NDVI datasets achieved an average RMSE around 0.06. And, the model performs better in regions of Australia while worse in North Europe.

M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a direct source of water for terrestrial plants. Measurement of soil moisture can help to characterize plant growth and portray regional soil moisture information in a timely manner, which is of great significance for water and soil regulation. This study uses the Tropic of Cancer in Yunnan Province as a research area, and based on MODIS product data, the apparent thermal inertia (ATI), vegetation supply water index (VSWI) and surface water capacity index (SWCI) are calculated. The measured data are used in regression analysis modeling to retrieve the soil moisture in the study area. The results show that the three indices of ATI, SWCI and VSWI have good correlation with soil moisture, among which VSWI has the best fitting effect, and ATI and SWCI can retrieve soil moisture more effectively. The soil moisture contents are mostly concentrated in the range of 0.2 to 0.4 m(3)/m(3), among which the soil moisture of Jianshui County, Mengzi City, Wenshan County, Yanshan County, Gejiu City and Shiping County are the smallest, and the soil moisture in the western portion of Gengma County and Cangyuan County and the central portion of Jinggu County are the largest. As the fractional vegetation cover increases, the soil moisture content also gradually increases, and the mean value is greater than 0.2 m(3)/m(3).

AB  - In order to study the tectonic characteristics and its relationship with uranium mineralization in Weijing area of Inner Mongolia, the remote sensing technique and visual interpretation are applied to interpret the linear structures in Weijing area with GF-2 remote sensing data, based on the atmospheric correction and another preprocessing. The distribution regularities of linear structures can be got from the field geological examination and the available geological data. The results indicates that the intersecting areas of NE-NEE trending structure F12 and NNE trending structure F11 with EW or NW trending structures are the favorable uranium metallogenic regions. The NE-NEE trending structure F12 and NNE trending structure F11 are the most important ore-controlling structures in the area.

AB  - A new mean sea surface (MSS) model (named Shandong University of Science and Technology (2018) (SUST2018) MSS model) with a grid of 1' x 1' over China seas and its adjacent ocean (0 degrees N similar to 41 degrees N, 100 degrees E similar to 140 degrees E) is established and validated. The SUST2018 model established with the 19-year moving average method is based on 26-year multi-satellite altimeter data covering the time period 1992-2018. The new altimetry data of HaiYang-2A (HY-2A), Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A have been used in establishing the SUST2018 model. The process of the establishment of the MSS model also have been presented, including collinear adjustment of exact repeat mission (ERM) data, removal of the temporal oceanic variability of geodetic mission (GM) data, crossover adjustment and gridding. The reliability and accuracy of SUST2018 are validated by comparing with the CLS15 and DTU18 MSS models as well as satellite altimeter data. By comparing SUST2018 and SUST(all)2018 (established with the traditional average method), it can be found that the accuracy of SUST2018 is higher than that of SUST(all)2018, which indicates that the 19-year moving average method can effectively improve the accuracy of an MSS model.

AB  - The Landsat Program has been observing and collecting Earth system data from space since 1972. Over this time, advances in spatial, spectral, and radiometric resolution have allowed the Landsat satellites to evolve into powerful global Earth observation imaging systems. The longevity of the Landsat Program has produced a massive catalogue of imagery data. The sheer magnitude of this collection necessitates the use of scalable techniques to extract value from decades of remote sensing data. With the introduction of commercial cloud computing, it is now possible to cheaply provision resources for processing and storing enormous amounts of such data. Machine learning-based computer vision is advancing at a blistering pace and has shown great promise when applied to satellite imagery. The combination of cloud computing and machine learning offers the ability to analyze the decades of imagery collected by the Landsat Program at a cost never before possible. The focus of this chapter is to discuss the Landsat Program progression, cloud computing, machine learning, and data policy and how all these components contribute to greater understanding on the state of our planet Earth.

TI  - A Physical-Based Algorithm for Retrieving Land Surface Temperature From Moon-Based Earth Observation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter and plays an important role in hydrology, ecology, environment, and biogeochemistry. It is difficult for the existing satellites to acquire global LST with spatial and temporal consistency. The Moon-based Earth observation platform with a long life, large coverage can observe continuously the Earth, and obtain the global-scale LST. At present, various approaches for retrieving LST from passive microwave remote sensing data have been developed for the satellite remote sensing data with small and constant viewing zenith angle, however, the Moon-based Earth observation platform located outside the Earth's ionosphere has the viewing zenith angle of 0-90 degrees. In this study, a modified physical-based method of LST retrieval from passive microwave data was developed for wide viewing zenith angles, and the LST and emissivity can be simultaneously estimated through the analysis of various atmospheric and ionosphere parameters. Three types of data, including the FengYun-3B satellite microwave radiation imager data, the multichannel Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer data, and Moon-based microwave radiation simulation data with the viewing zenith angles of 52-53 degrees, 55 degrees, and 0-90 degrees, respectively, were used to retrieve LST. Results show that the estimation accuracy of LST decreases with the increase of viewing zenith angle. The 23.8 and 36.5 GHz brightness temperature is optimum for the LST estimation under a large-scale viewing zenith angle, and the root mean square errors of the LST are 5.18, 5.44, and 4.79 K, respectively.

TI  - Sea surface salinity and the ocean structure in the tropical Indian Ocean
T2  - Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS-KNAW)
M3  - Data study
AB  - The variability of the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) is crucial to the global water cycle and heat transportation. At the seasonal time scale, the variability of the TIO is closely related to the monsoon circulation. Interannually, on the one hand, it is influenced remotely by the variability of the Pacific Ocean through atmospheric bridge and Rossby wave. On the other hand, the variability of TIO is independent of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and varies as a dipole pattern along the equator, known as the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD). In addition, the unique distribution of the TIO with shallower thermocline in the west, due to the unstable easterlies along the equator, makes the variability of the TIO differ from that in the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean with deeper thermocline in the west. However, the TIO variability is still hard to precisely predict and the difficulty is well acknowledged nowadays. To this end, the main aim of this dissertation is to better understand the seasonal and interannual variability of the TIO. Specifically, the first objective is to distinguish the relative impacts of heat flux and wind stress on the interannual variability of upper-ocean temperature in the TIO. The second objective focuses on studying the relationships among the parameters in the mixed layer and thermocline with the barrier layer thickness (BLT) in the TIO. The last objective of this dissertation is to investigate the role of sea surface salinity (SSS) in the onset of South Asian Summer Monsoon (SASM). To achieve this aim, the observation datasets including float and satellite data, reanalysis data, and simulations from a high-resolution model, are employed.In Chapter 2, we compared the ocean general circulation model (OGCM) hindcast with the reanalysis and observation data and found that they were consistent in the simulation of the climatological mean and interannual variability of the upper-ocean temperature vertical structure in the TIO. Therefore, OGCM was adopted in this study to study the variability of the TIO. Two sensitivity simulations were designed to study the relative contribution of heat flux and wind stress to the variability of TIO: one was set with only heat flux varying interannually, and another one assumed only wind stress varying interannually. The results show that the impacts of heat flux and wind stress on the interannual variability of ocean temperature in the TIO have a depth-dependent feature. Specifically, heat flux mainly dominates the interannual variability of ocean temperature above the depth of approximately 30 m in the TIO, while wind stress contributes most to the interannual variability of ocean temperature below the depth of 30 m. This depth-dependent feature has also been observed for sub-areas and different seasons in the TIO. Therefore, we define the depth where the dominant force switches from heat flux to wind stress in the TIO as the crossing depth. Shallower crossing depth indicates that heat flux only controls the interannual variability of ocean temperature near the surface while wind stress is the dominant driving force for the interannual temperature variability in the upper-ocean, such as the Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge (SCTR) and the eastern part of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IODE).In chapter 3, we assessed the driving forces for the variability of the barrier layer thickness (BLT) in TIO. The barrier layer is defined as a thinner layer between the bottom of the mixed layer and the top of the thermocline. The BLT in the TIO has significant seasonal and interannual variabilities. The results of this study show that the sea surface temperature (SST) barely contributes to the variability of BLT but the main forcing on the BLT from the mixed layer can be explained by the variability of SSS. At the seasonal time scale, the dominating drivers of the BLT variability are different in the western and eastern TIO. In the western TIO, SSS exerts a negative correlation with the BLT variability during boreal autumn, winter, and spring while shows minimal impacts on the BLT variability in summer. In the eastern TIO, the thermocline is the dominant driver for the BLT variability, and it has positive correlations with BLT in all four seasons. At the interannual time scale, the variability of BLT in the TIO is affected by the IOD and ENSO events. Particularly, in the eastern TIO, thinner BLT could be detected mainly induced by the anomalous thermocline during the positive IOD and El Nino years. In the western TIO, deepening thermocline due to El Nino induced anomalous wind stress results in thicker BLT. But the correlation between BLT and El Nino does not become weaker with the weakening relationship between thermocline and El Nino. This is because of the variation of SSS.In Chapter 4, we investigated the role of sea surface salinity anomalies (SSSAs) in the onset of the SASM. Positive SSSAs appears in the western TIO before the onset of SASM. This SSSAs has two maxima in the symmetry of the equator with one in the southern TIO and another one in the northern TIO. The location of the southern maxima corresponds to the SCTR. It is found that the SSSAs respond more sensitively to the change of the atmospheric circulation than sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs). The positive SSSAs in the SCTR, induced by the anomalous wind stress curl and associated with thinner BLT anomalies, provides a favorable environment for the decreasing SSTAs during spring. Meanwhile, this SSSAs-BLT-SSTAs process also develops in the SSSAs maxima of the northern TIO but happens later than that in the southern TIO. Therefore, this time-lag between the northern and southern TIO strengthened the north-to-south SST gradient, which in turn, promotes the northward crossing current for the onset of SASM. To conclude, this Ph.D. research primarily investigates the variability of the TIO by distinguishing the main driver of the interannual upper-ocean temperature variability, studying the relationships between SSS and thermocline with BLT at seasonal and interannual scales and discovering the role of SSS in the onset of SASM. However, more efforts are highly demanded in the near future to investigate more sophisticated air-sea interaction mechanism within the TIO. For example, the theory of crossing depth is only adapted in the area of (15°S-20°N). Thus, how to distinguish the relative impacts of heat flux and wind stress on the upper-ocean variability in the area to the south of 15°S is still to be unraveled. In addition, the role of SSS in the interannual variability of the TIO needs more precise datasets to investigate and the numerical modeling with more sophisticated air-sea interactions should be taken into consideration.

TI  - Replication Data for: Monitoring the water stress of an indoor living wall system using the "triangle method"
T2  - Harvard Dataverse
M3  - Data study
C8  - 1
AB  - Living walls are important vertical greening systems with modular pre-vegetated structures. Studies have suggested that living walls have many social benefits as an ecological engineering technique with notable potential for reconciliation ecology. Despite these benefits, there are currently no mature workflows or technologies for monitoring the health status and water stress of living wall systems. To partially fill the current knowledge gap related to water stress, we acquired thermal, multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing data from an indoor living wall in the Cloud Forest of the Gardens by the Bay, Singapore. Surface temperature (Ts) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were obtained from these data to construct a Ts-NDVI space for applying the "triangle method". A simple and effective algorithm was proposed to determine the dry and wet edges, the key components of the said method. The pixels associated with the dry and wet edges were then selected and highlighted to directly display the areas under water-stress conditions. Our results suggest that the proposed algorithm can provide a reasonable overview of the water-stress information of the living wall; therefore, our method can be simple and effective to monitor the health status of a living wall. Furthermore, our work confirms that the triangle method can be transferred from the outdoors to an indoor environment.

TI  - Using An Attention-Based LSTM Encoder-Decoder Network for Near Real-Time Disturbance Detection
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate prediction of future observations based on past data is the key to near real-time disturbance detection using satellite image time series (SITS). To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we present an attention-based long-short-term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder model in which the historical time series of a pixel is encoded with a bidirectional LSTM encoder while the future time series is produced by another LSTM decoder. An attention mechanism is integrated into the encoder-decoder model to align the input time series with the output time series and to dynamically choose the most relevant contextual information while forecasting. Based on the proposed model, we develop a framework for near real-time disturbance detection and verify its effectiveness in the case of burned area mapping. The prediction accuracy of the proposed model is evaluated using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series and compared with state-of-the-art models. Experimental results show that our model achieves the best results in terms of lower prediction error and higher model fitness. We also evaluate the disturbance detection ability of the proposed framework. The proposed approach improves the detection rate of disturbances while suppressing false alarms, and increases the temporal accuracy. We suggest that the proposed methods provide new tools for enhancing current early warning systems in real time.

TI  - Decadal vegetation succession from MODIS reveals the spatio-temporal evolution of post-seismic landsliding after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Strong earthquakes, especially in continental mountainous areas, can trigger extensive mass wasting, producing large amounts of debris that accumulates along the hillslopes or in drainage channels. The coseismic deposits and disturbed slopes are prone to be reactivated or remobilized by heavy rainfalls in the subsequent years after the earthquake. Predicting how long post-seismic landslide activity will return to the pre-earthquake level is a key to risk assessment and management. However, this is still poorly understood, and lacks quantitative prediction approach. The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake triggered an unprecedented number of landslides, creating an extraordinary natural laboratory to investigate the evolution of post-seismic landslides and their impacts on environment. Using the vegetation recovery rate as an indicator, we present the observational evidence of the post-seismic landslide evolution based on MODIS NDVI time series between 2000 and 2018. Using a simple vegetation recovery rate (VRR) function, we quantify the rate of vegetation regrowth in the Wenchuan earthquake affected area, and discuss the decaying trend of post-seismic landslide activities. Our findings show that 83% of the co-seismic landslides become inactive within a decade. The NDVI trend suggests that landslide activity may return to the pre-earthquake level within 18 years. The sensitivity of vegetation regrowth to post-seismic landsliding thus offers a great potential to improve our understanding of the spatio-temporal evolution of the post-seismic landslide activities.

TI  - The relationship between methane transport to the atmosphere and the decay of the Kara Sea ice cover: satellite data for 2003-2019
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite spectrometers operating on the outgoing long-wave IR (thermal) radiation of the Earth and placed in sun-synchronous polar orbits provide a wealth of information about Arctic methane (CH4) year-round, day and night. Their data are unique for estimating methane emissions from the warming Arctic, both for land and sea. The article analyzes concentrations of methane obtained by the AIRS spectrometer in conjunction with microwave satellite measurements of sea ice concentration. The data were filtered for cases of sufficiently high temperature contrast in the lower atmosphere. The focus is on the Kara Sea during autumn-early winter season between 2003 and January 2019. This sea underwent dramatic decline in the ice cover. This shelf zone is characterized by huge reserves of oil and natural gas (similar to 90% methane), as well as presence of sub-seabed permafrost and methane hydrates. Seasonal cycle of atmospheric methane has a minimum in early summer and a maximum in early winter. During last 16 years both summer and winter concentrations were increasing, but with different rates. Positive summer trends over the Kara Sea and over Atlantic control area were close one to another. In winter the Kara Sea methane was growing faster than over Atlantic. The methane seasonal cycle amplitude tripled from 2003 to 2019. This phenomenon was considered in terms of growing methane flux from the sea. This high trend was induced by a fast decay of the sea ice in this area with ice concentrations dropped from 95 to 20%. If the current Arctic sea cover would decline further and open water area would grow then further increase of methane concentration over the ocean may be foreseen.

AB  - Winter droughts are closely related to spring forest fires, but it is difficult to tell the time difference. Therefore, this study aimed to check the time difference between winter drought and spring forest fires in Korea. For this purpose, crosscorrelation analysis was performed on SPI data and the frequency of forest fires including forest fire damage records, VIIRS data, and MODIS data. As a result, SPI showed a three-month lag with fire damage records and VIIRS data and showed a sixmonth lag with MODIS data. However, it was reasonable to regard the time difference between drought and forest fires as three months since the fire damage records was directly recorded from field survey and the VIIRS had a higher spatial resolution than MODIS, which could identify relatively small forest fires. In conclusion, the frequency of spring forest fires was closely related to changes in precipitation over the previous three months. If the scale and scope of forest fires are analyzed by linking the fire damage records with the VIIRS data in the future, and based on this, detailed analysis of the relationship between the frequency of drought and forest fires in administrative units, it will greatly help local governments come up with policies to reduce forest fires.

T2  - TheScientificWorldJournal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key factor in numerous areas such as climate change, land use/land cover in the urban areas, and heat balance and is also a significant participant in the creation of climate models. Landsat data has given numerous possibilities to understand the land processes by means of remote sensing. The present study has been performed to identify the LST of the study region using Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite images for two time periods in order to compare the data. The study also attempted to identify and predict the role and importance of NDVI, NDBI, and the slope of the region on LST. The study concludes that the maximum and minimum temperatures of 40.44C and 20.78C were recorded during the November month whereas the maximum and minimum LST for month March has increased to 42.44C and 24.57C respectively. The result indicates that LST is inversely proportional to NDVI (-6.369) and slope (-0.077) whereas LST is directly proportional to NDBI (+14.74). Multiple linear regression model has been applied to calculate the extents of NDVI, NDBI, and slope on the LST. It concludes that the increase in vegetation and slope would result in slight decrease in temperature whereas the increase in built-up will result in a huge increase in temperature.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic Portal of the Laboratory of Satellite Oceanography of the Russian State Hydrometeorological University is an open geo-informational system designed for operational monitoring of the sea ice-ocean-atmosphere system in the Arctic. Possibilities to use the Arctic Portal for the Arctic sea ice monitoring on the basis of satellite data, as well as the types of satellite measurements suitable for studying the properties of sea ice: active and passive microwave data; data of spectral radiometers in the infrared (IR) and visible ranges are considered. Every type of satellite data has certain limitations. For the study of sea ice the most suitable are the all-season remote sensing data - measurements of microwave instruments, independent of clouds and time of a day. Existing in the world resources of the sea ice maps and satellite data on sea ice are either closed for users or limited in their informational content. Several types of satellite data are currently available on the Arctic portal: Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, 8-day averaged MODIS reflectivity data, optical and IR MODIS data of original time and spatial resolution, Norwegian Meteorological University sea ice maps, and data on consolidation of sea ice, based on passive microwave radiometer measurements. Some data is additionally available in the test mode. The effectiveness of combined use of various satellite data on the sea ice is proved by the examples of sea ice analyses.

TI  - The impact of Hospital Elder Life Program interventions, on 30-day readmission Rates of older hospitalized patients
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GERONTOLOGY AND GERIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study investigated the impact of the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP), a geriatric intervention program targeted at reducing delirium, on readmission rates. Secondary goals were to review HELP's impact on average length of stay (ALOS), discharge to the home, and falls.Design: This retrospective 3-year study reviewed inpatients age 70 and older, with one or more of six impairments: functional, renal, cognitive, sleep, visual and hearing. Patients were from a 784 bed teaching hospital in California with admissions between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2016. This was compared to a matched cohort of patients who did not receive any interventions from HELP volunteers or a HELP geriatric nurse practitioner. Data was also reviewed for impact on goals in age groups 70-85 and 85 +.Results: 2146 HELP patients with an average age of 82.1 showed improvement in 30-day readmission rates, with a readmission rate of 11.3% in the HELP group and 13.5% in the control group (n = 2704, mean 82.5). Detailed age data noted statistical significance only in the 70-85 population for readmission. ALOS was 5.6 and 6.2 days respectively in the HELP and non-HELP population. ALOS was also statistically significant across 70-85 and 85 +. Neither rates of discharge to home nor falls showed any significant improvement. Both control and intervention groups had a disproportionate number of whites and females.Conclusion: This study shows hospitals can improve patient outcomes and financial burden from 30-day read-missions and length of stay, particularly in the 70-85 age group, by implementing the Hospital Elder Life Program.

TI  - The cash crop boom in southern Myanmar: tracing land use regime shifts through participatory mapping
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest landscapes are undergoing vast transformations. Myanmar was long an exception to this trend - until recent policy reforms put economic development at the forefront. Under ambiguous land rights, commercial agriculture has spread rapidly, causing an unprecedented loss of biodiversity-rich forest. In south-eastern Myanmar, where land tenure is highly contested due to several decades of conflict, scientific evidence on these complex social-ecological processes is lacking. In the absence of past satellite data, we applied a participatory mapping approach and co-produced annual land use information with local land users between 1990 and 2017 for two case study landscapes. Results show that both landscapes have undergone a land use regime shift from small-scale farmers' shifting cultivation to plantations of rubber, betel nut, cashew, and oil palm. These changes are likely to have long-term impacts on land users' livelihoods and the environment. We call for a reconsideration of land governance arrangements and concerted land use planning that respects the rights of local land users and strengthens their role as environmental stewards. Applied with careful facilitation, participatory mapping could be an important tool to engage communities in the highly challenging process of transforming land governance to achieve more sustainable outcomes in this post-conflict context.

TI  - A Multiscale Random Forest Kernel for Land Cover Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Random forest (RF) is a popular ensemble learning method that is widely used for the analysis of remote sensing images. RF also has connections with the kernel-based method. Its tree-based structure can generate an RF kernel (RFK) that provides an alternative to common kernels such as radial basis function (RBF) in kernel-based methods such as support vector machine (SVM). Using an RFK in an SVM has been shown to outperform both RF and SVM-RBF (i.e., using an RBF kernel in an SVM) in classification tasks with a high number of features. Here, we explore new designs of RFKs for remote sensing image classification. Different RF structural parameters and characteristics are used to generate various RFKs. In particular, we explore the use of RFs depth, the number of branches between terminal nodes of trees, and the predicted class probabilities for designing and evaluating new RFK. Two depth-based kernel are proposed: an RFK at the optimal depth, and a multiscale one created by combining RFKs at multiple depths. We evaluate the proposed kernels within an SVM by classifying a time series of Worldview-2 images, and by designing experiments having a various number of features. Benchmarking the new RFKs against the RBF shows that the newly proposed kernels outperform the RBF kernel for the experiments with a higher number of features. For the experiments with a lower number of features, RFKs and RBF kernel perform at about the same level. Benchmarking against the standard RF also shows the general outperformance of the proposed RFKs in an SVM. In all experiments, the best results are obtained with a depth-optimized RFK.

AB  - Landsliding is considered as one of the major natural hazards that endanger human life and property, particularly in mountainous regions which have high precipitation rate and are seismically active. This paper identifies landslide-prone areas in Murree, a northern area of Pakistan and presents landslide susceptibility mapping technique using Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing. The landslide triggering factors considered in this study are elevation, slope, geology (lithology), land use and land cover, seismotectonic settings and vegetation index. A spatial database using Geographic Information System (GIS) was developed. Slope was derived from topographical datasets; lithology and land use/land cover from geological datasets and vegetation index are from Landsat 8 imagery. Then finally, by using weight of evidence (WoE) method, landslide susceptibility map was developed. The final landslide susceptibility map has five classes from very low to very high landslide susceptibility. The results indicate that though only 8% of the study area falls in very high susceptible zone, it has a high land use percentage. This poses a serious threat to infrastructure and human life. Results of this study would be helpful in disaster risk management, geohazard studies and construction and regional planning.

AB  - Indus River is one of the largest rivers of Asia that runs through four countries (China, India, Afghanistan, Pakistan) and supports multiple economic activities in the region. Sindh Province of Pakistan is at the tail-end of the River. River monitoring, though essential to manage it well, is a necessity for the tailenders to ascertain the availability of water and to distribute it among its users. The Sindh province depends mostly on the Indus River supply to meet its demand. The River irrigates Sindh 2540 hectares culturable area. Besides agriculture, industrial and domestic water users also greatly rely on the river water supply. The optimum management of the River necessitates an extensive network of gauge stations. Whereas, the Indus River has minimal gauging network. This paper presents the potential of satellite radar altimetry by using Sentinel 3A data to monitor river water levels. This paper validates the satellite data by comparing them with the in-situ data near the Guddu and Sukkur Barrages. The results showed an excellent agreement between the two datasets with correlations higher than 0.9, and the root mean square difference (RMSD) less than 45 cm for both locations.

AB  - ZAJC, Neza. St. Maximus the Greek (Arta, ca. 1470 - Moscow, 1556) and His Byzantine Worldview as His Contribution to Slavic Intellectual Ethical Encoding. The paper investigates the foundations of the ethical values that shaped the deeply personal theology of St. Maximus the Greek. By providing the original evidence from his writings (as well as from manuscripts) and the precise biographical context, the author reveals significant disagreement between Maxim's Russian co-speakers and his previous philological, ascetic and monastic experience, concerning the Byzantine system of education, especially the Byzantine consideration of divine wisdom and human knowledge. In particular, this paper analyses Maxim's understanding of (Greek) grammar. It also discusses the question of `the Jesus prayer' and its possible literal traces in the writings of Maxim the Greek. In conclusion, it seems that Maxim the Greek created a completely unique ethical system of intellectual knowledge that should be connected to the Athonite prayer and liturgical practice.

TI  - Retrieval of Surface Soil Moisture From Sentinel-1 Time Series for Reclamation of Wetland Sites
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a key factor in the reclamation of wetland habitats. Understanding the distribution and relative amount of water can be critical in reintroducing trees and grasses to disturbed soils. Soil moisture is also one of the main factors affecting microwave radar backscatter from the ground; while there are other factors determining backscatter levels (for instance, surface roughness, vegetation, and incident angle), relative variations in soil moisture can be estimated using space-based, high resolution, multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR). In this work, relative soil moisture indicators are derived from a time series of Sentinel-1 SAR data over previously mined oil sands in Alberta, Canada. The algorithm provides a relative assessment of soil moisture and requires calibration over wet and dry periods. An evaluation of the soil moisture product is validated using in situ measurements at multiple sites with observations showing agreement from May to August. Comparisons with precipitation records show that SAR derived surface soil moisture is influenced by discreet precipitation events; that is, rainfall that is coincident with the satellite observation reduces the effectiveness of the measurement. The resulting algorithm controls for rain events by including local weather records to adjust estimates based on the known precipitation.

AB  - The condition of the vegetation cover in Moscow was estimated using the NDVI vegetation index. To construct synthetic images, Landsat 5, 7, and 8 multispectral satellite images taken during the active vegetation period from 1999 to 2019 were used.Index indicators are calculated for pine forests located in protected areas, in urban parks among high-rise buildings and inside private low-rise building districts. The results showed differences in the NDVI values between these three types of birch forests, however, temporal trends show similar dynamics of changes in the physiological state of trees over the studied period.

TI  - Why didn't Russia become a constitutional monarchy in the XIX century?
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the main problems associated with the possibility of implementing a constitutional alternative in Russia in the XIX century. The authors consider the prerequisites for the development of constitutional projects during this period, including their regularity or randomness, and relationship with previous stages of development of the Russian statehood. They pay particular attention to the subjective factor, i.e. personal views and worldview of the Russian emperors as the main condition for the implementation of the constitutional alternative to the development of the country. The reigns of Alexander I and Alexander II, who were either the initiators of the development of constitutional projects (Alexander I) or did not prevent it (Alexander II), are the focus of attention. The comparative analysis of the main constitutional projects of the XIX century is carried out in this article: of the Letter of Commendation to the Russian people in 1801, the project of M.M. Speransky in 1809, the Charter Diploma of the Russian Empire in 1818-1820, the project of P.A. Valuev in 1863, the grand prince Konstantin Nikolaevich in 1866 and 1880, the P.A. Shuvalov in 1874 and of the M.T. Loris-Melikov in 1880-1881.The projects of the time period of Alexander II are much more moderate than of the epoch of Alexander I and they can be recognized as constitutional ones with a great stretch It was a step backwards in the development of Russian constitutionalism. This is explained by a subjective factor: much more moderate political views of Alexander II and his greater commitment to the autocratic tradition inherited from his father. In conclusion, there are the reasons for the lack of implementation of the constitutional alternative in Russia in the XIX century in this article, they are the following: peculiarities of the social structure of the Russian society, narrowness of the social base of the constitutional reforms, lack of understanding and disinterestedness of the majority of the population in their implementation and necessity, indecision of the emperors.

AB  - Navigation behaviour in nature is based on data obtained from perception of the terrain where movement occurs. The aim of this work is to study the influence of visual factors on the flight of birds over medium distances (about 10 km). In this study, we propose a method for probabilistic analysis of pigeon flights over combined countryside and urban terrain, based on surface flow simulation. Z-value - an altitude analogue that describes the characteristic gradient of the flow - is calculated as a function of "landscape complexity" based on the density of significant landscape objects. The calculated probabilistic model is compared with data on GPS-tracks of untrained and trained pigeons. As a result, significant features of terrain that determine sustainable locations in pigeon flights are identified. In the study, visual characteristics of the territories over which pigeons flew are calculated using remote sensing data from open sources, and spatial data are processed using the geographical information system QGIS.

AB  - Aerosols, particulate matters and air pollution are significant atmospheric issues in the Southeast Asia (SEA) countries particularly Malaysia. Despite their importance, data to investigate their spatio-temporal variation, estimating their abundance and modelling the trend are not widely available due to financial constraints and technical expertise. Remote sensing data are alternative solution to the limited data available from ground stations. One of the latest remotely sensed Aerosol Optical depth (AOD) data available is from Himawari-8 satellite that provides high temporal resolution data (every 10 minutes) at moderate spatial resolution of 5 km. Nevertheless, the robustness of these data for the tropical region has not yet been validated yet. This study aimed at assessing the performance of Himawari-8 AOD L2 product by (i) comparing its absolute AOD values against AOD retrieved from AERONET stations and (ii) analysing the spatial and temporal patterns of the AOD data. The AERONET data were averaged for +/- 5 min of the Himawari-8 overpass and matched to each other using statistical measures i.e. Correlation, Root mean square error (RMSE), Relative bias (RB) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Preliminary results of the analysis provided a coefficient of determination (R2) value =0.31, RMSE =0.16, and MAE = 0.15. The Himawari-8 AOD product is found to be overestimated the AOD values by 24.19%. Nevertheless, Himawari-8 AOD L2 product is able to exhibit similar spatial and temporal patterns compared to other remotely sensed AOD data such as that of MODIS. The high temporal resolution of Himawari data will facilitate frequent monitoring of air pollution in this region.

TI  - Schistosomiasis, strongyloidiasis and Chagas disease: the leading imported neglected tropical diseases in Italy
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In recent years, an increasing number of individuals affected by neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) have been observed in Italy, due to migration, international travels and climate changes. Reliable data on the current NTD epidemiology in Italy and the health system preparedness on this issue are not available.Methods We report the results of a survey on selected NTDs (schistosomiasis, strongyloidiasis, echinococcosis, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, cysticercosis, filariasis and scabies) in nine Italian sentinel centres, in order to investigate their occurrence throughout the country and identify which ones are a priority for public health interventions, development of protocols for case management, and training activities. To explore the preparedness of the centres, we investigate the availability of specific diagnostic tools and drugs, needed for the management of the most common NTDs. We also reviewed and summarized the available national policies, recommendations and guidelines on NTDs in Italy.Results Overall, 4123 NTDs cases were diagnosed in nine Italian centres within a 7-year period (2011-2017). Schistosomiasis and strongyloidiasis were the most common NTDs, accounting for about one-third each of all the diagnosed cases, followed by Chagas disease. The number of cases showed a significant trend to increase over time, mainly due to foreign-born subjects. Serology for Schistosoma spp. and Strongyloides stercoralis was available in seven and five centres, respectively. Agar plate stool culture for S. stercoralis was available in three sites. Ivermectin and praziquantel were always available in six centres. Six national policies, recommendations and guidelines documents were available, but for the most part, they are not fully implemented yet.Conclusions This survey showed how some NTDs, such as schistosomiasis and strongyloidiasis, are becoming more common in Italy, due to multiple components. A list of seven key actions was proposed, in order to improve diagnosis, management and control of NTDs in Italy.

AB  - Global soil moisture products retrieved from various sensors onboard satellites are becoming readily available. However, validation of such products is a crucial step to ensure their reliability. In-situ measurements, which provide the most accurate soil moisture estimates, are often used as reference dataset, but they are limited in number. The GROW Observatory (GROW) was initiated to demonstrate that a 'Citizens' Observatory' (CO) can provide and utilise unprecedented amounts of data. We present GROW as a case study and demonstrate, for the first time, the use of crowdsourced observations to assess the temporal and spatial consistency of various satellite-derived soil moisture products. In particular, we provide evidence of the added value to Earth Observation, thanks to (i) the high number of sensors deployed, covering a wide range of land use, environmental, and climatic conditions, and (ii) the unique spatial density in GROW. Our results confirmed that SMAP and ESA CCI SM can better capture the temporal dynamics compared to the other products investigated. We found high uncertainties due to the spatial mismatch between in-situ and satellite observations, not only for coarse scale but also for high-resolution soil moisture products. This finding highlights the importance of crowdsourced observations, which have the potential to reduce representativeness errors. Finally, a preliminary analysis of the spatial consistency of Sentinel-1 soil moisture showed a poor agreement against GROW data. We conclude presenting the challenges and the steps that will follow this preliminary analysis, as well as design guidelines for COs to meaningfully contribute to Earth Observation.

AB  - To monitor and manage the changes in the land use and land cover, is vital the process of classification; machine learning offers the potential for effective and efficient classification of remotely sensed imagery. However, not many articles have explicitly dealt with the effects of image fusion on land-cover classification accuracy. Although some studies have compared thematic mapping accuracy produced using different classification algorithms, there are no currently many studies that utilize image fusion for assessing different machine learning algorithms for classification purposes. The main aim of this study is to compare different machine learning algorithm for pixel classification of imagery fused with sensors Sentinel-2A and PlanetScope. The method used for image fusion is a variational model, the high spectral resolution of Sentinel-2A imagery and the high spatial resolution of PlanetScope imagery was fused; the machine learning algorithms evaluated are six that have been widely used in the remote sensing community: DT (Decision Tree), Boosted DT, RF (Random Forest), SVM radial base (Support Vector Machine), ANN (Artificial Neural Networks), KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors), for the classification four spectral indices (NDVI, NDM[, NDBI, MSAVI) were included, derived of the image fusion. The results show that the highest accuracy was produced by SVM radial base (OA: 87.8%, Kappa: 87%) respect to the other methods, nevertheless the methods RF, Boosted DT and KNN shown to be very powerful methods for classification of the study area.

TI  - Tree Water Status in Apple Orchards Measured by Means of Land Surface Temperature and Vegetation Index (LST-NDVI) Trapezoidal Space Derived from Landsat 8 Satellite Images
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the split window (SW) method was applied for land surface temperature (LST) retrieval using Landsat 8 in two apple orchards (Glindow, Altlandsberg). Four images were acquired during high demand of irrigation water from July to August 2018. After pre-processing images, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and LST were calculated by red, NIR, and thermal bands. The results were validated by interpolated infrared thermometer (IRT) measurements using the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method. In the next step, the temperature vegetation index (TVDI) was calculated based on the trapezoidal NDVI/LST space to determine the water status of apple trees in the case studies. Results show good agreement between interpolated LST using IRT measurements and remotely sensed LST calculation using SW in all satellite overpasses, where the absolute mean error was between 0.08 to 4.00 K and root mean square error (RMSE) values ranged between 0.71 and 4.23 K. The TVDI spatial distribution indicated that the trees suffered from water stress on 7 and 23 July and 8 August 2018 in Glindow apple orchard with the mean value of 0.69, 0.57, and 0.73, whereas in the Altlandsberg orchard on 17 August, the irrigation system compensated the water deficit as indicated by the TVDI value of 0.34. Moreover, a negative correlation between TVDI and vegetation water content (VWC) with correlation coefficient (r) of -0.81 was observed. The corresponding r for LST and VWC was equal to -0.89, which shows the inverse relation between water status and temperature-based indices. The results indicate that the LST and/or TVDI calculation using the proposed methods can be effectively applied for monitoring tree water status and support irrigation management in orchards using Landsat 8 satellite images without requiring ground measurements.

AB  - In this paper, an in-depth study is presented regarding an innovative methodology on which the authors have invested several months of research, as evidenced by their recent references on similar topics. A semi-automatic classification of the buildings in urban area is analyzed, when Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data are combined to Very High Resolution (VHR) WorldView-2 (WV-2) images and an Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) technique is used. The aim of the data fusion from different sensor types is to realize an effective and limited-cost product for protection and management of environmental and natural resources, to meet the needs of many institutions, such as municipalities, provinces and regions, and for applications in the context of risk analysis, territorial planning and local development. This procedure may be extended to large areas of the territory, resulting into a reduction of the processing time for the building detection, with respect to a human visual or manual photo-interpretation. Interesting results and further implications will be presented and discussed.

TI  - Application of satellite data in the quantitative assessment of evapotranspiration in northeastern Poland
T2  - GEOLOGICAL QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe a method of calculating one of the basic phenomena influenced by groundwater recharge, namely evapotranspiration (ET). The Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) algorithm was applied to calculate actual evapotranspiration (ETa), being modified to include spatiotemporal changes of substrate humidity and so referred to as mSSSEBop. Calculations were performed within the Szkwa and Rozoga River catchments (NE Poland). Quantitative ETa assessment was based on the analysis of Landsat satellite images, hydrometeorological and hydrogeological data. The results obtained for the original SSEBop algorithm and the modified mSSEBop one were compared with the water balance and data from a MOD16A2 dataset. The calculated water balance gave ETa values close to results using mSSEBop (with differences of 9-54 mm/year). In the case of the original algorithm, differences were in range of 42-218 mm/year. When compared with MOD16A2 data, the differences were within the range of -16.7 to 23.2 mm/8 days, with the mSSEBop algorithm giving on average lower ETa sums (similar to 14%) than MOD16A2 while SSEBop gave results higher than MOD16A2 by similar to 12%. The studies performed indicate that the method presented, using satellite data, gives a reliable, spatial and temporal ETa assessment for the mid latitudes.

TI  - The comic in Udmurt folklore and artistic literature of the late XIX - early XX centuries
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the comic is one of the ways of artistic reflection of reality. It shows the peculiarities of the national worldview at the certain period of history. To generalize the stages of evolution of the comic in literature, to establish cause-and-effect relationships of development of genres and forms of the comic, it is necessary to identify its origins. The article discusses the prerequisites for the origin of the comic in Udmurt literature and their originality at the initial stage of its development.Objective: to identify the origins and features of formation of comic genres in Udmurt literature in the aspect of continuity of traditions of oral folk art.Research materials: satirical and humorous works of Udmurt folklore and the initial stage of development of national literature.Results and novelty of the research: prerequisites of the comic in Udmurt literature are contained in laughing culture of the people, in rituals and rites that perform a magical function. An important source of the origin of literary comic genres was the genres of oral folk art with a dominant social function. A significant role was also played by the translation and cultural activities of the enlighteners, as well as the influence of older literatures. Based on the genres of oral and poetic creativity (comic, satirical, dance and game songs, fairy tales, fables, madyos, takmak) and taking into account, first of all, the experience of Russian literature, comic works of various genres are created in the Udmurt language.For the first time the article considers poorly studied works of Udmurt comic literature of the late XIX - early XX centuries. These are works of different genres of folklore origins: verses, poems, plays, essays, stories, novellas, feuilletons, parables, fables, madyos, new takmak, pamphlets, "light tales", etc. The educational theme of the first works gradually acquires a social and socio-political meaning complicating the poetics of the comic.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements reveal ground deformation following a rainfall event in the Samail Ophiolite in Oman. Due to the absence of usual tectonic and hydrologic forcings, we hypothesize that deformation is a result of chemical reactions and associated fracturing in the subsurface. When the ultramafic rocks in the ophiolite are exposed to air and water, they undergo carbonation which increases the rock volume and fractures the rock, resulting in observable ground surface uplift. A pilot study using 41 Sentinel-1 SAR images between 2016/11/15 and 2018/03/22 shows up to 4 cm of uplift in the several weeks following a major rainfall event, suggesting that carbonation is limited by rainfall. The uplift signal eventually recedes back to the noise level thus a longer time series with more rainfall events will better confirm this hypothesis. An eventual InSAR time series from 2015-present and an associated groundwater table model may improve the current estimates of CO2 captured by the carbonation, and its rate, in ultramafic rocks.

AB  - With the continuous innovation of modern science and technology, automation technology and information resources have become the main characteristics of the application of today's cutting-edge technology. Gradually, it is found that remote sensing technology can be used as the main way to obtain data resources based on the background of big data. It is more and more widely used in social and economic development. The diversification of imaging methods and the enhancement of remote sensing data acquisition ability lead to the diversification and mass of remote sensing data. The scale of data obtained by remote sensing technology shows a growing trend. This trend will inevitably put forward higher development requirements for the automatic analysis and mining of big data. Starting from the content of remote sensing big data, this paper makes a brief analysis of data automatic search and data mining technology, and finally gets the corresponding conclusion.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the LandsatTM/ETM+/OLI remote sensing data (30 m resolution) of the Shule River basin in the past 20 years, the land use data was obtained by interpretation. By using Erdas9.2 and ArcGIS10.3 software, the land-use types were divided into 6 primary landscape types and 25 secondary landscape types, and the spatial database of watershed land use was established. By using GIS spatial analysis technology, transfer matrix, land use dynamics and many other spatial-temporal statistical analysis methods, the transformation process and temporal and spatial pattern analysis of land-use types in river basin in recent 20 years were carried out, with results showing that: In the past 20 years, different degrees of changes have taken place in land use in the Shule River basin. On the whole, the area of cultivated land, woodland, grassland and urban and rural industrial and mining residents increased, among which grassland increased the most, with an annual increase rate of 0.33%. The area of cultivated land increased, with an annual growth rate of 0.0959%. While water area and unused land decreased, with an annual decline rate of 0.4490%. The decrease of water area was the smallest, with an annual decline rate of 0.0122%. There are obvious differences in the speed and type of change in water area and unused land. The hot spot of land use type transformation in the basin is the middle reaches oasis, mainly Dunhuang, Guazhou and Yumen counties (cities).

TI  - Assessment of the Long-Term High-Spatial-Resolution Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) Surface Longwave Radiation Product Using Ground Measurements
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we comprehensively assessed the newly released long-term high-spatial-resolution Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) surface longwave (LW) radiation product using site measurements of LW fluxes. In total, three years of ground-measured LW fluxes (surface longwave upward radiation (LWUP), surface longwave downward radiation (LWDN), and surface longwave net radiation (LWNR) collected from 141 sites in six independent networks (AmeriFlux, AsiaFlux, BSRN, CEOP, HiWATER-MUSOEXE, and TIPEX-III) are used to evaluate the GLASS LW radiation product. These sites cover various land cover types, surface elevations, and climatic types. According to the evaluation results, the biases are -4.33, -3.77, and 0.70 W/m(2) and the RMSEs are 18.15, 26.94, and 26.70 W/m(2) for clear-sky LWUP, LWDN, and LWNR, respectively. The GLASS LW radiation product performs well in climate-change-sensitive areas such as poleward areas, semiarid areas, and the "third pole", namely, the Tibetan Plateau. The accuracy of the GLASS LW product is higher or comparable to that of available LW products and studies but has a high-spatial-resolution of 1 km and a time span of 19 years. In conclusion, the overall accuracy of the clear-sky GLASS LW radiation product can satisfy the requirements of the hydrological, meteorological, and agricultural research communities on a global scale. We will continue to improve the retrieval algorithms and update the products accordingly.

TI  - Intercalibration of FY-3C MWRI Against GMI Using the Ocean Microwave Radiative Transfer Model
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work addresses the intercalibration of the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) on the Chinese second-generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellite Fengyun 3C (FY-3C) against the Microwave Imager (GMI) on the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) <italic>Core Observatory</italic>, in which a modified Double Difference (DD) method is developed and the Brightness Temperatures (TBs) in FY-3C MWRI and GMI channels are simulated using the ocean microwave Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) fed with the fifth generation of European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) data. With the modified DD method, the intercalibration of FY-3C MWRI in 2017 are obtained. The results show that the MWRI observations are underestimated, especially for the low frequency channels. The calibration biases (mean of DDs) in FY-3C MWRI channels are temperature dependent, and decrease with the frequency increment. The in-orbit calibration of the MWRI descending (MWRID) data is 1 & x007E;2 K worse than that of the MWRI ascending (MWRIA) data. At the TBs of standard scene defined by the Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System (GSICS), the calibration errors (mean of DDs & x00B1; standard deviation at the mean) of MWRIA data in January 2017 are & x2212;6.7 & x00B1;0.4 K, & x2212;8.3 & x00B1;0.8 K, & x2212;3.0 & x00B1;0.7 K, & x2212;1.9 & x00B1;1.0 K, & x2212;2.5 & x00B1;1.1 K, & x2212;3.9 & x00B1;0.8 K, & x2212;2.1 & x00B1;1.5 K, & x2212;1.5 & x00B1;1.0 K and & x2212;0.4 & x00B1;2.3 K in the 10V/H, 18V/H, 23V, 36V/H and 89V/H channels, respectively, while the calibration errors of MWRID data in January 2017 are & x2212;7.6 & x00B1;0.8 K, & x2212;9.1 & x00B1;1.2 K, & x2212;4.4 & x00B1;0.8 K, & x2212;2.9 & x00B1;1.3 K, & x2212;3.6 & x00B1;1.2 K, & x2212;5.1 & x00B1;0.8 K, & x2212;2.6 & x00B1;1.4 K, & x2212;2.5 & x00B1;1.1 K and & x2212;1.2 & x00B1;2.5 K in the nine channels, respectively. Although calibration biases exist, the in-orbit calibration of FY-3C MWRI is generally stable in 2017. The results of the modified DD method are consistent with that of the DD method. The modified DD method is promising to be applied to the intercalibration with both target and reference radiometers on polar-orbiting satellites.

AB  - Lake Baikal is the world's deepest lake and declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The most severe environmental problem facing the lake is the impact of water level regime fluctuation related to natural and human-caused factors. A core region under study is selected a territory of the Angarsky Sor - a shallow bay located in the Northeast of the lake. The research into a changing water content of the territory is based on imaginary provided by the Landsat-8 satellite. The study is focused on photographs taken in the high-water summer 2014 and in the law water level year 2015. The outcome of performed calculations is that an area of marshy and excessively wet regions has decreased more than 1.5 times, whereas there is a slight increase in the area of droughty waterless zones. Principal changes have been detected in the northern and north-eastern part of the Sor territory. Geoinformation technologies and remote sensing methods are considered to be efficient for the monitoring water level fluctuations, changes in the water surface area and vegetation mantle state of land ecosystems in the Sor region, what is essential for the preserving unique wetlands of the Angarsky Sor.

TI  - Improving Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Remote Sensing-Based Rice Nitrogen Nutrition Index Prediction with Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimizing nitrogen (N) management in rice is crucial for China's food security and sustainable agricultural development. Nondestructive crop growth monitoring based on remote sensing technologies can accurately assess crop N status, which may be used to guide the in-season site-specific N recommendations. The fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing is a low-cost, easy-to-operate technology for collecting spectral reflectance imagery, an important data source for precision N management. The relationships between many vegetation indices (VIs) derived from spectral reflectance data and crop parameters are known to be nonlinear. As a result, nonlinear machine learning methods have the potential to improve the estimation accuracy. The objective of this study was to evaluate five different approaches for estimating rice (Oryza sativa L.) aboveground biomass (AGB), plant N uptake (PNU), and N nutrition index (NNI) at stem elongation (SE) and heading (HD) stages in Northeast China: (1) single VI (SVI); (2) stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR); (3) random forest (RF); (4) support vector machine (SVM); and (5) artificial neural networks (ANN) regression. The results indicated that machine learning methods improved the NNI estimation compared to VI-SLR and SMLR methods. The RF algorithm performed the best for estimating NNI (R-2 = 0.94 (SE) and 0.96 (HD) for calibration and 0.61 (SE) and 0.79 (HD) for validation). The root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 0.09, and the relative errors were <10% in all the models. It is concluded that the RF machine learning regression can significantly improve the estimation of rice N status using UAV remote sensing. The application machine learning methods offers a new opportunity to better use remote sensing data for monitoring crop growth conditions and guiding precision crop management. More studies are needed to further improve these machine learning-based models by combining both remote sensing data and other related soil, weather, and management information for applications in precision N and crop management.

TI  - Generating High Resolution LAI Based on a Modified FSDAF Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important parameter for monitoring the physical and biological processes of vegetation canopy. Due to the constraints of cloud contamination, snowfall, and instrument conditions, most of the current satellite remote sensing LAI products have lower resolution that cannot satisfy the needs of vegetation remote sensing application in areas of high heterogeneity. We proposed a new model to generate high resolution LAI, by combining linear pixel unmixing and the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (FSDAF) method. This method derived the input data of FSDAF by downscaling the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data with a linear spectral mixture model. Through the improved input parameters of the algorithm, the fusion of MODIS LAI and LAI at Landsat spatial resolution estimated by Support Vector Regression model was realized. The fusion accuracy of generated LAI data was validated based on Sentinel-2 LAI products. The results showed that strong correlation between predicted LAI and Sentinel-2 LAI in sample sites was observed with higher correlation coefficients and lower Root Mean Square Error. Compared to the simulation results of FSDAF, the modified FSDAF model showed higher accuracy and reflected more spatial details in the boundary areas of different land cover types.

TI  - Vegetation Land Use/Land Cover Extraction From High-Resolution Satellite Images Based on Adaptive Context Inference
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, automatic extraction of multi-context and multi-scale land use/land cover vegetation from high-resolution remote sensing images is tackled, aiming to solve typical challenges in classifying remote sensing images at a pixel level. To solve small inter-class differences and large intra-class differences between the vegetation and background, we introduce a vegetation-feature-sensitive focus perception (FP) module. Considering the intrinsic properties of vegetation objects, we established an adaptive context inference (ACI) model under a supervised setting that includes a context model to represent relationships between a center pixel and its neighbors under semantic constraints, as well as the spatial structures of vegetation features. Comparative experiments on the ZY-3 and Gaofen Image Dataset (GID) datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed automatic vegetation extraction model against the baseline Deeplab v3 + model. Taking precision, kappa coefficient, mean intersection over union (miou), precision rate, and F1-score as the evaluation indexes, the results showed an improvement in the precision by at least 1.44% and miou by 2.47%, over the baseline Deeplab v3 + model. In addition, the ACI module improved the precision and miou by 2% and 3.88%, and the FP module improved the precision and miou by 1.13% and 1.65%. These results and statistics of these comprehensive experiments illustrated that our adaptive and effective vegetation extraction model could satisfy different requirements of land use/land cover mapping applications.

TI  - Grass Biomass Inversion Based on Landsat 8 Spectral Derived Data Classification System
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of forage biomass is of great significance for the rational use of grassland resources and monitoring of livestock load balance, and it is a key indicator for evaluating the sustainable development of grassland ecosystems and grassland resources. The rapid and non-destructive study of large-area vegetation biomass estimation based on Landsat remote sensing technology has been widely used. Most of the current researches are based on single variable or several commonly used vegetation indices to construct inversion models. These indices often cannot reflect the physical and chemical characteristics of vegetation in-many aspects. In this paper, the classification systems of different Landsat8-derived data were constructed by their corresponding physicochemical characteristics of vegetation and intersectional pattern with plants. A multivariable nonlinear biomass estimation - model based on stochastic gradient boosting algorithm was proposed and the model estimation results were discussed with different combinations of derived data categories. The program feasibility study was carried out with Haiyan County in Qinghai Province as the study area. The results showed that the Landsat8-derived data reflected the physical and chemical characteristics of vegetation mainly from the aspects of vegetation greenness, yellowness, coverage, moisture content, texture characteristics and elimination of atmospheric disturbance and soil background interference(7 subcategories). On the other hand, these data can also be summarized into three categories: direct factors (greenness, yellowness, coverage, moisture content), indirect factors (eliminating atmospheric interference and eliminating soil background interference), and spatial factors (texture characteristics). The derived data categories have obvious complementarity. The direct factor (GNDVI, TCW, NDTI, NDSVI, TCD)-indirect factor (SAVI, VARI)-space factor(Mean_B3, Mean_B6, Hom_II, Dis_B5) model had the best estimation accuracy, R-2 and R-2 reached 0. 88; the RMSE was 141. 00 g . m(-2), however the single direct factor model estimates result was the worst. Compared with the results of six typical biomass estimation models, the proposed method had obvious advantages. Compared with the univariate models, R-2 increased by 42%similar to 60%, RMSE decreased by more than 47%, R-cv(2) increased by 31%similar to 53%, and RMSEcv decreased by more than 29%; Compared with the multivariate models, R-2 increased by 29%similar to 42%, RMSE decreased by more than 35%; and increased by 2%similar to 18%, RMSEcv decreased by more than 2%. In addition, the proposed model also had some effect in eliminatingoversaturation problem. In summary, this paper uses Landsat8 data to construct an inversion model from the perspective of reflecting different physical and chemical characteristics of vegetation to achieve accurate estimation of forage biomass, which has important guiding significance for the real-time monitoring of pastage growth and the sustainable use and management of grassland resources. The research results can also provide reference and reference for future large-area regional grassland dynamic monitoring and other agricultural research.

TI  - Gadolinium-doped Au@prussian blue nanoparticles as MR/SERS bimodal agents for dendritic cell activating and tracking
T2  - THERANOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In vivo tracking of dendritic cell (DC) migration to the lymphatic system is essential for evaluating the outcome of DC-based immunotherapies. Novel multimodal imaging strategies with high analytical performance are urgently needed to supply complementary information about the migration and colonization of DCs. In this study, we designed a bimodal imaging agent, namely Au@Prussian blue-Gd@ovalbumin nanoparticles (APG@OVA NPs), for activating DCs and real-time tracking of DC migration process by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Moreover, the distribution of the colonized DCs in the lymphatic system was profiled at the single-cell levels based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique.Methods: In this strategy, PBs as cyanide (CN)-bridged coordination blocks were assembled onto the gold nanoparticles core to provide SERS signal in the Raman-silent region (1800 and 2800 cm(-1)), which could avoid background signal interference. The doping Gd3+ located in the lattice of PB enables the MRI ability with high relaxivity of the probe. Ovalbumin, an egg allergen, was used as an antigen to activate DCs due to its immunological properties. The prepared APG@OVA NP agents were used to activate DCs with high efficacy and to track their migration and distribution in vivo through SERS/MR bimodal imaging.Results: The APG@OVA NP agents could not only enable DC activating and labeling, but also achieve real-time monitoring of DC migration in vivo and accurate profiling of DC distribution in the lymphatic system. MR imaging indicated the time-dependent migration of the APG@OVA NP-labeled DCs from the footpad to the sentinel lymph node. The background-free Raman mapping of the lymph node tissue slice demonstrated that the activated DCs have successfully colonized to the sentinel lymph node.Conclusion: Concerning the high activating efficacy, dual complementary imaging readouts, and low biological toxicity, the APG@OVA NPs act as high-performance tracking agents for DC-based immunotherapies.

AB  - Field collection of permafrost vegetation and seasonal thaw depth measurements are a time consuming and labor intensive procedure. To address this, in this study we assessed the capacity of airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR data for upscaling in-situ point data to map vegetation and summer thaw depth at an experimental site near Fairbanks, Alaska, USA. The site represents roughly three quarters of the most common vegetation in the boreal and taiga permafrost zones. An overall accuracy of 93% was achieved for mapping five different vegetation types, and a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.66 was produced for thaw depth modeling using a machine learning algorithm when two remote sensing data sources were combined. Object-based vegetation and thaw depth maps were produced. This study demonstrates that fine spatial resolution hyperspectral data could be valuable for permafrost characterization, while the contribution from LiDAR was marginal at the testing site.

TI  - Improved Remote Sensing Image Classification Based on Multi-Scale Feature Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When extracting land-use information from remote sensing imagery using image segmentation, obtaining fine edges for extracted objects is a key problem that is yet to be solved. In this study, we developed a new weight feature value convolutional neural network (WFCNN) to perform fine remote sensing image segmentation and extract improved land-use information from remote sensing imagery. The WFCNN includes one encoder and one classifier. The encoder obtains a set of spectral features and five levels of semantic features. It uses the linear fusion method to hierarchically fuse the semantic features, employs an adjustment layer to optimize every level of fused features to ensure the stability of the pixel features, and combines the fused semantic and spectral features to form a feature graph. The classifier then uses a Softmax model to perform pixel-by-pixel classification. The WFCNN was trained using a stochastic gradient descent algorithm; the former and two variants were subject to experimental testing based on Gaofen 6 images and aerial images that compared them with the commonly used SegNet, U-NET, and RefineNet models. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score of the WFCNN were higher than those of the other models, indicating certain advantages in pixel-by-pixel segmentation. The results clearly show that the WFCNN can improve the accuracy and automation level of large-scale land-use mapping and the extraction of other information using remote sensing imagery.

TI  - First observation of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide from the Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument onboard the GaoFen-5 satellite.
T2  - Light, science & applications
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) is the first Chinese satellite-borne UV-Vis spectrometer aiming to measure the distribution of atmospheric trace gases on a global scale. The EMI instrument onboard the GaoFen-5 satellite was launched on 9 May 2018. In this paper, we present the tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical column density (VCD) retrieval algorithm dedicated to EMI measurement. We report the first successful retrieval of tropospheric NO2 VCD from the EMI instrument. Our retrieval improved the original EMI NO2 prototype algorithm by modifying the settings of the spectral fit and air mass factor calculations to account for the on-orbit instrumental performance changes. The retrieved EMI NO2 VCDs generally show good spatiotemporal agreement with the satellite-borne Ozone Monitoring Instrument and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (correlation coefficient R of ~0.9, bias <50%). A comparison with ground-based MAX-DOAS (Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) observations also shows good correlation with an R of 0.82. The results indicate that the EMI NO2 retrieval algorithm derives reliable and precise results, and this algorithm can feasibly produce stable operational products that can contribute to global air pollution monitoring.

AB  - The infrared observation sensors aboard remote sensing satellites play an important role in the applications of crop yield estimation, environmental protection, land resources survey, disaster monitoring, etc. But infrared remote sensing data is always in low resolution due to hardware limitations. It is a high cost-effective choice to improve the spatial resolution of infrared remote sensing data through super-resolution (SR) algorithm. Deep learning methods have made great breakthroughs in super-resolution of natural images. In this paper, we comparably study five recently popular supervised-deep-learning-based single image SR models for the purpose of super-resolving infrared images, including SRGAN, ESRGAN, LapSRN, RCAN, and SRFBN. We first test the performance of models trained by natural images on infrared remote sensing images to obtain a benchmark, and then specially fine-tune the SR models using infrared images of Landsat8 in a transfer-learning manner. We evaluate the performance of all these fine-tuned models on infrared images with three indicators including PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE. The experimental results show that the SRFBN model achieves the best generalization ability and SR performance. Therefore, we suggest using SRFBN for super-resolution reconstruction of single infrared remote sensing image in applications.

AB  - Nowadays remote sensing image classification plays an important role in various applications and has become an active research topic. A variety of approaches have been proposed for image classification, especially based on convolutional neural networks(CNN). However, although many methods have achieved good accuracy, their network structure is very large and the training parameters are considerable, which affect the overall performance. In this paper, we present a transfer learning method based on pre-trained EfficientNet models with fine tuning strategy for remote sensing image classification. EfficientNet achieves the current state-of-the-art performance using significantly less parameters than other latest models in this field of image classification. But nowadays the network is still lacking used in remote sensing tasks. Our method is validated on five remote sensing data sets, the experimental results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods for scene classification in remote sensing imagery.

AB  - The objective of this research is to detect ocean eddies automatically on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. We develop a new approach using Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask R-CNN) and edge enhancement. First, we use Canny edge detector to extract a wide range of edges in SAR images. Then we put both the edge detection results and the corresponding original images into a Mask R-CNN based model for learning, thereby strengthening edge information. The proposed framework has been trained on a sample dataset of Sentinel-1A SAR-C imagery of the Western Mediterranean Sea. Experimental results revealed that the proposed method improved the performance by 2.3% on the MS COCO metrics compared to the method without edge enhancement.

AB  - Based on MODIS NDVI remote sensing data, the methods of regression analysis, CV stability analysis, Hurst exponent analysis are used to invert the spatio-temporal variation trend of vegetation cover in the Pearl River Delta region from 2000 to 2015. On this basis, the future change trend of vegetation cover was predicted. The results indicate that (1) the vegetation coverage in the Pearl River Delta was on a rising trend in general from 2000 to 2015 (0.029/10 years). (2). The vegetation change in The Pearl River Delta region was mainly significantly improved (39.73%), and significantly degraded and slightly degraded areas accounted for only 13.22%, which were staggered with significantly improved regions. (3) Degree of vegetation cover fluctuation in cities and surrounding areas has significant spatial consistency with degraded areas of vegetation cover, which indicates that there is a certain correlation between the change of vegetation cover around the city and human activities. (4) Combined with the analysis of future and past trends, the condition that vegetation cover firstly degrades and then improves will occur. While vegetation degradation may occur in non-urban concentrated areas without good ecological planning. The research results will be helpful to understand the trend and spatial distribution of vegetation in the Pearl River Delta region.

TI  - Design of an Integrated Remote and Ground Sensing Monitor System for Assessing Farmland Quality
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quality monitoring is important for farmland protection. Here, high-resolution remote sensing data obtained by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and long-term ground sensing data, obtained by wireless sensor networks (WSNs), are uniquely suited for assessing spatial and temporal changes in farmland quality. However, existing UAV-WSN systems are unable to fully integrate the data obtained from these two monitoring systems. This work addresses this problem by designing an improved UAV-WSN monitoring system that can collect both high-resolution UAV images and long-term WSN data during a single-flight mission. This is facilitated by a newly proposed data transmission optimization routing protocol (DTORP) that selects the communication node within a cluster of the WSN to maximize the quantity of data that can be efficiently transmitted, additionally combining individual scheduling algorithms and routing algorithms appropriate for three different distance scales to reduce the energy consumption incurred during data transmission between the nodes in a cluster. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated based on Monte Carlo simulations by comparisons with that obtained by a conventional system using the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol. The results demonstrate that the proposed system provides a greater total volume of transmitted data, greater energy utilization efficiency, and a larger maximum revisit period than the conventional system. This implies that the proposed UAV-WSN monitoring system offers better overall performance and enhanced potential for conducting long-term farmland quality data collection over large areas in comparison to existing systems.

TI  - Evaluation of LJ1-01 Nighttime Light Imagery for Estimating Monthly PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentration: A Comparison With NPP-VIIRS Nighttime Light Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air quality degradations caused by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can lead to various health problems, and accurate PM2.5 data are critical for managing the environment and ensuring public health. Radiation signals collected by nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing satellites are influenced by PM2.5 concentrations, and thus, incorporating NTL imagery in statistical models has been widely used to predict PM2.5 concentrations. However, scarce work has been carried out with new-generation NTL data from the LJ1-01 satellite, which has a fine spatial resolution and wide measurement range. In this study, we integrated satellite observation data and meteorological data to construct five models based on the geographically weighted regression to validate the feasibility of LJ1-01/NPP-VIIRS in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer AOD-based PM2.5 prediction in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The models were validated by the cross-validation method. The results showed that the addition of NTL information could improve the performance of the PM(2.5 )prediction model. The seasonal R-2 with NTL in AOD-PM2.5 model have improved by 5.07%, 4.50%, 2.95%, and 2.56% in model fitting and 1.20%, 1.75%, 2.20%, and 4.41% in cross-validation. Furthermore, the LJ1-01 NIL data revealed additional details and improved the prediction accuracy, compared with the NPP-VIIRS in AOD-PM2.5 model, the seasonal R-2 with LJ1-01 in AOD-PM2.5 model increased by 1.16%, 1.79%, 0.76%, and 1.15% in model fitting and 1.04%, 0.85%, 0.78%, 1.37% in cross-validation. Thus, our findings indicate that LJ1-01 and NTL data have the potential for predicting PM2.5 and that they could constitute a useful supplemental data source for estimating ground-level PM2.5 distributions.

TI  - Monitoring of tropical cyclone structures in ten years of RADARSAT-2 SAR images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The cross-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) onboard the RADARSAT-2 satellite has the capability to simultaneously observe the tropical cyclone (TC) structure and ocean surface winds with high spatial resolution of similar to 1 km and large swath images of similar to 450 x 450 km. We propose a methodology to extract TC centers, radius of maximum winds, intensities and the azimuthal wave-number one asymmetric surface wind structures from 75 RADARSAT-2 cross-polarized SAR images over the period from 2008 to 2017. We present a quantitative investigation on both the symmetric mean flow and the asymmetries of azimuthal wave-number one in the surface wind fields retrieved from these SAR images. The results demonstrate that the radius of maximum wind decreases as maximum wind increases, which is consistent with the TC dynamic models for axisymmetric convective heating, and that TCs are more asymmetric when they are weak, and close to symmetric when they are strong.

TI  - Performance Analysis of Internal Solitary Wave Detection and Identification Based on Compact Polarimetric SAR
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper studies the application of compact polarimetric (CP) SAR in the detection and identification of ocean internal solitary waves (ISWs). First, based on full-polarimetric ALOS PALSAR images, we construct CP SAR images and extract 26 CP features. Then, the ISWS-sea surface differentiation capability for the different polarization features is analyzed by using the Jeffries and Euclidean distances. The results show that lambda(1), Entropy (H), Lambda, the polarimetric total power (Span) and the Stokes parameters (Stokesg(0), and Stokesg(3)) improve the ISWs detection results. On this basis, a k-means clustering algorithm based on CP features is introduced, and the results show that the ISWs detection and identification performance of the algorithm are superior to that of the traditional Wishart polarization clustering algorithm, which suggests that CP SAR has good application prospects in the detection and identification of ocean ISWs.

TI  - Combination of Super-Resolution PSI and Traditional PSI by Identification of Homogeneous Areas
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) depends heavily on Persistent Scatterer (PS) density. In order to increase PS density, we can apply Super-Resolution reprocessing algorithms in PSI. Involving the reprocessing algorithms and the peak-detection-based Persistent Scatterer Candidate points (PSCs) selection method, the full PSI chain is referred to as Super-Resolution PSI (SR-PSI). The implementation of the Super-Resolution reprocessing algorithm, however, is computationally intensive, which makes SR-PSI time-consuming. In this work, we propose to improve the efficiency by constraining the Capon-based reprocessing to the non-homogeneous areas (e.g., urban areas). We notice that the Capon algorithm performs similarly as the Fourier-based algorithm for homogeneous regions (e.g., grassland), thus we can use Single Look Complex (SLC) images for these areas. With the Coefficient of Variation (CV) as the index, we divide the full image into two classes: homogeneous areas, for which we select PSCs from the original stack, and non-homogeneous areas, for which we extract PSCs from the Capon-based reprocessed images. Then we combine the PSCs of both cases for further PSI processing. We applied the combination method to a stack of TerraSAR-X data. The results show that the proposed approach is more computationally efficient than the original SR-PSI with the effectiveness uncompromised, especially for applications aiming at the urban deformation.

AB  - In order to improve the data access ability of the current dispatching control system, reduce the data source processing pressure, and meet the increasing demand for high concurrency and large amount of data access, this paper starts with the requirement of high-speed data access, and proposes the key technology of constructing the high speed data cache component of the dispatching system based on the distributed memory cluster, and solves the distributed environment with the circular consistent hashing algorithm. For the balance of business data storage, the gradual hash mechanism is used to improve the scaling efficiency of the mapping table during storage, improve the query and access efficiency of multiple data information, ensure the high reliability of the data through the redundant multi copy cache architecture of the master-slave sentinel cluster, and ensure that the expired cache is cleaned and refreshed in time through the automatic update strategy of multiple cache data, and solve the data consistency requirements of different business scenarios. At the same time, an experimental verification environment is built to verify the concurrent processing performance of cache components.

AB  - Leaf chlorophyll content (Chl(leaf)) is a crucial parameter in carbon cycle modeling and agricultural monitor. Taking advantage of remotely sensed red-edge vegetation index (VI) is an easy approach to estimate Chl(leaf) at a large spatial scale. However, the spectral signals of Chl(leaf) and other canopy/foliar/background factors (e.g. leaf area, leaf angle, soil moisture, etc.) are always coupled together, leading to the relatively low accuracy in direct Chl(leaf) estimation. A new chlorophyll sensitive index (CSI) based on the red-edge band is proposed to estimate Chl(leaf), with minimal canopy structural influences. Validation results using in-situ measurements show CSI performed better to estimate Chl(leaf) of winter wheat and soybean at canopy scale: RMSE=8.24 mu g/cm(2) for CSI; RMSE=10.04 mu g/cm(2) for the best existing index, MTCI. CSI also has the potential ability to estimate Chl(leaf) across diverse structural species types with high accuracy. Therefore, CSI provides an effective and convenient way to estimate Chl(leaf) over large areas using satellite data.

AB  - Haze usually blurs the characteristics of images shotted in adverse weather conditions. It brings many challenges for computer vision such as object detection. Due to the lack of effective training dataset of remote sensing image, the dehazing usually utilize the physical model rather than the deep learning approach based on a large number of training dataset. An effective method to create training dataset may provide some new ideas for remote sensing image dehazing. In this paper, a novel approach based on the visual features rather than the physical counterparts is developed to create a training dataset for remote sensing images dehazing. Firstly, 400 haze images and 400 clear images with size of 240x240 pixels were gathered from Landsat 8. Secondly, the dataset was utilized to train the cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to derive an image transform model which can convert a clear image into a haze one. Thirdly, 4000 clear images with size of 240x240 pixels were collected from Landsat 8 and the images were transformed into the haze images with our model. Finally, the ratio of training dataset and testing dataset is set as 4:1. The haze images created by us were selected as the input and the original clear images were chosen as the output to train the convolutional neural networks to derive the dehazing models. The created dataset and the dehazing models derived were tested, and the experimental results showed that our approach is better to keep the brightness information of the original image, but it is not good at keeping the chroma information.

TI  - Effects of increasing aerosol optical depth on the gross primary productivity in China during 2000-2014
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been shown to influence the gross primary productivity (GPP) in terrestrial ecosystems by increasing the diffuse fraction, which could expend radiation scattering and improve the light-use efficiency of shade leaves. Previous studies have suggested that variations in aerosols are the main cause of changes in solar radiation over China. In this study, we analyzed the spatial and temporal trends of the AOD and GPP, which were extracted from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) products and radiation (total solar radiation and diffuse radiation) and diffuse fraction data obtained from meteorological stations in China from 2000 to 2014. The correlations among these variables were investigated according to three vegetation types. The results showed that the AOD increased by approximately 11.4% between 2001 and 2014. The diffuse radiation and GPP increased by 6.7% and 8.9% in the same period, respectively. The spatial patterns of the AOD were found to be similar to that of the diffuse radiation over China. The results showed a significantly positive correlation between the AOD and GPP for forests (p < 0.05, r = 0.572), but a negative effect of the AOD on the GPP for grasslands. The results could be attributed to the complex and closed canopy architecture of forests relative to grasslands, and the different responses of the canopy structures of forests and grasslands to the changes of diffuse radiation.

AB  - Cloud detection is a critical part of remote sensing images preprocessing, which can be regarded as an image pixel-segmentation problem. In recent years, because of effective performance, convolutional neural network is widely used in image segmentation. This paper proposed a cloud detection method based on convolutional neural network, not only adding Gabor feature extraction module to further extract the detail information in the low-level features but also mining the correlation between high-level features through the channel attention module. In order to evaluate our method, experiments were carried on the Gaofen-1 WFV dataset containing different types of clouds over various underlying. The results show that our method has higher accuracy rate and lower false alarm rate comparing to several state-of-the-art image segmentation network.

AB  - Cloud detection is a challenging task but plays a major role for remote sensing image processing. Due to the diversity of cloud and the complexity of underlying surfaces, most of the current cloud detection methods still face great challenges, especially in detecting the thin cloud. Therefore, we propose a method to detect cloud pixels in GaoFen-1 WFV images. In our method, the deep encoder-decoder network is used to learn the multi-scale global features. So that the high-level semantic information obtained in the process of feature learning is integrated with low-level spatial information to classify images into cloud and non-cloud regions. In addition, Up and Down blocks using Harr wavelet transform are designed to fully exploit the structural information of images, and especially the texture information of the cloud can be learned targetedly. The experimental results indicate that the network using Up and Down blocks performs well under different scenes.

TI  - LAKEFRONT WETLAND CHANGES IN DONGTINGLAKE USING LANDSAT IMAGE FROM 1979 TO 2016
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakefront wetland in Dongting Lake has been faced high variations during recent decades. Therefore, there has a strong need to investigate and understand the Lakefront wetland changes in Dongting Lake. In this paper, we selected Landsat image to study the Lakefront wetland in Dongting Lake in dry season from 1979 to 2016. Lakefront wetland information was classified to four categories: grassland, mud flat. waterbody and others. On this basis, we obtained the lakefront wetland distribution map of Dongting Lake by using maximum likelihood method. The results showed that from 1979 to 1995. lakefront wetland area in Dongting Lake decreased continuously. Among them, lakefront wetland area decreased by 170.4 km(2) from 1979 to 1987, in which lakefront wetland mainly transferred to waterbody, in the area of 161.85 km(2). From 1987 to 1995, lakefront wetland area decreased by 282.3 km(2), in which lakefront wetland area mainly transferred to other land cover types, with a transfer of 507.32 km(2). From 1995 to 2016. land wetland wetland area continued to increase, especially from 2005 to 2016, with an increase of 698.4 km(2), mainly in transfer of other land cover types to lakefront wetlands, transferring 588,65 km(2), Based on lakefront wetland area change study, in this paper, we further analyzed the impact of temperature, rainfall, and water level on change of lakefront wetland in Dongting Lake and its correlation. Water level and rainfall are negatively correlated with lakefront wetland area, and the correlation between temperature and lakefront wetland area is not obvious.

TI  - Clinical Practice Status of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Early-Stage Breast Cancer Patients in China: A Multicenter Study
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was introduced over 30 years ago, but the application of SLNB in China is unclear. This study aimed to explore the real-world implementation of SLNB among early-stage breast cancer patients in China.Methods: A multi-center, retrospective study was conducted among primary breast cancer patients from 37 hospitals in China in 2018. Their clinical data were collected and analyzed, including the implementation status of SLNB in China, subsequent processing of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) containing metastases, and the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) on SLNB.Results: SLNB surgery was performed on 43.5% of early-stage breast cancer patients in China and 11,942 patients who underwent SLNB were enrolled in this study. The majority of SLNBs were performed using a single mapping agent. A combination of blue dye and radiotracer or fluorescence imaging was used in only 14.9% of patients. The mean (SD) number of resected SLNs was 4.0 (2.1). For the patients with 1 or 2 positive SLNs, 83.0% of them continued to receive axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), while others did not. For the patients with three or more positive SLNs, 97.2% of them continued to receive ALND, among which 82.9% accepted radiotherapy simultaneously. Of the patients who underwent SLN surgery, 5.5% (654/11,942) were receiving NAC. Among them, 51.9% received SLNB before NAC, and the rest received SLNB after NAC. In biopsy-proven positive nodes, 64.7% positive SLNs turned negative after NAC.Conclusion: SLNB has been promoted in China, but it is not widely used compared to in developed countries. Furthermore, the usage of the dual tracer technique in SLNB is not high. Chinese breast surgeons are more conservative regarding the omission of ALND in 1 or 2 SLNs-positive patients.

TI  - Axillary accessory breast cancer with persistent leftsuperior vena cava: A case report and treatment controversy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Axillary accessory breast cancer and persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) are rare clinically. Many controversial treatments for accessory breast cancer are worth discussing and learning.PRESENTATION OF THE CASE: A 48-year-old woman presented with biopsy histopathology confirmed. Right axillary mass biopsy pathology showed mucinous adenocarcinoma of accessory breast. She concerned that the axillary accessory breast cancer was more likely to metastasize and unsure about whether to remove the breast. She accepted extended right axillary accessory breast resection plus ipsilateral axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and received chemotherapy. She was found to have a PLSVC before chemotherapy.DISCUSSION: Is there a need to remove the breast and perform ALND during axillary accessory breast cancer surgery? Is sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) appropriate for axillary accessory breast cancer surgery? Can negative SLNB for axillary accessory breast cancer avoid ALND? Does accessory breast cancer without axillary lymph node metastasis require local radiotherapy? Does PLSVC impact the use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) tubes during chemotherapy? Patients with accessory breast cancer without breast invasion should undergo local extended resection and ALND. SLNB for accessory breast cancer cannot instead of ALND. We recommend routine axillary radiotherapy after accessory breast cancer surgery. If it is determined that the tip of PICC is not in the coronary sinus of PLSVC, PLSVC does not affect chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: Many treatment strategies for accessory breast cancer require more evidence from evidence-based medicine. It is imperative to conduct multi-center accessory breast cancer research. (C) 2020 IJS Publishing Group Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A New Model Incorporating Axillary Ultrasound After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy to Predict Non-Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Invasive Breast Cancer
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Few models with good discriminative power have been introduced to predict the risk of non-sentinel lymph node (non-SLN) metastasis in breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). We aimed to develop a new and simple model for predicting the probability of non-SLN metastasis in breast cancer and facilitate the selection of patients who could avoid unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection following NAC.Patients and Methods: A total of 298 patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, who underwent SLN biopsy after completing NAC and subsequently breast surgery, were included and classified into the training set (n=228) and testing set (n=70). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to select factors that could be determined prior to breast surgery and significantly correlated with non-SLN metastasis in the training set. A logistic regression model was developed based on these factors and validated in the testing set.Results: Nodal status before NAC, post-NAC axillary ultrasound status, SLN number, and SLN metastasis number were independent predictors of non-SLN metastases in breast cancer after NAC. A predictive model based on these factors yielded an area under the curve of 0.838 (95% confidence interval: 0.774-0.902, p<0.001) in the training set. When applied to the testing set, this model yielded an area under the curve of 0.808 (95% confidence interval: 0.609-1.000, p=0.003).Conclusion: A new and simple model, which incorporated factors that could be determined prior to breast surgery, was developed to predict non-SLN metastasis in invasive breast cancer following NAC. Although this model performed excellently in internal validation, it requires external validation before it can be widely utilized in the clinical setting.

AB  - This paper presents a generative adversarial network based super-resolution (SR) approach (which is called as S2GAN) to enhance the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 spectral bands. The proposed approach consists of two main steps. The first step aims to increase the spatial resolution of the bands with 20m and 60m spatial resolutions by the scaling factors of 2 and 6, respectively. To this end, we introduce a generator network that performs SR on the lower resolution bands with the guidance of the bands associated to 10m spatial resolution by utilizing the convolutional layers with residual connections and a long skip-connection between inputs and outputs. The second step aims to distinguish SR bands from their ground truth bands. This is achieved by the proposed discriminator network, which alternately characterizes the high level features of the two sets of bands and applying binary classification on the extracted features. Then, we formulate the adversarial learning of the generator and discriminator networks as a min-max game. In this learning procedure, the generator aims to produce realistic SR bands as much as possible so that the discriminator incorrectly classifies SR bands. Experimental results obtained on different Sentinel-2 images show the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to both conventional and deep learning based SR approaches.

TI  - Invasive Micropapillary Carcinoma with CEP17 Monosomy of the Bilateral Breast: A Rare Case Report and Review of the Literature
T2  - ONCOTARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) is a novel type of breast cancer which is potentially very aggressive and may show early lymphatic infiltration. Monosomy of chromosome 17 (m17) is rare in breast cancer, and according to the 2018 guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists, the decision to administer trastuzumab treatment should be made based on positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 results by immunohistochemistry. Here, we report a rare case of bilateral local advanced IMPC involving m17. A 33-year-old woman found a mass measuring 30 mm on the left breast that increased to 100 mm over 3 months. A diagnosis of IMPC was made based on the findings of core needle biopsies of bilateral breast masses and left axillary lymph node, and m17 was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The patient underwent 6 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (docetaxel, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) and left-side modified radical mastectomy, left axillary lymph node dissection, right breast-conserving surgery, and right sentinel lymph node biopsy. Postoperative pathologic analysis of both breasts revealed IMPC, and m17 was confirmed by FISH. The patient received radiotherapy and endocrine therapy but rejected trastuzumab treatment. The patient was still alive at the 30-month follow-up, without recurrence or metastasis. Our findings suggest that loss of chromosome 17 may influence prognosis or therapeutic response, which needs to be further confirmed.

TI  - Combining Optical, Fluorescence, Thermal Satellite, and Environmental Data to Predict County-Level Maize Yield in China Using Machine Learning Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize is an extremely important grain crop, and the demand has increased sharply throughout the world. China contributes nearly one-fifth of the total production alone with its decreasing arable land. Timely and accurate prediction of maize yield in China is critical for ensuring global food security. Previous studies primarily used either visible or near-infrared (NIR) based vegetation indices (VIs), or climate data, or both to predict crop yield. However, other satellite data from different spectral bands have been underutilized, which contain unique information on crop growth and yield. In addition, although a joint application of multi-source data significantly improves crop yield prediction, the combinations of input variables that could achieve the best results have not been well investigated. Here we integrated optical, fluorescence, thermal satellite, and environmental data to predict county-level maize yield across four agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in China using a regression-based method (LASSO), two machine learning (ML) methods (RF and XGBoost), and deep learning (DL) network (LSTM). The results showed that combining multi-source data explained more than 75% of yield variation. Satellite data at the silking stage contributed more information than other variables, and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) had an almost equivalent performance with the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) largely due to the low signal to noise ratio and coarse spatial resolution. The extremely high temperature and vapor pressure deficit during the reproductive period were the most important climate variables affecting maize production in China. Soil properties and management factors contained extra information on crop growth conditions that cannot be fully captured by satellite and climate data. We found that ML and DL approaches definitely outperformed regression-based methods, and ML had more computational efficiency and easier generalizations relative to DL. Our study is an important effort to combine multi-source remote sensed and environmental data for large-scale yield prediction. The proposed methodology provides a paradigm for other crop yield predictions and in other regions.

TI  - Hierarchical Weakly Supervised Learning for Residential Area Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Residential-area segmentation is one of the most fundamental tasks in the field of remote sensing. Recently, fully supervised convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods have shown superiority in the field of semantic segmentation. However, a serious problem for those CNN-based methods is that pixel-level annotations are expensive and laborious. In this study, a novel hierarchical weakly supervised learning (HWSL) method is proposed to realize pixel-level semantic segmentation in remote sensing images. First, a weakly supervised hierarchical saliency analysis is proposed to capture a sequence of class-specific hierarchical saliency maps by computing the gradient maps with respect to the middle layers of the CNN. Then, superpixels and low-rank matrix recovery are introduced to highlight the common salient areas and fuse class-specific saliency maps with adaptive weights. Finally, a subtraction operation between class-specific saliency maps is conducted to generate hierarchical residual saliency maps and fulfill residential-area segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations with two remote sensing data sets and comparison with seven methods validate the superiority of the proposed HWSL model.

TI  - Land Subsidence and Uplift Surveying by Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry in Lianjiang Plain
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to investigate the distribution of land subsidence in the Lianjiang Plain, the interferometric point target analysis ( IPTA) method has been carried out with RADARSAT-2 data in this work. It was found that large-scale land uplift occurred in Puning City and Shantou City, and the maximum rebound velocity exceeded 100 mm/a in 2019. Then, the Sentinel-1 data collected from June 2015 to November 2019 were used to carry out a long-term sequence inversion of the ground rebound zone and further verify the RADARSAT-2 monitoring results. The results of both kinds of data show the similar distribution characteristics of the two uplift zones. After the preliminary analysis of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) results, geological data, and local government reports, the major factor causing land subsidence and uplift was concluded to be the change in groundwater level. The thick Quaternary strata and the compressible/expandable soil layers provide conditions for rapid subsidence and uplift. Also, the south edge of each uplift zone is limited by the WNW-trending Puning-Tianxin fault, where the land deformation is accompanied by ground fissures.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - By the end of 2017, a total of 110,872 people living with HIV (PLWH) had been diagnosed in Sichuan, including 42,496 AIDS patients, making Sichuan one of the provinces heavily affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The male/female ratio was 2.8:1; the 20-49 age group accounted for 68.5% of infections; and the Han ethnic majority accounted for 68.1% and the Yi ethnic minority accounted for 30.3% of the total cases. PLWH have a wide range of occupations, with farmers, unemployed, and rural migrant workers taking up the majority. Transmission by injection drug use accounted for the majority of cases until 2010, with sexual transmission rapidly expanding in the last decade. By the end of 2017, nearly 79,000 PLWH were receiving antiretroviral treatment in Sichuan province. Mortality greatly declined in recent years among those who received treatment. The number of HIV-related deaths surpassed 5000 in 2017. A comprehensive surveillance network has been set up composed of routine screening, case reporting, sentinel surveillance, specific epidemiological investigation, estimation of the HIV epidemic, and analysis of the incidence rate in different risk groups. Education activities targeting different groups have been carried out from provincial level to prefecture level and communities. Free antiretroviral treatment during the past decade has reduced the mortality rate among PLWH and has improved the quality of their life. Tailored behavioral interventions were implemented to effectively change high-risk behaviors among key populations. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) has covered all 21 prefectures and 181 counties. A comprehensive prevention and treatment system that takes the community as its basis, health departments its mainstay, and professional institutes its backbone, with the coordination of security, civil administration and education, and the general public have been established. Remarkable progress has been made, but a great challenge lies ahead to control HIV sexual transmission, particularly in minorities.

TI  - Characterization of Kyagar Glacier and Lake Outburst Floods in 2018 Based on Time-Series Sentinel-1A Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Early recognition of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) is required for timely and cost-effective remedial efforts to be implemented. Although the formation of ice-dammed lakes is known to begin as a pond or river that was blocked by ice from the glacier terminus, the relationship between glacier dynamics and lake development is not well understood. Using a time-series of Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired just before and after the lake outburst event in 2018, information is presented on the dynamic characteristics of Kyagar Glacier and its ice-dammed lake. Glacier velocity data derived from interferometry show that the glacier tongue experienced an accelerated advance (maximum velocity of 20 cm/day) just one month before the lake outburst, and a decreased velocity (maximum of 13 cm/day) afterward. Interferometric and backscattering properties of this region provide valuable insight into the diverse glaciated environment. Furthermore, daily temperature and total precipitation data derived from the ECMWF re-analysis (ERA)Interim highlight the importance of the sustained high-temperature driving force, supporting empirical observations from previous studies. The spatial and temporal resolution offered by the Sentinel-1A data allows variations in the glacier surface motion and lake evolution to be detected, meaning that the interaction mechanism between the glacial lake and the associated glacier can be explored. Although the glacier surge provided the boundary conditions favorable for lake formation, the short-term high temperatures and precipitation caused the melting of ice dams and also a rapid increase in the amount of water stored, which accelerated the potential for a lake outburst.

TI  - Classification of Paddy Rice Using a Stacked Generalization Approach and the Spectral Mixture Method Based on MODIS Time Series
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy rice is a major stable food, accounting for about 20% world's food supply. And the rice paddy, an important artificial wetland type, plays an important role in the regional ecological environment. This study proposes a stacked generalization and spectral mixture approach to map paddy rice using coarse spatial resolution images [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectralradiometer, (MODIS)]. By this method, the time series MODIS enhanced vegetation index images, phenological variables, land surface water index, elevation, and slope images are all employed to produce the optimal feature combination, which is then used to map paddy rice by the stacking algorithm. The validation experiment using the data of the Dongting Lake area showed that the proposed method can improve the overall accuracy of single classifiers, including the support vector machine, random forest, k-nearestneigbor (kNN), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and decision tree. Stacking (XGB) achieves the highest overall accuracy (90.3%) and Kappa coefficient (0.86), which are 2.8% and 0.03 higher than that of using the single kNN classifier. Furthermore, its user accuracies for distinguishing double-cropping rice and single-season rice are 92.5% and 90.0%, respectively. In terms of the paddy rice classification accuracy, the stacking model is also superior to single classifiers. Moreover, the MODIS-derived rice map obtained by the stacked generalization approach and the spectral mixture method area has a large determination coefficient (R-2 = 0.9975) with the government statistic data. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method in using coarse spatial resolution images for large-scale paddy rice mapping.

TI  - Feature Extraction for Classification of Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Using Patch-to-Patch CNN
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisensor fusion is of great importance in Earth observation related applications. For instance, hyperspectral images (HSIs) provide wealthy spectral information while light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data provide elevation information, and using HSI and LiDAR data together can achieve better classification performance. In this paper, an unsupervised feature extraction framework, named as patch-to-patch convolutional neural network (PToP CNN), is proposed for collaborative classification of hyperspectral and LiDAR data. More specific, a three-tower PToP mapping is first developed to seek an accurate representation from HSI to LiDAR data, aiming at merging multiscale features between two different sources. Then, by integrating hidden layers of the designed PToP CNN, extracted features are expected to possess deeply fused characteristics. Accordingly, features from different hidden layers are concatenated into a stacked vector and fed into three fully connected layers. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed classification framework, experiments are executed on two benchmark remote sensing data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides superior performance when compared with some state-of-the-art classifiers, such as two-branch CNN and context CNN.

Based on the reconstructed time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from multiple satellite images including Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and MODIS, 30-m planetary-scale pixel by pixel cropping intensity products were generated by enumerating the total number of valid cropping cycles using a binary crop phenophase profile indicating growing and non-growing periods. The total number of valid cropping cycles were also divided by 3 (three years from 2016 to 2018) to retrieve the average cropping intensity. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform, we implemented our algorithm across the globe to the global cropping intensity products.

TI  - Fine Extraction of Water Boundaries Based on an Improved Subpixel Mapping Algorithm
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The fine extraction of water boundaries is of great significance for water resource monitoring, water environment monitoring, and flood prevention. MODIS images are widely used for water extraction due to their high temporal resolution, wide coverage, gratuity, and long observation period. However, owing to their low spatial resolution, the water boundary results are often blurred. It is difficult to extract water boundaries accurately. The subpixel mapping algorithm can solve this problem. In this article, Dongting Lake and its surroundings are adopted as the experimental area. The digital elevation model (DEM) is used to modify the subpixel/pixel spatial attraction model (SPSAM) mapping results. The proposed algorithm is referred to as the DEM-modified SPSAM (D-MSPSAM). Based on the visual results of the two sets of experiments, the modified results suitably maintain the spatial details of the water, and many of the underestimations caused by the similarity of the spectral characteristics of the surroundings to those of the water have been corrected. In this paper, the accuracy of Landsat-8 water extraction is used as a reference. Based on the quantitative results, the D-MSPSAM method has a higher extraction accuracy than the traditional threshold method, and the accuracies of the extraction for high water and low water have been increased by 3.56 percentage points and 2.77 percentage points, respectively. Furthermore, these results also confirm the potential application of DEM data for flood submergence extraction and provide new ideas for the improvement of the subpixel mapping model. The proposed method can accurately generate water distribution maps in a practical and economical way.

TI  - Uncertainty Analysis of Remote Sensing Pretreatment for Biomass Estimation on Landsat OLI and Landsat ETM
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate quantification of biomass helps to understand forest productivity and carbon cycling dynamics. Research on uncertainty during pretreatment is still lacking despite it being one of the major sources of uncertainty and an essential step in biomass estimation. In this study, we investigated pretreatment uncertainty and conducted a comparative study on the uncertainty of three optical imagery preprocessing stages (radiometric calibration, atmospheric and terrain correction) in biomass estimation. A combination of statistical models (random forest) and multisource data (Landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+), Landsat operational land imager (OLI), national forest inventory (NFI)) was used to estimate forest biomass. Particularly, mean absolute error (MAE) and relative error (RE) were used to assess and quantify the uncertainty of each pretreatment, while the coefficient of determination (R-2) was employed to evaluate the accuracy of the model. The results obtained show that random forest (RF) and 10-fold cross validation algorithms provided reliable accuracy for biomass estimation to better understand the uncertainty in pretreatments. In this study, there was a considerable uncertainty in biomass estimation using original OLI and ETM+ images from. Uncertainty was lower after data processing, emphasizing the importance of pretreatments for improving accuracy in biomass estimation. Further, the effects of three pretreatments on uncertainty of biomass estimation were objectively quantified. In this study (results of test sample), a 33.70% uncertainty was found in biomass estimation using original images from the OLI, and a 34.28% uncertainty in ETM+. Radiometric calibration slightly increased the uncertainty of biomass estimation (OLI increased by 1.38%, ETM+ increased by 2.08%). Moreover, atmospheric correction (5.56% for OLI, 4.41% for ETM+) and terrain correction (1.00% for OLI, 1.67% for ETM+) significantly reduced uncertainty for OLI and ETM+, respectively. This is an important development in the field of improving the accuracy of biomass estimation by remote sensing. Notably, the three pretreatments presented the same trend in uncertainty during biomass estimation using OLI and ETM+. This may exhibit the same effects in other optical images. This article aims to quantify uncertainty in pretreatment and to analyze the resultant effects to provide a theoretical basis for improving the accuracy of biomass estimation.

AB  - Due to the lack of a suitable theoretical model for simulating radar backscatter of soil based on salt content, we investigated a new method to exploit Sentinel-1 radar backscatters and polarimetric decomposition information for dryland soil salinity monitoring. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) was estimated using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and field survey data combined with five machine learning models in Esperance, located in the southwest of Western Australia (SWWA). The performance of the five machine learning models was assessed and compared using the root-meansquare error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the correlation coefficient (r). The results revealed that the Random Forest Regression model (RFR) yielded the highest prediction performance (RMSE = 2.89 S/m, MAE = 1.90 S/m, and r = 0.81) and outperformed the other models. It can be concluded that the intensity images of VV and VH polarization of SAR imagery have the potential to predict EC of soils in SWWA.

TI  - A Stepwise Downscaling Method for Generating High-Resolution Land Surface Temperature From AMSR-E Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A stepwise downscaling method is proposed for generating high-resolution land surface temperature (LST) from advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the Earth observing system (AMSR-E) data to benefit the fusion of thermal infrared and microwave data for high-quality all-weather LST. This method sets a series of intermediate resolution levels between the initial (0.25 degrees) and target (0.01 degrees) resolutions, then downscales AMSR-E LST from one resolution to the next one step at a time, starting from 0.25 degrees and ending with 0.01 degrees. The geographically weighted regression model is adopted in each step to construct the relationship between LST and environmental variables, including normalized differential vegetation index, elevation, and slope. The stepwise method is verified over three regions in China that represent different characteristics of landscape heterogeneity varying from the highest to the lowest: the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (YGP), the border of Shanxi Province and Henan Province (BSH), and the central part of Inner Mongolia (CIM). Verified using the emulated AMSR-E LST resampled from reference MODIS LST available in 2010, the results show that the proportions of dates when the stepwise method is better are 100%, 78.1%, and 51.5% in the YGP, BSH, and CIM regions, respectively, which means the stepwise method has an advantage over the direct method in the regions with high heterogeneity. For real AMSR-E LST, the downscaled LST exhibits a similar spatial pattern to that of emulated data but suffers from reduced accuracy and contrast, which is caused by the smooth spatial pattern and low accuracy of the real AMSR-E LST.

TI  - PRECISE CLASSIFICATION OF FOREST SPECIES BASED ON MULTI-SOURCE REMOTE-SENSING IMAGES
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Picea schrenkiana var. tianshanica (PSVT) is an endemic tree species in Xinjiang, and serves as windbreak and soil consolidation, to ensure the stability of ecological environment. To efficiently and quickly grasp the ecological status of PSVT and the stability of forest ecosystem, we used images of different resolutions (GF-2 (1 m), GF-1 (8 m), GF-1 (16 m), Landsat 8 (30 m)) combined with field survey data, and performed multi-resolution segmentation to select the best segmentation scales. Based on the spectrum, texture and terrain factors, the canopy closure inversion of PSVT was performed to select the characteristic factors suitable. Then, we applied three object-oriented methods (i.e. support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART), and nearest neighbor classification (NNC)) to classify the forest land. The result shows that the near-infrared (NIR) band is highly independent and makes an important contribution to the optimum index factor (OIF), in which the real-time adjustments of segmentation results are made to achieve better effect. There is a significant relationship between textural features of each band. The canopy closure estimation model performs better with a combination of spectral, terrain, and texture factors. Compared to CART and NNC models, SVM classification achieved better accuracy.

AB  - To analyze the characteristic distribution of the MWRI rainfall algorithm, six record observations of typhoon Mufia are selected as the case study for this study. Six track records of MWRI observations and AMSR-E GPROF2010 rainfall products are matched and selected to make the analysis and comparisons. Averaged radial rainfall distribution from MWRI and AMSR-E rainfall products are consistent in six records. The results indicate that the MWRI retrievals are coincident with AMSR-E rain rates in temporal and spatial evaluation. MWRI radiometer can observe the entire process from formation, maturity to extinction for typhoons.

TI  - A novel remote sensing detection method for buildings damaged by earthquake based on multiscale adaptive multiple feature fusion
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid and accurate detection of damaged buildings after an earthquake are critical for emergency response. Given the difference in the textures of damaged parts and those of the original buildings, damaged buildings can be accurately detected through textural heterogeneity. However, quantitatively detecting damaged buildings using such heterogeneity from post-earthquake images is difficult. Therefore, we propose a method of automatically extracting house damage information from post-quake high-resolution optical remote sensing imagery through the multiscale fusion of spectral and textural features, which can be achieved in three steps. Firstly, the textural and spectral features of the images are enhanced at the pixel level. Secondly, the resulting feature images are fused at the feature level and the fused feature images are segmented using superpixels. Lastly, a post-quake house damage index model is constructed. Results show an overall accuracy of 76.75%, 75.35% and 83.25% for three different types of imagery. This finding indicates that the proposed algorithm can be used to extract damage information from multisource remote sensing data and provide useful guidance for post-disaster rescue and assessment based on regional house damage conditions.

AB  - In the disaster research field, extraction of post-disaster damaged house building information plays a critical role in post-disaster emergency rescue and disaster-induced damage assessment. In this study, we propose a method of automatically extracting house damage information from post-quake high-resolution optical remote-sensing imagery through multiscale fusion of spectral texture features. This is achieved in three steps.

AB  - This work proposes a novel distributed deep learning model for Remote Sensing (RS) images super-resolution. High Performance Computing (HPC) systems with GPUs are used to accelerate the learning of the unknown low to high resolution mapping from large volumes of Sentinel-2 data. The proposed deep learning model is based on self-attention mechanism and residual learning. The results demonstrate that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by keeping the size of the model relatively small. Synchronous data parallelism is applied to scale up the training process without severe performance loss. Distributed training is thus shown to speed up learning substantially while keeping performance intact.

TI  - Review of aerosol optical depth retrieval using visibility data
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Both ground and satellite observation of aerosol are short of long-term and wide covering data. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved by visibility data can partly make up the lack of long-term aerosol observation data. This article summaries the principle and progress of retrieval method in recent decades. Since Koschmieder firstly proposed the concept of daytime visibility and the empirical transformation formula between horizontal visual range and optical depth of atmosphere, the retrieval method has been gradually improved by many scholars considering the factors such as atmospheric scale height, the threshold value of human eye, the Rayleigh coefficient of atmospheric molecules, and the water vapor condition, etc. Spatial and temporal characteristics of retrieved results show that high AOD are distributed in large scale sand and dust area, central Europe, western Africa, southeastern North America and southeastern China and AOD in these areas continue to increase in recent decades. The comparison between the retrieved AOD and relevant satellite AOD in different periods and regions has well confirmed the accuracy of retrieval method, but the summary and discussion of visibility-retrieved AOD show that there are still many deficiencies to be improved. This paper also puts forward some feasible suggestions about how to improve the retrieval method from the consistency of visibility data modified visibility data using automatic observations, influence of water vapor, vertical profiles of aerosol particles, correction of retrieval results using satellite data, optimal solution of parameters and improvements through model simulation in the retrieval algorithm.

TI  - EMMCNN: An ETPS-Based Multi-Scale and Multi-Feature Method Using CNN for High Spatial Resolution Image Land-Cover Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover information is significant for land-use planning, urban management, and environment monitoring. This paper presented a novel extended topology-preserving segmentation (ETPS)-based multi-scale and multi-feature method using the convolutional neural network (EMMCNN) for high spatial resolution (HSR) image land-cover classification. The EMMCNN first segmented the images into superpixels using the ETPS algorithm with false-color composition and enhancement and built parallel convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with dense connections for superpixel multi-scale deep feature learning. Then, the multi-resolution segmentation (MRS) object hand-delineated features were extracted and mapped to superpixels for complementary multi-segmentation and multi-type representation. Finally, a hybrid network was designed to consist of 1-dimension CNN and multi-layer perception (MLP) with channel-wise stacking and attention-based weighting for adaptive feature fusion and comprehensive classification. Experimental results on four real HSR GaoFen-2 datasets demonstrated the superiority of the proposed EMMCNN over several well-known classification methods in terms of accuracy and consistency, with overall accuracy averagely improved by 1.74% to 19.35% for testing images and 1.06% to 8.78% for validating images. It was found that the solution combining an appropriate number of larger scales and multi-type features is recommended for better performance. Efficient superpixel segmentation, networks with strong learning ability, optimized multi-scale and multi-feature solution, and adaptive attention-based feature fusion were key points for improving HSR image land-cover classification in this study.

TI  - Evaluating the generalization ability of convolutional neural networks for built-up area extraction in different cities of China
T2  - OPTOELECTRONICS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The difficulty of build-up area extraction is due to complexity of remote sensing data in terms of heterogeneous appearance with large intra-class variations and lower inter-class variations. In order to extract the built-up area from Landsat 8-OLI images provided by Google earth engine (GEE), we propose a convolutional neural networks (CNN) utilizing spatial and spectral information synchronously, which is built in Google drive using Colaboratory-Keras. To train a CNN model with good generalization ability, we choose Beijing, Lanzhou, Chongqing, Suzhou and Guangzhou of China as the training sites, which are very different in term of natural environments. The ArcGIS-Model Builder is employed to automatically select 99 332 samples from the 38-m global built-up production of the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2014. The validate accuracy of the five experimental sites is higher than 90%. We compare the results with other existing building data products. The classification results of CNN can be very good for the details of the built-up areas, and greatly reduce the classification error and leakage error. We applied the well-trained CNN model to extract built-up areas of Chengdu, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Harbin, Hefei, Wuhan, Kunming and Fuzhou, for the sake of evaluating the generalization ability of the CNN. The fine classification results of the eight sites indicate that the generalization ability of the well-trained CNN is pretty good. However, the extraction results of Xi'an, Zhengzhou and Hefei are poor. As for the training data, only Lanzhou is located in the northwest region, so the trained CNN has poor image classification ability in the northwest region of China.

CP  - 8th IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The goal of convective storm nowcasting is local prediction of severe and imminent convective storms. Here, we consider the convective storm nowcasting problem from the perspective of machine learning. First, we use a pixel-wise sampling method to construct spatiotemporal features for nowcasting, and flexibly adjust the proportions of positive and negative samples in the training set to mitigate class-imbalance issues. Second, we employ a concise two-stream convolutional neural network to extract spatial and temporal cues for nowcasting. This simplifies the network structure, reduces the training time requirement, and improves classification accuracy. The two-stream network used both radar and satellite data. In the resulting two-stream, fused convolutional neural network, some of the parameters are entered into a single-stream convolutional neural network, but it can learn the features of many data. Further, considering the relevance of classification and regression tasks, we develop a multi-task learning strategy that predicts the labels used in such tasks. We integrate two-stream multi-task learning into a single convolutional neural network. Given the compact architecture, this network is more efficient and easier to optimize than existing recurrent neural networks.

M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion is one of the features of urban development that has caused many ecological and environmental problems. Evaluating the impact of urban expansion on carbon sequestration of the urban forest is important to understand the carbon cycle in urban ecosystems. Multiple remote sensing data were used to map land covers and carbon sequestration indicators of Shenyang in 2000, 2005, and 2010. Urban land area percentage (UAP), urban expansion magnitude (UEM), net primary productivity (NPP), aboveground biomass (AGB), and the change rate of NPP (RNPP) and AGB (RAGB) were analyzed in regions with different distances from the urban core. Results showed that the decline of UAP and bimodal fluctuation of UEM was found as the increase of distance from urban center. Urban forest NPP and AGB both rose with distance from urban center increased. Significant differences in NPP and AGB existed in various urban forest types. Moreover, UAP was significantly negatively correlated with NPP and AGB. We conclude that urban forests see more disturbances compared to natural forests. The evergreen coniferous forest has the highest ability of carbon sequestration, and great potential of carbon storage is found in the urban forest. Besides, the urban forest's carbon sequestration function will be maintained when adopting appropriate urban development mode.

AB  - With the gradual maturity of spaceX's space technology, private commercial space has developed rapidly and become a hot spot in the space field. The bottleneck that affects the development of private commercial space technology is the cost input and the backflow of funds. SpaceX proposed a novel solution is to reduce the cost of rocket launches by leasing its rocket carrying capacity and providing satellite launches to other companies or groups. For satellites already in orbit, however, there is no mature business model for making a profit.In this paper, a new model of satellite service is proposed, which takes satellite as a service to provide external services. A hybrid resource management framework is proposed to manage the basic hardware and unique hardware capabilities of satellites. Simulation results show that the framework can effectively improve the utilization rate of satellite resources and generate profits.

AB  - In order to cover the full Brightness Temperature (TB) range of microwave radiometer, warm-scene intercalibration is necessary and serves as a complement to cold-scene calibration over sea surfaces. This paper presents a method to intercalibrate the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) on the Chinese meteorological satellite Fengyun 3C (FY-3C) against the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) over forest warm scenes using the Double Difference (DD) method based on a microwave radiative transfer model. Considering the complex and variable land properties, forests are selected as calibration sites in terms of normalized difference vegetation index and polarization TB differences. The intercalibration results show that calibration biases exist in all FY-3C MWRI channels, and the calibration of MWRI ascending (MWRIA) data is better than that of the MWRI descending (MWRID) data. The intercalibration coefficients of FY-3C MWRI are obtained using quadratic regression fed with coincident TBs.

CL  - Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Above-low-cloud aerosol (ACA) has important impacts on low clouds bellow. Based on the satellite data from 2007 to 2010, this study analyzed the relationship between ACA optical depth (OD), ACA occurrences and low cloud integrated color ratio (CR) over tropic Atlantic region where ACA frequently occurs. The results show that, the integrated attenuated CR (IACR) of low cloud is about 30%-50% larger over smoke region in smoke outbreak seasons than other regions or seasons. However, the IACR of low cloud over dust region shows small difference between dust outbreak seasons and other seasons. It indicates that above-low-cloud smoke aerosol can introduce stronger color effect than dust. The integrated corrected CR (ICCR) of low cloud tends to decrease with increasing above-cloud dust OD, while the low cloud ICCR shows weak relationship with above-low-cloud smoke OD. And, the above-low-cloud dust aerosol could introduce strong microphysics effect, that is, the low cloud droplet size may decrease with increasing burden of dust aerosol above.

AB  - Taking the Dexing Copper Mine in Jiangxi Province, China as an study area, we used the long-term sequence summer Landsat images in 2002-2019 to investigate the variation of vegetation growth status and their ecological restoration effects. According to the specific situation of the study area, the Green-Red Nounalized Difference Vegetation Index (GRNDVI) calculated from remote sensing data was used to analyse the growth of mine vegetation and the dynamic change in the whole mining area. Moreover, the annual growth changes were compared with normal vegetation growth. The CV method, Hurst method, and Sen+Mann-Kendall method were combined used to evaluate the intensity of vegetation growth, change patterns and change sustainability analysis to obtain the overall growth and change of vegetation and then predict the vegetation growth trend in the study area. The results show that this method can assess accurately the vegetation growth trend in the study area.

TI  - Deep convolutional neural network structure design for remote sensing image scene classification based on transfer learning
T2  - 2020 THIRD INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON ENVIRONMENT AND GEOSCIENCE

CP  - 3rd International Workshop on Environment and Geoscience (IWEG)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - To obtain an ideal scene classification effect when applying a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to remote sensing images, a DCNN named ConNet-3F based on transfer learning was constructed. Firstly, the initial 13 layers of VGG16 were used as the main architecture, and then 6 layers were added to the end of it to extract deeper features. The pruned model of VGG16 acted as the feature extractor to extract features from remote sensing images. Subsequently, the parameters trained on the ImageNet were set as initialization. Finally, parameters of all layers were trained on the remote sensing data to obtain the favorable model. The results on the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset demonstrate that this method achieves higher classification accuracy compared with other mentioned methods. Especially, even if the ratio of training data was reduced on the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset, classification accuracies of the proposed method always stay above 90%.

AB  - Vegetation phenology is a sensitive indicator of biological responses to environmental change, and is readily observable and understandable to the public. Land Surface Phenology (LSP) derived from satellite data quantifies the seasonal dynamics of vegetation activity including phenological transition timing and greenness magnitude in vegetation communities. This paper presents the development of a global LSP product at a spatial resolution of 500m from daily observations of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). This product produces seven metrics of phenological timings and five metrics of phenological greenness. Spatial examination indicates that global VIIRS LSP reveals clear regular and irregular pattern across different geographical regions, ecosystems, and climate regimes. This VIIRS LSP product provides the continuity of MODIS land cover dynamics product.

TI  - Coastal Oyster Aquaculture Area Extraction and Nutrient Loading Estimation Using a GF-2 Satellite Image
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate extraction of an aquaculture area is significant in aquaculture management, post-disaster evaluation, and aquatic environment protection. However, little attention has been paid to the aquaculture area extraction in coastal water with high turbidity. In this study, based on the spectral and geospatial features of aquaculture cages in complex coastal water with varying turbidity, we proposed a new aquaculture area extraction method using a Gaofen-2 (GF-2) satellite image with 0.8-m spatial resolution. The water was classified into clear, medium, and high turbidity categories according to the suspended sediment concentration derived from the inversion of the GF-2 image. Different rules of extraction were developed with respect to those three categories of water body: First, the normalized difference water index threshold was set for the clear water, second, a ratio index (R = Green/NIR) was established for the medium turbid water body, and third, for the turbid water body, feature analysis with a specified classification rule was established. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed method worked well, with the high accuracies of 87.3300% for the overall accuracy, even for the high turbidity water. The kappa coefficient was 0.7375, which was much better than the kappa coefficient values of the three conventional classification methods represented in this article. This study provides effective information support and auxiliary decision analysis for management departments to scientifically plan and environmentally manage coastal aquaculture areas.

Ten quick-view image quality evaluation indexes are determined, including cloudiness, mean, variance, contrast, information entropy, second moment, homogeneity, correlation, definition and signal-to-noise ratio. The specific values of each quality evaluation index of the experimental image are obtained through calculation, and the quality of each image is evaluated. The experiment shows that the image 5 has more information, higher image quality and stronger usability, which are consistent with the visual interpretation results. It is confirmed that the emergency situation assessment results can be obtained in a timely and effective manner by using fast-tracking data, thus reserving time for making emergency early warning.

TI  - ICENET: A Semantic Segmentation Deep Network for River Ice by Fusing Positional and Channel-Wise Attentive Features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - River ice monitoring is of great significance for river management, ship navigation and ice hazard forecasting in cold-regions. Accurate ice segmentation is one most important pieces of technology in ice monitoring research. It can provide the prerequisite information for the calculation of ice cover density, drift ice speed, ice cover distribution, change detection and so on. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial photography has the advantages of higher spatial and temporal resolution. As UAV technology has become more popular and cheaper, it has been widely used in ice monitoring. So, we focused on river ice segmentation based on UAV remote sensing images. In this study, the NWPU_YRCC dataset was built for river ice segmentation, in which all images were captured by different UAVs in the region of the Yellow River, the most difficult river to manage in the world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public UAV image dataset for river ice segmentation. Meanwhile, a semantic segmentation deep convolution neural network by fusing positional and channel-wise attentive features is proposed for river ice semantic segmentation, named ICENET. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed ICENET outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving a superior result on the NWPU_YRCC dataset.

AB  - Internal waves (IWs) with wave crests of several hundred of kilometers can be well observed by satellite images. In this paper, transmeridional propagating IWs in the Celebes Sea, which have received less attention, is studied using a five-year Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer images. The spatial distribution of IWs in the Celebes Sea shows cross IW propagations, and analysis shows a comparable scale with IWs In the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea. The IW propagation speed is calculated using two methods based on synergy satellite observations and successive IW packets under the semi-diurnal generation assumption. The results demonstrate that west propagating IWs in the Celebes Sea are generated by semi-diurnal tidal cycles and propagating with a speed of over 3.0 m/s. The analysis of the geometry of IW wave crest and tidal transport distributions show that west propagating IWs in the Celebes Sea are generated at the Sangihe Islands.

AB  - Intraoperative pathologic diagnosis for central nervous system (CNS) tumors is important to determine the neurosurgery procedure. But sometimes the differential diagnosis between glioma and lymphoma, or glioma and metastatic tumors is difficult for a pathologist during a short time, especially when the specimen is small or the frozen section has ice crystals. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a very useful method for diagnosis, but the traditional immunohistochemical method is time consuming and not suitable intraoperatively. In this study, we chose Cytokeratin-pan, GFAP, and LCA as three immunohistochemical indicators. Intraoperative IHC was done by Novodiax ihcDirect technology combined with Leica Bond auto-staining. Compared with the manual method recommended for the reagents (Novodiax ihcDirect), the results show that auto-staining has better stability and high reproducibility in coloration, which has broad prospects for future application.

TI  - Active Layer Thickness Retrieval Over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Using Sentinel-1 Multitemporal InSAR Monitored Permafrost Subsidence and Temporal-Spatial Multilayer Soil Moisture Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing near-surface temperature over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has led to permafrost degradation and increasing active layer thickness (ALT). In this study, the ALT was estimated based on ground subsidence monitored by multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) and temporal-spatial multilayer soil moisture data. For the ground subsidence monitoring, a modified Stefan piecewise elevation change model based on air temperature data was integrated into a new small baseline subset (NSBAS) chain. A total of 33 scenes of Sentinel-1 data (S-1) were collected over one year to build the MT-InSAR analysis network. Moreover, both soil moisture active/passive (SMAP) L4 surface and root zone soil moisture data and ERA-Interim reanalysis data were used to build an ALT retrieval model. In particular, the global-scaled soil moisture data (SMAP and ERA-Interim) fraction was separated based on the Sentinel-1 amplitude-based land cover classification results and in situ soil moisture data. A typical ALT estimation method based on the point scale groundwater information was also performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Based on the validation of the ground-based ALT observations, the proposed method outperformed the traditional point scale groundwater information-based method, with a correlation coefficient of 0.67, RMSE of 0.70 and ubRMSE of 0.51, respectively. The ERA-Interim-based estimation results were underestimated due to the overestimation of the ERA-Interim soil moisture data. Obvious differences were observed between the ALT of the alpine meadow areas and alpine desert areas. Our results demonstrate that the combination of temporal-spatial multilayer soil moisture data and the MT-InSAR method with S-1 images is a promising approach for the large-scale characterization of ALT.

AB  - Forecasting traffic accidents at a fine-grained spatial scale is essential to provide effective precautions and improve traffic safety in smart urban sensing applications. Current solutions primarily rely on complete historical traffic accident records and/or accurate real-time traffic sensor data for traffic risk prediction. These solutions are prone to various limitations (e.g., facility availability, privacy and legal constraints). In this paper, we address those limitations by exploring two types of widely available and complementary data sources: social media sensing and remote sensing. However, three important technical challenges exist: i) the social media data and remote sensing data often have different data modalities and characteristics, which makes it difficult to effectively fuse them for traffic risk forecasting; ii) the social media data is often noisy, providing fuzzy evidence to capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of traffic accident occurrences; iii) the remote sensing data often contains complex visual features, making it a non-trivial task to explore the accident occurrence correlation between different locations. To address the above challenges, we propose GraphCast, a multi-modal graph neural network framework to accurately forecast the traffic risks in a city by jointly exploring the social media sensing and remote sensing paradigms. The evaluation results on a real-world case study in New York City show that our GraphCast scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art conventional and deep learning baselines in accurately forecasting the traffic risks in a city.

T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - This long-term span retrospective study aimed to determine the incidence and spatial-temporal trends of liver cancer in Wuwei city from 1995 to 2016 to provide scientific knowledge on the prevention and treatment of liver cancer. Data from the medical records of liver cancer patients treated in 12 sentinel hospitals in Wuwei city were extracted. SAS and Joinpoint software were used for data analysis, ArcGIS 10.2 software was used to make geographical distribution map, and SaTScan 9.4 software was used for clustering area detection. Of 2271 patients with liver cancer (average age, 58.73 years), 17.7% were 60 to 64 years of age. Majority were males (1680, 74%), with a sex ratio of 2.84. Joinpoint regression analysis from 1995 to 2016 revealed that the standardized liver cancer rate increased [annual average rate of change (AAPC) = 12.80% (95% CI: 9.5%-16.7%)], with a joinpoint in 2009. From 1995 to 2009, the change in overall APC was statistically significant [APC = 16.7 (95% CI: 12.3%-21.3%)]. The average incidence was the highest in Hongshagang Town. After 2005, the incidence gradually increased in each township. Five clusters of liver cancer were noted in Wuwei, including 37 townships. Males had a higher standardized liver cancer rate. After 2009, increase in the incidence of liver cancer was less rapid. The incidence of liver cancer in townships of Wuwei city was non-random, with certain spatial aggregations, covering 37 townships.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Remote sensing has become an important data source for estimating net surface shortwave radiation (NSSR) on glacier surface. However, for a small-scale mountain glacier, NSSR is influenced by not only the atmospheric environment and the sunearth geometric system but also other surface features, such as terrain and the surface anisotropic reflectance characteristics. In this study, an integrated approach is proposed to obtain the spatial distribution of NSSR with the aid of a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM), Landsat TM images, and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) atmospheric and BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) products. The estimation results of 18 typical observation periods closest to the corresponding MODIS overpass times show that NSSR exhibits very strong temporal and spatial heterogeneity in the Dayekou watershed of the Heihe River Basin, which is greatly affected by atmospheric and terrain environments. Verification results show that this algorithm performs well; the square of the correlation coefficient (R2) is 0.756, the mean bias error percentage (MBE%) are and the root-mean-square difference percentage (RMSD%) are -8.8% and 10.1%, respectively.

This study focuses on detecting infrastructure constructions, such as residential areas, commercial building, and roads, in the State of Maryland (US) from 2018 to 2019 by utilizing Sentinel-2 images at 10 m spatial resolution. We use a time-series of Sentinel-2 images to derive land cover maps in 2018 and 2019 and derive the change detection map. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network is used to classify satellite images into general land cover classes (impervious surface, forest/tree cover, grassland/cropland, water). The derived change detection map allows one to identify areas of changes with new constructions.

AB  - A novel bacteriocin, PE-ZYB1, was produced by Pediococcus pentosaceus zy-B that was isolated from the intestine of Mirnachiamys nobilis and collected from the South China Sea. The bacteriocin PE-ZYB1 was purified using acetic ether extraction, Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography, sepharose cation exchange chromatography and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), in succession. Its molecular mass was determined to be MW 2019.22 Da, and its N-terminal amino acid sequence was DLFNKFNRSMQYGNGVE. The PE-ZYB1 was confirmed as a novel bacteriocin through a homology search, using UniProt BLAST (NO. A0A1Y0VLN8). Bacteriocin PE-ZYB1 was found to have extensive spectrum antimicrobial activity against both Grain-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Bacteriocin PE-ZYB1 showed resistance to heat, was highly stable over pH 2-7 and was sensitive to trypsin. Increased extracellular electrical conductivity was detected for Listeria. monocytogenes treated by bacteriocin PE-ZYB1. Furthermore, bacteriocin PE-ZYB1 bactericidally destroyed the cell membrane integrity of L. monocyingenes, resulting in cell membrane perforation and permeabilization. These results indicate the potential of the bacteriocin PE-ZYB1 for use as a food bio-preservative.

TI  - Long-Term (1986-2018) Evolution of Channel Bars in Response to Combined Effects of Cascade Reservoirs in the Middle Reaches of the Hanjiang River
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Channel bars are essential landforms and their evolution is crucial to aquatic and riparian biodiversity, river's water-sediment process, and economic development. With the development of water conservation facilities and hydropower projects, numerous changes have been taken place in hydrological regimes and morphology. There have been many changes on channel bars in the middle reaches of Hanjiang River due to the combined effects of cascade reservoirs. However, little was known about such dynamics and their linkages to cascade dams across the entire downstream area. Using Landsat remote sensing images from 1986-2018 and the threshold binary Otsu extraction method, this study completed comprehensive monitoring of nine mid-channel bars (DX1-DX7, XZ1, and XZ2), and three shoal group (XZ3-XZ5) dynamics. Results showed that the mid-channel bars' area in the reach from Danjiangkou to Xiangyang (DX) decreased over the past 33 years, with the exception of DX4, while the total area decreased by 23.19%, this channel bars' area change was mainly influenced by backwater from the Cuijiaying Reservoir with high water level after 2010 (r = -0.93, p < 0.01). The total channel bar area from Xiangyang to Huangzhuang (XZ) decreased by 16.63% from 1986 to 2018. The total channel bar area in XZ had a strong negative correlation with runoff at Huangzhuang hydrologic station (r = -0.79, p < 0.05), which was partly attributed to upstream precipitation according to the high correlation between runoff and precipitation (R-2 = 0.65). In general, the DX section was under equilibrium between scouring and deposition compared to downstream Xiangyang, the bars in DX section were mainly affected by water level, and bars in XZ section during 1986-2018 were complicated because it was upstream eroded and downstream deposited. In addition, vegetation cover, revetments, flood events, sand mining, land use, and over-exploitation may cause channel bar area dynamics. Hence, more continuous investigations are suggested to focus on effects of cascade reservoir operation on hydrological regime, as well as the changing morphology of channel bars in the middle reaches of the Hanjiang River.

TI  - Threshold-Based Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Model Integration (TA-GMMI) Algorithm for Mapping Snow Cover in Mountainous Terrain
T2  - CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is an important parameter in the fields of computer modeling, engineering technology and energy development. With the extensive growth of novel hardware and software compositions creating smart, cyber physical systems' (CPS) efficient end-to-end workflows. In order to provide accurate snow detection results for the CPS's terminal, this paper proposed a snow cover detection algorithm based on the unsupervised Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for the FY-4A satellite data. At present, most snow cover detection algorithms mainly utilize the characteristics of the optical spectrum, which is based on the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) with thresholds in different wavebands. These algorithms require a large amount of manually labeled data for statistical analysis to obtain the appropriate thresholds for the study area. Consideration must be given to both the high and low elevations in the study area. It is difficult to extract all snow by a fixed threshold in mountainous and rugged terrains. In this research, we avoid relying on a manual analysis for different elevations. Therefore, an algorithm based on the GMM is proposed, integrating the threshold-based algorithm and the GMM. First, the threshold-based algorithm with transferred thresholds from other satellites' analysis results are used to coarsely classify the surface objects. These results are then used to initialize the parameters of the GMM. Finally, the parameters of that model are updated by an expectation-maximum (EM) iteration algorithm, and the final results are outputted when the iterative conditions end. The results show that this algorithm can adjust itself to mountainous terrain with different elevations, and exhibits a better performance than the threshold-based algorithm. Compared with orbit satellites' snow products, the accuracy of the algorithm used for FY-4A is improved by nearly 2%, and the snow detection rate is increased by nearly 6%. Moreover, compared with microwave sensors' snow products, the accuracy is increased by nearly 3%. The validation results show that the proposed algorithm can be adapted to a complex terrain environment in mountainous areas and exhibits good performance under a transferred threshold without manually assigned labels.

TI  - Can Remotely Sensed Actual Evapotranspiration Facilitate Hydrological Prediction in Ungauged Regions Without Runoff Calibration?
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Runoff prediction in ungauged catchments is a significant hydrological challenge. The common approach is to calibrate hydrological models against streamflow data from gauged catchments, and then regionalize or transfer parameter values from the gauged calibration to predict runoff in the ungauged catchments. This paper explores the potential for using parameter values from hydrological models calibrated solely against readily available remotely sensed evapotranspiration data to estimate runoff time series. The advantage of this approach is that it does not require observed streamflow data for model calibration and is therefore particularly useful for runoff prediction in poorly gauged or ungauged regions. The modeling experiments are carried out using data from 222 catchments across Australia. The results from the remotely sensed evapotranspiration runoff-free calibration are encouraging, particularly in simulating monthly runoff and mean annual runoff in the wetter catchments. However, results for daily runoff and in the drier regions are relatively poor, and further developments are needed to realize the benefit of direct model calibration against remotely sensed data to predict runoff in ungauged catchments.

TI  - Mask-R-FCN: A Deep Fusion Network for Semantic Segmentation
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image classification plays a significant role in urban applications, precision agriculture, water resource management. The task of classification in the field of remote sensing is to map raw images to semantic maps. Typically, fully convolutional network (FCN) is one of the most effective deep neural networks for semantic segmentation. However, small objects in remote sensing images can be easily overlooked and misclassified as the majority label, which is often the background of the image. Although many works have attempted to deal with this problem, making a trade-off between background semantics and edge details is still a problem. This is mainly because they are based on a single neural network model. To deal with this problem, a convolutional deep network with regions (R-CNN), which is highly effective for object detection is leveraged as a complementary component in our work. A learning-based and decision-level strategy is applied to fuse both semantic maps from a semantic model and an object detection model. The proposed network is referred to as Mask-R-FCN. Experimental results on real remote sensing images from the Zurich dataset, Gaofen Image Dataset (GID), and DataFountain2017 show that the proposed network can obtain higher accuracy than single deep neural networks and other machine learning algorithms. The proposed network achieved better average accuracies, which are approximately 2% higher than those of any other single deep neural networks on the Zurich, GID, and DataFoundation2017 datasets.

AB  - Multiple leaf area index (LAI) products have been generated from satellite remote sensing data. These products are used to monitor global environmental changes, climate change, and carbon cycles. However, these products have too low spatial resolution to meet various application requirements. For example, crop growth monitoring and yield estimation require the higher spatial resolution LAI product. In this study, a method was proposed to generate 250m spatial resolution LAI product from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer(MODIS) surface reflectance data using general regression neural networks (GRNNs). A dataset from MODIS surface reflectance product (MOD09Q1), MODIS observation geometry data, and Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI product during the period from 2001-2017 was used to train the GRNNs in this study. Because the spatial resolution of these data are inconsistent, we proposed a downscaling method based on pure pixels to unify the spatial resolution of these data to 250m. we can get the GRNNs by training these datasets. Then, the MOD09Q1 surface reflectance and the corresponding observation geometry are entered into the GRNNs to retrieve LAI values. The retrieved LAI values were compared with the Geoland3 (GEOV3) LAI product and validated by ground measured LAI values. The results demonstrated that the method can get better temporal profiles than the GEOV3 LAI product. And the retrieved LAI values are in good agreement with the ground measured LAI values (R2 = 078861 and RMSE = 0.5645).

AB  - This paper makes a comparison of the retrieval of sea level pressure using 50-60 GHz and 118.75 GHz passive microwave observations. The 50-60 GHz passive observations of the Microwave Temperature Sounder-II (MWTS-II) and 118.75 GHz observations of the Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder (MWHTS) onboard the Chinese Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) meteorological satellite were used to carry out the comparison. Based on neural networkbased retrieval algorithm, sea surface atmospheric pressure retrieval models for MWTS-II and MWHTS were established, respectively. Passive microwave observations from January 2018 to October 2019 and the corresponding Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) Final (FNL) analysis data were used to develop and test the retrieval models. Results show that the accuracy of sea surface atmospheric pressure from MWTS-II retrieval is similar to that of the MWHTS retrieval for both usual weather conditions and tropical cyclone (TC) conditions. This provides a reference for high spatial resolution surface pressure observations by passive microwave instruments from low orbit satellites and high temporal resolution observations from geostationary orbit in the future.

M3  - Data study
AB  - Detecting topographic changes in an urban environment and keeping city-level point clouds up-to-date are important tasks for urban planning and monitoring. In practice, remote sensing data are often available only in different modalities for two epochs. Change detection between airborne laser scanning data and photogrammetric data is challenging due to the multi-modality of the input data and dense matching errors. The data contain three sub-datasets: "ALS-g-raw.las" are the ground laser points. "ALS-u-raw.las" are the non-ground laser points. "RawPC(lasgrid)(39M).las" are the dense matching points. Our method proposes an end-to-end pseudo-Siamese convolutional neural network (PSI-CNN) for change detection between the two types of point clouds.

TI  - Parallel Computing for Obtaining Regional Scale Rice Growth Conditions Based on WOFOST and Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is very important to obtain continuous regional crop parameters efficiently in the agricultural field. However, remote sensing data can provide spatial-continuous / temporal-disperse crop information while crop growth model can provide temporal-continuous / spatial-disperse crop information. Therefore, the assimilation between crop growth model and remote sensing data is an efficient way for obtaining continuous vegetation growth information. This study aims to present a parallel method based on graphic processing unit (GPU) to improve the efficiency of the assimilation between RS data and crop growth model to estimate rice growth parameters. Remote sensing data, Landsat and HJ-1 images, were collected and the World Food Studies (WOFOST) crop growth model which has a strong flexibility was employed. To acquire continuous regional crop parameters, particle swarm optimization (PSO) data assimilation method was used to combine remote sensing images and WOFOST and this process is accompanied by a parallel method based on the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform of NVIDIA GPU. With these methods, we obtained daily rice growth parameters of Zhuzhou City, Hunan, China and compared the efficiency and precision of parallel method and non-parallel method. Results showed that the parallel program has a remarkable speedup (reaching 240 times) compared with the non-parallel program with a similar accuracy. This study indicated that the parallel implementation based on GPU was successful in improving the efficiency of the assimilation between RS data and the WOFOST model.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatiotemporal resolution fine particulate matter (PM2.5) simulations can provide important exposure data for the assessment of long-term and short-term health effects. Satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, meteorological data, and topographic data have become key variables for PM2.5 estimation. In this study, a random forest model was developed and used to estimate the highest resolution (0.01 degrees x 0.01 degrees) daily PM2.5 concentrations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Our model had a suitable performance (cv-R-2 = 0.83 and test-R-2 = 0.86). The regional test-R-2 value in southern Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei was higher than that in northern Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. The model performance was excellent at medium to high PM2.5 concentrations. Our study considered meteorological lag effects and found that the boundary layer height of the one-day lag had the most important contribution to the model. AOD and elevation factors were also important factors in the modeling process. High spatiotemporal resolution PM2.5 concentrations in 2010-2016 were estimated using a random forest model, which was based on PM2.5 measurements from 2013 to 2016.

TI  - Mapping large-area tidal flats without the dependence on tidal elevations: A case study of Southern China
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems are under increased pressure from climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Tidal flat maps are necessary for managing, protecting, and restoring coastal ecosystems. Most of the existing tidal flat mapping approaches that are dependent on modelled tidal elevations, suffer high uncertainty over offshore, especially over areas where the tidal conditions have been changed by human-made structures and anthropogenic impacts. Meanwhile, these approaches separate the tidal flats in estuaries by a coastal distance rather than actual distance of saltwater intrusion. In this study, we propose a tidal flat mapping approach, using a new method to avoid the dependence on tidal elevations. The proposed approach synthesizes large-area satellite observations over a time period, to acquire the high and low tidal datum, and then classifies land and water under each tidal datum utilizing an adaptive binary classifier. The tidal flats are identified as areas being water during high tides and being land during low tides. Furthermore, the proposed approach uses the distribution of salt vegetation (i.e., mangroves) as a salinity proxy to particularly identify the tidal flats in estuaries. The proposed approach was applied for mapping the tidal flats in southern China (covering over a half of the coastline of China) utilizing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from July 2016 to July 2018. The results achieved an overall accuracy of 92.4% and an agreement rate of 70.5% with the most recent global tidal flat map. The proposed approach does not depend on the modelled tidal elevations or large sample sets and could be easily applied for mapping tidal flats globally.

AB  - Surface albedo is an important land surface characteristic parameter in the study of radiation an energy balance, which can determine the distribution process of radiant energy between the earth's surface and the atmosphere. In this paper, we propose a direct estimation algorithm based on FY-3D Medium Resolution Spectral Imager -2 (MERSI-2) top of atmosphere reflectivity (TOA). The core of this algorithm is to establish a regression relationship between MERSI-2 TOA and shortwave surface broadband albedo. First, the 6S atmospheric radiation transmission model is used to simulate the TOA of MERIS-2 and MODIS under various atmospheric conditions, multiple observation angles, and various BRDF surface characteristics. Next, a linear regression method is proposed to obtain the conversion coefficient between TOA of MERSI-2 and MODIS. Finally, convert MODIS albedo lookup table into MERSI-2 albedo lookup table. FY-3D MERSI-2 surface albedo can be obtained by calling MERSI-2 lookup table. The cross-validation results show that the proposed algorithm obtains better performance.

AB  - Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is a signal emitted by chlorophyll molecules after the absorption of solar radiation. SIF is closely related with the photosynthetic activity of vegetation, and it could be used as an indicator of photosynthetic status. SIF retrieved from spaceborne measurements can provide a synoptic perspective of the surface targets. The recently launched TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board of Sentinel-5 precursor provides dataset for the retrieval of SIF with an unprecedented resolution in spatial and temporal dimensions. In this study, we implemented a data-driven approach to retrieval of SIF at red spectral peak measured from TROPOMI. We chose a retrieval window ranging from 669 to 686 nm, a subset of TROPOMI's band 5 because this wavelength range is free from atmospheric absorption and covers several solar Fraunhofer lines. Preliminary retrieval results indicated that the modeled spectra through the forward model accurately fit the measured spectra within the fitting window of TROPOMI. Global composites of the red SIF at 685 nm extracted from TROPOMI measurement on 3-13 June, 2019, show reasonably high and low values as expected in different parts of the world. Comparisons with independent far-red TROPOMI SIF product, Normalized difference vegetation index calculated from TROPOMI's apparent reflectance factors, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer gross primary productivity product show similar spatial patterns, which confirms that the red TROPOMI SIF is able to provide a reasonable tool to map plant productivity across different regions of the globe.

TI  - Responses of Water Use Efficiency to Drought in Southwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) measures the tradeoff between carbon uptake and water consumption in terrestrial ecosystems. It remains unclear how the responses of WUE to drought vary with drought severity. We assessed the spatio-temporal variations of ecosystem WUE and its responses to drought for terrestrial ecosystems in Southwest China over the period 2000-2017. The annual WUE values varied with vegetation type in the region: Forests (3.25 gC kg(-1)H(2)O) > shrublands (2.00 gC kg(-1)H(2)O) > croplands (1.76 gC kg(-1)H(2)O) > grasslands (1.04 gC kg(-1)H(2)O). During the period 2000-2017, frequent droughts occurred in Southwest China, and overall, drought had an enhancement effect on WUE. However, the effects of drought on WUE varied with vegetation type and drought severity. Croplands were the most sensitive to drought, and slight water deficiency led to the decline of cropland WUE. Over grasslands, mild drought increased its WUE while moderate and severe drought reduced its WUE. For forests and shrublands, mild and moderate drought increased their WUE, and only severe drought reduce their WUE, indicating that these ecosystems had stronger resistance to drought. Assessing the patterns and trends of ecosystem WUE and its responses to drought are essential for understanding plant water use strategy and informing ecosystem water management.

TI  - OpenSARUrban: A Sentinel-1 SAR Image Dataset for Urban Interpretation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1 mission provides a freely accessible opportunity for urban image interpretation based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with a specific resolution, which is of paramount importance for Earth observation. In parallel, with the rapid development of advanced technologies, especially deep learning, we urgently need a large-scale SAR dataset supporting urban image interpretation. This article presents OpenSARUrban: a Sentinel-1 dataset dedicated to the content-related interpretation of urban SAR images, including a well-defined hierarchical annotation scheme, data collection, well-established procedures for dataset compilation and organization as well as properties, visualizations, and applications of this dataset. Particularly, our OpenSARUrban collection provides 33 358 image patches of urban SAR scenes, covering 21 major cities of China, including 10 different target area categories, 4 kinds of data formats, 2 kinds of polarization modes, and owning 5 essential properties: large-scale coverage, diversity, specificity, reliability, and sustainability. These properties guarantee the achievement of several goals for OpenSARUrban. The first one is to support urban target characterization. The second one is to help develop well-applicable and advanced algorithms for Sentinel-1 urban target classification. The third one is to explore content-based image retrieval for these kinds of data. In addition, dataset visualization is implemented from the perspective of manifolds to give an intuitive understanding. Besides a detailed description and visualization of the dataset, we present results of some benchmarking algorithms, demonstrating that this dataset is practical and challenging. Notably, developing algorithms to enhance the classification performance on the whole dataset and considering the data imbalance are especially demanding.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the Landsat 5 TM/Landsat 8 OLI images of Guilin City in 2002, 2012, and 2017, the object-oriented land use classification method and mathematical models (such as transfer matrix and dynamic degree), as well as the Chinese ecosystem service unit area value equivalent factor table, were used to quantifiably analyze the land use status and changes in the value of ecosystem services in Guilin from 2002 to 2017. The results showed that forest land was the main matrix type in the study area. During the study period, forest land and unused land were the types of land that had increased and decreased the most, respectively, while the reduced unused land was mainly transferred to forest land and cultivated land. The changes in unused land and construction land were particularly intense, and the land use changes of Guilin as a whole continued to increase during the study period. The value of ecosystem services in Guilin continued to rise, and the value of ecosystem services on forest land accounts for more than 85% of the entire ecosystem. The value of services such as soil formation and protection, water conservation, and biodiversity conservation were higher within the value of each individual service. In contrast, services such as food production had the lowest value, indicating that the service function of Guilin's ecosystem was far greater than the productive function.

TI  - LAND COVER CLASSIFICATION BASED ON DAILY NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX TIME SERIES FROM MULTITEMPORAL REMOTELY SENSED DATA
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover information is a critical parameter in various research fields affecting regional ecology and environment. This study explored the application of daily normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series on land cover classification in an irrigation area. The study area is located in Wugong and Fufeng of the Baojixia irrigation area. First, the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) and harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) filtering methods were employed in unequal-interval NDVI time series derived from the Huan Jing-1 A/B satellite. Second, daily NDVI time series data were acquired through spatial interpolation and the data was classified using a support vector machine (SVM). Finally, the parameters of the SVM classifier were optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA), which was used in the land cover classification based on daily NDVI time series. The results revealed that the S-G filtering was superior to HANTS for filtering the unequal-interval NDVI time series. Processing the daily NDVI time series through spatial interpolation substantially improved the land use classification accuracy contributing to an increase in phenological information of daily NDVI time series. Finally, the optimal parameters of the SVM classifier were determined using the GA as gamma = 0.0933 and C = 49.5643, and the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the classification results based on daily NDVI time series using GA-SVM were 98.24% and 0.9789, respectively, which demonstrates that GASVM had a substantial effect on land cover classification. These results could provide an empirical basis for further application of daily NDVI time series on land cover classification in irrigation areas.

TI  - ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH FOR EVAPOTRANSPIRATION DOWNSCALING BASED ON REMOTE SENSING
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate determination of evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial for water resource management. This study presented a method based on an artificial neural network (ANN) approach that can conduct ET downscaling with or without using thermal infrared data. However, obtaining ET data with both high temporal and spatial resolutions is a challenge because of the constraints of satellite technology. Therefore, this study adopted an ANN approach for ET downscaling to resolve the aforementioned problem. This approach provided ET data with high temporal and spatial resolutions. The path analysis results indicated that in the study areas (Wugong and Fufeng, China), the land surface temperature (LST) was the dominant factor that affected daily ET. Obtaining LST information from thermal infrared data is difficult because of the sensor's spatial and temporal resolutions, and an ANN approach that does not require thermal infrared data for ET downscaling is necessary. Results revealed a strong correlation between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and LST during summer. Based on this finding, the NDVI can be considered a predictor variable to obtain LST data by using moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Finally, we applied the established ANN model to Huanjing- 1B data, and the results demonstrated that the ANN model can suitably estimate summer ET data by using a combination of downscaled LST data and a digital elevation model. Thus, the ANN model, which does not require thermal infrared data, can be accurately used for ET downscaling during summer.

AB  - To reduce the topographic influence on the high-resolution optical remote sensing data, a radiation based topographic correction method was developed in this study by normalizing the solar illumination differences in mountain areas with the use of high-resolution downward shortwave radiation data (DSR). The coarse-resolution Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) SEVIRI DSR product was downscaled to the same spatial scale as the Landsat 8/OLI data to obtain the high-resolution DSR. The correction results indicated that the corrected spectral reflectance is poorer correlated with solar illumination than the original one. In addition, the corrected images also maintain the spectral characteristics with few overcorrections. Therefore, the proposed method will be of good potential in mountain remote sensing data process to reduce the topographic impacts.

TI  - Impervious Surface Extraction by Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis with Post-Processing Model
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimations of impervious surface areas are essential for urban planning development. Linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) is commonly adopted to extract the impervious surface (IS) fraction in a mixed pixel at the subpixel scale. However, owing to errors in the spectra of pure pixels selected from remote sensing images, incorrect fractions of different land cover types often emerge after unmixing. In this study, two Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images-acquired on 20 September 2019 (Path/Row: 121/44) and 14 November 2019 (Path/Row: 122/44)-of Guangzhou and Shenzhen were unmixed by LSMA using spectral indices in endmember selection. A post-processing model using the Dry Bare-soil Index (DBSI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as thresholds was established to improve the IS fraction of the LSMA result. Comparative analysis reveals that LSMA with the post-processing model achieves better performance for IS fraction extraction (R-2 = 0.910 and 0.926 and root mean square error [RMSE] = 10.08% and 10.83% for Guangzhou and Shenzhen, respectively), and the distribution of IS is basically consistent with the IS of the actual areas. The post-processing model solves the problem of overestimation of pervious surface and underestimation of impervious surface.

AB  - For crop growth monitoring task, process-based model is widely used to simulating plants biophysical processes using agrometeorological data, soil properties and plant management. However there is limitation for these models mainly due to availability, uncertainty and spatial variation of model parameters. To solve these problems, empirical models built using machine learning algorithms was developed to predict sugarcane sucrose content based on multi-temporal spectral data with a combination of agrometeorological data. The performance of the built models is evaluated with comparison of statistical model and machine learning model with only spectral data. The result shows that the machine learning model has a better performance compared with statistical model. Moreover, in addition of multi-temporal imformations from both spectral and agrometeorological data there is an apparently improvement on sugarcane sucrose prediction accuracy.

AB  - GAOFEN-4 is a high-resolution optical remote sensing satellite on geosynchronous orbit, which has been found the potential to monitor the moving ships on the sea. Some classic moving ships target detection algorithms are studied. A new algorithm is proposed for the sequence images of GAOFEN-4 satellite, which can effectively suppress the interference of noise on moving ships target detection by performing the defogging of dark channel prior and a moving detection with visual background extractor. Some experiments are executed with real sequence images. It shows that the new algorithm is better than classic target detection algorithms for the sequence images.

AB  - Island mass effect, which is accompanied by higher bio-productivity and closely associated with fishing activities, was observed in many island (reefs) areas. Recently, we found the Chl-a enrichment (the annual mean >= 0.14 mg/m(3)) in the surrounding of the reefs and atolls in the Xisha Archipelago, based on the daily MODISA Level-2 data during the years of 2003 to 2017. The DINEOF algorithm was used to filling missing values in the MODISA data. The analysis results show that: 1) Generally, the Chl-a concentrations became larger in winter (November to January) and smaller in summer (May to July) in the XA; The seasonal variation of Chl-a is strongly related to the Mixed Layer Depth, which is larger in winter and smaller in summer. 2) In the XA, higher Chl-a were observed in the lagoons of the atolls, where is shallow and nutritious. Hovmoller diagrams of daily MODIS Chl-a along the transect of several atolls show that higher Chl-a also appeared in the downstream side. It seems that the lagoons are the sources of the Chl-a, and the turbulent currents transfer and maintain the higher Chl-a in the downstream wakes.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the structure of the image of the author and the character in satirical magazines published in Orenburg in the early 20th century. The study shows that creation of a literary "mask" and the dialogization of main characters' speech are the key methods to reflect the author's position, who is forced to maneuver between the reader and voluntary censorship.Parody, being an integral part of the arsenal of satirical poetics, contributes to effective intervention in the inconsistencies of modern reality, their correction or eradication. However, the external layer of tests, thanks to the malicious, ambivalent irony, preserves a completely noble and emotionally neutral form of appeal to contemporaries discussing everyday problems. It focuses on the hidden mechanisms of modern reality, affecting consciousness, worldview and social position of an individual and the stages of its development.Parodying the speech of representatives of various social classes, the author, using specific vocabulary and stylistics, clearly delineated the boundaries. It was possible to go beyond them only for a representative of a journalistic community that owned a palette of diverse means and techniques. They stylized characteristic noble metaphorization, merchant and bureaucratic symbolization, masking the lack of both spirituality and reason for existence in the description of peasants' life, striking by its terrifying reality.The editorial policy of magazines is clearly reflected in the selection of materials for their distribution on the page. After accusatory materials relevant to the political and public life of the city, everyday genre paintings of national disasters and oppression are placed. It strengthens the reader's need for change.

AB  - In the article the worldview basis of new European conception of state is being analyzed. Rationalistic tendencies in the European culture are recognised to be a key factor, which has determined the specifics of understanding of essence and goals of state. For the political teachings of New age state appears to be a garant of reasonable principles keeping in the societies' life. Many authors linked the inevitability of conflicts between people in the natural state with the effect of irrational passions. The idea of state and it's realisation in the form of mechanism, based on the contract, were determined by the fear of chaos and the threat of violence in the natural state. The main goal of state, which was understood by many thinkers of New age as safety guarantee and life's rational organization, required the extension of sphere of management impact and control. So, being closely connected with the rationalism, new European conception of state undergoes change in the situation of modern worldview's crisis.

M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2007, a large-scare green macroalgae bloom of Ulva prolifera has occurred every year in the Yellow Sea, and satellite ocean color remote sensing monitoring of such event is an effective technical method with important application value. For the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI), Landsat8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Gaofen satellite (GF1) multispectral satellite data of the study area, the bloom was monitored based on spectral band difference algorithms and band-ratio algorithms. In view of the threshold selection of the detection, the scaled algae index (SAT) is less sensitive to the environment and shows accurate stability. For the five satellite ocean color sensors, this study compared their ability to monitor algal bloom on spatial and temporal scales. On the spatial scale, quantitative results of each data are specifically compared. Low spatial resolution data was found to overestimate the blooming area. On the time scale, GOCI can best monitor the dynamic changes of bloom, and the composites of algae and sea surface wind shows the dynamic evolution of blooming event in the range from May to July 2017.

AB  - In the rugged mountains, the undulations of the terrain will affect the geometric and radiation characteristics of SAR imaging, resulting in SAR image distortion, which hinders its comprehensive application in the field of land subsidence monitoring, landslide disaster monitoring and so on. This article takes ALOS PALSAR as an example, combined with satellite orbit fitting technology to optimize parameters, based on the R-D positioning model, using DEM to simulate SAR images and extract parameters such as local incident angle, projection angle, and backscatter coefficient. The simulated SAR image is used to achieve the ortho-rectification of the original SAR image. The calculation method of the local incidence and projection angles and the backscattering coefficient is used to construct the terrain radiation correction model of the SAR image. The experimental results show that the research method is significantly effective, the mean square error of the radiant intensity of the image after correction is significantly reduced, and the texture characteristics of the image are significantly enhanced.This has certain practical significance for the application researchon SAR image in information extraction, interpretation,quantitative analysis and parameter inversion.

AB  - This study combines object-based image analysis (OBIA) and deep learning (DL) techniques for automatic risk source extraction and risk assessment in drinking water sources using high-spatial-resolution (HSR) imagery. HSR images are first segmented to obtain the object primitives (OP), and the DL training samples are collected based on the OPs. U-Net semantic segmentation and object-based classification methods are then used to extract the risk source targets. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method is used to obtain the weights of risk sources. The risk assessment model is then established which comprehensively evaluates the safety level of drinking water source environment. Experiments at the Jiajiang water source of Nanjing city are carried out based on china's GaoFen-2 (GF-2) imagery, in which the risk sources such as farmlands, woodlands, grasslands, roads, and industrial and residential buildings are extracted and evaluated of their risk influences by the comprehensive risk assessment index (RAI). It shows that on December 12, 2018, the environment of Jiajiang drinking water source is at a safety level of "high".

AB  - Based on multi-phase night-time light remote sensing data obtained by the Luojia-1 satellite (11-01), the visual interpretation of images and statistics of night-time light is adopted to conduct a comparative analysis of the light intensity information of the airport runway within 1 km and the surroundings of Beijing Capital Airport and Daxing Airport. The results demonstrate that there are multiple strong light sources within 1 km of Beijing Capital Airport, yet their configurations are not consistent with navigation lights. Meanwhile, at present, the overall interference around Beijing Daxing Airport is relatively weak. As neighboring areas develop, interferences by non-aviation light may increase and require constant attention. To the best of our knowledge, this study reports the application of night-time light remote sensing technology in the identification of non-aviation light and the improvement of runway safety for the first time. In addition, advantages and limitations of satellite remote sensing in runway safety are discussed from aspects such as data availability, technical feasibility, and economic effectiveness.

AB  - Here we present a physics-based decorrelation phase covariance model and discuss its role in effective decorrelation noise reduction in interferogram stacks. We test our model in both Cascadia - a rapidly decorrelating region, and Death Valley - a slowly decorrelating region, with observations collected by Sentinel-1. We find that in Cascadia, including redundant interferograms in the stack reduces phase variance from 0.28 rad(2) to 0.04 rad(2), while in Death Valley, both redundant and independent interferogram stacking yield phase variances of 0.10 rad(2). Both observations are consistent with predictions from our model.Comparing with three existing decorrelation phase covariance models, our proposed model matches observations with the smallest average discrepancy between theory and observations - 0.017 rad2 in Cascadia and 0.066 rad(2) in Death Valley.

AB  - Bridge owners face aging physical assets and increasing traffic demand resulting from urbanization and emerging autonomous freight and vehicles. The available public funding however can hardly keep up with the needs. The State of Washington has identified needed repairs on 6,080 bridges at an estimated cost of $9.2B. An innovative approach is proposed to transform how bridge assets in Washington State could be managed and financed using efficient and digital (tokenized) financing models. The informational inefficiencies derived from bridge traffic, structural health monitoring, historical repairs, and upgrades, coupled to remote sensing data from drones and satellites can be valued and priced, either as cash flows or equity value. These, in turn, are integrated into efficient financial instruments, including tokenization, to lower transaction cost and risks, and to overcome the limitation of small project size. This paper describes the framework of digitization, bridge performance analytics, and data market in the context of innovative financing, risks and uniqueness of Washington State transportation development.

TI  - Sentinel approach to detect emerging causes of work-related respiratory diseases
T2  - OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The world of work is continually changing, and this could result in new and emerging risks being introduced, including those that may cause work-related respiratory diseases (WRRD).Aims To describe recently emerging and new cases of WRRD and the relevant methodology using data in a national occupational respiratory disease surveillance scheme in the UK.Methods Incident cases of respiratory diseases reported by physicians to the Surveillance of Work-related and Occupational Respiratory Disease (SWORD) between January 2015 and December 2017 were included. Potentially emerging respiratory hazards manifesting in SWORD data were identified with the following hierarchical approach: (i) new respiratory disease not previously associated with work, (ii) specific exposure/agent not previously associated with WRRD and (iii) industry and/or occupation not previously associated with WRRD.Results A total of 1215 cases of WRRD were reported to SWORD between January 2015 and December 2017. No new WRRD were identified. Thirteen potentially emerging causes of occupational asthma were identified, including exposures to agents such as ninhydrin. Four potential new causes were identified for interstitial pneumonia, which included wood and brass dust.Two potentially emerging causes of WRRD were identified for inhalational accidents (green coffee and nitrocellulose), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (diphenylmethane diisocyanate and salami mould), rhinitis (morphine and Amaranthus quitensis) and sarcoidosis (prions and horses).Conclusions Continuous monitoring and reporting of any new work-related disease is a critical function of any occupational disease reporting scheme. Potential emerging causes of work-related health risks have been identified by using a simple and systematic way of detecting emerging causes of WRRDs.

AB  - With taking into account the electric load, a simplified 4-hi stack HBM structure model containing through-silicon-vias (TSVs) with a 3x6 distributed matrix in each hierarchical level is built. Distributions of temperature, current density and voltage, as well as the mechanical behavior of TSVs and the micro-bump joints in the HBM model are characterized by finite element simulation. To clarify the roles of various coupled physical fields playing in influencing the performance of TSVs and micro-bump joints, the comprehensive simulations were conducted under the conditions of electro-thermo-mechanical fields, electro-mechanical fields and thermo-mechanical fields, respectively. The simulation results indicate that under the electro-thermo-mechanical fields, not only Joule heating occurs but also the current crowding effect appears at the corners between Cu pads and micro-bump joints, as well as at both ends of TSVs. Notably, the maximum current density under the electro-mechanical fields is larger than that under the electro-thermo-mechanical fields. In addition, the Cu protrusion height at lower ends of TSVs is larger than that at upper ends. For micro-bump joints with the viscoplastic deformation behavior, the strain concentration exhibits a symmetrical distribution along the ZY plane (X=0).

TI  - Grouping-Based Time-Series Model for Monitoring of Fall Peak Coloration Dates Using Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of plant phenology is vital to effective understanding and prediction of the response of vegetation ecosystems to climate change. Satellite remote sensing is extensively employed to monitor vegetation phenology. However, fall phenology, such as peak foliage coloration, is less well understood compared with spring phenological events, and is mainly determined using the vegetation index (VI) time-series. Each VI only emphasizes a single vegetation property. Thus, selecting suitable VIs and taking advantage of multiple spectral signatures to detect phenological events is challenging. In this study, a novel grouping-based time-series approach for satellite remote sensing was proposed, and a wide range of spectral wavelengths was considered to monitor the complex fall foliage coloration process with simultaneous changes in multiple vegetation properties. The spatial and temporal scale effects of satellite data were reduced to form a reliable remote sensing time-series, which was then divided into groups, namely pre-transition, transition and post-transition groups, to represent vegetation dynamics. The transition period of leaf coloration was correspondingly determined to divisions with the smallest intra-group and largest inter-group distances. Preliminary results using a time-series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from 2002 to 2013 at the Harvard Forest (spatial scale: similar to 3500 m; temporal scale: similar to 8 days) demonstrated that the method can accurately determine the coloration period (correlation coefficient: 0.88; mean absolute difference: 3.38 days), and that the peak coloration periods displayed a shifting trend to earlier dates. The grouping-based approach shows considerable potential in phenological monitoring using satellite time-series.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Global inventory modeling and mapping studies (GIMMS) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), from 1982 to 2010, were used to simulate the grass coverage and analyze its spatial pattern and changes. The response of grass coverage to climatic variations at annual and monthly time scales was analyzed (during the 29 years, the nationwide annual temperature increased with a mean rate of 0.04 degrees C/year and precipitation decreased with a mean rate of -0.39 mm/year; however, in northwest China, precipitation increased). Grass coverage distribution had increased from northwest to southeast across China. During 1982-2010, the mean nationwide grass coverage was 34%, but exhibited apparent spatial heterogeneity being the highest (61.4%) in slope grasslands and the lowest (17.1%) in desert grasslands. There was a slight increase in the grass coverage over the study period with a rate of 0.17% per year. Regionally, the largest increase of grass coverage was observed in northwest China and Tibetan Plateau. Increase in slope grasslands coverage was as high as 0.27% per year, while in the plain grasslands and meadows, the grass coverage increase was the lowest (being 0.11% per year and 0.1% per year, respectively). Across China, the grass coverage with extremely significant increase (P < 0.01) and significant increase (P < 0.05) accounted for 46.03% and 11% of the total grassland area, respectively, while those with extremely significant and significant decrease accounted for only 4.1% and 3.24%, respectively. At the annual time scale, there are no significant correlations between grass coverage and annual mean temperature and precipitation for the total grassland area. However, the grass coverage was somewhat affected by temperature in alpine and sub-alpine grassland, alpine and sub-alpine meadow, slope grassland and meadow, while grass coverage in desert grassland and plain grassland was more affected by precipitation. At the monthly time scale, there are significant correlations between grass coverage with both temperature and precipitation, indicating that the grass coverage is more affected by seasonal fluctuations of hydrothermal conditions. Additionally, there is one-month time-lag effect between grass coverage and climate factors for each grassland types, and the correlations are the highest between the current months' grass coverage and the former one month's temperature and precipitation.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Grasslands in China are mainly located in ecologically fragile regions, which are sensitive to climate change. During recent decades, grasslands have experienced prominent warming and drying. Therefore, investigating the response of grasslands to climatic variations is necessary for a better understanding of the cumulative consequences of climate change. Grassland net primary productivity (NPP) is an important indicator for evaluating grassland ecosystem conditions. We used multisource remote sensing data and meteorological data to estimate the grassland NPP from 1982 to 2010, based on the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model. The spatial pattern and change trends of grassland NPP were evaluated. The response of grassland NPP changes to climatic variations was also analyzed. The results revealed that the spatial distribution of grassland NPP showed an increasing trend from the northwest to southeast across China. During the period from 1982 to 2010, the grassland mean NPP was 282 gC/m(2)/year, and NPP exhibited apparent spatial heterogeneity, being highest (710 gC/m(2)/year) in the dry heat savanna shrub and grass and lowest (58 gC/m2/year) in the alpine desert. The total annual NPP was 988.3 Tg C. Grassland NPP has increased slightly in the past 30 years, at a rate of 0.6 gC/m(2)/year. Regions showing increasing NPP accounted for 67.2% of the total grassland areas, within which areas with extremely significant (P < 0.01) and significant (P < 0.05) increases accounted for 35.8% and 8.0% of the total grassland area, respectively. Regions showing extremely significant and significant decreases encompassed only 5.8% and 4.8% of total grassland area, respectively. Clear increases in grassland NPP were observed in the west of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Alxa Plateau, and western area of Xinjiang. Areas with a decrease in grassland NPP were mainly distributed in the western regions of Inner Mongolia. Furthermore, the increasing rate of NPP showed temporal variation and differed among different grassland types. The correlation coefficient between NPP and precipitation was larger than that between NPP and temperature. Moreover, the response of grassland NPP to temperature and precipitation differed for different grassland types. There were significant positive correlations between annual precipitation and NPP in temperate desert steppe, temperate steppe, and temperate meadow steppe.

TI  - Developing a fused vegetation temperature condition index for drought monitoring at field scales using Sentinel-2 and MODIS imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series high spatial resolution drought monitoring is essential for effective agricultural management. For more than a decade, the multiyear vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) based on the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been applied to regional drought monitoring. However, the spatial resolutions of AVHRR and MODIS (1 km) often represent mixtures of built-up areas and different vegetation or crop types. In this paper, a framework is proposed to obtain a ten-day interval multiyear VTCI at field scales, which is fused from Sentinel-2 data with a fine spatial resolution (20 m) and ten-day interval Terra MODIS data with a coarse spatial resolution using the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM). This framework includes the disaggregation of the Terra MODIS land surface temperature (LST) using Sentinel-2 data and digital elevation model (DEM) data, the spatiotemporal fusion of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and LST, and drought monitoring by the fused VTCI. The accuracy of this framework for regional drought monitoring was tested in the Guanzhong Plain of China. The results indicate that 1) the Sentinel-2 biophysical products combined with DEM data based on support vector regression can accurately disaggregate the Terra MODIS LST; 2) the ESTARFM has good capability to fuse the NDVI and LST derived from Sentinel-2 and Terra MODIS; 3) the multiyear spatiotemporally fused VTCI, a quantitative drought monitoring index at field scales, can be calculated by using the linear regression between the single-year fused VTCI based on the data in 2018 and the multiyear Terra MODIS VTCI based on an 18-year data record; and 4) the spatiotemporal fusion of the multiyear VTCI can significantly improve the drought monitoring accuracy in the winter wheat and woodland area of the Guanzhong Plain. From mid-March to early May, the multiyear spatiotemporally fused VTCIs have better correlation with the cumulative precipitation over the past 20 days (R-2 is 0.83 in the entire study area) than the multiyear Terra MODIS VTCIs (R-2 is 0.80 in the entire study area). The results of this study demonstrate the potential of using the spatiotemporal fusion algorithm to obtain the multiyear VTCI at field scales and provide an effective method for improving the accuracy of drought monitoring.

TI  - Drought Monitoring Using the Sentinel-3-Based Multiyear Vegetation Temperature Condition Index in the Guanzhong Plain, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) has been shown to perform well for drought monitoring using multiyear advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Compared to single-year VTCI, the VTCI calculated by multiyear data can quantitatively reflect the degree of drought and precipitation in a region. Sentinel-3 is a recently launched remote sensing satellite with high temporal resolution and is similar to the satellites carrying AVHRR and MODIS sensors. One year of Sentinel-3 data is available for calculating the VTCI, and given the need for developing quantitatively drought monitoring capabilities, the aim of this study is to investigate the methods used to calculate the potential multiyear Sentinel-3 VTCI for quantitative drought monitoring. This is based on a comparison with multiyear Terra MODIS VTCI and a correlation analysis with cumulative precipitation data. The analysis results indicate that the potential multiyear Sentinel-3 VTCI can be accurately calculated from the single-year Sentinel-3 VTCI based on the linear correlation between the single-year VTCI and multiyear VTCI derived from Terra MODIS, which do not exhibit obvious systematic deviations from the multiyear Terra MODIS VTCI (the absolute value of the average bias <0.04). The multiyear Sentinel-3 VTCIs can quantitatively reflect the drought levels, which are significantly correlated with the recent cumulative precipitation throughout the study period (R-2 = 0.731, P < 0.001). Therefore, it is proposed that Sentinel-3 can successfully inherit the VTCI-based drought monitoring tasks from MODIS.

TI  - A Practical Plateau Lake Extraction Algorithm Combining Novel Statistical Features and Kullback-Leibler Distance Using Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to wind-induced waves, dry sand, wet snow, and terrain shadows, the lake extraction from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau is accompanied by false alarms. In this article, a practical plateau lake extraction algorithm combining novel statistical features and Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) using SAR imagery has been proposed. First, a mathematical description for the plateau lake surface called object-based generalized gamma distribution (OG Gamma D) features has been proposed, which is able to suppress the false alarms by using spatial context information as the large-scale descriptor. Second, the random forest classifier is used to train a multifeature set, including conventional texture features and OG Gamma D features, and output an initial labeling result. Finally, to suppress the false alarms in the initial lake extraction results, automatic postprocessing based on KLD has been used. The algorithm is tested by several experiments using Sentinel-1 SAR data, performing better than the state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving the overall accuracy of 99.54% while maintaining a false-alarm rate of 0.32%.

AB  - Qingdao coastal water is an important area that provides with traveling, mariculture, etc. On the basis on MODIS satellite remote sensing data from July 2002 to June 2014, the spatial-temporal variation of Chlorophyll-a concentration in Qingdao coastal area are presented, and the results show that, an obvious decrease of Chlorophyll-a concentration from offshore to onshore in a pattern parallel to the coastal line is revealed. The monthly mean Chl-a concentration is the lowest outside the Jiaozhou Bay, the highest in the bay in summer, and the lowest in the bay, the highest in the bay mouth in winter. The variation of yearly average Chl-a concentration shows that it keeps the volatility in the bay and the bay mouth, but slowly rising outside the bay. The temporal and spatial features of the Chl-a concentration in the Qingdao coastal area were affected by the variations of the marine environmental factors, such as light, nutrients, ocean currents, sea surface temperature, mixed layer depth, also related with ingestion of zooplankton and so on.

AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the important dynamic parameters to characterize the physical characteristics of seawater, and it is also an important basic auxiliary parameter for the quantitative observation of other ocean parameters. In view of the lack of remote sensing data mainly caused by cloud cover over the ocean, based on the long-term MODIS Aqua L3 8-day mean SST products from January 2003 to March 2015, the missing data in the East China Sea are reconstructed by Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Function (DINEOF) method, and the reconstruction results are evaluated by error analysis before and after cross-validation data reconstruction. It shows that the image reconstructed by DINEOF method can reflect the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of sea surface temperature in the study area, and the root mean square error of reconstruction is 0.4272. DINEOF method can reconstruct large area missing data without any prior information and has high accuracy.

T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Xiamen is one of China's five major special economic zones and is the core city of Haixi Economic Zone, with a high level of urbanization. Monitoring and driving force analysis of impervious surfaces can increase our understanding of urbanization process and have important significance for urban landscape pattern research and urban ecological environment construction. We used the Landsat remote sensing image data from 1978 to 2018 to reveal the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of the impervious surface landscape in Xiamen in the past 40 years, using the full-restricted least squares method, landscape pattern analysis, slope gradient analysis and correlation analysis. We further analyzed its relationship with social and economic factors. The results showed that, during 1978-2018, the impervious surface of Xiamen increased by 348.96 km(2), with a mean annual increase of 8.72 km(2). The impervious surface dynamics reached a maximum of 9.0% in 2005-2010. More than 86.6% of the impervious surface of Xiamen was distributed within 6 degrees of slope, with a tendency to expand to a greater slope in 2010-2018. With the increases of slope, the proportion of impervious surface decreased, the density of plaque decreased with the shape tending to be regular and continuous, the degree of fragmentation of the impervious surface increased. The increases of impervious surface in Xiamen was significantly related to the regional economic aggregate and population. In the study period, the spatial pattern of impervious surface in Xiamen significantly altered. In the future urban planning process, the extent and speed of impervious surface expansion should be coordinated to avoid ecological problems caused by excessive impervious surface to meet the need for sustainable development of Xiamen.

TI  - Retrieval and Prediction of Three-Dimensional Displacements by Combining the DInSAR and Probability Integral Method in a Mining Area
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring ground displacement produced by underground mining is essential to ensure the safety of infrastructure over mining areas. Differential synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) can only obtain the 1-D [i.e., along the line-of-sight (LOS) direction] displacement component. In this study, we present an improved algorithm for retrieving and predicting 3-D displacement fields induced by underground mining based on the LOS displacement derived from DInSAR and the probability integral method (PIM). Whole parameters included in the standard PIM model are involved in the improved algorithm. In addition, the interaction between multiple working panels is considered and incorporated into the model. Next, a stochastic optimization technique hybridizing the cultural algorithm and random particle swarm optimization has been designed to retrieve model parameters, which can be used to retrieve and predict the 3-D displacement field. Simulated experiments show that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 10, 12, and 17 mm in the vertical, east-west, and north-south directions, respectively, by comparing the simulated and retrieved 3-D displacement. Furthermore, the capability of the proposed method is investigated and validated in the Xuehu mining area of China using three ALOS PALSAR acquisitions. Our results agree well with leveling measurements in the vertical direction with an RMSE of 38 mm. Although the retrieved horizontal displacement cannot be validated due to a lack of field surveys, these displacement fields coincide spatially with the evolution of mining excavation.

AB  - Considering the difficulty of ship detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images lacking color and texture details, we propose a method for SAR ship detection based on hierarchical attention mechanism. Compared with the optical images, the detection methods based on deep-learning for SAR images are aiming at designing a network that is sensitive to high-level features. The proposed method, containing Global Attention Module (GAM) and Local Attention Module (LAM), presents a hierarchical attention strategy respectively from the image level and the target level. GAM in both spatial and channel domain is constructed to highlight target characteristics. Anchor generation is guided by the LAM for locating more accurate candidate regions. Hierarchical attention improves the performance of extracting significant features of SAR images, which makes the algorithm more efficient in detecting small and multiple ship targets. Experiments results show that our method has achieved 0.7 to 4.1 points higher Average Precision (AP) than several state-of-the-art detection methods on SAR datasets of GF-3 and Sentinel-1.

AB  - The artificial sources emitting close to or/and in the L-band are contaminating the collected remote sensing data and deteriorating the performance of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. Detecting and locating such sources is crucial to improve the quality of SMOS scientific products. In this paper, we present an approach based on matrix completion (MC) for localization of radio-frequency interference (RFI) sources. This approach exploits the low-rank property of the augmented covariance matrix (ACM) of the sparse array, and addresses the ACM incompleteness (i.e., sampling data loss) due to inherent array geometry (e.g., the SMOS Y-shaped array). Some experimental results indicate that, compared with existing approaches based on the discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) inversion and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, the proposed MC approach has better performance such as superior spatial resolution and reduced artifacts.

AB  - Previous experiments showed that the frequency dependence of snow volume scattering from 18 to 90GHz is power of 2.8, which is much weaker than the power of 4 of Rayleigh scattering. Recently monitoring snow using existing satellites (such as Sentinel-1, COSMO-SkyMed and QuickScat) have been widely studied. The radar signatures from C to Ku band are important for active remote sensing of snow. In this paper, we study the snow aggregation effects and its frequency dependence of volume scattering from C to Ku band (4-18GHz) with the bicontinuous model. The bicontinuous media model is applied to model the snow microstructure with aggregates. The integral equation of snow scattering volume is derived based on the Born approximation which then leads to the scattering coefficients. Scattering coefficients of snow are computed from C to Ku band giving a frequency dependence of similar to 2.6 power, weaker than that of Rayleigh scattering because of the aggregation effects. In addition, results are also in good agreement with the full wave numerical solutions from X to Ku band.

CL  - Shenyang, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Compare with the reflectance of land surface, ocean water is much less. And, the contribution of atmospheric molecules and aerosols plays an vital importance on the water-leaving reflectance inversion. In order to simplify the inversion process, we generate a look-up-table(LUT) that contains the observation geometry information, the aerosol optical depth(AOD), the exponent of Junge power law(V) and the other factors used to calculate the water-leaving reflectance. The AOD and V are determined using our previous iterative algorithm from dual near-infrared(NIR) and dual shortwave-infrared(SWIR) channels, respectively. We compare the retrieved AOD and V with Aerosol Robotic Network(AERONET) measurement datas to ensure the precision of aerosol information. The AERONET AOD at 550 nm is 0.0876, and the inversed AOD from dual-NIR and dual-SWIR is 0.05-0.325 and 0.0373-0.98, respectively. For dual-NIR, there are 31.97% and 57.18% pixels with the AOD absolute relative error less than 10% and 20%, respectively. For dual-SWIR, there are 31.01% and 59.79%. Then, we use the retrieved aerosol information together with the observation geometry information to get the factors used to calculate the water-leaving reflectance through interpolation. Finally, we use the MODIS ocean color product to verify the water-leaving reflectance calculated based on aerosol retrieved from NIR and SWIR, and the two calculated water-leaving reflectance are marked as rho(NIR) and rho(SWIR). In the visible and near-infrared region, both of them are smaller than the product values. Despite the rho(SWIR) is larger than rho(NIR), the overcorrection is much more serious in rho(NIR).

AB  - From text analysis to image interpretation, the topic model (TM) always plays an important role. With its powerful semantic mining capabilities, it is able to capture the latent spectral and spatial information from remote sensing (RS) images. Recent years have witnessed widespread use of TM to solve the problems in RS image interpretation, i.e., semantic segmentation, target detection, and scene classification. However, there has not yet been a study expatiating and summarizing the current situation of RS applications with TM. This paper intends to systematically summarize the application of TM in RS images and to conduct several typical experiments for comparison. Specifically, the architecture of our work can be explained as follows: 1) the theory of TM; 2) the applications of RS based on TM; 3) experimental analysis of typical TM methods to provide reference for further understanding, and 4) summary and prospects for guiding further research into TM for RS data.

TI  - Multidimensional Response Evaluation of Remote-Sensing Vegetation Change to Drought Stress in the Three-River Headwaters, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of drought on ecosystems has become increasingly prominent. This study used the MODIS remote-sensing vegetation index and the standardized precipitation index to quantify vegetation coverage status and meteorological drought level. Using the copula method, the joint distribution of the drought index and related vegetation cover variables were simulated for the first time. The conditional distribution of vegetation biomass was deduced, and the multidimensional response between the vegetation biomass and drought was explored to understand the possible vegetation loss under different drought severity conditions. The three-river headwaters (TRH) region is the source place of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Lancang River, where the ecosystem is characterized by the innate vulnerability. Using this region as a case study, the results show that the spatiotemporal evolution of drought and vegetation in the TRH region has apparent regional heterogeneity. The vegetation cover in the eastern region is significantly better than that in the northwestern region, while the vegetation growth trend in the northwestern region is stronger than that in the southeastern region. It is feasible to build a vegetation-drought multidimensional response model based on the copula method. In 92.5% of the TRH region, vegetation cover was significantly affected by the severity of the drought. The impact on the growth of vegetation caused by persistent drought events was higher than that of short-term but high-intensity drought. The vegetation in the TRH area has a certain degree of drought resistance. This study provides outstanding theoretical support and reference for the protection of the TRH basin ecosystem.

TI  - Estimating Sunshine Duration Using Hourly Total Cloud Amount Data from a Geostationary Meteorological Satellite
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sunshine duration is an important indicator of the amount of solar radiation received in a region and an important input parameter for the study of atmospheric energy balance, climate change, ecosystem evolution, and social sustainability. Currently, extrapolation and interpolation of data from meteorological stations are the most common methods used to calculate sunshine duration on a regional scale. However, it is difficult to obtain high precision sunshine duration in areas lacking ground observation or where sunshine duration is highly heterogeneous on the ground. In this paper, a new method is proposed to estimate sunshine duration with hourly total cloud amount (CTA) data from sunrise to sunset derived from the Fengyun-2G geostationary meteorological satellite (FY-2G). This method constructs a new index known as daytime mean total cloud coverage amount and provides quadratic equations relating daytime mean total cloud coverage amount to relative sunshine duration in different seasons. The method was validated with ground observation data for 2016 from 18 meteorological stations in the Three-River Headwaters Region of Qinghai Province, China. For individual stations, the coefficient of determination (R-2) between estimated and measured sunshine was at least 0.894, the RMSE (root mean square error) was 0.977 h/day or less, the MAE (mean absolute error) was 0.824 h/day or less, the RE (relative error) was 0.150 or lower, and the value of d was 0.963 or greater, which validated that the proposed method can effectively predict daily sunshine duration. These equations can also provide higher precision estimates of regional-scale sunshine duration. This was demonstrated by comparing, for the entire study region, the spatial distribution of sunshine duration estimated from season-based equations with results from three different interpolation methods based on ground observations. Overall, the study confirms that total cloud amount measures from a geostationary satellite can be used to successfully estimate sunshine duration.

AB  - High-quality Leaf Area Index (LAI) time-series is important for many ecological applications. Unfortunately, troubles of observations missing and low spatial-temporal resolution greatly restrict their further applications. Due to the increasing of algorithm uncertainty, the current time-series optimized (TSO) algorithms perform poorly when LAI observations are lost continuously or unavailable on the key phenology nodes. It is an effective way of improving performance of TSO by introducing prior knowledge which replenishes time-series detail information. Meteorological data is completely competent since its great potential of describing vegetation growing rules. In this paper, focusing on data missing trouble, we develop a new LAI time-series reconstruction algorithm, called MNNR (Meteorology and Neural Network based Reconstruction), by introducing external meteorological data and other prior information into a neural network model. The results demonstrate that the proposed MNNR algorithm is well capable of spatial-temporal LAI reconstruction and performs excellently when observations are lost continuously.

TI  - Surface Deformation Retrieving Over Soft Clay Based on an Improved Time Series InSAR Model: A Case Study of Dongting Lake Area, China
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The infrastructures built on soft clay in the Dongting Lake area are more prone to settlement and instability due to its significant rheological properties. It is of great importance to conduct a long-term surface deformation monitoring over this area. The most commonly used Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) deformation models are based on combinations of one or several pure empirical mathematical functions without considering the physical and mechanical characteristics of the observed objects. In this work, we propose an improved deformation model based on the functional relationship between strain and time in the Maxwell rheological model. The rheological parameters of elastic modulus and viscosity are introduced into a traditional empirical seasonal model. The improved model is applied for the investigation of the spatial-temporal surface evolution over the Dongting Lake area with the Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technology and TerraSAR-X satellite imagery. With the proposed model, the rheological parameters and the time series deformation are estimated, with the maximum accumulated subsidence estimated as 38 mm. Through the analysis of the generated results, we find that the lower the viscosity and elastic modulus are, the higher the deformation is. Temporally, the overall deformation follows a generally subsiding trend with a seasonal recovery of 5 mm from October 2012 to November 2012 and 12 mm from January 2013 to February 2013. To compensate for the deficiency of the unavailability of external geodetic measurements over this area, three different accuracy indexes (residual phase, temporal coherence, and high-pass deformation) are utilized to evaluate the modeling accuracy. The results of the improved model are also compared to three traditional models (seasonal model, cubic polynomial model, and linear model). The comparison shows that the improved model is highly recommended in this area because of its better accuracy.

AB  - Satellite jitter, the fluctuation of satellite point, has negative influence on the geometric quality of high-resolution optical satellite imagery. Gaofen-1 02/03/04 satellites are Chinese operational remote sensing satellites, which have Earth observation capability with 2/8 (panchromatic/multispectral image) meter resolution. This paper presented a jitter detection method based on multispectral imagery for Gaofen-1 02/03/04 satellites. Three short strip datasets captured in the early in-flight period were used to conduct the experiments. The results indicate that satellite jitter with a frequency of 1.1-1.2 Hz, and amplitude of 1-2 pixel exists during the early in-flight period.

AB  - Near-real-time monitoring live fuel moisture content (LFMC) from remote sensing is paramount to wildfire early management at a large scale since LFMC is a critical variable in affecting fire ignition and fire spread rate. The geostationary satellite Himawari-8 observes the land surface every 10 minutes, making near-real-time LFMC retrieval achievable. To this end, the potential of Himawari-8 data for LFMC retrieval using the radiative transfer model was explored in this study. The performance of retrieved LFMC was validated using 16 LFMC samplings located in Australia involving two land cover types: croplands and tree cover lands. Additionally, the MODIS data was also applied and compared for the LFMC retrieval. The results showed that Himawati-8 data performed poor accuracy level with R-2 and RMSE of 0.26 and 42.16%, respectively. Whereas better accuracy level was found for MODIS data, R-2 and RMSE were 0.67 and 29.17%, respectively. This result indicated that the LFMC estimated from Himawari-8 is challenged. Detailed fieldwork and methodology improvements adopted for this data are needed for improving the LFMC estimate in the future.

TI  - Estimating and Mapping Mangrove Biomass Dynamic Change Using WorldView-2 Images and Digital Surface Models
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and quantification of biomass changes is critical to understanding mangrove carbon sequestration, conservation, and restoration. Few previous studies have focused on mangrove biomass changes based on high spatial resolution images, particularly for disturbed and recovering areas. This study developed an effective model to estimate and map mangrove aboveground biomass dynamic change between 2010 and 2016 on Qi'ao Island in South China. The study area includes native Kandelia candel (K. candel) and planted Sonneratia apetala (S. apetala) mangrove species within the largest planted area in China. Models were developed using WorldView-2 images, digital surface models (DSMs), and the random forest algorithm. Accuracies of the model were assessed using multiyear field samples. DSMs were identified as the most important variable for model accuracy, reducing relative error by up to 3.14%. Three models were developed: a model for 2010, another model for 2016, and a combined model for 2010 and 2016. Compared with the 2010 (RMSE = 41.03 t/ha, RMSEr = 24.31%) and 2016 (RMSE = 39.92 t/ha, RMSEr = 23.40%) models, the combined model (RMSE = 50.99 t/ha, RMSEr = 30.48%) only increased the relative error by 6.17% and 7.08%, respectively. Mangrove biomass maps generated from the most accurate models showed total biomass increased from 23270.43 to 39819.03 tons by up to 71.11% over the study period. K. candel total biomass decreased by 36.5% due to Derris trifoliata challenge. S. apetala total biomass increased by 74.79% due to reforestation programs, achieving aboveground biomass accumulation of 4.17 t/ha for stands that existed in 2010. This study provides insights into biomass dynamic change in disturbed and recovering mangrove areas. Future studies should consider using LiDAR techniques to obtain actual tree height applied for biomass estimation instead of DSM.

AB  - The subject of the study is the course of the dynamics of vegetation productivity on the dumps of the surface mine "Izykhsky" (2000-2019), using Terra Modis. The aim is to identify patterns of seasonal and long-term dynamics of restored vegetation as a result of succession according to images. The methodology included processing information on gross primary production and evapotranspiration, as well as identifying the relationship with meteorological data for 2018-2019. There is a positive trend in the long-term dynamics - in terms of total gross primary production from 1.7 to 5.5 kg/m(2)/8 days and in evapotranspiration from 1142 to 2784 kg/m(2)/8 days. The evapotranspiration correlated with the productivity. Since 2016, productivity has reached a plateau, which indicates the development of ecological niches by plants. The phytomass of the restored vegetation was in 1.5 times greater, than the mass of the steppe site. Seasonal dynamics in 2019 showed that communities on dumps have higher productivity, in contrast to the steppe, and one peak in the first ten days of July. The sum of temperatures and productivity had a high relationship (R-2 = 0.7) in comparison with the steppe (R-2 = 0.2). Terra Modis data can be applied in the field of ecological monitoring of vegetation of coal dumps.

TI  - ROMANTIC HUMAN STUDY: PECULIARITIES OF PERSONALITY PHILOSOPHY IN THE LITERATURE OF THE 1820-1830-IES
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The purpose of the study is to show the connection of romanticism with the anthropological doctrine that goes back to Hegelianism and Kantianism, and at the same time - with the concepts of the future, structuralism and postmodernism. Theoretical basis. The man is a central figure of the Romantic literary, therefore it makes sense to single out romantic human anthropological doctrine and the image of man associated with a specific historical and cultural era called the "epoch of romanticism"; to show that many romantic philosophical positions remained relevant to the basic foundations of contemporary anthropological research and coincide with it in analytical and critical thinking about a man, a person, his historical and evolutionary fate. Originality. The romantic worldview determined the specifics of anthropological discourse, both logical and illogical, remaining symbols and attaching, as for example, a real historical anecdote, a popular history, a philosophical thought, a myth, a famous literary episode and the arts multiplied by creative inspiration and imagination. This tendency determined the fragmentation of thinking and the scientific image of man as a dual being, nevertheless, presented and described in all the variety of relations with the world and with himself, that allows us to call this area of thought "the romantic human science". Conclusions. Structural analysis of numerous romantic texts allows us to draw the following conclusion: with mythopoetic imagery and anthropological thought about a man, romantic writers introduced the reader to any wisdom, to philosophical understanding of their human essence, to past and modern teachings, in a way processed antique, medieval and enlightening views, in which an important place was given to reflections on the place of man in nature, society, and history. Correlating the well-known statements about a person as a descendant of the "old Adam", "person", "personality", "soul", with the modern idea of historical and social development, about the evolution of the consciousness of a person who revealed himself as an individual in modern times, with scientific and aesthetic views, the writers of the first half of the XIX century gave romantic thought anthropological meaning and, in fact, laid the foundations of historical, social, psychological, cultural and psychoanalytic anthropology.

TI  - Study of Chemical and Optical Properties of Biomass Burning Aerosols during Long-Range Transport Events toward the Arctic in Summer 2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning related aerosol episodes are becoming a serious threat to the radiative balance of the Arctic region. Since early July 2017 intense wildfires were recorded between August and September in Canada and Greenland, covering an area up to 4674 km(2) in size. This paper describes the impact of these biomass burning (BB) events measured over Svalbard, using an ensemble of ground-based, columnar, and vertically-resolved techniques. BB influenced the aerosol chemistry via nitrates and oxalates, which exhibited an increase in their concentrations in all of size fractions, indicating the BB origin of particles. The absorption coefficient data (530 nm) at ground reached values up to 0.6 Mm(-1), highlighting the impact of these BB events when compared to average Arctic background values, which do not exceed 0.05 Mm(-1). The absorption behavior is fundamental as implies a subsequent atmospheric heating. At the same time, the AERONET Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data showed high values at stations located close to or in Canada (AOD over 2.0). Similarly, increased values of AODs were then observed in Svalbard, e.g., in Hornsund (daily average AODs exceeded 0.14 and reached hourly values up to 0.5). Elevated values of AODs were then registered in Sodankyla and Andenes (daily average AODs exceeding 0.150) a few days after the Svalbard observation of the event highlighting the BB columnar magnitude, which is crucial for the radiative impact. All the reported data suggest to rank the summer 2017 plume of aerosols as one of the biggest atmosphere related environmental problems over Svalbard region in last 10 years.

AB  - In spectral image analysis, anomaly detection algorithms implicitly perform spatial anomaly detection. That is, the pixels are assumed to all be from the same image at a single time, and the anomalies are pixels whose spectra differ from the rest of the pixel spectra in the scene. In this research we are instead interested in temporal anomalies, where we compare a single pixel against itself over time rather than against the rest of the pixels in the scene. To do this requires a large sample of registered images taken at different points in time, which is easily enabled by global-coverage constellations such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat. In doing so we can implement the same anomaly detection algorithms that are traditionally applied spatially, but draw our "background" distribution from time instead of space. Here we present a straightforward experiment with Temporal RX, where we use the traditional RX algorithm but with a temporal background distribution. We use the annual Burning Man music festival as our test case and explore the spatially-aggregated temporal anomaly detection results.

TI  - Malignant melanoma metastasis in the ileum - two case reports
T2  - VOJNOSANITETSKI PREGLED
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Malignant melanoma is a tumor that develops from melanocytes, so this type of tumor can occur in any part of body containing the cells. Melanoma is less common than other skin tumors. It is very aggressive type of skin tumor with very early metastases and accounts for 75% of cases of death due to skin tumor. In the initial phase the tumor growth is horizontal. Early detection of changes is very important. Over time, as the tumor gets the vertical growth phase, occurrence of metastases depends on the depth of invasion (Breslow). Malignant melanoma metastasizes to regional lymph nodes, but also in the liver, lung, brain and almost any place that can be populated by the haematogenous route. Case report. We reported two cases of patients who were urgently surgically treated in the Emergency Center of Vojvodina, Serbia, with the clinical signs and symptoms of ileus. In both cases, the ileum resection was performed with terminal ileostomy. Histological analysis was performed and through morphology and immunohistochemical profile, in both cases, the diagnosis was metastatic malignant melanoma in the ileum. Conclusion. In patients with diagnosed malignant melanoma of the skin with symptoms of abdominal pain and/or anemia, application of modern imaging techniques is imperative in order to obtain an early diagnosis of gastrointestinal metastases of this tumor, because the rapid detection and radical resection may contribute to the overall survival of these patients.

TI  - Characteristics of deep moist convection over Germany in multi-source data
T2  - METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyses characteristics of deep moist convection (DMC) over Germany with the aim to select relevant parameters that have the skill to improve the identification of current life cycle phase and the forecast of a lifetime of DMCs in an operational weather forecasting environment. No differentiation between thunderstorm organization types is done, since no simple differentiation method is available in an operational environment. In contrast to previous analyses, multiple data sources are used synchronously to explore an extensive data set of DMCs at high resolution in space and time. Basis of our analysis are all DMC detections in satellite data (using Cb-TRAM - Thunderstorm Tracking and Monitoring) in a five month period (June 2016, May/June/July 2017, and June 2018). For each of these DMCs the time series of selected parameters from satellite, ground-based radar, lightning detection, and numerical weather prediction (NWP) model data are inspected. In search for clear signatures of expectable lifetime and differences between short and long-lived DMCs, all thunderstorm systems are sorted by their lifetime. In addition, they are separated into four life cycle phases: 1. early growth, 2. advanced growth, 3. maturity, and 4. decay. Generally, it turns out that satellite, radar, and lightning data are the most suitable data to determine the actual life cycle phase of a DMC. It is shown that long-lived DMCs are, on average, related to lower minimum cloud top temperature and mid-level relative humidity and higher maximum of coverage area, vertically integrated water and lightning activity during their life cycle than short-lived systems. The NWP model parameters have a diagnostic potential to identify the remaining lifetime in connection with the observational data, but do not contain information about the actual life cycle phase. The results obtained in this study will be used for an investigation of their potential application in a nowcasting model, in order to determine the current phase of an observed DMC and to predict its remaining lifetime.

TI  - Shoreline Extraction Based on an Active Connection Matrix (ACM) Image Enhancement Strategy
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal environments are facing constant changes over time due to their dynamic nature and geological, geomorphological, hydrodynamic, biological, climatic and anthropogenic factors. For these reasons, the monitoring of these areas is crucial for the safeguarding of the cultural heritage and the populations living there. The focus of this paper is shoreline extraction by means of an experimental algorithm, called J-Net Dynamic (Semeion Research Center of Sciences of Communication, Rome, Italy). It was tested on two types of image: a very high resolution (VHR) multispectral image (WorldView-2) and a high resolution (HR) radar synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image (Sentinel-1). The extracted shorelines were compared with those manually digitized for both images independently. The results obtained with the J-Net Dynamic algorithm were also compared with common algorithms, widely used in the literature, including the WorldView water index and the Canny edge detector. The results show that the experimental algorithm is more effective than the others, as it improves shoreline extraction accuracy both in the optical and SAR images.

TI  - Establishment of Simple Nomograms for Predicting Axillary Lymph Node Involvement in Early Breast Cancer
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement is an important prognostic factor of early invasive breast cancer. The objective of this study was to establish simple nomograms for predicting ALN involvement based on ultrasound (US) characteristics and evaluate the predictive value of US in the detection of ALN involvement.Patients and Methods: A total of 1328 patients with cT1-2N0 breast cancer by physical exam were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate analysis was used for the comparison of variables, and multivariate analysis was performed by binary logistic regression analysis. The R software was used to establish simple nomograms based on the US characteristics alone. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the prediction model and the verification group were drawn, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the discrimination of the prediction model. A calibration curve was plotted to assess the nomogram predictions vs the actual observations of the ALN metastasis rate and axillary tumor burden rate.Results: The ALN metastasis rates of the training group and the validation group were 35.1% and 34.1%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that molecular subtype, lymphovascular invasion, mass descriptors (size, margin, microcalcification and blood flow signal) and LN descriptors (shape, cortical thickness and long-to-short ratio) were independent impact factors in early breast cancer. The AUC of ALN metastasis rate of prediction model based on US features was 0.802, the AUC of high tumor burden rate was 0.873, and the AUC of external validation group was 0.731 and 0.802, respectively. The calibration curve of the nomogram showed that the nomogram predictions are consistent with the actual metastasis rate and the high tumor burden rate. The results showed that preoperative US had a sensitivity of 59.4% and a specificity of 88.9% for predicting the ALN metastasis rate.Conclusion: The successfully established nomograms based on US characteristics to predict ALN metastasis rate and high axillary tumor burden rate in early breast cancer can achieve individual prediction. Compared with other nomogram predictions, it is more intuitive, and can help clinical decision-making; thus, it should be promoted. However, at this time US features alone are insufficient to replace sentinel lymph node biopsy.

AB  - This paper aims to investigate the influences of urban growth and green land cover decrease on land surface radiative properties and metropolitan climate of Bucharest in Romania. Remote sensing data from Landsat TM/ETM/OLI, Sentinel 2 and time series MODIS Terra/Aqua thermal infrared sensors as well as in-situ meteorological data have been used to assess urban land cover- air and land surface temperature interactions over period between 2000 and 2019 years. The air (Ta) and land surface temperature (Ts), key parameters for urban climate research, were analyzed in relation with variables land surface albedo and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at city level. Based on these parameters, the urban growth, Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect and the relationships of Ts to other biogeophysical parameters have been analyzed. The correlation analyses revealed that, at the pixel-scale, Ta and Ts possessed a strong positive correlation with percent impervious surfaces and negative correlation with vegetation abundances at the regional scale, respectively. Was also analyzed UHI phenomenon during extreme heat waves events. Our results suggest that monthly mean UHI intensity is between 1 degrees C and 6 degrees C, and the most intense UHI occurs in day- time in the summer period during heat waves periods. The analysis shows that different urban/periurban zones and landscapes bring diurnally and seasonally different contributions to the local and regional thermal environment. City land cover was the most important contributor to increases in regional Ts. Vegetation had a clear cooling effect as the normalized vegetation difference index (NDVI) increased during summer periods.

AB  - During last decade, due to fast progress of geospatial technology development, all weather, high-resolution and high-dynamic range, a huge time-series data base is available for earthquake precursors anomalies monitoring in active geotectonic areas. In this paper, changes before and after the Vrancea earthquakes in the crustal dynamics as well as in the land and atmospheric parameters ( land surface temperature LST, surface latent heat flux -SLHF, and air surface temperature- AT anomalies, have been investigated on the basis of time-series geospatial (NOAA AVHRR and MODIS Terra/Aqua) and field data analysis for January 2012- January 2020 period. For some analyzed earthquakes, starting with ten days up to one week prior to a moderate or earthquakes a transient thermal infrared rise appeared in LST (5-10 Ko), SLHF ( tens of W/m(2)), and AT (2-10 C-o) values higher than the normal, function of the magnitude and focal depth, which disappeared after the main shock. The joint analysis of geospatial, geophysical, and geological information revealed new insights for Vrancea zone seismicity in Romania. Since the variations of the solar and geomagnetic indices follow a normal behavior during the whole period of the observed anomalies between 3 and 10 days before the earthquake, it can be concluded that multi-precursors analysis is very important to detect the possible Lithosphere Atmosphere Ionosphere Coupling (LAIC) effects.

Initially a remake of the 1973 film of the same name directed by Michael Crichton, the series soon evolved: its second season has become a form of comprehension for both the basis of the western poetics in its relation to science fiction and the burning issues of the 21st century. "The rise of the machines" is interpreted here as a revolt against God, as overcoming the total scenarios of normative poetics and also as a visualization of Donna Haraway's cyberfeminism ideas. The meta-western part of the Westworld plot unfolds from the 1970s and 1980s to the "revolutionary" aesthetics of the 60s and reveals its ambition to play around with the revisionist scripts of the spaghetti western, especially its most radical part - the zapata western. Trying on their revolutionary logic, the characters and creators of the series try to find their way out of the maze of unsolvable questions about the oncoming future and formulate new ethical dominants for a contemporary viewer. Such a logic supposes existence not in the world of a classical western - with the final triumph of justice, but in the world of a total revisionism of the late 1960s western. It is manifested in the integral poetics of the second season. Androids are creatures with a new worldview and perception of a different world order. They travel through different areas and levels of the historical park, collect key moments of history and stylistic features of a western as the central epic genre of cinema aesthetics.The first two seasons of the Westworld are as much an anthem to the cinema, the main art of the 20th century, as Quentin Tarantino's westerns created at the same time. They demonstrate that in the world of contemporary values the cinema epic is the starting point of history, the beginning and the source of a person's epic worldview. As a result, the western appears in the series as a key epic form underlying the mythological mind of a contemporary viewer. The meta-western nature also reflects the direction towards the total westernization of cinema aesthetics and, at the same time, an attempt to understand the reasons which led this approach to the crisis, projected onto the social contradictions of our time. The ironic laws of the spaghetti western, using the elements of Christianization and surrealism in the interpretation of the genre's canonical schemes, make it possible to expand the range of the tasks set by the authors far beyond the borders of one-nation specifics.

TI  - Bandole versus Justine: The World's Soul System in Sade's <i>La Nouvelle Justine</i>
T2  - THELEME-REVISTA COMPLUTENSE DE ESTUDIOS FRANCESES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article seeks to examine Donatien Alphonse Francois de Sade's ironic appropriation of the "world's soul system" in La Nouvelle Justine. Our objective is to show how Sade subverts said philosophical system, originally associated with immaterialist Pythagorean-Platonic thought, in order to transform it into an immanentist-materialist worldview. In order to accomplish this task, we concentrate on Sade's characterization of the libertine Bandole and his dialogue with Justine. We also study the historical-conceptual reconstruction of philosophical and theological expressions of the world's soul system produced by authors that Sade frequently read, such as Pierre Bayle and Nicolas Freret. Of special relevance will be the link between those expressions and Baruch Spinoza's thought. This articles evaluates the controversial engagement (or lack thereof) that Sade's libertine novels exhibit with respect to the diffusion of the Enlightenment's key proclamations and ideas.

TI  - Do Game Data Generalize Well for Remote Sensing Image Segmentation?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the recent progress in deep learning and remote sensing image interpretation, the adaption of a deep learning model between different sources of remote sensing data still remains a challenge. This paper investigates an interesting question: do synthetic data generalize well for remote sensing image applications? To answer this question, we take the building segmentation as an example by training a deep learning model on the city map of a well-known video game "Grand Theft Auto V" and then adapting the model to real-world remote sensing images. We propose a generative adversarial training based segmentation framework to improve the adaptability of the segmentation model. Our model consists of a CycleGAN model and a ResNet based segmentation network, where the former one is a well-known image-to-image translation framework which learns a mapping of the image from the game domain to the remote sensing domain; and the latter one learns to predict pixel-wise building masks based on the transformed data. All models in our method can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. The segmentation model can be trained without using any additional ground truth reference of the real-world images. Experimental results on a public building segmentation dataset suggest the effectiveness of our adaptation method. Our method shows superiority over other state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods, for example, Deeplab-v3 and UNet. Another advantage of our method is that by introducing semantic information to the image-to-image translation framework, the image style conversion can be further improved.

AB  - The paper presents results of the spectral brightness study of coniferous and foliar forests on the satellite images Landsat-7 for different seasons. Spectral channels, in which reflections from such species most differ from each other, are determined. The obtained results allow one to form standards for the classification of forest vegetation cover in different phenological phases. To increase the distinctiveness of the analyzed objects, information about their brightness was merged for different combinations of two spectral channels. This allows one to form two additional classification features: the Euclidean distance and spectral angle in two-dimensional brightness space. It is shown that the combination of two channels can significantly increase the number and quality of the formed features for the selection of coniferous and foliar vegetation.

TI  - RADIO PUBLICISM IN RUSSIA: CONCEPTUALIZATION, SOCIAL PURPOSE, AND DEVELOPMENT TRENDS
T2  - THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES OF JOURNALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays researching socio-political broadcasting of the 21st century is topical. The recent decades have witnessed a significant increase in the number of journalistic radio programs, evolution of their format and genre diversity, and improvement of broadcasting forms and approaches. However, modern radio publicism as independent form of public-oriented journalism has not been studied sufficiently.The article deals with theoretical ambiguity of the concept of publicism (political and topical journalism), determines its general characteristics and patterns, namely, depth of author's thought, a high level of personification, strong emotion, direct appeal to the society, publicist's own ideals and values, solemnity, prepossession, worldview forming, and rapid development during transition and crisis periods.The authors analyze correlation between the notions "publicism" and "publicist style", and determine that the latter, being the journalist's manner of interpreting a public phenomenon and a way of his/her identification with a particular community, is one of the characteristics of publisism. Meanwhile, the study shows that some media content of publicist-like style only imitates publicism, being in fact pseudo-publicism, whose influence is destructive due to its anti-civil and anti-social orientation, provocative character and intolerant attitude.The authors propose their own scientific definition to the term "radio publicism", point out essential and functional characteristics of Russian radio publicism, its development trends and prospects, and determine universal features of modern radio publicism. The article also describes its current genre-and-format structure. Documentary publicist and art publicist genre groups, having their own verbal, compositional, structural, and functional features and radio audience, are distinguished as ontological categories of radio publicism.The research methods used by the authors include structure functional analysis, typological analysis, method of observation, comparative analysis, classification, and a systemic approach.

AB  - The drought that occurred in Indramayu Regency was caused by a shift of the beginning season and a long dry season which affected the availability of water storage for plants. Indramayu Regency is one of the rice centers in West Java with 56% of its area is rice fields. But in recent years rice productivity has been reduced due to drought. The Indramayu District Agriculture Office noted that in 2012, 2015 and 2018 paddy fields. The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of 2012, 2015 and 2018 wetland agricultural drought areas and their relationship with rainfall in Indramayu Regency. The VHI drought index (Vegetation Health Index) is used to determine the pattern of distribution of the drought area of agricultural land. VHI is a combination of VCI (Vegetation Condition Index) and TCI (Temperature Condition Index) derived from NDVI data processing (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), LST (Land Surface Temperature) of Landsat 7 and 8 images. The processing results of the VHI index show the distribution of drought levels no drought to extreme drought, where in 2012, 2015 and 2018 the distribution of drought in agricultural land has the same pattern, which is dominated by the coastal areas of Indramayu Regency due to the influence of less rainfall. While the level of mild drought is in the western and center regions of Indramayu Regency.

AB  - Seasonal variations have brought about significant changes in vegetation cover and spatial distribution in the past decade. Globally, grazing lands are experiencing a significant warming and drying process more especially the grazing lands in the Savannah and Sahel regions. This paper reports the study undertaken for mapping changes on the grass above ground biomass (GAB) due to these seasonal changes using Sentinel 2A Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data. Emphasising on the GAB, the main objective of this study is to map and model monthly GAB variations to their corresponding meteorological data. A set of selected widely used vegetation indices were applied to satellite data, and later were further regressed against corresponding in-situ GAB samples and weather data, hence, producing a predictor of GAB from satellite data. Sentinel 2A MSI data were acquired monthly from January to December 2018. Combined with precipitation and temperature data, the GAB variations on monthly scales were analysed. The results indicated that GAB determined and its seasonal variations shown good agreement (r = 0.8, p < 0.001) with corresponding in-situ verifications. Temperature was found inversely proportionally to GAB for the whole grazing calendar. Therefore, it was concluded that mapping GAB seasonal variations is achievable with Sentinel2 MSI, vast potential for input to grazing land management.

T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - In both free-living and pathogenic bacteria, problems in the synthesis and assembly of early flagellar components invariably lead to cell division defects. However, the mechanism that fine-tunes the cell division cycle with the flagellar biogenesis is poorly understood. Herein, we report the role of the conserved regulator MadA in coupling flagellar biogenesis to cell division in Caulobacter crescentus. We demonstrate that MadA is required to induce the flagellar specific type III export component FlhA to release and activate FliX, which in-turn is required to license the conserved sigma54-activator, FlbD. In the absence of MadA, FliX is tethered to FlhA, inhibiting FlbD activation and crippling completion of flagellar biogenesis and cell division. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MadA exploits a divisome-stoichiometric to control cell division. We propose that MadA has a sentinel-type function that warrants progression of the flagellar biogenesis, and the cell division cycle, once early flagellar structures are properly assembled. Overall design: Global transcriptome profiling (gene expression) by RNA-Seq in Caulobacter crescentus NA1000(WT), flbD::Tn and DeltamadA backgrounds.

TI  - NFkappaB dynamics determine the stimulus-specificity of epigenomic reprogramming in macrophages
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - The epigenome defines the cell type, but also possesses plasticity to tune gene expression in the context of extracellular cues. This tuning is evident in immune sentinel cells such as macrophages, which respond to pathogens and cytokines with phenotypic shifts driven by epigenomic reprogramming. Recent studies indicate that this reprogramming arises from the activity of transcription factors including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkappaB). NFkappaB binds not only to available enhancers but may also produce de novo enhancers in previously silent areas of the genome. Here, we show that NFkappaB reprograms the macrophage epigenome in a stimulus-specific manner, in response only to a subset of pathogen-derived stimuli. The basis for these surprising differences lies in the stimulus-specific temporal dynamics of NFkappaB activity. In response to different stimuli, NFkappaB enters the nucleus with variable speed, amplitude, and duration, and may oscillate between the nucleus and cytoplasm. These dynamical features combine to specify the identity and dose of a given stimulus. We demonstrate through live cell imaging, mathematical modeling, and genetic perturbations that NFkappaB promotes open chromatin and formation of de novo enhancers most strongly when its dynamics are non-oscillatory. These de novo enhancers result in the activation of additional response genes. We propose a mechanistic paradigm in which the temporal dynamics of transcription factors are a key determinant of their capacity to control epigenomic reprogramming, thus enabling the formation of stimulus-specific memory in innate immune sentinel cells. Overall design: Sequencing data from murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, comparing different TLR stimuli and using genetic perturbations of NFkappaB signaling dynamics. H3K4me1 ChIP-seq (41 samples), ATAC-seq (36 samples), mRNA-seq (19 samples).

TI  - ZAK activation on colliding ribosomes triggers SAPK signaling pathways to regulate cell fate
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Problems arising during translation of mRNAs lead to ribosome stalling and collisions with trailing ribosomes. These collisions are known to trigger a series of events including degradation of the stalled nascent polypeptide, decay of the problematic mRNAs, and ribosome rescue. However, the systemic cellular response of ribosome collision has not been explored. Here, we uncover a novel function for ribosome collisions in signal transduction. Using multiple translation elongation inhibitors and cellular stress conditions, we show that ribosome collisions activate both the SAPK (Stress Activated Protein Kinase) and GCN2-mediated cellular stress response pathways that lead to apoptosis and the integrated stress response (ISR), respectively. We further show that the MAPKKK ZAK functions as the sentinel for ribosome collisions, and ZAK is required for activation of both SAPKs p38/JNK and GCN2 signaling pathways. Selective ribosome profiling and biochemistry demonstrate that ZAK preferentially associates with the minimal unit of colliding ribosomes, the disome, inducing ZAK phosphorylation. While ZAK associates with elongating ribosomes under non-stressed conditions, activation of ZAK is specifically trigger by colliding ribosomes. Together, these results provide new insights into how perturbation of translational homeostasis, as read-out by colliding ribosomes, regulates cell fate. Overall design: 4 samples for selective ribosome profiling experiments using ZAK OE HeLa cells. 4 samples for ribosome profiling experiments using HeLa cells.

TI  - PERICYTE-LIKE CELLS UNDERGO TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPROGRAMMING AND DISTINCT FUNCTIONAL ADAPTATIONS IN ACUTE LUNG INJURY
T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Background: We previously reported on the role of pericyte-like cells as functional sentinel immune cells in lung injury. However, much about the biology of pericytes in lung injury remains unknown. Lung pericyte-like cells are well-positioned to sense disruption to the epithelial barrier and coordinate local inflammatory responses due to their anatomic niche within the alveoli. In this report, we characterized transcriptional responses and functional changes in pericyte-like cells following activation by alveolar components from injured and uninjured lungs. Methods: We purified pericyte-like cells from lung digests using PDGFR_ as a selection marker and expanded them in culture as previously described (1). We induced sterile acute lung injury in mice with recombinant human Fas ligand (rhFasL) instillation followed by mechanical ventilation (1). We then collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from injured and uninjured mice. Purified pericyte-like cells in culture were exposed to growth media only (control), BALF from uninjured mice, and BALF from injured mice for 6 and 24 h. RNA collected from pericyte-like cells for each of these treatment conditions underwent genome-wide sequencing using RNA-seq. Targets of interest identified by bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq data were validated using in vitro and in vivo assays. Results: We observed robust global transcriptional changes in pericyte-like cells following treatment with uninjured and injured BALF at 6 h, but this response persisted for 24 h only after exposure to injured BALF. Functional enrichment analysis of pericytes treated with injured BALF revealed activation of immuno-inflammatory, cell migration and angiogenesis-related pathways, whereas processes associated with tissue development and remodeling were down-regulated. We validated select targets in the inflammatory, angiogenesis-related, and cell migratory pathways using functional assays in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: Lung pericyte-like cells are highly responsive to alveolar compartment content from both uninjured and injured lungs, but injured BALF elicits a more sustained response. The inflammatory, angiogenic, and migratory changes exhibited by activated pericyte-like cells underscore the phenotypic plasticity of these specialized stromal cells in the setting of acute lung injury. Overall design: Mouse lung pericyte-like cell mRNA profiles from culutre after exposure to injured BALF (6h, 24h; n = 6 per time point), uninjured BALF (6h, 24h; n = 6 per time point) or media only (6h, 24h; n = 6 per time point) were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq.

TI  - A Study of Herman Bavinck's 'Progressiveness of Revelation'
TI  - 바빙크의 '계시의 점진' 개념에 대한 고찰
T2  - Korea Reformed Theology
T2  - 한국개혁신학
M3  - research-article
AB  - The Object of this study is to understand Bavinck's 'Progressiveness of Revelation'. When explaining ‘Progressiveness of Revelation', Bavinck basically holds of the eternity and temporality of revelation at the same time. According to him, when a revelation, not uniform, but single, unfolds in the history of time, it appears richly adapted to the saints living in each age. At the same time, before the revelation unfolds in history, the unity of the revelation itself is already secured in God's eternal wisdom. On this account, he describes the history of revelation, emphasizing the historicity of revelation on the one hand, and criticizes Cocceius, emphasizing the eternity of revelation on the other hand. His understanding of 'Progressiveness of Revelation' derived from two foundations. The first is his “organic world view of Christian monotheism.” In his worldview, God's thought, that is, His wisdom is precedent to the being of the created world, and this wisdom secures the unity and diversity of beings. Also, not only His thought, but God's act, that is, “counsel of will” is precedent to all these things. Through this, the world is endowed with the end, that is, God's glory and progresses historically in relation to it. Therefore, in his worldview, "development" is possible, which means not "better", but "closer" in historical progress in accordance with God's purpose. The second is his explanation of ‘the church as the perceiving subject of history of revelation'. He points out that history cannot exist objectively in a pure sense as the objects in natural science, but can only be described through human beings who perceive it. Likewise, the history of revelation is also described through the saints of the church, who are the perceiving subjects of it. The point is that the saints of this church are not only identified individually or collectively, but also as those with organic unity. Bavinck explains that as individual, each saint always starts from the beginning, but as a member of the whole, they are able to perceive revelation more clearly by assembling already given revelations. Bavinck clearly rejects Darwinism and Hegelism. First, Bavinck's 'Progression of Revelation' has different concepts of 'development' and 'clarity' from the Darwinism which only has uniform and linear 'development' and fictional 'clarity' based on the genetic unity of the perceiving subject, that is denying God's wisdom and work. Second, It also rejects Hegelism, which brings God's thoughts down to the tide of time and mixes eternity with time. In conclusion, Babinck's 'Progressiveness of Revelation' offers us two implications. One is that when explaining 'Progressiveness of Revelation', time and eternity should be strictly distinguished, but also not be seperated. Second, 'Progression of Revelation' is limited to content, not attributes. Despite these contributions, however, one must be careful about the confusion of the histories of revelation and the doctrine by applying the same consciousness of the perceiving subject to the both without much distinction.

AB  - In East Asia, the concept of qi(氣) is so important that it occupies the core of the worldview. In modern times, we are discussing qi(氣) at two levels. On one hand, it is a discourse on science related to oriental medicine and on the other, a religious discourse related to spirituality. The term qi(氣) is being discussed as a key concept across these two areas. How is this possible? This paper will address two perspectives in which qi(氣) of Confucianism is discussed. It will briefly describe the context in which transcendent reality or the sacred is discussed in religious studies and the controversial discussion context in science and discuss how the word spirituality has been translated. In this context, we are going to look at what spirituality can mean in modern society.

TI  - Encountering the other: Jungian analysts and traditional healers in South Africa.
T2  - The Journal of analytical psychology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Part 1: The history: Peter Ammann This sketches the background to this project, starting from Jung's interest in African culture, critically reviewing his colonial, exploitative attitudes, while balancing this with his true interest and willingness to be changed by his encounter with the 'other'. Vera Buhrmann pursued her interest in African healing traditions in a deeply respectful manner, but a reciprocal interest was lacking. When Peter met Nomfundo Mlisa, clinical psychologist and traditional healer with a keen interest in Jung, the project of true dialogue between Jungian analysts and African traditional healers was initiated. Hogsback video excerpt: Themes are umbilini/intuition, and dreams from African and Western perspectives. Descriptions are given by traditional health practitioners and Jungian analysts, outlining similarities and differences. A case is described in which the internal splitting effects of colonization is clearly demonstrated. A dream is shared and African and Western interpretations are offered. See https://jungsouthernafrica.co.za/traditional-health-practitioners/ Part 2: The context: Fred Borchardt Two contexts are highlighted: 1. The social activist movement #RhodesMustFall, initiated on 9 March 2015. The protests were focused on the repression of indigenous thought systems by colonialism. Our project had to take into account how colonization impacted on indigenous healing systems. Our tool in this work is the analytical psychology of Jung, which offers a basis for entering into dialogue with other cultures. 2. The discourse in Jungian circles about apologizing to people from African descent for the way in which they were described in Jungian literature. Monkey Valley video excerpt: Ester Haumann, Jungian analyst, in reflecting on the trauma of the Boer War in her immediate ancestry, poses the provocative question: how does it happen that the oppressed becomes the oppressor? It emerges that when trauma is unprocessed, it is repeated. Vella Maseko, African traditional healer and clinical psychologist, responds with concern about the pain of the nation in South Africa, and asks how do we, as healers, respond to this. See https://jungsouthernafrica.co.za/traditional-health-practitioners/ Part 3: The traditional health practitioner's stand and worldview: Nomfundo Mlisa Jungian analysts and traditional healers have initiated critical dialogues based on diverse critical political as well as historical impediments that have impacted negatively on traditional health systems. This highlights the link between Jungian and traditional healing theory. A call for self-introspection through Johari Window theory across cultures is expressed to allow encounters with each other, within us and between us. The need for rainbow therapy is coined, making South African Jungian analysts and the traditional healers, pioneers in initiating a rainbow therapy. Part 4: Conclusion: Renee Ramsden This dialogue was conceived of as a small group of practitioners from both disciplines, who could get to know and trust each other. In the second conference a narrative approach was favoured, which worked very well. Both sides were able to describe their journeys towards becoming healers, and similarities were striking. The healing effect of finding common ground through respectful receiving of each other, was profound. Perhaps this could offer a healing pattern of relating which could function like an ecological 'seedbomb'.
AB  - Premiere partie: Lhistoire, par Peter Ammann Ceci esquisse le contexte autour de ce projet, commencant par linteret de Jung pour la culture africaine, et examinant ses attitudes coloniales et en lien avec lexploitation, tout en equilibrant cela avec son interet authentique et sa disponibilite a etre change par sa rencontre avec  lautre . Vera Buhrmann a suivi son interet pour les traditions de Guerison Africaine dune maniere profondement respectueuse, mais il manquait un interet reciproque. Quand Peter rencontra Nomfundo Mlisa, Psychologue Clinicien et Guerisseur Traditionnel ayant un interet prononce pour Jung, le projet dun vrai dialogue entre Analystes Jungiens et Guerisseurs Traditionnels Africains vit le jour. Extrait dune video sur Hogsback: Les themes sont Umbilini/lIntuition, et les Reves selon les perspectives Africaines et Occidentales. Des descriptions sont donnees par des Guerisseurs Traditionnels et par des Analystes Jungiens, en soulignant les similarites et les differences. Un cas est presente dans lequel les effets du clivage interne de la colonisation sont clairement mis en lumiere. Un reve est donne, et des interpretations Africaines et Occidentales proposees. Deuxieme partie: Le contexte, par Fred Borchardt Deux cadres sont selectionnes: 1) Le mouvement social activiste #RhodesMustFall, lance le 9 mars 2015. Les manifestations etaient centrees sur la repression des systemes indigenes de pensee par le colonialisme. Notre projet devait prendre en compact limpact du colonialisme sur les Systemes indigenes de Guerison. Notre outil pour ce travail est la psychologie analytique de Jung, qui offre une fondation pour ouvrir le dialogue avec dautres cultures. 2) Le discours dans les cercles Jungiens sur la question de faire des excuses aux personnes de filiation africaine pour la maniere dont elles ont ete decrites dans la litterature Jungienne. Extrait dune video sur Monkey Valley: Lanalyste Jungienne Ester Haumann, revisitant le traumatisme de la guerre de Boer chez ses ancetres proches, pose la question provocante: comment se fait-il que les opprimes soient devenus les oppresseurs? Il en ressort que lorsque le traumatisme ne peut etre transforme il est repete. Vella Maseko, Guerisseuse Traditionnelle Africaine et psychologue clinicienne, repond en evoquant linquietude concernant la souffrance de la nation dAfrique du Sud, et comment les guerisseurs y repondent. Troisieme partie: le point de vue du professionnel de la sante traditionnel et la vision du monde, par Nomfundo Mlisa Les analystes Jungiens et les guerisseurs traditionnels ont mis en place des echanges critiques fondes sur differents obstacles politiques et historiques qui ont eu un impact negatif sur les systemes traditionnels de sante. Ceci souligne le lien entre la theorie Jungienne et la theorie de guerison traditionnelle. Par la theorie de la fenetre de Johari, un appel a lintrospection se fait dans toutes les cultures visant a faciliter les rencontres avec lautre, a linterieur de soi et entre nous. Le besoin de therapie  arc en ciel  fut repere, faisant des analystes Jungiens et des guerisseurs traditionnels dAfrique du Sud des pionniers dans lelaboration dune therapie  arc en ciel . Quatrieme partie: Conclusion, par Renee Ramsden Ce dialogue fut etabli par un petit groupe de praticiens des deux disciplines, qui ont avance dans la decouverte et la confiance de lautre. Dans la deuxieme conference, une approche narrative fut choisie, qui savera fructueuse. Les deux camps purent decrire leur parcours pour devenir des soignants, et les similarites furent marquantes. Lexperience de trouver un terrain dentente par la receptivite respectueuse envers lautre apporta un profond effet de guerison. Peut-etre que ceci peut offrir un schema relationnel de guerison qui pourrait fonctionner comme une bombe a graine (seedbomb) ecologique.Teil 1: die Geschichte: Peter Ammann Hier wird der Hintergrund dieses Projektes skizziert, ausgehend von Jungs Interesse an der afrikanischen Kultur, wobei seine kolonialen, ausbeuterischen Einstellungen kritisch uberpruft und diese mit seinem echten Interesse und seiner Bereitschaft, sich durch die Begegnung mit dem 'Anderen' zu verandern, abgeglichen werden. Vera Buhrmann verfolgte ihr Interesse an afrikanischen Heiltraditionen mit tiefem Respekt, aber es fehlte an der Wechselseitigkeit. Als sich Peter mit Nomfundo Mlisa, Klinischer Psychologe und traditioneller Heiler mit groSSem Interesse an Jung, traf, wurde das Projekt eines echten Dialogs zwischen Jungianischen Analytikern und afrikanischen traditionellen Heilern initiiert. Hogsback Video-Auszug: Themen waren Umbilini/Intuition und Traume aus afrikanischer und westlicher Perspektive. Beschreibungen von THP- und Jungianischen Analytikern, in denen Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschiede skizziert werden. Es wurde ein Fall beschrieben, in dem die internen Spaltungseffekte der Kolonisation deutlich gezeigt wurden. Ein Traum wurde mitgeteilt und hierzu wurden afrikanische und westliche Interpretationen angeboten. Teil 2: der Kontext: Fred Borchardt Zwei Zusammenhange werden hervorgehoben: 1) Die sozialaktivistische Bewegung RhodesMustFall, initiiert am 9. Marz 2015. Die Proteste konzentrierten sich auf die Unterdruckung indigener Denksysteme durch den Kolonialismus. Unser Projekt muSSte berucksichtigen, wie sich die Kolonialisierung auf indigene Heilsysteme ausgewirkt hatte. Unser Mittel bei dieser Arbeit bildet die Analytische Psychologie von Jung, die eine Grundlage fur den Dialog mit anderen Kulturen bietet. 2) Der Diskurs in Jungianischen Kreisen uber die Entschuldigung bei Menschen afrikanischer Herkunft fur die Art und Weise, wie sie, die Menschen, in der Jungianischen Literatur beschrieben wurden. Monkey Valley Video-Auszug: Ester Haumann, Jungianische Analytikerin, reflektiert uber das Trauma des Burenkrieges anhand ihrer unmittelbaren Herkunft und wirft die provokative Frage auf: Wie kommt es, daSS die Unterdruckten zum Unterdrucker werden? Es zeigte sich, daSS ein Trauma, wenn es unbearbeitet ist, wiederholt wird. Vella Maseko, afrikanische traditionelle Heilerin und klinische Psychologin, antwortete mit Besorgnis uber den Schmerz der Nation in Sudafrika und wie wir als Heiler darauf reagieren. Teil 3: Die Position und die Weltanschauung der traditionellen Heiler: Nomfundo Mlisa Jungianische Analytiker und traditionelle Heiler haben auf dem Hintergrund verschiedener sowohl kritischer politischer als auch historischer Altlasten, die sich negativ auf die traditionellen Gesundheitssysteme ausgewirkt haben, kritische Dialoge initiiert. Die Verbindung zwischen Jungianischer und traditioneller Heilungstheorie wird so unterstrichen. Ein Aufruf zur Selbstbeobachtung mittels der Johari-Window-Theorie zwischen den Kulturen ergeht, um Begegnungen untereinander, in und zwischen uns zu ermoglichen. Der Bedarf an einer Regenbogentherapie wurde gepragt, was die sudafrikanischen Jungianischen Analytiker und die traditionellen Heiler zu Pionieren bei der Einfuhrung einer Regenbogentherapie machte. Teil 4: Fazit: Renee Ramsden Dieser Dialog wurde durch eine kleine Gruppe von Praktikern beider Disziplinen konzipiert, die sich kennenlernen und vertrauen konnten. Bei der zweiten Konferenz wurde ein narrativer Ansatz gewahlt, der sehr gut funktionierte. Beide Seiten konnten ihre jeweiligen Reisewege zum Heilerwerden beschreiben und die Ahnlichkeiten waren auffallig. Die heilende Wirkung, durch respektvolles Miteinander Gemeinsamkeiten zu finden, war tiefgreifend. Vielleicht konnte dies ein heilendes Muster von Bezogenheit bieten, das wie eine okologische 'Saatbombe' funktionieren konnte.Parte 1: La storia: Peter Ammann Questa parte delinea lo sfondo di questo progetto, a partire dall'interesse di Jung per la cultura africana, rivedendo criticamente i suoi atteggiamenti coloniali e di sfruttamento, bilanciandoli con il suo vero interesse e la volonta di essere cambiato dal suo incontro con "l'altro". Vera Buhrmann ha portato avanti il suo interesse per le tradizioni africane di guarigione in modo profondamente rispettoso, ma cio che mancava era un interesse reciproco. Quando Peter incontro Nomfundo Mlisa, psicologo clinico e guaritore tradizionale con un profondo interesse per Jung, ebbe inizio il progetto di un vero dialogo tra analisti junghiani e guaritori tradizionali africani. Estratto video di Hogsback: I temi erano Umbilini/Intuizione, e Sogni da prospettive africane ed occidentali. Descrizioni fornite dagli analisti THP e junghiani, che delineano somiglianze e differenze. E' stato descritto un caso in cui sono chiaramente dimostrati gli effetti di scissione interna della colonizzazione. E' stato condiviso un sogno e sono state offerte interpretazioni africane ed occidentali. Parte 2: Il contesto: Fred Borchardt Vengono evidenziati due contesti: 1) Il movimento attivista sociale #RhodesMustFall, avviato il 9 Marzo 2015. Le proteste si sono concentrate sulla repressione dei sistemi di pensiero indigeni da parte del colonialismo. Il nostro progetto doveva tenere conto dell'impatto della colonizzazione sui sistemi di guarigione indigeni. Il nostro strumento in questo lavoro e la psicologia analitica di Jung, che offre una base per entrare in dialogo con altre culture. 2) Il dibattito allinterno dei circoli junghiani su come scusarsi con persone di origine africana per il modo in cui sono state descritte nella letteratura junghiana. Estratto video di Monkey Valley: Ester Haumann, analista junghiana, riflettendo sul trauma della guerra boera nei suoi antenati immediati, pone la provocatoria domanda: come mai l'oppresso diventa l'oppressore? E' emerso che quando il trauma non e trattato, viene ripetuto. Vella Maseko, guaritrice tradizionale africana e psicologa clinica, ha risposto con preoccupazione al dolore della nazione in Sud Africa, e come i guaritori possono rispondere a questo. Parte 3: La condizione dei guaritori tradizionali e la visione del mondo: Nomfundo Mlisa Gli analisti junghiani ed i guaritori tradizionali hanno avviato un dialogo basato sui diversi ostacoli politici e storici che hanno avuto un impatto negativo sui sistemi di cura tradizionali. Questo permette di evidenziare i collegamenti tra le teorie di cura junghiane e tradizionali. Si suggerisce che lauto-introspezione, attraverso la teoria cross-culturale di Johari Window, favorisca lincontro con gli altri, dentro di noi e tra di noi. Si sottolinea la necessita della terapia-arcobaleno, rendendo gli analisti junghiani sud-africani ed i guaritori tradizionali pionieri nellavviare una terapia-arcobaleno. Part 4: Conclusione: Renee Ramsden Questo dialogo e stato concepito come un piccolo gruppo di professionisti di entrambi le discipline, che potevano imparare a conoscersi e a fidarsi reciprocamente. Nella seconda conferenza e stato privilegiato un approccio narrativo, che ha funzionato molto bene. Entrambe le parti sono state in grado di descrivere il loro percorso per diventare guaritori e le somiglianze erano sorprendenti. L'effetto curativo del trovare un punto d'incontro attraverso il rispetto reciproco e stato profondo. Forse cio potrebbe offrire un modello di relazione di cura che potrebbe funzionare come una bomba di semi ecologica.Часть 1. История: Питер Амманн Рассказывается об истории этого проекта: от интереса Юнга к африканской культуре, через критический обзор его колониальных и эксплуататорских взглядов, которые уравновешивались искренним интересом и желанием быть измененным встречей с другим. Вера Бурманн с глубоким интересом и в очень уважительной манере изучала африканские традиции целительства, однако ответного интереса не последовало. Когда Питер встретился с Номфундо Млиса, клиническим психологом и традиционным целителем, который интересовался идеями Юнга, возник проект подлинного диалога между юнгианскими аналитиками и африканскими целителями. Хогсбэк видео отрывок: Темы были Умбилини/интуиция, сны с африканской и западной перспективы. Целители и аналитики дали свои описания, показав сходства и различия. Был описан случай, в котором внутренние расщепляющие эффекта колонизации были четко продемонстрированы. Было предложено сновидение с последующими африканскими и западными интерпретациями. Часть 2. Контекст: Фред Борхардт Отмчены два контекста: 1) движение социального активизма #РодесДолженПасть (#RhodesMustFall), которое началось 9го марта 2015 года. Протесты были направлены против колониализма и репрессий местной системы мысли. Наш проект должен был принять во внимание, как колонизация повлияла на местную Систему Целительства. Нашим инструментом в данной работе явилась аналитическая психология Юнга, которая дает основу для диалога с другими культурами. 2) Обсуждение в юнгианских кругах извинения перед людьми африканского происхождения за то, какими они были описаны в юнгианской литературе. Видео отрывок Долина обезьян: Юнгианский аналитик Эстер Хоман, размышляя о травме Бурской войны у своих предков, задает провокационный вопрос: как получается, что угнетенный становится угнетателем? Это происходит, если травма не переработана. В этом случае она повторяется. Африканский традиционный целитель и клинический психолог Велла Масеко с беспокойством говорит о боли своей южноафриканской нации и о том, как целителям откликаться на нее. Часть 3. Позиция и мировоззрение традиционного целителя. Номфундо Млиса Юнгианские аналитики и традиционные целители обсудили различные политические и исторические препятствия, которые негативно сказались на традиционной системе врачевания. Этот диалог подчеркнул связь между юнгианской и традиционной теорией врачевания. Призыв к самоинтроспекции с помощью окна Йогари в различных культурах понимается как возможность встречи друг с другом, внутри нас самих и между людьми. Потребность в радужной терапии была озвучена, а южноафриканские юнгианские аналитики и традиционные целители стали пионерами этого начинания. Часть 4. Заключение: Рени Расмден Этот диалог родился в небольшой группе специалистов обеих практик, которые смогли познакомиться и установить доверие, на второй встрече предпочтение было отдано нарративному подходу и это оказалось очень хорошим выбором. Обе стороны смогли описать свой путь к тому, чтобы стать целителями. Сходства оказались поразительными. Целительный эффект нахождения общей почвы, взаимного уважения и принятия друг друга был поистине глубоким. Вероятно, это может стать целительным паттерном отношений, которое может функционировать как экологичная питательная среда.Parte 1: La historia: Peter Ammann: Esta presentacion ofrece un diagrama del fundamento de este proyecto, comenzando con el interes de Jung en la cultura Africana, revisando criticamente sus actitudes coloniales y de explotacion, y a la vez balanceando las mismas con su interes genuino y su disponibilidad a ser transformado a traves del encuentro con el otro. Vera Buhrmann prosiguio su interes en las tradiciones de Curacion Africanas de un modo profundamente respetuoso, pero un interes reciproco estuvo ausente. Cuando Peter se encontro con Nomfundo Mlisa, psicologa clinica y curadora tradicional con un agudo interes en Jung, comenzo un proyecto de verdadero dialogo entre Analistas Junguianos y Curadores Tradicionales de Africa. Hogsback fragmento de video: Los temas fueron Umbilini/Intuicion, y Suenos desde las perspectivas de Africa y Occidente. Descripciones dadas por THP y analistas Junguianos, delinearon similitudes y diferencias. Se describio un caso en el cual los efectos disociativos internos del colonialismo fueron claramente demostrados. Se compartio un sueno y se ofrecieron interpretaciones de Africa y Occidente. Parte 2: El contexto: Fred Borchardt Se subrayan dos contextos: 1) El movimiento social activista RhodesMustFall, iniciado el 9 de Marzo de 2015. Las protestas se focalizaron en la represion de los sistemas de pensamiento indigena por parte del colonialismo. Nuestro proyecto debia tomar en cuenta como la colonizacion ha impactado en los Sistemas de Curacion Indigenas. Nuestro instrumento en este trabajo es la psicologia analitica de Jung, la cual ofrece una base para comenzar un dialogo con otras culturas. 2) El discurso en circulos Junguianos sobre el pedido de perdon a las personas de descendencia Africana por la forma en la cual son descriptos en la literatura Junguiana. Monkey Valley: fragmento de video: Ester Haumann, analista Junguiana, al reflexionar sobre el trauma de la Guerra Boer en sus ancestros inmediatos, plantea la provocativa pregunta: como es que sucede que el oprimido deviene en opresor? Emerge cuando el trauma no es procesado, y se repite. Vella Maseko, Curadora Tradicional Africana y psicologa clinica responde con preocupacion sobre el dolor de la nacion en Sud Africa, y como nosotros como curadores respondemos a esto. Parte 3: La posicion y la cosmovision del medico tradicional de la salud: Nomfundo Mlisa Analistas Junguianos y Curadores Tradicionales han iniciado dialogos criticos basados en diversas criticas politicas asi como en impedimentos historicos que impactaron negativamente en los sistemas tradicionales de salud. Se destacan los lazos entre la teoria Junguiana y las de curacion tradicional. Se expresa un llamado a la introspeccion a traves de la teoria de Johari Window para posibilitar encuentros entre unos y otros, dentro nuestro y entre nosotros. Se acuno la necesidad de una terapia del arcoiris, haciendo de los analistas Junguianos Sud Africanos, y de los curadores tradicionales, los pioneros en iniciar una terapia del arco iris. Parte 4: Conclusion: Renee Ramsden Este dialogo fue concebido como un encuentro de un pequeno grupo de ambas disciplinas, que podrian llegar a conocerse y a confiar unas en otras. En la segunda conferencia, un abordaje narrativo fue propuesto, el cual funciono muy bien. Ambos lados pudieron describir sus caminos para llegar a ser curadores, y las similitudes fueron llamativas. El efecto curador de encontrar un fundamento comun a traves de una respetuosa receptividad mutua fue profundo. Tal vez, esto pueda ofrecer un patron curador de relacionamiento, el cual podria funcionar como una ecologica bomba-de-semillas.与他者的相遇:荣格心理分析者和南非传统治愈者 第一部分:历史:彼得阿曼: Peter Ammann 这一部分描述了这个项目的背景, 从荣格对非洲文化的兴趣出发, 批判性地回顾他对于殖民主义和剥削的态度, 并平衡以他期望与他者相遇而改变的真正兴趣和意愿。Vera Buhrmann以一种尊重的态度探寻她对于非洲疗愈传统的兴趣, 但其中仍然缺少相互的兴趣。当彼得 (Peter Ammann)与Nomfundo Mlisa, 一位对荣格有着浓厚兴趣的临床心理学家、传统治愈者时相见时, 荣格心理分析者与非洲传统治愈者之间真正对话的项目就开始了。 霍格贝尔 (地名)视频片段: 主题是来自非洲及西方角度的直觉和梦境。THP和荣格心理分析者给出的描述, 概述了它们的相似性和差异性。文章描述了一个案例, 其中明确表明了殖民地化带来的内部分裂效应。视频分享了一个梦, 并提供了来自非洲和西方的梦的解释。 第二部分:背景:Fred Borchardt 强调了两个背景:1)2015年3月9日发起的社会活动家运动洛德斯必须倒下。抗议活动的重点是殖民主义对土著思想体系的镇压。我们的项目必须考虑到殖民对土著治疗系统的影响。我们项目的工具是荣格的分析心理学, 它提供了与其他文化进行对话的基础。2)荣格流派圈的论述在向非裔道歉, 致歉内容是关于荣格学派文献中描述非洲人的方式。 猴子谷 (地名)视频片段: 荣格心理分析师Ester Haumann在反思布尔战争对她直系祖先带来的心理创伤时, 提出了一个具有挑衅意味的问题:被压迫者如何变成了压迫者? 后来发现, 当心理创伤没有被处理, 就会反复重演。非洲传统治愈者、临床心理学家Vella Maseko对南非民族国家的痛苦以及作为治疗师如何应对这一问题表现了关切与忧虑。 第三部分:传统健康行业从业者的立场和世界观:Nomfundo Mlisa 尽管存在着对传统卫生系统产生负面影响的重重政治和历史阻碍, 荣格心理分析者和传统治疗师们依然化绊脚石为垫脚石而发起了重要的对话。这凸显了荣格学派与传统治疗理论之间的联系。有人呼吁通过约哈里之窗理论进行跨文化的我反省, 以允许彼此的交流与接触。这种接触既在我们各自内部, 亦指在我们两者之间。彩虹疗法的需求被创造, 南非的荣格心理分析者和传统治愈者共同成为了彩虹疗法的先驱。 第四部分:结论 Renee Ramsden: 这个对话来自于一个由多个专业组成的小组成员, 成员间互相熟悉并信任对方。在第二次的会议中, 叙事的取向受到了青睐, 并且效果非常好。两方面的参与者都可以叙述他们成为治疗者的旅程, 他们曾经历类似的困难。双方可以相互之间找到共识的基础, 其治愈效果是显著的。这或许可以提供一种治疗模式, 其功能类似于生态学的种子炸弹。.

AB  - Preliminary Research The Alumni Engagement Score is used by higher education institutions to measure the engagement of their alumni base. Industry standards for how such a score should be calculated were established by the Council of Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) in 2018. The CASE White Paper on Alumni Metrics and can be foundhere. CASE defines 'alumni engagement' as "activities that are valued by alumni, build enduring and mutually beneficial relationships, inspire loyalty and financial support, strengthen the institution's reputation and involve alumni in meaningful activities to advance the institution's mission.CASE recommends that the Alumni Engagement Score be broken down into four subscores: Volunteer, Experiential, Philanthropic, and Communication. These categories are defined by CASE as follows: Volunteer: "Formally defined and rewarding volunteer roles that are endorsed or valued by the institution and support its mission and strategic goals." Experiential: "Meaningful experiences that inspire alumni, are valued by the institution, promote its mission, celebrate its achievements and strengthen its reputation." Philanthropic: "Diverse opportunities for alumni to make philanthropic investments that are meaningful to the donor and support the institution's mission and strategic goals." Communication: "Interactive, meaningful and informative communication with alumni that supports the institution's mission, strategic goals and reputation." How the Score is Calculated at GW Following the guidance provided by CASE, The George Washington University created it's own Alumni Engagement Score in 2019 after five years of research, planning, and preparation. The Score is built to be as broad reaching as possible, while at the same time being specific, meaningful, measurable, understandable, and impactful. Each alum is given a Score on a scale of 0-100 and at GW, we define an 'engaged' alum as one that has a Score greater than zero. Overall, the Scores is a simple sum of how each alum scores in each of the four subscores: Volunteer, Experiential, Philanthropic, and Communication. Volunteer Calculation (Total Calculable Score: 30) : Current Member of a Board or Council (10 points) Other Current Volunteer Activity on record (up to 10 points) Past Volunteer Activity on record (up to 5 points) Past Member of a School Board or Council (5 points) Experiential Calculation (Total Calculable Score: 30): Event Attendance (up to 10 points) Lifelong Learning/Career Services (up to 10 points) Access Online Services (2.5 points) Recevied an Award from GW (2.5 points) Visit Contact Report (5 points) Philanthropic Calculation (Total Calculable Score: 20): Loyal Giving (2.5 points) Giving$1,000 -$49,999 (5 points) Current FY Donor or LYBUNT (2.5 points) Years Increasing Gift Amount (5 points) Leadership Giving of$100,000 or more (2.5 points) Planned Giving (2.5 points) Communication Calculation (Total Calculable Score: 15): Social Media Advocacy - Facebook Engagement (up to 10 points) Contact Report (up to 5 points) While the total calculable score in FY21 is just 95 possible points, the Alumni Engagement Score Project Working Group is actively working to improve the score. This fiscal year, we are working to build an additional measure for the communication subscore of up to 5 points to make the total calculable score 100. Currently, we are building the infrastructure tp measure this data point in our donor database so that we can use it in FY22. Key Findings Througout the course of this project, we clearly can see that there has been fluctuations in the average Alumni Engagement Scores over the past three calculations. However, year over year, the medians and modes have remained steady. Unfortunately, the proportion of alumni that are engaged, as defined as having a score greater than 0, has been steadily decreasing. When dividing alumni by their preferred school, the average Alumni Engagement Score changes each year, but alumni from the Law School and the Business School tended to have higher Scores on average. Meanwhile, alumni from CPS, GSPM and SON all had the lowest Scores on average. Once we had the average Scores from all alumni, I was curious to examine whether certain cohorts of alumni across the university were more engaged. The first cohort I examined were student atheletes, and it was quite clear that they are much more highly engaged than all alumni across the board. Additionally, alumni who participated in student activities were also more engaged than all alumni, just slightly less than student atheletes. Lastly, I sought to find out if alumni who have multiple degrees from GW were more engaged than all alumni. However, the averages year over year were only marginally higher than all alumni. When mapping all alumni across the United States, we saw that states with higher populations of alumni also had the most engaged alumni. Turning to the four subscores that make up the Alumni Engagement Score, the correlation matrix allows us to see the correlations of all the four subscores for each of the three years at once. Overall, the Philanthropic Subscore had the highest correlations with the overall Score for all three years. Each of the Subscores were only mildly correlated with each other, with the Communication Subscore having the lowest correlations with the other Subscores. Looking at the proportions of engaged alumni who had a score within each of the four subscores, there was minimal change in the proportion of alumni who scored highly in the Volunteer Subscore and the Philanthropic Subscore remained steady over the three years. Meanwhile, there were dramatic shifts in these proportions of alumni who scored in the Experiential and Communication Subscores. Conclusion Overall, the engagement of GW's alumni base has decreased over the past three fiscal years, as the proportion of GW Alumni who are 'engaged' has steadily declined. The biggest possible reason that the Scores have decreased over the last three years that should be taken into strong consideration is the fact that we are all experiencing a global pandemic. Alumni have been impacted financially, volunteer opportunities and events have had to be cancelled, and sadly, we are loosing a number of previously engaged alumni to the virus. DAR is doing everything it can to continue to engage alumni in meaningful ways virtually and are building the infrastructure to engage more alumni again once the pandemic is over. While CASE has not reported the average proportion of alumni that are engaged for a higher education institution for an easy comparison, on the surface, having only approximately 20% of the alumni base engaged could provide some pause. On the other hand, it could also provide an opportunity to bring more alumni from unengaged to the cohort of engaged alumni. This fiscal year, DAR's goal was to increase the average Alumni Engagement Score overall as well as the average Score for each of the schools. While these averages have fluctuated over the last three years, the most engaged alumni cohort are graduates of the Law School and the Business School. This could be because these schools have the 2nd and 3rd largest alumni bases. Anecdotally, one could also argue that alumni tend to favor their alma matter linked to their graduate school institution over their undergraduate institution. This is also why I sought to find out if alumni who had two or more degrees from GW were more engaged. Examining all four cohorts of alumni, we can see that those who were student athletes, those who participated in student activities, and those with multiple GW degrees all had a higher Alumni Engagement Score on average than all alumni. Therefore, I can can conclude, that at GW, activity while at student at GW can lead to stronger engagement as an alumnus. Looking at the map of where GW alumni live, most of our alumni live on the coasts. It was unsurprising then to find that the most engaged alumni also lived on the coasts, mostly in the DMV area as well as California and New York. Once we are allowed to have in-person events and volunteer opportunities again, it would be wise to continue to focus engagement on the areas with the biggest, most engaged alumni. Shifting our focus to the four Subscores that comprise the Alumni Engagement Score, the correlation matrix heat map provided some insight into how each Subscore is related. Overall, the Philanthropic Subscore had the strongest correlation with the overall Score for each fiscal year. The Volunteer Subscore and Experiential Subscore had consistent correlations with the overall Score across all three years, hovering around 0.5 and 0.6, respectively. The correlation between the Communication Subscore and the overall Score in FY19 was 0.45, however, in FY20 and FY21, the correlation increase dramatically to about 0.7. Each of the Subscores were only mildly correlated with each other, with the Communication Subscore having the lowest correlations with the other Subscores. Therefore, I can conclude that none of the Subscores are strongly correlated with each other. Lastly, I investigated the proportion of engaged alumni who had a score within each of the four subscores to discover if alumni were more engaged in some areas than others. As a result, I found that Experiential engagement has dropped significantly over the past three years, which is unsurprising given the pandemic. Surprisingly however, volunteer and philanthropic engagement have remained quite steady given the pandemic. However, we may not see the full effect of the pandemic on these two Subscores until FY22, as points are still given to past engagement in these two calculations. Lastly, the Communication Subscore has increased over the last two years, as we are capturing more communication data and during the pandemic more alumni are available to talk. Given the results of this project, I recommend that GW DAR continue to reach out to alumni in the hopes of engaging them in volunteer, experiential, and philanthropic opportunities in the virtual environment as we continue to navigate the effects of the global pandemic.

TI  - Mental health literacy: conceptions of mental illness among African residents of Sisonke District in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The prevalence of mental illness is on the rise, and there are many people with chronic or severe mental disorders who are unaware that they have a diagnosable disorder. It is plausible that this is largely because of the public's non-alignment with biomedical understandings of mental illness which may imply a lack of mental health literacy. This study investigated conceptions and aetiological beliefs about mental illness among 787 randomly selected African residents of Sisonke District using a survey. The results show that participants did not use standard psychological nomenclature to describe mental illness, but instead used very broad, over-encompassing terms which may be indicative of their worldview. Of the three disorders investigated, depression was mainly conceptualised using psychological and medical terms, and schizophrenia and alcohol dependency were conceptualised in psychological and social terms. In addition, only schizophrenia, among the three disorders investigated, was conceptualised using supernatural descriptions such as bewitchment and ukuthwasa. The findings of this study highlight the importance of awareness campaigns that take into consideration and respect the cultural differences of the people as well as collaboration between traditional and medical practitioners.

TI  - An Assesment of Usefulness of Smartphone as a Magnifying Device for Microsurgery Training.
T2  - Ortopedia, traumatologia, rehabilitacja
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently available smartphones are equipped with optic systems allowing even 10x magnifi-ca-tion, which makes it possible to use them as magnifying devices for microsurgery training. The objective of this study was to assess the usefulness of smartphones for basic microsurgery training.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two students began experimental microsurgical training using a smartphone as a magni-fy-ing device. Both students had acquired microsurgical skills following training under the microscope. For the expe-riment, the time of completion of a "6 stitches" test was measured and compared for each student using a smartphone and a microscope, after 1 and 6 hours of training using only a smartphone.RESULTS: After one hour of training, the first student completed the "6 stitches" test within 7:52 min. under the mi-croscope and within 16:35 min. using a smartphone, while the respective scores of the second student were 12:31 and 20:12 min.. In both cases the time required to complete the test was longer when working with a smartphone. The test was repeated after 6 hours of practice with a telephone, and the results now were as follows: first student 7:10 min. with the microscope and 12:50 min. with a smartphone, second student 8:54 min. with the microscope and 12:01 min. with a smartphone.CONCLUSIONS: 1. The microsurgical skills of both trainees improved gradually when they were using a smartphone (by 3:8 min. and 8:1 min) and the microscope (by 0:4 min. and 3:8 min). 2. Two drawbacks of the smartphone were noticed: lack of three-dimensional vision, deteriorating vertical orientation in the operating field and worse vision quality compared to the microscope. 3. Advantages of this tool include the availability of training at home, low cost and possibility of analysis of images recorded in the smartphone memory.

TI  - Land cover classification method considering the contribution of waveform characteristic parameters and the pooling scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In view of current land cover classification methods using the full-waveform characteristic parameters from spaceborne lasers, land cover categories are misclassified because the extracted features cannot accurately distinguish various types of features. We propose a land cover classification method that considers the contribution of waveform feature parameters and the pooling scale. First, the waveform after preprocessing and Gaussian decomposition is characteristic extracted and roughly classified, and the importance of each waveform feature parameter is evaluated and sorted. The best feature parameter set is determined by backward selection of the waveform feature parameters. Moreover, the original waveforms are pooled at different scales, and the correlations between ground objects after pooling are compared with the correlations between the original waveforms to ensure the stability of the correlation between various waveforms of ground objects and the peak information of waveforms while reducing the amount of data. Finally, random forest (RF) and support vector machine classifiers are selected to complete the land cover classification experiment based on the optimal waveform parameter set and the optimal pooling scale. We use ICESat (ice, cloud, and land elevation satellite) and Geoscience Laser Altimeter System data from the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebeii region for verification. The results show that, based on the RF classifier, the overall classification accuracy was 86.95%, and the use of spaceborne laser waveform characteristic parameters compared with the classification method greatly improved the accuracy, fully verifying the feasibility of the method in classifying land cover types. These findings can provide a technical basis for the application and promotion of GaoFen 7(GF-7) and other follow-up, satellite-based laser altimetry data in the fine-grained classification of land cover types.

TI  - Precursory worldwide signatures of earthquake occurrences on Swarm satellite data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the preparation phase of large earthquakes is essential to understand the physical processes involved, and potentially useful also to develop a future reliable short-term warning system. Here we analyse electron density and magnetic field data measured by Swarm three-satellite constellation for 4.7 years, to look for possible in-situ ionospheric precursors of large earthquakes to study the interactions between the lithosphere and the above atmosphere and ionosphere, in what is called the Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere Coupling (LAIC). We define these anomalies statistically in the whole space-time interval of interest and use a Worldwide Statistical Correlation (WSC) analysis through a superposed epoch approach to study the possible relation with the earthquakes. We find some clear concentrations of electron density and magnetic anomalies from more than two months to some days before the earthquake occurrences. Such anomaly clustering is, in general, statistically significant with respect to homogeneous random simulations, supporting a LAIC during the preparation phase of earthquakes. By investigating different earthquake magnitude ranges, not only do we confirm the well-known Rikitake empirical law between ionospheric anomaly precursor time and earthquake magnitude, but we also give more reliability to the seismic source origin for many of the identified anomalies.

TI  - Analysis on the endemic situation of schistosomiasis in Ruichang, Jiangxi, from 2009 to 2017.
T2  - Chinese Journal of Parasitology and Parasitic Diseases
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To analyze the endemic situation of schistosomiasis in Ruichang, Jiangxi Province from 2009 to 2017, so as to provide reference for formulating the corresponding prevention and control measures and strategies. Methods The annually reported data related to the prevention and control of schistosomiasis in Ruichang were collected from 2009 to 2017. These data mainly include the annual examination of schistosomiasis in the population, the treatment for the advanced schistosomiasis patients, status for livestock infection and snail control. Then a database related to the Schistosoma infections of humans, livestock and snail was established accordingly by using township as calculated units. The serological positive rate in humans, the fecal egg positive rate in livestock, the area with snail, the occurrence rate and the density of living snails were analyzed based on the database. Results A total of 736 216 individuals received examination for schistomiasis including 703 121 received serological test. Total 6 404 were serologically positive with positive rate of 0.40%[approximately]1.48%, which was statistical difference between the years (P < 0.01). The serological positive rate increased after flood in 2016 and reached to 1.45% (701/48 458) in 2017, with a significant difference compared with 2015 (0.40%, 357/90 271). Total 107 318 individuals received fecal examination with 292 egg positive, with positive rate ranging from 0 to 1.24%, with statistical difference between different years (P < 0.01). The egg positive patients were mainly distributed in 7 townships including Xiafan (25.68%, 75/292), Fanzhen (21.23%, 62/292), Matou (15.75%, 46/292), Guilin (12.33%, 36/292), Gaofeng (11.99%, 35/292), Henggang (8.90%, 26/292) and Nanyang (3.42%, 10/292). There was no acute schistosomiasis patient found in consecutive 9 years. There was no fecal positive patient since 2015. However, there were still 209 cases of advanced schistosomiasis in Ruichang region mainly distributed in the town of Xiafan (73, 34.93%), Gaofen (51, 24.40%), Fanzhen (24, 11.48%), Huangjin (22, 10.53%) and Matou (15, 7.18%). The total number of 36 460 cattle were examined from 2009 to 2017, in which 258 confirmed with infection of Schistosoma, most of them distributed in Xiafan (87, 33.72%), Gaofeng (48, 18.60%), Huangjin (62, 24.42%) and Wujiao (29, 11.24%). Total 262 infected cattle received anthelmintic treatment and the mass administration of anthelmintic expanded to 29 750 cattle. The area with snails decreased year by year since 2009 (615.99 hm<sup>2</sup>), and reached to the lowest level of 584.11 hm<sup>2</sup> in 2015, however, the difference in area with snail between 2015 and 2009 was no significant. The incidence of frames with snails decreased from 20.56% in 2009 to 10.78% in 2015, with statistical differences between the years (P < 0.01). Similarly, the density of snail decreased from 0.34/frame in 2009 to 0.16 /frame in 2015, with statistical difference between the two years (P < 0.05). Affected by the flood in 2016, the area with snail increased 43.60% (838.76 hm<sup>2</sup>) compared to that in 2015 with significant difference (P < 0.01), however, there was no significant change for the occurrence rate with snail in frames and the density of snail. In 2017, the incidence of frames with snails reached to 27.94%, and the density of snails reached to 0.56/frame, which were significantly higher than that in 2015 (10.78%, 0.16/frame)(P < 0.01). This increase happened in main nine towns of Ruichang. The correlation coefficient between serological positive rate in people, fecal egg positive rates in human and cattle and the area with snail, snail density, percentage of frames with snail was low (r = -0.199-0.202), without significance. Conclusion The endemic situation of schistosomiasis in Ruichang region was decreasing year by year since 2009. However, Matou, Gaofeng, Fanzhen, Xiafan, Henggang and Guilin are still the main areas with high risk of schistosomiasis transmission and the major areas for the disease control. Snail control is difficult to be consolidated and greatly affected by flood and other natural factors. Therefore, it is critical to establish emergent plan and the monitoring system after flood to prevent rebound of schistosomiasis in the flooded area.

TI  - Observed Deep-Reaching Signatures of the Madden-Julian Oscillation in the Ocean Circulation of the Western Tropical Pacific
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Prominent intraseasonal variability (ISV) of ocean currents was detected by two subsurface moorings deployed at 140 degrees E, 2 degrees N, and 4.7 degrees N during 2014-2018 and shown to be largely induced by westerly wind bursts (WWBs) associated with passages of Madden-Julian oscillations (MJOs). The North Equatorial Countercurrent between 60 and 200 m is enhanced (attenuated) by 6-8 cm/s prior (subsequent) to the WWB. Current anomalies below 300 m are as large as 2-3 cm/s, close in magnitude to the mean velocities of the North Equatorial Subsurface Current and North Subsurface Countercurrent. The ISV in the upper 600 m shows a vertical dipole structure at 2 degrees N and vertically coherent anomalies at 4.7 degrees N. Further analysis combining satellite data reveals local recirculation structures generated by wind-forced Rossby waves. Ocean model experiments confirm the importance of the MJO's wind forcing in causing these subsurface ocean ISVs.

TI  - A Study of the North Water Polynya Ice Arch using Four Decades of Satellite Data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Polynyas are sections of the polar ocean that remain relatively ice-free during winter, imparting significant physical and biological impact on the region. The North Water polynya (NOW) situated between Ellesmere Island and Greenland is the largest recurring Arctic polynya. Historically, the NOW forms every season when Arctic Ocean floes moving southward through Nares Strait become congested and form an ice arch that defines the northern border of the polynya. This blockage usually forms during winter and breaks down in spring. It is conjectured that the polynya is maintained by latent heat of fusion from the continuous formation of new ice as floes are swept southward from the ice arch by wind and ocean currents. Analysis of four decades of satellite imagery indicates a growing instability in the location of the ice arch, challenging previous models of polynya maintenance. A linear trend of the data indicates the number of days of Nares Strait blockage has decreased 2.1 days/year between 1979 and 2019 with wide interannual variations. Prior to 2007, ice arches blocked Nares Strait an average of 177 days/year compared to 128 days/year since that time. The overall trend of reduced ice arch duration is a contributing factor to the dramatic loss of multiyear ice in the Arctic basin.

TI  - Comprehensive Analysis of the Magnetic Signatures of Small-Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances,as Observed by Swarm
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on Swarm satellite data from 2015 through 2018, we present the mean characteristics of magnetic field fluctuations at midlatitudes and low latitudes. It is the first comprehensive study focusing on small-scale variations (<10 km). Events are observed on about 35% of the orbits. The highest occurrence rates are detected after sunset, in the East Asian/Australian sector, and during months around June solstice. Low occurrence rates are found at low magnetic latitudes (below +/- 10 degrees quasi-dipole latitude), in the region of the South Atlantic Anomaly, and during equinox seasons. All these occurrence features compare well with those of medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances. We therefore term our small-scale events small-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (SSTIDs). SSTIDs exhibit high field-aligned current (FAC) densities connected to narrow current sheets with meridional width of typically 4 km. The intense FACs of several mu A/m(2) flow typically between the hemispheres. Return currents are distributed over larger scales and thus have smaller amplitudes. Peak current densities get larger toward lower latitudes. There are two groups of events, around morning-noontime and evening-night, which are separated by demarcation lines near 04 and 15 magnetic local time. The magnetic amplitudes of the small-scale fluctuations are larger in sunlight than in darkness, indicating larger total currents in the loops. But the FAC peak current densities are larger in darkness, inferring a stronger squeezing of the current sheet under low-conductivity conditions. We suggest that our SSTIDs are an evolutional state of medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances.

TI  - Aerial laser scanning reveals the dynamics of cropland abandonment in Poland
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the patterns of cropland abandonment is important when formulating policies that can limit negative and facilitate positive outcomes of abandonment. We present a new approach to determining the dynamics of this phenomenon using aerial laser scanning (ALS) data. Assuming that the height of trees correlates with their age made it possible to reconstruct the dynamics of cropland abandonment in the roughly 30-year period preceding the date of the measurements. The variability of forest cover growth over time can be represented by a curve similar in shape to a Gaussian function or a curve resulting from overlapping two or more individual curves shifted in time. The presented research shows that a single ALS measurement can be useful in the process of assessing the current extent of cropland abandonment, the dynamics of its changes in the past, and short-term forecasting of changes in the future.

TI  - Satellite-Observed Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Concentration Variability and Its Relation to Physical Environmental Changes in the East Sea (Japan Sea) from 2003 to 2015
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatio-temporal variability of the chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration in the East Sea (Japan Sea) (EJS) was investigated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over 13 years from 2003 to 2015 to understand the impact of physical environmental changes on low-trophic level marine ecosystems. The chl-a images were composited to produce gridded monthly chl-a images using a weighted average method after applying a speckle removal algorithm to each path image. Missing pixels without any satellite observations because of cloud coverage were objectively filled using three-dimensional optimal interpolation. The first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode of the monthly chl-a images, accounting for 14% of the total variance, showed higher eigenvectors values in the eastern part of the EJS and distinct annual peaks each spring. The amplitudes of the first EOF mode, despite the dominant year-to-year variations in chl-a, tended to increase during spring over time. The recent 13-year trend of chl-a showed differences between the southwestern part and the northeastern part of the EJS, and this difference clearly appeared in the monthly trend maps for March and April. The eastern coast of Korea showed a highly positive trend during summer, particularly during August. The changes in chl-a over the decade were related to the physical environmental changes in sea surface wind, mixed layer depth, and stratification of upper sea water in the EJS.

TI  - Disyllabic Combining Forms and Their Stressed Vowels
T2  - STUDIA NEOPHILOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is concerned with the question of why in the case of some English disyllabic combining forms, the stressed penult contains either a long or short vowel; e.g., the combining form zygo- can be pronounced either /|z & x28c;?g & x259;& x28a;/ or /|z?g & x259;& x28a;/, with the nucleus of the stressed penult being interchangeably the diphthong /& x28c;?/ and the short monophthong /?/. It is argued that long pronunciations such as /|z & x28c;?g & x259;& x28a;/ are mainly due to occurrences in pen-initially stressed formations such as zy|goma, zy|gosis, zy|gotic, etc., in which pre-tonic y has the potential of being phonetically realized as /& x28c;?/. Short pronunciations such as /|z?g & x259;& x28a;/ are, by contrast, mainly due to formations such as |zygospore and |zygotene, in which the stressed syllable is separated from the right word boundary by at least two unstressed syllables (which, given the oft-mentioned stress-timing of the English language, may count for an English speaker as rhythmically unfortunate).

AB  - Modifications such as degrading the retrieval quality of mixed pixels in the coastline area and revising surface characterization scheme have been made to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1 (C6.1) Dark Target (DT) aerosol optical depth (AOD) product to address inaccuracy over urban areas. In this study, comprehensive evaluations of modifications to the MODIS C6.1 DT AOD product, in comparison with Collection 6 (C6), are conducted over mainland China under different spatial distributions, seasons, and air quality for the period 2010-2017, combined with validation against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD measurements. The preliminary result showed that the C6.1 DT AOD product in China displayed an overall good performance with high R-2 (0.87) and low root-mean-square error (0.23) against ground measurements. Moreover, the C6.1 DT AOD product was an overall improvement over C6, with greater correlation and lower uncertainty against ground measurements, especially for the North China Plain and Central China, although this was not the case for Western China. The improvement was also seasonal, being distinct in spring but less pronounced in winter, and negatively correlated with the level of air pollution. Furthermore, the analysis of DT AOD retrievals in different urbanized areas illustrated that the updated DT algorithm worked well in completely urbanized areas, where 97% of C6.1 DT AOD retrievals were an improvement over C6, while approximately 10% of C6.1 DT AOD retrievals were deteriorated in semiurbanized areas. Additionally, the DT AOD retrievals in areas with relatively low enhanced vegetation index and high surface reflectance were significantly improved, mitigating problems associated with the DT algorithm, further improving the reliability of MODIS DT AOD products.Plain Language Summary Modifications have been made to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) product to address inaccuracy over urban areas. This study evaluates the MODIS AOD product in comparison with the old version. Specifically, we evaluated products' performance over mainland China under different spatial distributions, seasons, and air quality for the period 2010-2017. It was demonstrated that the updated AOD retrieval algorithm show a visible improvement in highly urbanized areas, as well as areas with relatively low enhanced vegetation index and high surface reflectance. However, because the surface reflectance scheme was trained over the continental United States, it could not effectively describe the complex surfaces in Eastern and Western China, and therefore, further improvement is required in this regard.

TI  - Red tide detection using deep learning and high-spatial resolution optical satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Red tide is one of the most devastating phenomena that have impacted coastal environments and fishery on a local scale in the worldwide seas. Satellite imagery can provide a synoptic view of the red tides over the wide region. Previous methods to detect the red tides have not sufficiently performed and revealed limitations in the study region. This study developed a red tide detection scheme based on the deep-learning method by using Landsat-8 OLI data during unprecedented explosive red tide events in the southern coastal region of the Korean Peninsula in 2013. To develop and validate the red tide detection of this study, we conducted cruise campaigns to obtain in-situ water sampling for red tide species and its density, chlorophyll-a concentration, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and spectrum data of red tides as a target object and other reference data using a spectroradiometer in the coastal regions from 2013 to 2015. The seawater shows different spectral shape by its components such as red tide, chlorophyll-a concentration, and SPM. Spectral characteristics of the red tides demonstrated bimodal peaks over visible wavelengths regardless of the species of the red tide. Considering such spectral characteristics, the red tide detection algorithm was constructed by the deep-learning method with Landsat-8 OLI level-2 reflectance values and in-situ red tide observations. The validation results of the algorithm as compared with the map of in-situ red tide measurements showed a high probability of detection values greater than 0.7. These works have made it possible to monitor the red tides with high-spatial resolution satellite data and provide a tool to minimize a lot of socioecological impacts from red tide.

TI  - Estimation of local daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration during wildfire episodes: integrating MODIS AOD with multivariate linear mixed effect (LME) models
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal peaks of air pollution from wildfires are increasing in frequency and severity in the western provinces of Canada. During these episodes, populations are exposed to adverse short-term health effects due to elevated levels of fine particulate matter, which is the primary pollutant associated with smoke. The spatial resolution of ground-based monitoring records generally is not sufficient for emergency preparedness and epidemiological studies of such events. Accurate spatial and temporal models of smoke pollution for the study of smoke exposure effects require reliable, fine-scale input data. Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) measures can provide a valuable alternative to the coarse spatial resolution of ground PM2.5 monitoring network measurements. Numerous statistical approaches have been used to estimate the link between AOD and PM2.5, most of which consider the relationship between AOD and PM2.5 as being fixed over space and for an entire day; however, due to time-varying meteorological variables, that relationship changes over time and space. Hence, to capture the effects of temporal and spatial variations on the AOD-PM2.5 relationship, two nested linear mixed effect (LME) models are developed herein. Daily estimation of PM2.5 concentration is derived by incorporating nested period-zone-specific random effects of the AOD-PM2.5 relationship over the province of Alberta, Canada. Model validation shows that LME improves the estimation performance of the model compared with ordinary multivariate linear regression by more than 115%. Our findings indicate that the potential of the LME model increases when additional variables are integrated with AOD measures in a multivariate framework. This single model yields an array of reliable spatial-temporal estimates of daily PM2.5 concentrations from wildfire at fine spatial resolution.

TI  - Assimilating GRACE Into a Land Surface Model in the Presence of an Irrigation-Induced Groundwater Trend
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Assimilating terrestrial water storage observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission into land surface models (LSMs) provides an opportunity to disaggregate and downscale GRACE information to finer scales and improve water component estimates in LSMs. However, the performance of GRACE data assimilation (GRACE-DA) is limited by the lack of representation of human activities in most LSMs. To simultaneously improve GRACE-DA and reduce the uncertainties in the modeled anthropogenic processes, we assimilate mascon-based GRACE terrestrial water storage into the Noah-Multiparameterization LSM that includes groundwater extraction for irrigation. Simulations with and without GRACE-DA and with and without groundwater pumping for irrigation are performed to study the isolated and combined effects of groundwater irrigation and GRACE-DA on water and energy fluxes over the High Plains Aquifer (HPA). The results reveal that the DA-only simulation may erroneously distribute increments across water storage components and affect the related fluxes through biased feedbacks, while the irrigation-only simulation may overestimate groundwater decline due to shortcomings in the irrigation and groundwater parameterizations. Assimilating GRACE when irrigation is simulated produces the best overall performance for water storage trends over the northern HPA. For the southern HPA, GRACE assimilation with irrigation performs similarly to irrigation-only simulation for water storage components and evapotranspiration. GRACE assimilation also improves results in nonirrigated regions and can potentially alleviate the overestimation of groundwater trends in regions with greater irrigation uncertainties. This study highlights the potential to advance hydrological data assimilation in the context of anthropogenic water consumption and land-atmosphere interactions.

TI  - High Rates of Inflation During a Noneruptive Episode of Seismic Unrest at Semisopochnoi Volcano, Alaska in 2014-2015
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Magma intrusion rate is a key parameter in eruption triggering but is poorly quantified in existing geodetic studies. Here we examine two episodes of rapid inflation in this context. Two noneruptive microseismic swarms were recorded at Semisopochnoi Volcano, Alaska in 2014-2015. We use differential SAR techniques and TerraSAR-X images to document surface deformation from 2011 to 2015, which comprises island-wide radial inflation totaling similar to 25 cm (+/-1 cm) line of sight displacement in 2014-2015. Multiple source geometries are tested in an inversion of the deformation data, and InSAR data are best fit by a spheroid trending to the northeast and plunging to the southeast, with a major axis of similar to 4 km and minor axes of similar to 1 km, directly under the central caldera of Semisopochnoi. In 2014, a modeled influx of 0.043 km(3) of magma caused line of sight displacement of similar to 17 cm. This magma was stored at a depth of similar to 8 km, until 2015 when 0.029 km(3) was added. Along with the definition of inflation source parameters, the recorded seismic events are relocated using differential travel times. These relocated events outline a linear aseismic area within a larger zone of shallow (<10 km) seismicity. This aseismic region aligns with the centroid of the deformation model. Based on these geodetic and seismic models, the plumbing system at Semisopochnoi is interpreted as a spheroidal magma storage zone at a depth of similar to 8 km below a linear feature of partial melt. The observed deformation and seismicity appear to result from rapid injection into this main storage region.

TI  - Meteorology influencing springtime air quality, pollution transport, and visibility in Korea
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - In an environment with many local, remote, persistent, and episodic sources of pollution, meteorology is the primary factor that drives periods of unhealthy air quality and reduced visibility. The 2016 Korea-United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) field study provides a unique opportunity to examine the impact of meteorology on the relative influence of local and transboundary pollution. Much of the KORUS-AQ campaign can be grouped into four distinct research periods based on observed synoptic meteorology, including a period of complex aerosol vertical profiles driven by dynamic meteorology, stagnation under a persistent anticyclone, low-level transport and haze development, and a blocking pattern. These episodes are examined using a diverse archive of ground, airborne, and satellite data. While frontal boundaries are recognized as the primary mechanism driving pollution transport in eastern Asia, results show that they are not always related to sustained periods of hazardous air quality and reduced visibility at the surface. Significant long-range transport of pollution and dust was constrained to a few short events, suggesting that the majority of pollutants sampled during KORUS-AQ originated from local sources. A severe regional pollution episode is examined in detail, featuring dense haze and significant secondary particle formation within a shallow moist boundary layer. Observations during KORUS-AQ also highlight a rapid, 40 ppbv increase in ozone pollution as a strong sea breeze front traversed the Seoul Metropolitan Area. Representativeness of meteorology and pollution conditions measured by KORUS-AQ is considered by comparison with climatology. This analysis is an essential step toward improved local and regional forecasting of air quality and visibility.

TI  - Effects of cold exposure revealed by global transcriptomic analysis in ferret peripheral blood mononuclear cells
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Animal studies, mostly performed in rodents, show the beneficial anti-obesity effects of cold studies. This is due to thermogenic activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT), a tissue also recently discovered in adult humans. Studies in humans, however, are hampered by the accessibility of most tissues. In contrast, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are accessible and share the expression profile of different sets of genes with other tissues, including those that reflect metabolic responses. Ferrets are an animal model physiologically closer to humans than rodents. Here, we investigated the effects on ferrets of one-week acclimation to 4 degrees C by analysing the PBMC transcriptome. Cold exposure deeply affected PBMC gene expression, producing a widespread down-regulation of genes involved in different biological pathways (cell cycle, gene expression regulation/protein synthesis, immune response, signal transduction, and genes related to extracellular matrix/cytoskeleton), while thermogenic and glycogenolysis-related processes were increased. Results obtained in PBMC reflected those of adipose tissue, but hardly those of the liver. Our study, using ferret as a model, reinforce PBMC usefulness as sentinel biological material for cold-exposure studies in order to deepen our understanding of the general and specific pathways affected by cold acclimation. This is relevant for future development of therapies to be used clinically.

TI  - No treeline advance over the last 50 years in subarctic western and central Canada and the problem of vegetation misclassification in remotely sensed data
T2  - ECOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we examined (1) whether there has been significant tree cover change over the period 1960-2010 in a 960,000 km(2) subarctic study region in western and central Canada, and (2) the degree to which Global Forest Change (GFC) tree cover data agree with other datasets. We compared GFC tree cover to cover estimates from air photos (c. 1960), ground-level plot data (c. 1982-84), annotated low-level oblique photographs (c. 2005-09), and air photo footprints on the World Imagery Base Map (c. 2010). Tree cover changes since 1960 varied by physiographic and ecological regions. Afforestation was modest to non-significant depending on the region. We observed no evidence of northward tree migration. An increase in the areal extent of burned forests, mostly in areas south of the forest-tundra, was the largest change detected. We documented systematic discrepancies between our tree cover estimates and GFC data. GFC underestimates of tree cover typically occurred in areas of low tree density. Areas where GFC data overestimated tree cover were common, especially near the northern limits of trees and in areas dominated by dense or tall shrubs. Predictions of climate-driven vegetation response derived solely from remotely sensed data may not be reliable.

TI  - A blessing for the Yangtze River: optimization of Chinese regional policy planning for water yield and purification in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) changes impact the structure and functioning of ecosystems, which consequently influences the provisioning of a range of ecosystem services (ES). There is a growing consensus regarding the merit of integrating the evaluation of ES into regional policy planning. The Yangtze River is the world's third longest and supports more than 6% of its population. However, assessing the potential impacts of different resource management policies upon ES is complicated in the Yangtze basin. To remedy this, here we designed a scenario analysis-based approach that used remotely sensed data and GIS (geographic information system) to analyze the relationships between ES (i.e., water flow regulation, water purification) and policies envisioned to improve human welfare in the Chongqing municipality, in the upper reaches of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) in the Yangtze basin. This watershed area has high population density and suffers from severe flood hazard and critical pollution issues. The GEOMOD modeling technique was used to predict LULC changes according to policy planning alternatives, producing scenarios by 2050 for the TGRA watershed. The GIS-based ES model (InVEST model) was developed as a tool to inform the decision-making process with the intention of aligning conservation measures with economic development. We examine policy effectiveness by comparing three scenarios for 2050: scenario-1 maintains the current policy, with no considerations of ES; scenario-2 integrates ES into policy planning; and scenario-3 integrates ES into policy planning considering the needs of local people. Our scenario-based LULC change analysis showed that the land with large increases in water flow regulation (i.e., values <=-3000 x 10(3) m(3) km(-2)) were scattered over the entire study area, while phosphorus reduction (i.e., values <= -30 kg km(-2)) were located mainly along rivers in all scenarios. Scenario-2 and scenario-3 are based on policies aiming at enhancing ES provisioning; for these, the projected ecological risks of water pollution are significantly reduced (39.97% and 37.58%, respectively). Total net changes of the investigated ES under scenario-2 or scenario-3 were almost double that occurring under scenario-1. Although scenario-2 and scenario-3 showed a near-equal total net change, water purification under scenario-2 was the greatest relative to forest expansion. However, scenario-3 offered the best future environmental development scenario, as it accounted for the demand and supply characteristics of water yield and purification in different regions. The water purification service made the greatest contribution to positive and negative effects (26%-47% and -7%, respectively) on ES provisioning. Linking water purification service to policy planning would effectively improve the overall ES. These scenario forecasting results will help the Three Gorges Dam to gain more ecological benefits via improvements to water flow regulation and the effective alleviation of degraded water quality in heavily populated regions in the Yangtze basin.

TI  - Breast MRI and tumour biology predict axillary lymph node response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer
T2  - CANCER IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In patients who have had axillary nodal metastasis diagnosed prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, there is little consensus on how to manage the axilla subsequently. The aim of this study was to explore whether a combination of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessed response and primary tumour pathology factors could identify a subset of patients that might be spared axillary node clearance. Methods A retrospective data analysis was performed of patients with core biopsy-proven axillary nodal metastasis prior to commencement of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) who had subsequent axillary node clearance (ANC) at definitive breast surgery. Breast tumour and axillary response at MRI before, during and on completion of NAC, core biopsy tumour grade, tumour type and immunophenotype were correlated with pathological response in the breast and the number of metastatic nodes in the ANC specimens. Results Of 87 consecutive patients with MRI at baseline, interim and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy who underwent ANC at time of breast surgery, 33 (38%) had no residual macrometastatic axillary disease, 28 (32%) had 1-2 metastatic nodes and 26 (30%) had more than 2 metastatic nodes. Factors that predicted axillary nodal complete response were MRI complete response in the breast (p < 0.0001), HER2 positivity (p = 0.02) and non-lobular tumour type (p = 0.015). Conclusion MRI assessment of breast tumour response to NAC and core biopsy factors are predictive of response in axillary nodes, and can be used to guide decision making regarding appropriate axillary surgery.

TI  - Schistosomiasis - Assessing Progress toward the 2020 and 2025 Global Goals
T2  - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is estimated that schistosomiasis infects more than 140 million persons globally. In this report, data on the progress of control from nine countries (eight in Sub-Saharan Africa plus Yemen) are presented. Various chemotherapy treatment strategies in countries were analyzed to assess the effect on heavy-intensity infection.Background With the vision of "a world free of schistosomiasis," the World Health Organization (WHO) set ambitious goals of control of this debilitating disease and its elimination as a public health problem by 2020 and 2025, respectively. As these milestones become imminent, and if programs are to succeed, it is important to evaluate the WHO programmatic guidelines empirically. Methods We collated and analyzed multiyear cross-sectional data from nine national schistosomiasis control programs (in eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in Yemen). Data were analyzed according to schistosome species (Schistosoma mansoni or S. haematobium), number of treatment rounds, overall prevalence, and prevalence of heavy-intensity infection. Disease control was defined as a prevalence of heavy-intensity infection of less than 5% aggregated across sentinel sites, and the elimination target was defined as a prevalence of heavy-intensity infection of less than 1% in all sentinel sites. Heavy-intensity infection was defined as at least 400 eggs per gram of feces for S. mansoni infection or as more than 50 eggs per 10 ml of urine for S. haematobium infection. Results All but one country program (Niger) reached the disease-control target by two treatment rounds or less, which is earlier than projected by current WHO guidelines (5 to 10 years). Programs in areas with low endemicity levels at baseline were more likely to reach both the control and elimination targets than were programs in areas with moderate and high endemicity levels at baseline, although the elimination target was reached only for S. mansoni infection (in Burkina Faso, Burundi, and Rwanda within three treatment rounds). Intracountry variation was evident in the relationships between overall prevalence and heavy-intensity infection (stratified according to treatment rounds), a finding that highlights the challenges of using one metric to define control or elimination across all epidemiologic settings. Conclusions These data suggest the need to reevaluate progress and treatment strategies in national schistosomiasis control programs more frequently, with local epidemiologic data taken into consideration, in order to determine the treatment effect and appropriate resource allocations and move closer to achieving the global goals.

TI  - Antimicrobial sensing coupled with cell membrane remodeling mediates antibiotic resistance and virulence in <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Bacteria have developed several evolutionary strategies to protect their cell membranes (CMs) from the attack of antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by the innate immune system, including remodeling of phospholipid content and localization. Multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, an opportunistic human pathogen, evolves resistance to the lipopeptide daptomycin and AMPs by diverting the antibiotic away from critical septal targets using CM anionic phospholipid redistribution. The LiaFSR stress response system regulates this CM remodeling via the LiaR response regulator by a previously unknown mechanism. Here, we characterize a LiaR-regulated protein, LiaX, that senses daptomycin or AMPs and triggers protective CM remodeling. LiaX is surface exposed, and in daptomycin-resistant clinical strains, both LiaX and the N-terminal domain alone are released into the extracellular milieu. The N-terminal domain of LiaX binds daptomycin and AMPs (such as human LL-37) and functions as an extracellular sentinel that activates the cell envelope stress response. The C-terminal domain of LiaX plays a role in inhibiting the LiaFSR system, and when this domain is absent, it leads to activation of anionic phospholipid redistribution. Strains that exhibit LiaX-mediated CM remodeling and AMP resistance show enhanced virulence in the Caenorhabditis elegans model, an effect that is abolished in animals lacking an innate immune pathway crucial for producing AMPs. In conclusion, we report a mechanism of antibiotic and AMP resistance that couples bacterial stress sensing to major changes in CM architecture, ultimately also affecting host-pathogen interactions.

TI  - A study of the responsiveness of crops to fertilizers by zones of stable intra-field heterogeneity based on big satellite data analysis
T2  - ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The maps of stable intra-field heterogeneity of soil cover were created based on big satellite (remote sensing) data using the technology of the spectral neighbourhood of the soil line. The maps were created for 29 fields with a total area of 2,000 hectares (ha). On the field XI-1, various amounts of nitrogen spring fertilizer supplement on winter wheat were applied. This differentiation was carried out on 110 rectangular plots with dimensions of 70 x 90 m. Four different amounts of fertilizers were applied to 110 fragments of the XI-1 field in the checkerboard pattern. It was established that the responsiveness of winter wheat to fertilizers varied by different zones of the map with stable intra-field heterogeneity. In low fertility zone, increasing fertilization from 50 kg ha(-1) to 350 kg ha(-1)ammonium nitrate (from 17.2 to 120.4 kg ha(-1)N) resulted in an increase in wheat yield by 26%, versus 50% in normal fertility zone and 74% in high fertility zone. The stable intra-field heterogeneity map based on big satellite data can be used to intensify the precision farming.

TI  - An integer-valued time series model for multivariate surveillance
T2  - STATISTICS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent days, different types of surveillance data are becoming available for public health purposes. In most cases, several variables are monitored and events of different types are reported. As the amount of surveillance data increases, statistical methods that can effectively address multivariate surveillance scenarios are demanded. Even though research activity in this field is increasing rapidly in recent years, only a few approaches have simultaneously addressed the integer-valued property of the data and its correlation (both time correlation and cross-correlation) structure. In this article, we suggest a multivariate integer-valued autoregressive model that allows for both serial and cross-correlations between the series and can easily accommodate overdispersion and covariate information. Moreover, its structure implies a natural decomposition into an endemic and an epidemic component, a common distinction in dynamic models for infectious disease counts. Detection of disease outbreaks is achieved through the comparison of surveillance data with one-step-ahead predictions obtained after fitting the suggested model to a set of clean historical data. The performance of the suggested model is illustrated on a trivariate series of syndromic surveillance data collected during Athens 2004 Olympic Games.

TI  - Mapping the properties of the vortex-induced vibrations of flexible cylinders in uniform oncoming flow
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flexible structures placed within an oncoming flow exhibit far more complex vortex-induced dynamics than flexibly mounted rigid cylinders, because they involve the distributed interaction between the structural and wake dynamics along the entire span. Hence, mapping the well-understood properties of rigid cylinder vibrations to those of strings and beams has been elusive. We show here with a combination of experiments, conducted at Reynolds number, Re from 250 to 2300, and computational fluid dynamics that such a mapping is possible for flexible structures in uniform flow undergoing combined cross-flow and in-line oscillations, but only when additional concepts are introduced to model the extended coupling of the flow and the structure. The in-line response consists of largely standing waves that define cells, each cell spanning the distance between adjacent nodes, over which stable vortical patterns form, whose features ('2S' versus 'P + S') depend strongly on the true reduced velocity, V-r = U/f(y)d, where U is the inflow velocity, f(y) is the cross-flow vibration frequency and d is the cylinder diameter, and the phase angle between in-line and cross-flow response; while the cross-flow response may contain travelling waves, breaking the symmetry of the problem. The axial distribution of the highly variable effective added masses in the cross-flow and in-line directions, and the local phase angle between in-line and cross-flow motion determine the single frequency of cross-flow response, while the in-line response vibrates at twice the cross-flow frequency. The cross-flow and in-line lift coefficients in phase with velocity depend strongly on the true reduced velocity but also on the local phase angle between in-line and cross-flow motions. Modal shapes can be defined for in-line and cross-flow, based on the resemblance of the response to conventional modes, which can be in the ratio of either '2n =n' or '(2n - 1)/n', where n is the order of the cross-flow response mode. We use an underwater optical tracking system to reconstruct the sectional fluid forces in a flexible structure and show that, once the cross-flow and in-line motion features are known, employing strip theory and the hydrodynamic coefficients obtained from forced rigid cylinder experiments allows us to predict the distributed forces accurately.

TI  - Development of optimal weight algorithm for efficient application of dual tree complex wavelet transform for resolution enhancement of satellite images
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wavelets have been intensively studied for resolution enhancement of images since the last decade. Subbands of decomposed wavelet images are interpolated and combined using equal weights to form resolution-enhanced images. Using different weights for subbands may provide different information content in the output image. Hence, the weights need to be optimized. Therefore, here a technique is proposed to obtain optimal weight for subbands in dual tree complex wavelet transform for resolution enhancement of satellite images. The proposed approach effectively selects the optimal weights of individual subbands automatically according to the variances of each subband, and achieves better image quality. The technique is applicable on different satellite data, like MODIS and PALSAR.

TI  - Advances in urban information extraction from high-resolution remote sensing imagery
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The study of urban area is one of the hottest research topics in the field of remote sensing. With the accumulation of high-resolution (HR) remote sensing data and emerging of new satellite sensors, HR observation of urban areas has become increasingly possible, which provides us with more elaborate urban information. However, the strong heterogeneity in the spectral and spatial domain of HR imagery brings great challenges to urban remote sensing. In recent years, numerous approaches were proposed to deal with HR image interpretation over complex urban scenes, including a series of features from low level to high level, as well as state-of-the-art methods depicting not only the urban extent, but also the intra-urban variations. In this paper, we aim to summarize the major advances in HR urban remote sensing from the aspects of feature representation and information extraction. Moreover, the future trends are discussed from the perspectives of methodology, urban structure and pattern characterization, big data challenge, and global mapping.

T2  - Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Meta-Analysis
AB  - Objective: To systematically evaluate the diagnostic value of optical imaging combined with indocyanine green (ICG)-guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in gastric cancer, and to identify potential factors that would influence diagnostic accuracy. Methods: Study was carried out by searching the electronic database of PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library with keywords as "gastric/stomach" and "cancer/carcinoma/tumor/tumour/adenocarcinoma/neoplasm" and "sentinel lymph node" and "near-infrared/NIR or fluorescent imaging" and "indocyanine green/ICG" . Literature inclusion criteria: (1) gastric cancer clinical stage was cT0-3; (2) clinical stage determined by at least 2 kinds of imaging modalities; (3) optical imaging (near-infrared or fluorescence imaging) combined with ICG-guided SLN biopsy; (4) prospective study to predict lymph node metastasis; (5) intraoperative or postoperative pathology for all lymph nodes removed; (6) patients number in the literature >10 cases. Exclusion criteria: (1) patients with a history of ICG allergy or chemoradiotherapy; (2) previous history of endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection; (3) patients with a variety of gastrointestinal tumor; (4) case reports, conference abstracts, clinical guidelines, editorials, reviews, meta-analysis and correspondence letters; (5) in vitro or animal experiments; (6) insufficient diagnostic efficacy data. The meta-analysis was performed in the Stata12.0 software using the "bivariate mixed-effects model" combined with the "midas" command to pool the data. Information such as true positive value, false positive value, false negative value, and true negative value of each included articles were extracted. The literature quality assessment map was drawn to describe the overall quality of the articles; the heterogeneity analysis was performed with the forest map, with P<0.01 considered as statistical significance; the funnel plot was used to describe publication bias, with P<0.1 considered as statistically significant. Area under curve (AUC) of summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) was used to describe the diagnostic accuracy and the AUC closer to 1 indicated higher diagnostic accuracy. If there was heterogeneity (I(2)>50%) among studies, regression analysis and subgroup analysis were performed. P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: A total of 15 studies (1020 patients) were included. The optical imaging contained near-infrared (NIR) and fluorescent imaging (FI). The diagnostic value of optical imaging combined with ICG-guided SLN biopsy in gastric cancer was as follows: the pooled sensitivity (Sen) was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.82 to 0.99), specificity (Spe) was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.92 to 1.00), positive likelihood ratio (PLR) was 30.39 (95% CI: 9.14 to 101.06), negative likelihood ratio (NLR) was 0.05 (95% CI:0.01 to 0.20), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 225.54 (95% CI: 88.81 to 572.77), AUC was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99 to 1.00), threshold value was sensitivity=0.95 (95% CI: 0.82 to 0.99) and specificity=1.00 (95% CI: 0.92 to 1.00). Deeks method revealed DOR funnel plot of SLN biopsy was not asymmetrical obviously with significant difference (P=0.01), which indicated remarkable publishing bias. Meta-subgroup analysis showed that compared to FI, NIR imaging had higher sensitivity (0.98 vs. 0.73); compared to 0 minutes, optical imaging performed 20 minutes after ICG injection had higher sensitivity (0.98 vs. 0.70); compared to mean detected number of SLN of 4, mean detected number≥4 had higher sensitivity (0.96 vs. 0.68); compared to HE stain, immunohistochemistry + HE had higher sensitivity (0.99 vs. 0.84); compared to subserous injection of ICG, submucosa injection of ICG had higher sensitivity (0.98 vs. 0.40); compared to injection of 5 g/L ICG, 0.5 g/L and 0.05 g/L had higher sensitivity (0.98 vs. 0.83); compared to cT2-3 tumor, early stage (cT1) tumor had higher sensitivity (0.96 vs. 0.72); compared to ≤ enrolled 26 cases in the study, > 26 cases had higher sensitivity (0.96 vs. 0.65); compared to papers before 2010, papers after 2010 had higher sensitivity (0.97 vs. 0.81); whose differences were all significant. Sensitivity differences between mean tumor diameter of ≤30 cm and >30 cm, open surgery and laparoscopic surgery, lymph node regional dissection and retrieved dissection were not significant (all P>0.05). Conclusions: Optical imaging combined with ICG-guided SLN biopsy is clinically feasible, and especially suitable for early gastric cancer. However, the ICG being used in current studies may be overdosed. Higher sensitivity may be achieved from NIR imaging when compared with FI method.

TI  - Oculomotor deficits in children adopted from Eastern Europe
T2  - ACTA PAEDIATRICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim We aim to assess oculomotor behaviour in children adopted from Eastern Europe, who are at high risk of maternal alcohol consumption. Methods This cross-sectional study included 29 adoptees and 29 age-matched controls. All of them underwent a complete ophthalmological examination. Oculomotor control, including fixation and saccadic performance, was assessed using a DIVE device, with eye tracking technology. Anthropometric and facial measurements were obtained from all the adopted children, to identify features of foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Fixational and saccadic outcomes were compared between groups, and the effect of adoption and FASD features quantified. Results Oculomotor performance was poorer in adopted children. They presented shorter (0.53 vs 1.43 milliseconds in the long task and 0.43 vs 0.82 in the short task) and more unstable fixations (with a bivariate contour ellipse area of 27.9 vs 11.6 degree(2) during the long task and 6.9 vs 1.3 degree(2) during the short task) and slower saccadic reactions (278 vs 197 milliseconds). Children with sentinel finding for FASD showed the worst oculomotor outcomes. Conclusion Children adopted from Eastern Europe present oculomotor deficits, affecting both fixation and saccadic skills. We highlight prenatal exposure to alcohol as the main cause for these deficits.

TI  - Design of LEO satellites augmented constellation for navigation
T2  - CHINESE SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A constellation design method of LEO ( Low Earth Orbit) satellites augmented-constellation for navigation is presented since global LEO satellites becoming a hot spot. Firstly, the relationship between the orbit altitude and the visible spherical crown is deduced, thus the constellation altitude can be computed with the space debris distribution, economy and collision risk. Then, the relationship between the elevation and the orbit inclination is derived, and meanwhile the constellation inclination is determined to get north and south poles coverage. Next, compared with Iridium, it is demonstrated that a single constellation can't achieve a uniform visible satellites distribution and DOP ( Dilution of Precision) on global scale. Finally, an LEO satellites constellation design method is proposed, which can achieve global coverage while make the DOP (Dilution of Precision) and the visible satellites distribute evenly around the world. The results show that the mixed constellation designed by the method can achieve a global coverage and even distribution of visible satellite numbers and DOP.

TI  - Analysis and Simulation of the Spatial Autocorrelation Pattern in the Ecosystem Service Value of the Oasis Cities in Dry Areas
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the land use data extracted from remote sensing interpretation in Urumqi between 1995 and 2015, a prediction for the land use changes for the year 2025 and an ESV (ecosystem service value) assessment have been performed using the CA-Markov model. A further analysis of the distribution characteristics of spatial patterns in the ESV and the land use is made by means of the spatial statistical methods, such as the grid analysis, the spatial autocorrelation and Getis-Ord hot spot analysis. The relationship between the spatial autocorrelation in the ESV and that in the land use as well as the reason for the spatial distribution changes of the cold spots and the hot spots in the interannual variations are discussed. The change process of the high and low ESV values with respect to the center of gravity in the space is interpreted. The results show that: (1) Within the 30 years, certain differences had been presented among the ESV changes in different land use types in different periods, representing a fluctuation trend. However, a decreasing trend in the overall ESV was presented and the main reason for this is the decrease of the ESV provided by the cultivated lands, forests and grass-lands. (2) Significant differences exist in the overall spatial distribution pattern of the ESV and, for many years, the areas with a high ESV value have been mainly distributed in the zones with a large woodland area in Urumqi County, while the areas with a low ESV value have been mainly concentrated in the zones that surround the four central districts of Urumqi (Tianshan District, Shaybak District, Shuimogou District and Toutunhe District). (3) The ESV in the study area has significant spatial positive autocorrelation and spatial clustering characteristics, and the high-high and low-low clustered distribution is highly coincident with the high-low ESV value areas. (4) The number of hot and cold spots in the ESV has been increasing year by year. The increase in the quantity of the hot spots is closely related to the ecological protection and restoration measures which Urumqi has vigorously implemented in the recent years. On the other hand, the increase in the quantity of the cold spots is of great concern, and this is closely related to the human activities such as the disorderly spread and expansion of urban built-up areas and land development.

TI  - Rationale for targeted self-management strategies for breathlessness in heart failure
T2  - HEART FAILURE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - To provide a conceptual rationale for targeted self-management strategies for breathlessness in chronic heart failure. Breathlessness is a defining symptom of chronic heart failure and is the primary cause for hospital readmissions and emergency room visits, resulting in extensive health care utilization. Chronic breathlessness, punctuated by acute physiological decompensation, is a sentinel symptom of the heart failure syndrome and often intensifies towards the end of life. Drawing upon evidence-based guidelines, physiological mechanisms and existing conceptual models for the management of breathlessness is proposed. Key elements of this model include adherence to evidence-based approaches (pharmacological and non-pharmacological management to optimize heart failure treatment), self-monitoring of symptoms, identification of modifiable factors (such as fluid overload), and targeted strategies for breathlessness including distraction and gas flow. Self-management is an essential component in heart failure management which could positively influences health outcomes and quality of life. Refining programs to focus on breathlessness may have the potential to reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life.

TI  - Emergence of West Nile virus lineage 2 in Europe: Characteristics of the first seven cases of West Nile neuroinvasive disease in horses in Austria
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - We report details of the first seven equine cases of confirmed West Nile neuroinvasive disease in Austria. The cases presented during summer and autumn of 2016 (n = 2), 2017 (n = 3) and 2018 (n = 2). All horses showed gait abnormalities and 6 of 7 horses exhibited fasciculations and/or tremors, and we provide video recordings of these. Three horses also showed cranial nerve involvement. Following rapid improvement, three horses were discharged. Four horses were euthanized due to the severity of clinical signs and subjected to neuropathological examination. West Nile virus (WNV) lineage 2 nucleic acid was detected in 5 of 7 horses, and WNV-specific neutralizing antibodies in all 7 horses. In addition, serologic evidence of WNV infection was found in two out of fourteen in-contact horses. Horses may be considered a sentinel species for human WNV infections, integrating human and veterinary medicine and thus contributing to the one health concept.

TI  - Spatio-temporal regression kriging model of mean daily temperature for Croatia
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High resolution gridded mean daily temperature datasets are valuable for research and applications in agronomy, meteorology, hydrology, ecology, and many other disciplines depending on weather or climate. The gridded datasets and the models used for their estimation are being constantly improved as there is always a need for more accurate datasets as well as for datasets with a higher spatial and temporal resolution. We developed a spatio-temporal regression kriging model for Croatia at 1 km spatial resolution by adapting the spatio-temporal regression kriging model developed for global land areas. A geometrical temperature trend, digital elevation model, and topographic wetness index were used as covariates together with measurements from the Croatian national meteorological network for the year 2008. This model performed better than the global model and previously developed models for Croatia, based on MODIS land surface temperature images. The R-2 was 97.8% and RMSE was 1.2 degrees C for leave-one-out and 5-fold cross-validation. The proposed national model still has a high level of uncertainty at higher altitudes leaving it suitable for agricultural areas that are dominant in lower and medium altitudes.

TI  - Correlation of Remotely Sensed Surface Reflectance With Forcing Variables in Six Different Estuaries
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the links between estuarine dynamics and longitudinal distributions of remotely sensed reflectance in estuaries. Reflectance at 655 nm from Landsat-8 correlates with in situ measurements of surface turbidity. Images collected from 2013 to 2018 are used to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of reflectance distribution in six selected estuaries with different dynamics. The results show that the maximum magnitude (Cmax) and location (Xmax) of the reflectance are functions of two major forcing variables, the freshwater discharge and tidal stage. Salt wedge estuaries (i.e., the Fraser River, Connecticut River, and Columbia River estuary) are affected strongly by river discharge and are relatively less affected by tidal forcing. In salt wedge estuaries, the Cmax values along the river channel are correlated with river discharge, while the Xmax values generally are not. In partially mixed to strain-induced periodic stratification (SIPS) estuaries (i.e., Delaware River) and SIPS-to-well-mixed estuaries (i.e., Gironde estuary), the Xmax values are correlated with river discharge, but the Cmax values are not. SIPS-to-well-mixed estuaries (i.e., Gironde estuary) and highly time-dependent salt wedge to well-mixed estuaries (i.e., Merrimack River estuary) are affected by tidal forcing. In these estuaries, the Cmax values are correlated with tidal stage. The Cmax values tend to be lower around high tide than low tide. Overall, the results demonstrate that remote sensing observations of ocean color can be utilized to infer subsurface estuarine processes. Satellite ocean color is a potential tool to monitor river discharge and to classify estuaries.

TI  - Locating and monitoring of landslides based on small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the effects of rugged terrain and vegetation cover, improving the locating and monitoring accuracy of time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR) in detecting the development of landslides in mountainous and valley areas has become a problem that needs to be solved. Our study uses the ground local incident angle (GLIA) to locate noneffective monitoring areas that are affected by steep terrain as well as to improve the locating accuracy of TS-InSAR technology in the effective coverage area. At the same time, the improved small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) method is used to improve the density of interferometer targets as well as to solve the problem of insufficient permanent scatterers due to the effects of vegetation coverage. A geometric model of GLIA was established. Ascending and descending synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) were used for calculating the value of GLIA. The relationships of the GLIA and the interference characteristics of InSAR data were analyzed, and the locations of noneffective areas were determined. Finally, 19 ascending pass SAR data scenes acquired by the ALOS-1 satellite were processed through using the improved SBAS-InSAR method, and the detailed time series moving displacement information from 2007 to 2011 was mapped in Wudongde hydropower reservoir. Furthermore, the potentially moving landslide areas and landslide hazard areas were located in the effective interference areas. The active Jinpingzi landslide was investigated in detail, and the single-point monitoring results of SBAS-InSAR were compared with the electronic total station (ETS) measurement results. The conclusion shows that the monitoring results of SBAS-InSAR were in agreement with the ground field survey and the single-point ETS monitoring, and the applicability of the model and algorithm proposed was proved. Our study provides a reference for the early identification and high-precision monitoring of landslides in mountainous and valley areas. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Comparison between single and multi-locus approaches for specimen identification in <i>Mytilus</i> mussels
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mytilus mussels have been the object of much research given their sentinel role in coastal ecosystems and significant value as an aquaculture resource appreciated for both, its flavour and nutritional content. Some of the most-studied Mytilus species are M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis, M. chilensis and M. trossulus. As species identification based on morphological characteristics of Mytilus specimens is difficult, molecular markers are often used. Single-locus markers can give conflicting results when used independently; not all markers differentiate among all species, and the markers target genomic regions with different evolutionary histories. We evaluated the concordance between the PCR-RFLP markers most commonly-used for species identification in mussels within the Mytilus genus (Me15-16, ITS, mac-1, 16S rRNA and COI) when used alone (mono-locus approach) or together (multi-locus approach). In this study, multi-locus strategy outperformed the mono-locus methods, clearly identifying all four species and also showed similar specimen identification performance than a 49 SNPs panel. We hope that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of DNA marker-based analysis of Mytilus taxa. These results support the use of a multi-locus approach when studying this important marine resource, including research on food quality and safety, sustainable production and conservation.

TI  - Land-use and land-cover dynamics and their drivers in the central highlands of Ethiopia with special reference to the Lake Wanchi watershed
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes have been recognized universally as fundamental constituents of global biodiversity and ecosystem services change driver. The objectives of this study were analyzing the spatial and temporal LULC dynamics over the past 44 years and identifying the major drivers of these changes. It was conducted in the central highlands of Ethiopia at the social-ecological Lake Wanchi watershed. The study triangulated data from Landsat images of four different time series, ground verifications, focus group discussions, key informants interview, and quantitative analytical approach. The Landsat imageries were processed and analyzed using ArcGIS 10.3 software. Supervised classification was executed using the maximum likelihood technique. The non-quantifiable data were analyzed using qualitative descriptions and the quantitative analytical approach was used to rank the degree of LULC change drivers. About 62% of the land area in the study watershed experienced LULC conversions. Wetlands, forest-cover, shrub-cover, and water body converted (declined) annually at a rate of 3.3%, 1.4%, 1.3% and 0.6%, respectively. Croplands, bare lands, agroforestry, and settlements, expanded annually at the rate of 10.2%, 5.7%, 2.6% and 2.1%, respectively. Agricultural activities, wood extraction, settlement expansion, and infrastructure constructions were proximate LULC change drivers, while, demographic changes, community conflict, and land tenure policy were the underlying change drivers. To mitigate the rapid LULC changes and safeguard the social-ecological benefits at the local watershed and distant downstream systems of Lake Wanchi, rehabilitation of the watershed specifically, the natural vegetation covers and environmentally sensitive areas, through the application of integrated watershed management strategies is critically important.

TI  - Dimensionally and environmentally ultra-stable polymer composites reinforced with carbon fibres
T2  - NATURE MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple layers of diamond-like carbon films are shown to act as moisture barriers when conformally deposited on carbon fibre reinforced polymers used in space applications.The quest to develop materials that enable the manufacture of dimensionally ultra-stable structures for critical-dimension components in spacecraft has led to much research over many decades and the evolution of carbon fibre reinforced polymer materials. This has resulted in structural designs that feature a near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion. However, the dimensional instabilities that result from moisture ingression and release remain the fundamental vulnerability of the matrix, which restricts many applications. Here, we address this challenge by developing a space-qualifiable physical surface barrier that blends within the mechanical properties of the composite, thus becoming part of the composite itself. The resulting enhanced composite features mechanical integrity and a strength that is superior to the underlying composite, while remaining impervious to moisture and outgassing. We demonstrate production capability for a model-sized component for the Sentinel-5 mission and demonstrate such capability for future European Space Agency (ESA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) programmes such as Copernicus Extension, Earth Explorer and Science Cosmic Visions.

AB  - Purpose To study the utility of positron emission tomography with computerized tomography (PET/CT) in patients with a stage I-III melanoma. Patients and methods PET/CT findings from all patients with a stage I-III melanoma attended at our hospital from September 2011 to November 2015 were reviewed. Results Data from 83 patients with a stage I-III melanoma, 39 patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and 35 patients with locoregional recurrences were analyzed. Sensitivity of PET/CT in clinical stage I-III patients was 5%, with a 14% of false positives. In patients with a positive SLNB, PET/CT previous to complete lymph node dissection had a 23% of false negatives. In patients with clinical locoregional recurrences, PET/CT findings revealed asymptomatic visceral distant metastasis in 25.7%. Conclusions PET/CT has a significant rate of false positive and negative results in patients with a stage I-III melanoma. Utility in patients with nodal locoregional recurrences seems higher than in patients with skin metastases.

TI  - Prediction Mapping Through Maxent Modeling Paves the Way for the Conservation of <i>Rhododendron arboreum</i> in Uttarakhand Himalayas
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the middle Himalayas, Rhododendron arboreum is shrinking due to low seed viability, poor regeneration, habitat degradation and fragmentation, habitat distortion, and species invasion. Further, developmental activities, the encroachment of forestland for agriculture, urbanization, and industrial expansion put additional burdens on its natural distribution. The present work focused on the prediction of R. arboreum distribution in Uttarakhand Himalayas using the Maxent model. In total, 1077 geospatial data were recorded, 300 well-distributed geo-coordinates were used to predict and estimate the distribution, while the rest were used to validate the model. The Maxent model generated AUC curve with an accurate and significant value of 0.886 +/- 0.023. Bioclimatic variables such as temperature seasonality (Bio 4), annual temperature range (Bio 7), altitude (Alt), annual precipitation (Bio 12), and precipitation seasonality (Bio 15) contributed significantly to predict the distribution, as revealed by the Jackknife test. Within the total geographical area of 617.48 km(2) under R. arboreum distribution as shown over Landsat 8 generated map, 167.48 km(2) was found to be very dense, 320.75 km(2) was moderately dense, and 129.25 km(2) was open. The estimated distributed area was 2733.08 km(2). The satellite-based mapping and model-based prediction of R. arboreum are of paramount importance to the foresters and researchers for species conservation, management, and utilization in a sustainable manner.

TI  - Comparing environmental impacts of Chinese Torreya plantations and regular forests using remote sensing
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to evaluate the environmental impact of land-use change before deciding on its development because of possible problems in sustainability. The Chinese Torreya tree (Torreya grandis cv Merrillii) is a traditional nut tree cultivated in China for more than a thousand years. The income from the cultivation of this species has improved the local economy in southeastern China. To increase nuts production, large industrial plantations of Torreya are under construction, which require clear-cutting local subtropical evergreen forests. In this study, several biophysical indices from remote sensing data at a regular evergreen broadleaved forest and a nearby Torreya plantation were compared. The results indicated that the Torreya plantation had a significantly lower albedo (12.43 +/- 0.15%) and higher soil water storage within surface 2-m layer (69.0 +/- 2.24 kg/m(2)/month) than the regular forest (12.64 +/- 0.14% and 57.87 +/- 1.81 kg/m(2)/month). The annual average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was significantly higher at the regular forest landscape than at the Torreya forest landscape. Except for NDVI, the resilience of these ecological processes was high in the regular evergreen broadleaved forest than in the Torreya plantation. The development of Torreya plantations at a large scale could alter local energy and hydrological processes. Environmental impacts and multiple ecological services should be considered for the sustainable development of Torreya plantations in this region. This study may provide an approach to evaluating potential environmental impacts for landscape change at large scales. Further research by ground observation and studies on ecological processes at different scales should be conducted. Our results may be helpful for relevant agencies to create strategies to better develop local economies and conserve the natural landscape.

TI  - Water spirits within the fishers' worldview: implications for fishing management in Northeast Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Historically, aquatic environments are linked to the worldview of many local people, where there is an interconnection between the natural world, the supernatural, and the social organization. In this study, we provided a discussion on how the supernatural beings that inhabit the freshwater systems interact with artisanal fishers and fishing resources in the riverine community of Parnaiba River middle course, in Mid North of Northeast Brazil. We also provided the implications of these interactions on the fisher's behaviors and how the acculturation process (e.g., introduction of new religions) can affect the fishers' worldview. Method The selection of participants was done through intentional sampling. The content qualitative analysis was carried out to interpret the data from semi-structured interviews with 29 artisanal fishers. Results The mythical representations that inhabit the aquatic environments in the surveyed area were as follows: Mae d' agua, Cabeca de cuia, Muleque d'agua, Visage, Piratinga, Sucuiuiu, and Luz e Arco-iris. These beings have distinctions regarding the form and attributions and can be associated with seasonality (temporal markers) and specific habitats (spatial markers). The respect and fear feeling of the mythical beings were striking among the fishers interviewed. For instance, we have record offering practices in order to obtain protection and success during the fisheries. These practices suggest that there may be local conservationist habits in fisheries management. However, the advancement of urbanization and the introduction of new religions that deny the existence of mythical entities are factors that can generate the acculturation process among the fishers. Conclusions It is therefore necessary to carry out more studies in the surveyed area in order to evaluate the existence of possible patterns in the relationship between fisher and mythical beings. This information could confirm the role of mythical beings as environmental regulators. Consequently, it could be considered in the conservationist policies of fishery resources, reinforcing the importance of local knowledge and cultural factors for fishing management approaches.

Understanding regional influenza-associated outpatient burden is crucial for formulating control strategies against influenza viruses. Methods We extracted the national sentinel surveillance data on outpatient visits due to influenza-like-illness (ILI) and virological confirmation of sentinel specimens from 30 provinces of China from 2006 to 2015. Generalized additive regression models were fitted to estimate influenza-associated excess ILI outpatient burden for each individual province, accounting for seasonal baselines and meteorological factors. Results Influenza was associated with an average of 2.5 excess ILI consultations per 1000 person-years (py) in 30 provinces of China each year from 2006 to 2015. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 led to a higher number of influenza-associated ILI consultations in 2009 across all provinces compared with other years. The excess ILI burden was 4.5 per 1000 py among children aged below 15 years old, substantially higher than that in adults. Conclusions Human influenza viruses caused considerable impact on population morbidity, with a consequent healthcare and economic burden. This study provided the evidence for planning of vaccination programs in China and a framework to estimate burden of influenza-associated outpatient consultations.

TI  - The August 2018 Kaktovik Earthquakes: Active Tectonics in Northeastern Alaska Revealed With InSAR and Seismology
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The largest earthquakes recorded in northern Alaska (Mw 6.4 and Mw 6.0) occurred similar to 6 hr apart on 12 August 2018, in the northeastern Brooks Range. The earthquakes were captured by Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) satellites and Earthscope Transportable Array seismic data, giving insight into the little-known active tectonic processes of Arctic Alaska, obscured until recently by sparse data availability. In this study, InSAR modeling, teleseismic back projections, calibrated hypocentral relocations, and regional moment tensor solutions resolve two previously unknown, SSW dipping right-lateral fault segments. These are the first active faults identified as conjugate to the NE trending sinistral Canning displacement zone directly to the west, which is therefore a more complex zone of diffuse faulting than previously thought. The northeastern Brooks Range has been characterized as an area of low to moderate seismic hazard, but these earthquakes illustrate the potential for larger, possibly destructive events in a region earmarked for rapid resource development.

TI  - Diagnostic value of laboratory monitoring to predict severe hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn in non-D and non-K-alloimmunized pregnancies
T2  - TRANSFUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Pregnant women are routinely screened for red blood cell (RBC) antibodies early in pregnancy. If RBC-alloantibodies are detected, repeated laboratory testing is advised to timely identify pregnancies at high risk for severe hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). We assessed for RBC alloantibodies, other than anti-D or anti-K, cut-offs for the titer and the antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) test to select high-risk cases. To advise on test repeat intervals, and to avoid unnecessary testing, we evaluated the chance for exceeding the cut-offs for Rh antibodies other than anti-D, Jk, Fy, and S/s antibodies. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Diagnostic value of antibody titer and ADCC test was determined with data from a prospective index-cohort study, conducted in 2002-2004. Laboratory test outcomes were from a recent observational cohort (2015-2016). RESULTS A titer cut-off of >= 16 showed a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI:73-100%) and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 17% (95% CI:14%-20%). The percentage of pregnancies reaching a titer above the cut-off of >= 16 varied from 0% for anti-Jk(a)/Jk(b) (n = 38) to 36% for anti-c (n = 97). The ADCC test showed no cut-off with a 100% sensitivity. However, in cases with a titer >= 16 and an ADCC test >= 30% a PPV of 38% was obtained to detect severe HDFN. CONCLUSION A titer cut-off of >= 16 is adequate to detect all cases at risk for severe HDFN; the ADCC test may add a more accurate risk estimation. Repeated testing is recommended in pregnancies with anti-c. In pregnancies with other Rh antibodies a repeated test in the third trimester is recommended.

AB  - Objective: With the development of laparoscopic surgery technique, the concept of minimally invasive surgery has gradually gained popularity. Laparoscopic minimally invasive technique applied in the treatment of gastric cancer has been recognized by surgeons. In recent years, the indocyanine green labeled near-infrared fluorescence laparoscopic technique has been gradually applied to the surgical treatment of gastric cancer. This technique overcomes the drawbacks of tactile lack of laparoscopic surgery and makes the laparoscopic surgery of gastric cancer more precise and minimally invasive. This article introduces the injection method of indocyanine green and discusses the application of fluorescent laparoscopy in gastric cancer surgery, including intraoperative tumor localization of early gastric cancer, sentinel lymph node biopsy, lymph node navigation of advanced gastric cancer, digestive tract reconstruction and gastrointestinal blood perfusion assessment during the procedure.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - With the continuous development of laparoscopic techniques and the concept of individualized treatment, laparoscopic surgery is also moving from "minimally invasive" to "minimally invasive plus precision" . Lymph node metastasis is one of the most important risk factors affecting the prognosis of gastric cancer (GC). Reasonable lymph node dissection has always been an important exploration direction in the field of GC surgery. In recent years, domestic and foreign studies have found that the new tracer, indocyanine green (ICG), can detect the lymphatic vasculature non-invasively, and more accurately display the perigastric lymph nodes, providing a new perspective in laparoscopic lymph node dissection for GC. Alternatively, since the application of ICG in laparoscopic gastrointestinal tumor surgery, especially in gastric cancer surgery is still in the early stage of exploration and experience accumulation, more high-level medical evidences are needed to evaluate its clinical value.
AB  - 随着腹腔镜技术的不断发展和个体化治疗理念的深入人心，腹腔镜胃癌手术也正从微创迈向微创plus精准。淋巴结转移是影响胃癌患者预后的重要危险因素，合理的淋巴结廓清范围长期以来都是胃癌外科领域的重要探索方向。近年来，国内外研究结果显示，新型示踪剂吲哚菁绿(ICG)可以无创探测淋巴脉管系统，进而更加精准地显示胃周淋巴结，为腹腔镜胃癌淋巴结清扫提供了全新的视角。另一方面，由于ICG荧光示踪应用于腹腔镜胃肠道肿瘤手术，尤其是胃癌手术仍处在前期探索和经验累积阶段，仍需更多高级别循证医学的证据评估其临床价值。.

TI  - Evaluation of low-cost optical particle counters for monitoring individual indoor aerosol sources
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-cost optical particle counters (OPC) have gained increasing attention in recent years in exposure studies. Previous studies reported that the OPCs' performance varies considerably with type of particles being measured; however, little information on their performance in monitoring common indoor aerosols is available. Given the significance of exposure to indoor aerosols and their associated adverse health effects, this experimental study investigates the performance of low-cost OPCs in monitoring individual aerosols that are commonly found indoors in a controlled chamber environment. Performances of four low-cost OPCs were examined under exposure to varying concentrations of biological (dust mite, pollen, cat, and dog fur) and non-biological (monodisperse silica and melamine resin) aerosols. Each particle sample was dispersed into the chamber using a computer-controlled syringe injection system, while size-resolved particle number concentrations were simultaneously measured by four low-cost OPCs (OPC N2, IC Sentinel, Speck, and Dylos) as well as a lab-grade reference sensor (AeroTrak). The study results showed measurable effects of particle size, particle type, and concentration on the low-cost OPC responses. Particle concentration had the most dominant effect on the linearity of low-cost sensors. Results also revealed that the sensor responses to four biological particles follow a similar pattern and converge to a linear line as the number concentration increases above 5 cm(-3). As for non-biological particles, the OPC responses were more varied depending on the particle type and size, especially in the concentration range <10 cm(-3). Calibration equations developed in this study provide baseline information for correcting low-cost OPC readings when utilized to measure concentrations of individual indoor aerosol sources.

TI  - A geographically weighted random forest approach for evaluate forest change drivers in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tropical Andes region includes biodiversity hotspots of high conservation priority whose management strategies depend on the analysis of forest dynamics drivers (FDDs). These depend on complex social and ecological interactions that manifest on different space-time scales and are commonly evaluated through regression analysis of multivariate datasets. However, processing such datasets is challenging, especially when time series are used and inconsistencies in data collection complicate their integration. Moreover, regression analysis in FDD characterization has been criticized for failing to capture spatial variability; therefore, alternatives such as geographically weighted regression (GWR) have been proposed, but their sensitivity to multicollinearity has not yet been solved. In this scenario, we present an innovative methodology that combines techniques to: 1) derive remote sensing time series products; 2) improve census processing with dasymetric mapping; 3) combine GWR and random forest (RF) to derive local variables importance; and 4) report results based in a clustering and hypothesis testing. We applied this methodology in the northwestern Ecuadorian Amazon, a highly heterogeneous region characterized by different active fronts of deforestation and reforestation, within the time period 2000-2010. Our objective was to identify linkages between these processes and validate the potential of the proposed methodology. Our findings indicate that land-use intensity proxies can be extracted from remote sensing time series, while intercensal analysis can be facilitated by calculating population density maps. Moreover, our implementation of GWR with RF achieved accurate predictions above the 74% using the out-of-bag samples, demonstrating that derived RF features can be used to construct hypothesis and discuss forest change drivers with more detailed information. In the other hand, our analysis revealed contrasting effects between deforestation and reforestation for variables related to suitability to agriculture and accessibility to its facilities, which is also reflected according patch size, land cover and population dynamics patterns. This approach demonstrates the benefits of integrating remote sensing-derived products and socioeconomic data to understand coupled socioecological systems more from a local than a global scale.

TI  - The critical detection distance for passively tracking tagged fish using a fixed radio telemetry station in a small stream
T2  - ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundFixed radio telemetry stations are used to study the movement ecology of fishes in streams and rivers. A common assumption of such studies is that detection efficiency remains constant through space and time. The objective of this study was to understand how site characteristics and tag distance can influence the detection efficiency of a fixed receiver when used for fisheries research in a small stream. Field tests included a fixed receiver station on Forty Mile Creek, in Banff National Park, AB, Canada that recorded signals from radio tags over specified distances (i.e., 0 m, 27 m, 53 m, 80 m) within the expected detection range from July to October, 2016. Model selection was used to test which parameters may influence detection efficiency.ResultsThe fixed receiver was able to record an average of 89% of transmissions over the study period. Detection efficiency was greater or equal to 0.97 at tag distances of <= 53 m. Detection efficiency significantly declined by 36% to a rate of 0.62 for tags placed 80 m from the fixed receiver. Water temperature and water depth also reduced detection efficiency, but only at the critical threshold of 80 m from the tag. Interestingly, turbidity had no influence on detection efficiency in this study.ConclusionsThis study provided insights into the reliability of fixed receiver stations as a passive tracking technique in small streams. The abrupt change in detection efficiency observed in this study presumably occurs in other systems. Identifying critical detection distance thresholds would appear to be a useful strategy for avoiding false-negative results. It is recommended that researchers who conduct radio tracking studies with fixed arrays should consider the deployment of sentinel tags over the study to understand the system performance.

AB  - Indocyanine green (ICG) has been used as a novel tracer for mapping lymph nodes in navigation surgeries for many malignant tumors. Recently, ICG is mainly applied in sentinel lymph node biopsy for early gastric cancer, while its application in advanced gastric cancer is less reported. It was reported that application of ICG in locating perigastric lymph nodes could elevate the efficiency of lymphadenectomy for advanced gastric cancer. Besides, recognizing small lymph nodes and dissecting certain lymph node stations are its unique advantages. However, some problems remain unsolved, as few relevant research has been done. Based on conceptions of minimal invasive and precision medicine, ICG may play an important role in improving the accuracy of laparoscopic surgery for advanced gastric cancer in the future.

TI  - Interannual variation in the start of vegetation growing season and its response to climate change in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau derived from MODIS data during 2001 to 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, remote sensing of phenology has become a useful tool to reveal the response and feedback of vegetation dynamics to global climate change due to its multitemporal phase, wide-coverage, continuous space coverage, and long-time series. Based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data product MOD09A1, enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was calculated, and the time series EVI of the growing season in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) from 2001 to 2016 was reconstructed in light of the double logistic function filter. A dynamic threshold method was used to extract the starting date of the growing season (SOG) of vegetation. The characteristics of temporal-spatial variation of SOG of vegetation in QTP were analyzed, and the irregularity of the vegetation SOG in response to climate change was explored. The results show that: (1) the vegetation SOG in QTP varied between day of year (DOY) 110 and DOY 170 between 2001 and 2016. Affected by the spatial difference of hydrothermal conditions, the vegetation SOG is gradually delayed from the southeast to the northwest in the plateau, the latest of which in the southwest of Tibet. The SOG of vegetation in the east of QTP is in advance while it is delayed in the west. (2) the SOG of vegetation has the characteristics of vertical differentiation as well, especially in the range of 3600 to 5000 m, and the delaying rate of the SOG with increasing elevation is 10.7 day/km. (3) The time lag analysis between climatic factors and the vegetation SOG in QTP indicates that the SOG has a time lag of 0 to 15 days behind the air temperature and 15 to 30 days behind precipitation. The SOG of vegetation in southern Tibet and southern Qinghai is more sensitive to air temperature changes than precipitation, whereas the vegetation SOG in southwestern Tibet and southwestern Qinghai is more sensitive to precipitation changes than air temperature changes.

TI  - Physics-Constrained Machine Learning of Evapotranspiration
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET) is important to understanding the global water cycle and to study land-atmosphere interactions. We developed a physics constrained machine learning (ML) model (hybrid model) to estimate latent heat flux (LE), which conserves the surface energy budget. By comparing model predictions with observations at 82 eddy covariance tower sites, our hybrid model shows similar performance to the pure ML model in terms of mean metrics (e.g., mean absolute percent errors) but, importantly, the hybrid model conserves the surface energy balance, while the pure ML model does not. A second key result is that the hybrid model extrapolates much better than the pure ML model, emphasizing the benefits of combining physics with ML for increased generalizations. The hybrid model allows inferring the structural dependence of ET and surface resistance (r(s)), and we find that vegetation height and soil moisture are the main regulators of ET and r(s).

M3  - Biographical-Item
AB  - This issue of the "Journal of Frontier Studies" we dedicate to the brilliant Australian scientist Deborah Bird Rose, who unexpectedly passed away in December last year. Born in the United States, she nevertheless connected her life with Australia. Having begun to study the cultures of the indigenous people of this continent, she did a lot for the aborigines, helping them to defend their rights to land. Acquaintance with Aboriginal culture has had a huge impact on her worldview. She was introduced to completely different principles of perception of the world around her, in which a person is not declared a "King of Nature", but is perceived as an integral element of the universe, closely related to other Beings on the Earth. This vision has led her to a new ecological paradigm that closely blended Western philosophy with the traditional worldview of the indigenous people of the continent. It is this that has determined its desire to protect not only the rights of the aborigines, but also a variety of local fauna, whose existence was threatened by the modern system of exploitation of the resources of the continent.But there is nothing surprising in this "turnaround" of her scientific career, as the environmental shift in frontier studies has become the most popular one in the modern world. In this Preface, the Editor shows how Western Humanities has long been looking for new directions in the study of man in inseparable connection with the environment. The Preface also provides a brief analysis of the most significant representatives of such a relative new direction of historical science as "environmental history".

TI  - Links Between the Coral <i>δ</i><SUP>13</SUP>C Record of Primary Productivity Variations in the Northern South China Sea and the East Asian Winter Monsoon
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The decadal variability of ocean primary productivity (PP) has mainly been studied using relatively short term satellite data, limiting its in-depth analysis. Here, by removing the influence of the C-13 Suess effect, we extract the PP signal on decadal timescales using a record of coral delta C-13 values from the northern South China Sea (NSCS), where the physical-biogeochemical conditions are influenced largely by the winter monsoon. Our results show that the PP in the NSCS increased from 1851 to the 1920s and decreased from the 1920s to 2007, and large superimposed decadal-scale changes were observed. The in-phase relationship observed between the PP reconstruction and winter monsoon records suggests that the changes in the PP in the NSCS are linked to decadal-scale changes in the winter monsoon. Considering that the winter monsoon intensity may weaken in the future under global warming, the PP in the NSCS might decrease in the coming decades.

TI  - Pathogenic fungi-induced susceptibility is mitigated by mutual <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> in the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> model
T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Since animals frequently encounter a variety of harmful fungi in nature, their ability to develop sophisticated anti-fungal strategies allows them to flourish across the globe. Extensive studies have highlighted the significant involvement of indigenous microbial communities in human health. However, the daunting diversity of mammalian microbiota and host genetic complexity are major obstacles to our understanding of these intricate links between microbiota components, host immune genotype, and disease phenotype. In this study, we sought to develop a bacterium-fungus-Drosophila model to systematically evaluate the anti-fungal effects of commensal bacteria. Results We isolated the pathogenic fungal strain, Diaporthe FY, which was detrimental to the survival and development of Drosophila upon infection. Using Drosophila as a model system, Drosophila-associated Lactobacillus plantarum functioned as a probiotic, and protected the flies from mortality induced by Diaporthe FY. Our results show that L. plantarum hindered the growth of Diaporthe FY in vitro, and decreased the mortality rate of Diaporthe FY-infected flies in vivo, consequently mitigating the toxicity of Diaporthe FY to the hosts. Additionally, the presence of L. plantarum overrode the avoidance of oviposition on Diaporthe FY-associated substrates. Conclusions Diaporthe FY was identified as a potential Drosophila pathogen. Commensal L. plantarum mitigated the susceptibility of Drosophila to pathogenic fungi, providing insight into the natural interplay between commensal and pathogenic microbial communities that contribute to animal health and pathogenesis.

TI  - The effects of volume of interest delineation on MRI-based radiomics analysis: evaluation with two disease groups
T2  - CANCER IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Manual delineation of volume of interest (VOI) is widely used in current radiomics analysis, suffering from high variability. The tolerance of delineation differences and possible influence on each step of radiomics analysis are not clear, requiring quantitative assessment. The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of delineation of VOIs on radiomics analysis for the preoperative prediction of metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in breast cancer. Methods This study retrospectively enrolled two datasets (NPC group: 238 cases; SLN group: 146 cases). Three operations, namely, erosion, smoothing, and dilation, were implemented on the VOIs accurately delineated by radiologists to generate diverse VOI variations. Then, we extracted 2068 radiomics features and evaluated the effects of VOI differences on feature values by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Feature selection was conducted by Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy combined with 0.632+ bootstrap algorithms. The prediction performance of radiomics models with random forest classifier were tested on an independent validation cohort by the area under the receive operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results The larger the VOIs changed, the fewer features with high ICCs. Under any variation, SLN group showed fewer features with ICC >= 0.9 compared with NPC group. Not more than 15% top-predictive features identical to the accurate VOIs were observed across feature selection. The differences of AUCs of models derived from VOIs across smoothing or dilation with 3 pixels were not statistically significant compared with the accurate VOIs (p > 0.05) except for T2-weighted fat suppression images (smoothing: 0.845 vs. 0.725, p = 0.001; dilation: 0.800 vs. 0.725, p = 0.042). Dilation with 5 and 7 pixels contributed to remarkable AUCs in SLN group but the opposite in NPC group. The radiomics models did not perform well when tested by data from other delineations. Conclusions Differences in delineation of VOIs affected radiomics analysis, related to specific disease and MRI sequences. Differences from smooth delineation or expansion with 3 pixels width around the tumors or lesions were acceptable. The delineation for radiomics analysis should follow a predefined and unified standard.

TI  - A method for urban population density prediction at 30m resolution
T2  - CARTOGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a new method for urban population density prediction at 30 m resolution. Using data for Bangalore, the paper demonstrates that population within each 30 m residential built-up cell can be modeled as a function of cell-level data on street density and building heights and ward-level data on car ownership. Building-height data were generated from Cartosat-1 stereo imagery using an open-source satellite stereo image processing software. Using this building-height data in conjunction with the other datasets, the paper demonstrates that a 30 m resolution population density surface can be generated such that, when summed to the ward level, the median absolute percentage error between predicted population and known census population at the ward level is 8.29%. The paper also shows that the relationship between population density, street density, building height, and ward level car ownership is spatially non-stationary. A fine-grained understanding of urban population densities, as enabled by the proposed method, can be beneficial to research, policy, and practice related to cities.

TI  - Spatial variations and controls of carbon use efficiency in China's terrestrial ecosystems
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon use efficiency (CUE), one of the most important eco-physiological parameters, represents the capacity of plants to transform carbon into new biomass. Understanding the variations and controls of CUE is crucial for regional carbon assessment. Here, we used 15-years of continuous remote sensing data to examine the variations of CUE across broad geographic and climatic gradients in China. The results showed that the vegetation CUE was averaged to 0.54 +/- 0.11 with minor interannual variation. However, the CUE greatly varied with geographic gradients and ecosystem types. Forests have a lower CUE than grasslands and croplands. Evergreen needleleaf forests have a higher CUE than other forest types. Climate factors (mean annual temperature (MAT), precipitation (MAP) and the index of water availability (IWA)) dominantly regulated the spatial variations of CUE. The CUE exhibited a linear decrease with enhanced MAT and MAP and a parabolic response to the IWA. Furthermore, the responses of CUE to environmental change varied with individual ecosystem type. In contrast, precipitation exerted strong control on CUE in grassland, while in forest and cropland, the CUE was mainly controlled by the available water. This study identifies the variations and response of CUE to environmental drivers in China, which will be valuable for the regional assessment of carbon cycling dynamics under future climate change.

TI  - Nodal positivity decreases with age in women with early-stage, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Despite data demonstrating the safety of omitting axillary surgery in older women with early-stage breast cancer, the incidence of axillary surgery remains high. It was hypothesized that the prevalence of nodal positivity would decrease with advancing age. Methods The National Cancer Data Base was used to construct a cohort of adult women with early-stage, clinically node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer treated between 2013 and 2015. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between age and nodal positivity, and this was stratified by the axillary surgery category. Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate the proportion of women receiving adjuvant therapy according to age and nodal status. Results The incidence of axillary surgery among women aged 70 and older (n = 51,917) remained high nationwide (86%). There was a significant decrease in nodal positivity with advancing age in women with early-stage, ER+, clinically node-negative breast cancer from the youngest cohort up to patients aged 70 to 89 years, and this was independent of histologic subtype (ductal vs lobular), race, comorbidities, and socioeconomic factors. Overall, less than 10% of women aged 70 or older who underwent surgery had node-positive disease, regardless of axillary surgery type, and almost 95% of node-positive patients aged 70 or older were at pathological stage N1mi or N1. Conclusions Axillary surgery may be safely omitted for many older women with ER+, clinically node-negative, early-stage breast cancer. Nodal positivity declines with advancing age, and this suggests varied biology in older patients versus younger patients.

TI  - Oncologic impact of micrometastases or isolated tumor cells in sentinel lymph nodes of patients with endometrial cancer: a meta-analysis
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose There is a gap in knowledge regarding the impact of micrometastases (MIC) and isolated tumor cells (ITCs) found in the sentinel lymph nodes of patients with endometrial cancer. Here, we present a meta-analysis of the published literature on the rate of MIC and ITCs after lymphatic mapping and determine trends in postoperative management. Methods Literature search of Medline and PubMed was done using the terms: micrometastases, isolated tumor cells, endometrial cancer, and sentinel lymph node. Inclusion criteria were: English-language manuscripts, retrospectives, or prospective studies published between January 1999 and June 2019. We removed manuscripts on sentinel node mapping that did not specify information on micrometastases or isolated tumor cells, non-English-language articles, no data about oncologic outcomes, and articles limited to ten cases or less. Results A total of 45 manuscripts were reviewed, and 8 studies met inclusion criteria. We found that the total number of patients with MIC/ITCs was 286 (187 and 99, respectively). The 72% of patients detected with MIC/ITCs in sentinel nodes received adjuvant therapies. The MIC/ITCs group has a higher relative risk of recurrence of 1.34 (1.07, 1.67) than the negative group, even if the adjuvant therapy was given. Conclusion We noted that there is an increased relative risk of recurrence in patients with low-volume metastases, even after receiving adjuvant therapy. Whether adjuvant therapy is indicated remains a topic of debate because there are other uterine factors implicated in the prognosis. Multi-institutional tumor registries may help shed light on this important question.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS and VIIRS cloud-gap-filled snow-cover products for production of an Earth science data record
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cryosphere products have been available since 2000 - following the 1999 launch of the Terra MODIS and the 2002 launch of the Aqua MODIS - and include global snow-cover extent (SCE) (swath, daily, and 8 d composites) at 500 m and similar to 5 km spatial resolutions. These products are used extensively in hydrological modeling and climate studies. Reprocessing of the complete snow-cover data record, from Collection 5 (C5) to Collection 6 (C6) and Collection 6.1 (C6.1), has provided improvements in the MODIS product suite. Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Collection 1 (Cl) snow-cover products at a 375 m spatial resolution have been available since 2011 and are currently being reprocessed for Collection 2 (C2). Both the MODIS C6.1 and the VIIRS C2 products will be available for download from the National Snow and Ice Data Center beginning in early 2020 with the complete time series available in 2020. To address the need for a cloud-reduced or cloud-free daily SCE product for both MODIS and VIIRS, a daily cloudgap-filled (CGF) snow-cover algorithm was developed for MODIS C6.1 and VIIRS C2 processing. MOD10A1F (Terra) and MYD10A1F (Aqua) are daily, 500m resolution CGF SCE map products from MODIS. VNP10A1F is the daily, 375 m resolution CGF SCE map product from VIIRS. These CGF products include quality-assurance data such as cloud-persistence statistics showing the age of the observation in each pixel. The objective of this paper is to introduce the new MODIS and VIIRS standard CGF daily SCE products and to provide a preliminary evaluation of uncertainties in the the gap-filling methodology so that the products can be used as the basis for a moderate-resolution Earth science data record (ESDR) of SCE. Time series of the MODIS and VIIRS CGF products have been developed and evaluated at selected study sites in the US and southern Canada. Observed differences, although small, are largely attributed to cloud masking and differences in the time of day of image acquisition. A nearly 3-month time-series comparison of Terra MODIS and S-NPP VIIRS CGF snow-cover maps for a large study area covering all or parts of 11 states in the western US and part of southwestern Canada reveals excellent correspondence between the Terra MODIS and S-NPP VIIRS products, with a mean difference of 11 070 km(2), which is similar to 0.45 % of the study area. According to our preliminary validation of the Terra and Aqua MODIS CGF SCE products in the western US study area, we found higher accuracy of the Terra product compared with the Aqua product. The MODIS CGF SCE data record beginning in 2000 has been extended into the VIIRS era, which should last at least through the early 2030s.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping land cover changes (LCC) cover three decades over North and West Africa regions provides critical insights for the climate research that inspects the land-atmosphere interaction. LCC is a serious problem in the Earth science domain for this impacts the regional climate by modifying the distribution of terrestrial carbon stocking and roughness of the Earth's surface. In this study, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) generated from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) was used to produce a continuous set of annual land cover (LC) maps of land cover over North and West Africa between 1982 and 2015, based on the random forest classification. We used the MODIS land cover product (MCD12Q1) as a reference data for training the classifier. The result has validated using annual LC maps listed by time series and the spatio-temporal dynamics of land cover has illustrated over the last three decades. The comparison with Google Earth image 2015 shows that the overall accuracy of the simpler nine-class type of our land cover 2015 map is 76% and 2% higher than that of the MODIS map of the same year. The detection of changes indicated that over the last three decades, the urban and built-up, barren or sparsely vegetated, savannas and deciduous broadleaf forest have increased; in contrast, the open shrublands, woody savannas and water bodies have decreased.

TI  - Retrieval of photosynthetic capability for yield gap attribution in maize via model-data fusion
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the factors driving yield gaps between the attainable and actual yields achieved by farmers is essential for agricultural improvement and water resource management. In this study, the process-based VIP (Vegetation Interface Processes) eco-hydrological model was used to estimate the yield gap of spring maize in the Hutuo River Basin (HRB), North China. To describe the realistic crop growth and attainable yield pattern, the field-sampled grain yield and aboveground biomass were used to design a scheme to retrieve the intrinsic quantum efficiency (epsilon(act)) for leaf photosynthesis of C4 crop, including the statistical relationships between the intrinsic quantum efficiency, vegetation index and grain yield. The actual yields were predicted with the retrieved intrinsic quantum efficiency pattern, while the attainable yields were predicted with the average of the top 5% intrinsic quantum efficiencies. The simulated actual yields are consistent with the census data at the county level (R-2 of 0.37 to 0.74 and relative RMSE of 16-29%). The average yield gap in the basin is 5246 kg ha(-1), being 55% of the attainable yield. It is revealed that soil organic matter (SOM) content and depth of soil layer are the principal limiting factors in more than 80% of farmland and results in 70% of the yield gap, while the effects of SOM content is dominant in flat piedmont. Water stress is also a critical factor limiting crop yield, especially for hilly farmlands with slopes greater than 8 degrees. Improving fertilizer management and irrigation techniques in the HRB is therefore the primary task to narrow yield gaps attributable to basin management.

TI  - Slower vegetation greening faced faster social development on the landscape of the Belt and Road region
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The thinking of landscape sustainability discussed thewin-win goal of landscape management for both ecological conservation and social development. The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative has a pathway of green development towards sustainability, which could be benefited from a corporation on transnational landscape management. Although previous remote sensing observations showed that the ecosystem improvement and social development can coexist in most of the Belt and Road region, whether the change tendencies can be sustained have been neglected. Based on the continuous vegetation index, nighttime light and landcover datasets between 1980s-2010s, a detailed observation of the landscape evolution was obtained in this study. Depending on the identifications of temporal breakpoints, the time series was separated to identify the former and latter tendencies, and the evolution score were evaluated. The results showed that the vegetation greening trend weakened in nearly half of the region, and the arid region mostly experienced vegetation browning lately. The evolution patterns of ecological landscape and social landscape were coincided distributed in China and India, and in Southeast Asia was not scored high for both ecological conservation and social development. Consequently, we should not be overly optimistic about the synergy between ecosystem improvement and social development. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assimilating Satellite Land Surface States Data from Fengyun-4A
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-4A is the new generation of Chinese geostationary meteorological satellites. Land surface albedo, land surface emissivity and land surface temperature are key states for land surface modelling. In this paper, the land surface albedo, land surface emissivity and land surface temperature data from Fengyun-4A were assimilated into the Integrated Urban land Model. The Fengyun-4A data are one of the data sources for the land data assimilation system which devoted to produce the high spatial and temporal resolution, multiple parameters near real-time land data sets. The Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LSA and LSE data, the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, China Academy of Sciences (IAP) 325 m tower observation data and the observed 5 cm and 10 cm soil temperature data in more than 100 sites are used for validation. The results indicate the MODIS land surface albedo is much smaller than the Fengyun-4A and is superior to the Fengyun-4A for the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, China Academy of Sciences 325 m tower site. The Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer land surface emissivity is smaller than the Fengyun-4A in barren land surface and the differences is relatively small for other land use and land cover categories. In most regions of the research area, the Fengyun-4A land surface albedo and land surface emissivity are larger than those of the simulations. After the land surface albedo assimilation, in most regions the simulated net radiation was decreased. After the land surface emissivity assimilation, in most regions the simulated net radiation was increased. After the land surface temperature assimilation, the biases of the land surface temperature were decreased apparently; the biases of the daily average 5 cm and 10 cm soil temperature were decreased.

TI  - Giant Ulcerative Basal Cell Carcinoma with Local Metastasis: A Case Report and Assessment of Surgical Techniques
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Giant basal cell carcinoma (GBCC) is a rare skin cancer characterized by an aggressive biological behavior with extensive local invasion, frequent metastasis, and associated poor prognosis. Wide local excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy is often warranted for this condition, and reconstruction by local rotational flap is one of the best surgical techniques for repairing similar skin cancers with a relatively large skin defect.A 59-year-old man who was a former construction worker with a significant smoking history presented with a single giant suspicious chronic ulcerating skin lesion measuring 9 x 7 cm that proved to be a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) on his left shoulder. The patient was negative for enlarged or palpable lymph nodes and underwent a wide local excision and primary repair with a local flap. Despite negative margins, his follow-up visits at six, nine, and 10 months revealed numerous suspicious lesions that further required multiple local wide excisions that showed new basal cell carcinoma and recurrence to the left axilla. Given the invasiveness of his skin cancer, he was referred to oncology and later treated by chemoradiation.Patients with multiple risk factors are associated with a higher incidence of more invasive skin cancer due to possible cumulative effects. The therapeutic approach for GBCC should involve multidisciplinary teams, with wide local resection of the tumor with possible sentinel lymph node biopsy, local rotational flap for reconstruction of the wide defect, and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy if necessary.

TI  - Coupling remote sensing with a water balance model for soybean yield predictions over large areas
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study a new method for predicting soybean yield over large spatial scales, overcoming the difficulties of scalability, is proposed. The method is based on the so-called "simplified triangle" remote sensing technique which is coupled with a crop prediction model of Doorenbos and Kassam 1979 (DK) and the climatological water balance model of Thornthwaite and Mather 1955 (ThM). In the method, surface soil water content (Mo), evapotranspiration (ET), and evaporative fraction (EF) are derived from satellite-derived surface radiant temperature (Ts) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Use of the proposed method is demonstrated in Brazil's Parana state for crop years 2002-03 to 2011-12. The soybean crop yield model of DK is evaluated using remotely estimated EF values obtained by a simplified triangle. Predicted crop yield by the satellite measurements and from archived Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission data (TRMM) and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) data were in good agreement with the measured crop yield. A "d(2)" index (modified Willmott) between 0.8 and 0.98 and RMSE between 30.8 (kg/ha) to 57.2 (kg/ha) was reported. Crop yield predicted using EF from the triangle were statistically better than the DK and ThM using values of the equivalent of EF obtained from archived surface data when compared with the measured soybean crop data. The proposed method requires no ancillary meteorological or surface data apart from the two satellite images. This makes the technique easy to apply allowing providing spatiotemporal estimates of crop yield in large areas and at different spatial scales requiring little or no surface data.

TI  - Remote sensing and modeling fusion for investigating the ecosystem water-carbon coupling processes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The water and carbon cycles are tightly linked and play a key role in the material and energy flows between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere, but the interactions of water and carbon cycles are not quite clear. The global climate change and intensive human activities could also complicate the water and carbon coupling processes. Better understanding the coupled water-carbon cycles and their spatiotemporal evolution can inform management and decision-making efforts regarding carbon uptake, food production, water resources, and climate change. The integration of remote sensing and numeric modeling is an attractive approach to address the challenge. Remote sensing can provide extensive data for a number of variables at regional scale and support models, whereas process-based modeling can facilitate investigating the processes that remote sensing cannot well handle (e.g., below-ground and lateral material movement) and backcast/forecast the impacts of environmental change. Over the past twenty years, an increasing number of studies using a variety of remote sensing products together with numeric models have examined the water-carbon interactions. This article reviewed themethodologies for integrating remote sensing data into these models and the modeling of water-carbon coupling processes. We first summarized the major remote sensing datasets and models used for studying the coupled water-carbon cycles. We then provided an overview of the methods for integrating remote sensing data into water-carbon models, and discussed their strengths and challenges. We also prospected the development of potential new remote sensing datasets, modeling methods, and their potential applications in the field of eco-hydrology. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Estimating evapotranspiration using METRIC model and Landsat data for better understandings of regional hydrology in the western Urmia Lake Basin
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study estimates the evapotranspiration (ET) from the western part of Urmia Lake Basin, Iran, to provide quality spatio-temporal evapotranspiration information for use in achieving regional sustainable water management. A "mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration" (METRIC) ET estimation model was adopted to estimate monthly ET for the period between 2014-2016 using Landsat 8 satellite imagery. Several refinements are made to adjust the model to the local environment. The refinements include estimating evaporation from the saline lake, correction of the underestimation of city surface temperature through the modification of thermal emissivity, as well as modifications of minor assumptions applied in METRIC. The estimation results for ET obtained using METRIC were compared with independent estimation of ET using the FAO-56 approach in order to assess the estimation accuracy. The comparison showed good correlation between the two types of estimation results for irrigated agriculture, implying successful estimation of ET in this region. ET estimated in non-irrigated bare soil fields was prone to overestimation. The novelty of this study lies in the fact that this is the first ET data for this basin with 100 m spatio-temporal resolution and accuracy information. Therefore, the estimation procedure and results are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the regional hydrology. This is necessary both for the restoration of Urmia Lake and for achieving sustainable water management in the region.

AB  - Stratigraphic formations, namely, Asu River, Ezeaku, Awgu and Nkporo Groups; belonging to Albian, Turonian, Coniacian and Campanian ages, respectively, underlie the studied region. The formations are dominated by groundwater problematic clastic sediments. This study is aimed at tracing fracture zones for groundwater prospects and delineating hydrological catchments for the watershed management strategy. It commenced with analyses of aeromagnetic and edge enhanced band 5 Landsat 7 ETM+ data, with application of filters like reduction to equator (RTE), first vertical derivatives (1VD), total horizontal gradient (THG) and analytical signal. The THG of the RTE grids was combined with the edge enhanced Landsat data and utilized on-screen lineament discriminations. Results showed igneous intrusive representative lineaments in Asu River Group. Lineaments pinpointing ferruginous structures like ironstones stained the Nkporo Group. Further applications of edge enhanced filters delineated lineaments as river beds, fractures/fault nodes and fold axes. The lineaments trending NW-SE depict fracture axes and river beds, whereas those trending NE-SW represent axial anticlines. Validation of results with electrical sounding verified the relevance of outcropping fractures as conduits through which groundwater discharges from the shallow water table at the northwestern hill range region; producing fluvial systems like river tributaries/catchments. Conversely, the rivers recharge the groundwater via fracture linking to deeper water table downstream.

TI  - Regional Node Basin Recurrence in Melanoma Patients: More Common After Node Dissection for Macroscopic Rather than Clinically Occult Nodal Disease
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Recommended treatment for patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive melanoma has recently changed. Randomized trials demonstrated equivalent survival with close observation versus completion lymph node dissection (CLND), but increased regional node recurrence. We evaluated factors related to in-basin nodal recurrence after lymphadenectomy (LND) for SLN-positive or macroscopic nodal metastases. Methods An institutional database and the first Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT-I) were analyzed independently. Exclusions were multiple primaries, multi-basin involvement, or in-transit metastases. Patient demographics, primary tumor thickness and ulceration, lymph nodes retrieved, and use of adjuvant radiotherapy were analyzed. Multivariate analyses were performed to determine factors predicting in-basin nodal recurrence (significance p <= 0.05). Results The retrospective cohort (577 patients) showed an in-basin failure rate of 6.6% after CLND for a positive SLN and 13.1% after LND for palpable disease (p = 0.001). This recurrence risk persisted after adjustment for patient, tumor, and LND factors [hazard ratio (HR) 2.32; p = 0.004]. In the MSLT-I cohort (326 patients), the failure rate after CLND following SLNB was 6.2%, but 10.1% after LND for palpable recurrence in observation patients. After adjustment for other factors, macroscopic disease was associated with an increased risk of recurrence after LND (HR 2.24; p = 0.05). Conclusion After LND for melanoma, in-basin recurrence is infrequent, but a clinically significant fraction will fail. Failure is less likely if dissection is performed for clinically occult disease. Further research is warranted to evaluate the long-term regional control and quality of life associated with nodal basin observation, which has now become standard practice.

TI  - In-flight calibration and monitoring of the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) short-wave infrared (SWIR) module
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - During its first year in operation the short-wave infrared (SWIR) Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) was calibrated in-flight and its performance was monitored. In this paper we present the results of the in-flight calibration and the ongoing instrument monitoring. This includes the determination of the background signals, noise performance, instrument spectral response function (ISRF) stability, and stray-light stability. From these results, the number of incurred dead and bad pixels due to cosmic-ray impacts is determined. The light-path transmission is checked by monitoring internal lamp and diffuser stabilities. Due to its high sensitivity to Earth radiation on the eclipse side, the calibration strategy for the background (i.e. dark current and offset) monitoring was adjusted. Trends over the first full year of nominal operations reveal a very stable SWIR module. The number of newly incurred dead and bad pixels is less than 0.1% over nearly a full year since the start of operations. Assuming linear degradation of various components, the SWIR module is expected to keep performing within expected parameters for the full operational life-time.

TI  - Paclitaxel induces lymphatic endothelial cells autophagy to promote metastasis
T2  - CELL DEATH & DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cytotoxic therapy for breast cancer inhibits the growth of primary tumors, but promotes metastasis to the sentinel lymph nodes through the lymphatic system. However, the effect of first-line chemotherapy on the lymphatic endothelium has been poorly investigated. In this study, we determined that paclitaxel, the anti-cancer drug approved for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer, induces lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) autophagy to increase metastases. While paclitaxel treatment was largely efficacious in inhibiting LEC adhesion, it had no effect on cell survival. Paclitaxel inhibited LEC migration and branch point formation by inducing an autophagy mechanism independent of Akt phosphorylation. In vivo, paclitaxel mediated a higher permeability of lymphatic endothelium to tumor cells and this effect was reversed by chloroquine, an autophagy-lysosome inhibitor. Despite a strong effect on reducing tumor size, paclitaxel significantly increased metastasis to the sentinel lymph nodes. This effect was restricted to a lymphatic dissemination, as chemotherapy did not affect the blood endothelium. Taken together, our findings suggest that the lymphatic system resists to chemotherapy through an autophagy mechanism to promote malignant progression and metastatic lesions. This study paves the way for new combinative therapies aimed at reducing the number of metastases.

TI  - Surveillance of swine influenza viruses in sentinel familial farms in Hung Yen province in Northern Vietnam in 2013-2014
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - From May 2013 to April 2014, 15 swine family-run farms (17 pig litters) in two districts in Hung Yen province, near Hanoi, were virologically and epizootiologically monitored for swine influenza viruses (SIV) monthly. No SIV was isolated from nasal swabs. Maternal antibodies were detected in 10 litters, and seroconversion against SIV was detected in six litters. There was a marked difference in patterns of SIV transmission in the two districts. Van Lam district which has low density of swine with mainly smallholder farms had low intensity of SIV, with much of the infection caused by H1N1 2009 pandemic-like viruses A(H1N1)pdm09, likely originated from humans. In contrast, Van Giang district, which has high swine density and larger farms, had high levels of typical SIV (triple reassortants H3N2 and H3N2 Binh Duong lineage viruses) circulating within swine. With one exception, the SIV lineages detected were those we concurrently isolated from studies in a large central abattoir in Hanoi. Influenza-like illness symptoms reported by farmers were poorly correlated with serological evidence of SIV infection.

TI  - Twenty-five years of change in the management of the axilla in breast cancer
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is now used worldwide. It has led to many changes in how we manage the axilla in patients with breast cancer. This review covers four areas of management of the axilla in breast cancer: assessing the clinically node-negative axilla, managing the clinically negative axilla found to be involved at SLN biopsy, management of the clinically positive axilla in the context of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, and treatment of the diseased axilla when radical therapy is required. We suggest that the evidence supports an optimum number of 3 nodes to be removed for accurate SLN biopsy. Breast cancer departments that have not adopted Z0011 patient management cannot continue to avoid change. The evidence is clear: Not all patients with limited axillary nodal disease on sentinel node biopsy need axillary lymph node dissection. For patients who do need axillary treatment, axillary radiotherapy continues to be under-used. Patients undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy can be safely assessed by post-therapy SLN biopsy, with retrieval of any previously biopsied involved nodes by targeted axillary dissection. There is much to support the trend to doing less in the axilla. We are obliged to act based on the available robust clinical trial data in a way that limits morbidity while at the same time does not increase the risk of disease recurrence.

TI  - Chlorophyll as key indicator to evaluate astaxanthin accumulation ability of <i>Haematococcus pluvialis</i>
T2  - BIORESOURCES AND BIOPROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Natural astaxanthin is mainly derived from Haematococcus pluvialis. In the photoinduction phase, astaxanthin accumulation ability can be significantly affected by the characteristics of H. pluvialis cells in the proliferation phase. Based on sequential heterotrophy-dilution-photoinduction (SHDP) technology, the authors' previous study showed that high astaxanthin accumulation ability is accompanied by high chlorophyll content of H. pluvialis heterotrophic cell; whereas the mechanism of this result remained largely obscure. Therefore, transcriptome analysis was conducted to explain this mechanism. Results RNA-seq analysis showed that the transcription level of chlorophyll synthesis-related genes was negatively correlated with genes related to astaxanthin synthesis. A metabolic network between chlorophyll synthesis and astaxanthin accumulation was proposed. Conclusions The relationship between chlorophyll synthesis and astaxanthin accumulation was clarified. Chlorophyll degradation products might be used for astaxanthin synthesis through certain pathways. This study enlightens on the mechanism for the transformation of pigment and is conducive to optimize culture process of H. pluvialis by improving the chlorophyll content of heterotrophic cell.

TI  - The 2017 Nishinoshima eruption: combined analysis using Himawari-8 and multiple high-resolution satellite images
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nishinoshima volcano suddenly resumed eruptive activity in April 2017 after about 1.5 years of dormancy since its previous activity in 2013-2015. Nishinoshima is an uninhabited isolated island. We analyzed the eruption sequence and the eruptive process of the 2017 eruption (17 April-10 August: 116 days) by combining high-temporal-resolution images from Himawari-8 and high-spatial-resolution images from the ALOS-2, Landsat-8, and Pleiades satellites. We used these data to discuss how temporal variations in the lava effusion rate affected the flow formations and topographical features of the effused lava. The total effused volume was estimated to be 1.6 x 10(7) m(3), and the average effusion rate was 1.5 x 10(5) m(3)/day (1.7 m(3)/s). Based on variations in the thermal anomalies in the 1.6-mu m band of Himawari-8, which roughly coincided with that of the lava effusion rate estimated by ALOS-2, the activity was segmented into five stages. In Stage 1 (17-30 April: 14 days), the lava effusion rate was the highest, and lava flowed to the west and southwest. Stage 2 (1 May-5 June: 36 days) showed a uniform decrease in flow, and lava flowed to the southwest and formed the southwestern lava delta. During Stage 3 (6-15 June: 10 days), the lava effusion rate increased in a pulsed manner, the flow direction changed from southwestward to westward, and a narrow lava flow effused from the southern slope of the cone. In Stage 4 (16 June-31 July: 46 days), the lava effusion rate decreased and lava flowed westward through lava tubes, enlarging the western lava delta. Around the end of July, lava effusion mostly stopped. Finally, in Stage 5 (1-10 August: 10 days), explosive eruptions occurred sporadically. The variation in lava effusion rate seemed to play an important role in forming different flow patterns of lava on Nishinoshima. In Stages 1 and 3, lava flowed in multiple directions, while in Stages 2 and 4, it flowed in single direction, probably because the effusion rate was lower. A pulsed increase in the lava effusion rate during Stage 3 caused new breaks and disturbances of the lava passages near the vents, which resulted in changes in flow directions. Differences in the size of lava lobes between the southwestern and western deltas are also considered to result from differences in the lava effusion rate.

TI  - Thermal anomalies detection before Saravan earthquake (April 16th, 2013, <i>M</i><sub>W</sub>=7.8) using time series method, satellite, and meteorological data
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal anomaly detection related to strong earthquakes is one of the earthquake precursors extensively investigated by researchers. In this research, five years (March 16th to May 16th, every year from 2009 to 2013) of Land Surface Temperature (LST) data products, obtained from satellite data (MODIS-Aqua), and meteorological data (air and soil temperature), using three-dimensional time series method, have been analyzed to characterize the thermal anomalies related to the Saravan earthquake (April 16th, 2013, M-w = 7.8). The results indicate that the thermal anomalies were observed in the time period before and after the earthquake. In the LST time-space-temperature coordinates, the thermal anomaly pattern was seen before the Saravan earthquake. In the Kriging surfaces of the air temperature and the difference between the LST and air temperature ( increment T), considerable changes were seen a few days before the earthquake until a few days after it. In addition, the soil temperature time-space-temperature coordinates show changes (increase) a few days after the Saravan earthquake. Therefore, the obtained results suggest that these changes (thermal anomalies) are related to the earthquake and can be expressed as an earthquake predictor.

TI  - Detectability of CO<sub>2</sub> emission plumes of cities and power plants with the Copernicus Anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> Monitoring (CO2M) mission
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution atmospheric transport simulations were used to investigate the potential for detecting carbon dioxide (CO2) plumes of the city of Berlin and neighboring power stations with the Copernicus Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide Monitoring (CO2M) mission, which is a proposed constellation of CO2 satellites with imaging capabilities. The potential for detecting plumes was studied for satellite images of CO2 alone or in combination with images of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) to investigate the added value of measurements of other gases co-emitted with CO2 that have better signal-to-noise ratios. The additional NO2 and CO images were either generated for instruments on the same CO2M satellites (2 km x 2 km resolution) or for the Sentinel-5 instrument (7.5 km x 7.5 km) assumed to fly 2 h earlier than CO2M. Realistic CO2, CO and NOX(=NO+NO2) fields were simulated at 1 km x 1 km horizontal resolution with the Consortium for Small-scale Modeling model extended with a module for the simulation of greenhouse gases (COSMO-GHG) for the year 2015, and they were used as input for an orbit simulator to generate synthetic observations of columns of CO2, CO and NO2 for constellations of up to six satellites. A simple plume detection algorithm was applied to detect coherent structures in the images of CO2, NO2 or CO against instrument noise and variability in background levels. Although six satellites with an assumed swath of 250 km were sufficient to overpass Berlin on a daily basis, only about 50 out of 365 plumes per year could be observed in conditions suitable for emission estimation due to frequent cloud cover. With the CO2 instrument only 6 and 16 of these 50 plumes could be detected assuming a high-noise (sigma(VEG50) = 1.0 ppm) and low-noise (sigma(VEG50) = 0.5 ppm) scenario, respectively, because the CO2 signals were often too weak. A CO instrument with specifications similar to the Sentinel-5 mission performed worse than the CO2 instrument, while the number of detectable plumes could be significantly increased to about 35 plumes with an NO2 instrument. CO2 and NO2 plumes were found to overlap to a large extent, although NOX had a limited lifetime (assumed to be 4 h) and although CO2 and NOX were emitted with different NOX ; CO2 emission ratios by different source types with different temporal and vertical emission profiles. Using NO2 observations from the Sentinel-5 platform instead resulted in a significant spatial mismatch between NO2 and CO2 plumes due to the 2 h time difference between Sentinel-5 and CO2M. The plumes of the coal-fired power plant Janschwalde were easier to detect with the CO2 instrument (about 40-45 plumes per year), but, again, an NO2 instrument could detect significantly more plumes (about 70). Auxiliary measurements of NO2 were thus found to greatly enhance the capability of detecting the location of CO2 plumes, which will be invaluable for the quantification of CO2 emissions from large point sources.

TI  - Global order, US-China relations, and Chinese behaviour: The ground is shifting, Canada must adjust
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Three profound shifts are coming to a head in the twenty-first century: shifts in the global order, shifts in the US-China relationship, and shifts in Chinese behaviour. These shifts are compelling Canada to reframe its relations with China. First, at the global level, the changing balance of power is leading us toward an era of polycentric global governance. Second, there is deepening antagonism in US-China relations. Third, China's international posture has become more assertive. Canada has yet to adjust, but it is well placed to develop a global worldview in sync with twenty-first century realities. The Canada-China relationship needs to be transformed into an adaptive, modular, and strategic relationship, in our dealings with China at the global level, in triangulating our relationships with the US and China, and within the confines of our bilateral relationship. This paper tackles each area in turn.

TI  - Hidden in plain sight: How finding a lake in the Brazilian Pantanal improves understanding of wetland hydrogeomorphology
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are permanently or seasonally flooded areas which support countless species of plants and animals. The Pantanal, in central-west Brazil is one of the largest freshwater wetlands in the world covering an area of similar to 150 000 km(2). The relationships between geomorphology, hydrology, sedimentation, and vegetation cover are critical for understanding how the landscape constrains the dynamics of wetlands. We provide a detailed study of the geomorphology and surface hydrology of the Negro River Interfan System (NRIS), in the southern Pantanal, by applying multiple approaches (i.e. remote sensing analysis, geomorphological zonation and hydrosedimentological surveys). A multitemporal analysis of Landsat imagery produced an inundation frequency map (2000-2011 period) that revealed a permanently flooded area in the central portion of the NRIS. A hidden fluvial lake was previously undetected due to the accumulation of floating mats and floating meadows of macrophytes. The Negro and Aquidauana feeder rivers exhibit remarkable differences in channel planform, water discharge, and sediment load. The Negro River presents a distributary pattern with marginal levees with decreasing elevation as it progrades into the lake and remains as a subaqueous landform conditioning the water flow downstream. The lake outflow to the Paraguay River occurs mainly by sheet flow during flood seasons and through small tributary channels during dry months. The lake's geometry is outlined by east-northeast and west-northwest straight borders, suggesting that the area is tectonically controlled. A cloud-based worldwide water surface database (1984-2015) revealed frequent channel changes within the NRIS. Recent channel avulsions in the lower course of the Negro River are noteworthy mainly because the former river channel at the confluence with the Paraguay River is no longer connected with the Negro River channel.

TI  - Changing landscape configuration demands ecological planning: Retrospect and prospect for megaherbivores of North Bengal
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gorumara National Park (GNP) is an important conservation area located in the northern region of West Bengal State, India, as it provides habitat for three megaherbivores: Indian One-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and Gaurs (Bos gaurus). It harbours one of the last population of the one-horned rhino. In the present study, landscape change and configuration were investigated by comparing three Landsat images, from 1998, 2008 and 2018. The images were classified into six different landcover classes following standard methodology. The present study also involves evaluation of landscape and anthropogenic predictors influence on the megaherbivores of GNP, followed by future landcover simulation for the year 2028. The result shows a significant decrease in the grassland cover from 18.87 km(2) to 8.27 km(2) from 1998 to 2018, whereas the woodland cover has increased from 50.14 km(2) to 62.09 km(2) between 1998 and 2018. The landscape configuration indices such as Number of Patches (NP), Patch Density (PD), Interspersion and Juxtaposition (IJI), Aggregation Index (AI) and Mean Shape Index (SHAPE AM) indicated that the landscapes has lost complexity in the spatial placement of patches of different Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classes. Also, the landscape over the three decades has become uniform in terms of diversity of patches, because of earlier plantation activities by the forest managers. Result also indicated that grassland, along with its class metrics are the top predictors contributing 43.6% in explaining the spatial distribution of megaherbivores in GNP. Results from the simulated landcover of 2028 suggest a possible decline in overall grassland by 6.23% and a subsequent upsurge in woodland by 6.09% from 2018. The present result will be useful in guiding the forest management in developing habitat improvement strategies for the long-term viability of megaherbivore populations of rhino, gaur and elephant in the GNP.

TI  - Cervids as sentinel-species for tick-borne encephalitis virus in Norway - A serological study
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is the causative agent of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). TBEV is one of the most important neurological pathogens transmitted by tick bites in Europe. The objectives of this study were to investigate the seroprevalence of TBE antibodies in cervids in Norway and the possible emergence of new foci, and furthermore to evaluate if cervids can function as sentinel animals for the distribution of TBEV in the country. Serum samples from 286 moose, 148 roe deer, 140 red deer and 83 reindeer from all over Norway were collected and screened for TBE immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies with a modified commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmed by TBEV serum neutralisation test (SNT). The overall seroprevalence against the TBEV complex in the cervid specimens from Norway was 4.6%. The highest number of seropositive cervids was found in south-eastern Norway, but seropositive cervids were also detected in southern- and central Norway. Antibodies against TBEV detected by SNT were present in 9.4% of the moose samples, 1.4% in red deer, 0.7% in roe deer, and nil in reindeer. The majority of the positive samples in our study originated from areas where human cases of TBE have been reported in Norway. The study is the first comprehensive screening of cervid species in Norway for antibodies to TBEV, and shows that cervids are useful sentinel animals to indicate TBEV occurrence, as supplement to studies in ticks. Furthermore, the results indicate that TBEV might be spreading northwards in Norway. This information may be of relevance for public health considerations and supports previous findings of TBEV in ticks in Norway.

TI  - A new environmental and spatial approach to the Tiwanaku World Heritage site (Bolivia) using remote sensing (UAV and satellite images)
T2  - GEOARCHAEOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper analyses the research carried out in the Tiwanaku World Heritage site in Bolivia, using unmanned aerial vehicles and satellite images. The combined use of images with different scales has made it possible to locate many archaeological structures unknown to date (drainage systems, walls, circular crop marks, and a possible dock). The Sentinel-2 images, which were processed using principal components analysis and histogram equalization, show the river beds, flood-prone areas, and several buried drainage channels surrounding the most important structures. The archaeological evidence obtained with the digital terrain model and natural color/multispectral images enables us to contrast a new dimension of land and water uses that go beyond what was known to date. In the same way, these images enable us to understand in detail the environmental characteristics, land use, building distribution, and flood defense structures of the Tiwanaku culture throughout its history, within the context of the environmental conditions of the Bolivian altiplano. This study allowed the authors to collect new information and pose questions on the relationship of this site with water, as well as a better understanding of the extent and habitat of this historical population.

TI  - Enhanced Vegetation Growth in the Urban Environment Across 32 Cities in the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - How the urban environment influences vegetation phenology is important to understand the living environment and the climate-vegetation interaction. This study investigates changes in vegetation phenology in the urban environment using remote sensing data for 32 major cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Vegetation phenological information for both urban and rural areas of each individual city was derived from the remote sensing data. We found that the urban environment generally enhanced vegetation growth but at varied degrees for different regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Vegetation phenology metrics, including the start of season (SOS), the end of season (EOS), and the growing season length (GSL), have large differences between urban and rural environment. Vegetation SOS in urban areas occurred earlier than in rural areas for 22 in 32 cities, and the relationships between advanced urban SOS and the distance away from urban centers are significant for 9 cities. Vegetation EOS in urban areas occurred later than in rural areas for 19 in 32 cities, and the relationships between delayed urban EOS and the distance away from urban centers are significant for 10 cities. The response of SOS to the urban environment is found dependent upon the latitude of urban centers and urban spring daytime and nighttime temperatures. Analysis on ground observational records of vegetation phenology in the region of North America supports the findings derived from remote sensing data. These findings could help to understand the impacts of the urban environment on vegetation growth.
