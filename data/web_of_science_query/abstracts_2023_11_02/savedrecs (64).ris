TI  - Assessing the distribution pattern of otters in four rivers of the Indian Himalayan biodiversity hotspot
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata), and Asian small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus) have all been reported previously from the Indian state of Uttarakhand. However, little information is available about their current distribution in a mountainous region that is subject to increasing human-induced stressors (such as hydropower plants, pollution, sand and boulder mining, destructive fishing techniques, poaching). Owing to important roles played by these otters in structuring riverine food webs (particularly taking account of their roles as top carnivores), it is critical that they receive suitable protection in the face of projected temperature rise, change in precipitation patterns, and associated river flows in this Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. This study assesses otter distribution in four rivers of Uttarakhand as a basis for informing future conservation actions. Field surveys were conducted (October 2018-January 2019) in reaches of the Kosi, Ramganga, Khoh, and Song rivers, supported by semi-structured interviews (N = 379) conducted with members of local communities to collect qualitative data on views and perceptions of otter species. In addition, community-based otter awareness camps were organized for local youths (N = 105), adults (N = 115), and schoolchildren (N = 256 covering 10 schools). Habitat suitability maps were created using remote-sensing data, survey findings, and a geographic information system to provide information about priority reaches of river to be targeted for future conservation efforts. This study provides critical interdisciplinary baseline information to guide decision-makers towards developing a targeted, otter-specific conservation programme for this important Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. The otter conservation education programmes conducted during this study resulted in a proposal to set up a community-based conservation initiative to monitor and report otter sightings from the area, potentially representing a way forward for achieving simultaneous otter conservation and associated ecosystem benefits for local communities.

TI  - Identifying tree health using sentinel-2 images: a case study on <i>Tortrix viridana</i> L. infected oak trees in Western Iran
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest land has a vital role in our planet ecosystem health. Forest areas are under natural and human pressure worldwide. Pests may have irreparable damages to vegetation cover; Tortrix viridana is one of the most important pests in the western forests of Iran and is mainly hosted by oak trees. In this study the performance of Sentinel-2 images to detect infected oaks by T. viridana in the Zagros forest habitat was considered. Vegetation indices (VIs) were extracted from affected and non-affected areas by T. viridana. The indices indices included normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), infrared percentage vegetation index (IPVI) and inverted red-edge chlorophyll index (IRECI) which were extracted from Sentinel-2 satellite images. The results of the present study show that VIs in affected and non-affected areas of the study site have significant differences at 99% of confidence level. In addition, the Spearman's correlation coefficients between the VIs values in the affected and non-affected were 0.213, 0.213, 0.168 and 0.121 for IPVI, NDVI, IRECI and SAVI, respectively. This shows that Sentinel-2 images can be used to detect pests in forest areas.

TI  - Detection of permanently eroded landsurfaces through multitemporal analysis of Landsat data: a case study from an agricultural area in southern Italy
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a critical environmental degradation problem globally, especially in regions economically dependent on agriculture. Remote sensing proved to be an ideal method for a timely investigation of soil erosion over large areas. The aim of this study was analyzing the spatial distribution of soil erosion-prone landsurfaces in an agricultural area of southern Italy in the period 2009-2018 and investigating the environmental features more favorable in triggering soil erosion processes. The study was carried out by integrating the results of multitemporal analysis of Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI imagery, GIS analysis, and geomorphological field survey. Erosion-prone landsurfaces were detected through their typical spectral response. GIS analysis allowed discriminating permanently eroded landsurfaces from areas occasionally affected by soil erosion or morphodynamically stable. Severe soil erosion processes affected more than a half of the study area at least once in the considered period. Permanently eroded landsurfaces accounted for 5.4% of the areas affected by soil erosion processes. Lithological and pedological features of the landsurface controlled the spatial distribution of the eroded areas more than slope angle and aspect. The proposed approach allowed producing reliable maps of the areas affected by soil erosion processes in a relatively short time and at a low cost, which represent a first but fundamental step in land management.

TI  - Embracing indigenous metaphors: a new/old way of thinking about sustainability
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores the role of metaphor in cognition, outlining how the machine metaphor came to dominate and the problematic assumptions for culture/nature relationships and the consequences for the environment that underpin this metaphor. It then argues that the machine metaphor needs to be complemented by an animistic metaphor, which embodies and underpins indigenous relationships to nature, using examples from the New Zealand Maori.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This paper presents a dataset of yearly land use and land cover classification maps for Mato Grosso State, Brazil, from 2001 to 2017. Mato Grosso is one of the world's fast moving agricultural frontiers. To ensure multi-year compatibility, the work uses MODIS sensor analysis-ready products and an innovative method that applies machine learning techniques to classify satellite image time series. The maps provide information about crop and pasture expansion over natural vegetation, as well as spatially explicit estimates of increases in agricultural productivity and trade-offs between crop and pasture expansion. Therefore, the dataset provides new and relevant information to understand the impact of environmental policies on the expansion of tropical agriculture in Brazil. Using such results, researchers can make informed assessments of the interplay between production and protection within Amazon, Cerrado, and Pantanal biomes.Measurement(s)land center dot land useTechnology Type(s)computational modeling techniqueFactor Type(s)year center dot geographic location center dot land use and cover classSample Characteristic - EnvironmentlandSample Characteristic - LocationMato Grosso State Machine-accessible metadata file describing the reported data: 10.6084/m9.figshare.11440461

TI  - Variations in glacier volume and snow cover and their impact on lake storage in the Paiku Co Basin, in the Central Himalayas
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers and snow cover are important constituents of the surface of the Tibetan Plateau. The responses of these phenomena to global environmental changes are sensitive, rapid and intensive due to the high altitudes and arid cold climate of the Tibetan Plateau. Based on multisource remote sensing data, including Landsat images, MOD10A2 snow product, ICESat, Cryosat-2 altimetry data and long-term ground climate observations, we analysed the dynamic changes of glaciers, snow melting and lake in the Paiku Co basin using extraction methods for glaciers and lake, the degree-day model and the ice and lake volume method. The interaction among the climate, ice-snow and the hydrological elements in Paiku Co is revealed. From 2000 to 2018, the basin tended to be drier, and rainfall decreased at a rate of -3.07 mm/a. The seasonal temperature difference in the basin increased, the maximum temperature increased at a rate of 0.02 degrees C/a and the minimum temperature decreased at a rate of -0.06 degrees C/a, which accelerated the melting from glaciers and snow at rates of 0.55 x 10(7) m(3)/a and 0.29 x 10(7) m(3)/a, respectively. The rate of contribution to the lake from rainfall, snow and glacier melted water was 55.6, 27.7 and 16.7%, respectively. In the past 18 years, the warmer and drier climate has caused the lake to shrink. The water level of the lake continued to decline at a rate of -0.02 m/a, and the lake water volume decreased by 4.85 x 10(8) m(3) at a rate of -0.27 x 10(8) m(3)/a from 2000 to 2018. This evaluation is important for understanding how the snow and ice melting in the central Himalayas affect the regional water cycle.

TI  - Landscape Scale land degradation mapping in the semi-arid areas of the Save catchment, Zimbabwe
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This research investigates the distribution and magnitude of vegetation loss in the Save catchment. The main objective is to map and quantify human-induced land degradation in the Save catchment, using Residual trend analysis (RESTREND) method. The investigation was done using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI time series data, and gridded precipitation datasets from Climate Research Unit, recorded between 2000 and 2015. NDVI and rainfall time series, as well as ordinary least squares regression models used in the analysis, were computed in R statistical program. Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques were used in the quantification of degradation trends. The study revealed that approximately 18% of Save catchment experienced declining residual trends whilst increasing residual trends covered 34% of the area. These trends covered 1.7 Mha and 3.1 Mha, respectively. The study calculated the statistical significance of the declining trends. The results demonstrate that about 3.6 Mha experienced significant human-induced land degradation during the study period. This area represents 39% of the Save Catchment, 4%, 13%, and 22% of which were classified as severely, moderately, and lightly degraded, respectively. The results indicate the vulnerability of Save catchment to human-induced degradation. Severe degradation was noted in the central districts of the Save Catchment, notably Bikita, Chiredzi, and most parts of Chipinge. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of RESTREND in removing influence of precipitation changes from land degradation. Based on these results, we recommend for the use of RESTREND method in detecting land degradation that is triggered by human actions.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming has substantial impacts on the hydrologic cycle and precipitation characteristics. This study aimed to explore variability in the form of precipitation by analysis of trends in the snowfall (SD)/total precipitation-day (PD) ratio across Iran. To this end, the PD and SD records were acquired from 33 synoptic stations during 1965-2014. The Mann-Kendall (MK) test was the main method used for trend detection. Analyzing data exposed that the annual SD/PD ratio was less than 25% in a plethora of the stations. The MK test findings indicated downward tendencies in the SD/PD ratio over most regions of the country; although in many cases, the observed trends were not statically significant. The changes in the annual SD/PD ratio were estimated down to - 2% per decade over 70% of Iran's total area. Further studies are required to ascertain the linkages between the large-scale climate oscillations and the form of precipitation across this region. Also, using remotely sensed data (e.g., obtained from the MODIS) and fine-resolution gridded data (e.g., global and regional reanalysis data) in future research could improve the findings of such studies and dwindle the uncertainties caused by the scanty site-based observations.

TI  - SAT-ETL-Integrator: an extract-transform-load software for satellite big data ingestion
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data are used in several environmental applications, particularly in air quality supervising, climate change monitoring, and natural disaster predictions. However, remote sensing (RS) data occur in huge volume, in near-real time, and are stored inside complex structures. We aim to prove that satellite data are big data (BD). Accordingly, we propose a software as an extract-transform-load tool for satellite data preprocessing. We focused on the ingestion layer that will enable an efficient RSBD integration. As a result, the developed software layer receives data continuously and removes similar to 86% of the unused files. This layer also eliminates nearly 20% of erroneous datasets. Thanks to the proposed approach, we successfully reduced storage space consumption, enhanced the RS data accuracy, and integrated preprocessed datasets into a Hadoop distributed file system.

TI  - Trend analysis of atmospheric temperature, water vapour, ozone, methane and carbon-monoxide over few major cities of India using satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, decadal trend analysis of atmospheric temperature, water vapour, ozone, methane and carbon-monoxide has been presented over few major cities of India using Aqua-AIRS products from 2003 to 2012. The atmospheric column is studied in few atmospheric layers, viz., surface-850, 850-500, 500-100, 100-50 and 50-1 hPa for temperature, water vapour and ozone. However, CH4 and CO results are presented in total column amounts. Non-parametric Mann-Kendall test has been applied to investigate the trends of annual means of parameters and Sen's slope estimate has been used to find the rate of the change, if there is a trend. The layer average temperature (LAT) has been found to be increasing in lower troposphere (surface-850 hPa) and decreasing in lower stratosphere (100-50 hPa). The warming trend over Chennai is found to be not limited in lower tropospheric region, but extended in 850-500 hPa layer also. However, LAT (850-500 hPa) has decreasing trend over Thiruvananthapuram. LAT in 500-100 hPa has significant decreasing trend only over Ahmedabad. The decreasing LAT trend in 100-50 hPa is quite prominent with significant decreasing trends over Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Hyderabad. The layer integrated water vapour (LIWV) is found be increasing mainly in surface-850 hPa and 850-500 hPa layers. The decreasing trend of LIWV has been observed only over Ahmedabad in 500-100 hPa layer. For total column water vapour, the trends are mostly increasing, however, it is statistically significant only over Hyderabad. The layer integrated ozone has been found to be increasing in troposphere and decreasing in lower stratosphere. The increasing trend of ozone in troposphere is most prominent in lower-mid tropospheric region (850-500 hPa layer). No significant trend has been observed for total column ozone. Total column methane has shown significant increasing trend over all cities with very good significance level. However, for total column carbon-monoxide, the trends are decreasing and the decreasing trends are significant over Delhi and Mumbai.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Evolution and Zoning of Ecological Vulnerability of Jingle County
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on the eco-environment vulnerability assessment is an important basis for the regional ecological environment restoration and governance. Based on the interaction between man-made and natural factors, 14 indices were selected which can represent the human activities, social economy, vegetation, meteorology, soil and terrain landforms to construct the ecological vulnerability evaluation index system for Jingle County in Shanxi Province. The quantitative assessment and zoning of ecological vulnerability in 2007 and 2017 was calculated with the aid of spatial principal component analysis method, remote sensing data and geographic information technology. The characteristics of the spatio-temporal evolution of ecological vulnerability were also revealed. The results show that: (1) Through the analysis of principal component characteristics, elevation deviate degree, soil erosion degree, per capita area of cultivated farmland, annual average precipitation, and GDP per capita indices were the main factors affecting the ecological vulnerability of the study area. (2) The ecological vulnerability types in Jingle County were mainly composed of four types: slight, light, moderate and severe vulnerability. In 2007, it was mainly characterized by light vulnerability and moderate vulnerability, and in 2017 it was mainly characterized by moderate vulnerability and severe vulnerability. Spatially, the central area was more vulnerable than the surrounding area showing a declining trend from center to both sides of the middle part of the study area. (3) The total area of mutual shift between various types of ecological vulnerability was 662. 84 km(2) from 2007 to 2017. The mutual transfer was mainly happening for light and moderate vulnerability. The light vulnerability mainly shifted to moderate vulnerability and moderate vulnerability mainly shifted to severe vulnerability, with the transfer areas of 472. 90 and 187. 65 km(2), respectively. The basic trend of "light to moderate evolution, moderate to severe evolution" in space showed that the ecological situation was severe. (4) According to the characteristics of spatio-temporal evolution, the ecological restoration area, balance area and degradation area were divided. This study can provide scientific support and research ideas for the development of ecological restoration and governance in Jingle County and similar areas.

AB  - The main objective of this study to produce landslide susceptibility zones using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and support vector machine (SVM) data-driven models along the Tipari to Ghuttu highway corridors in the Garhwal Himalaya. A landslide inventory has been prepared through field surveys and LISS-IV and Landsat 8 satellite images. The datasets of 85 landslides were categorised into training and test sets. In this study 11 landslide conditioning variables were used that are; altitude, slope angle, aspect, plan curvature, topographic wetness index, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use, soil texture, distance to rivers, distance to faults, and distance to the road. The result produced using MaxEnt and SVM model were subsequently validated using receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) with test sets of landslide dataset. Both the models have good prediction capabilities. MaxEnt has ROC value of 0.78 while SVM has the highest prediction rate of 0.85.

TI  - Comparison of 4 Remote Sensing Drought Indexes for Drought Monitoring in Eastern Inner Mongolia
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern part of Inner Mongolia is a high-risk area for drought disasters, it is necessary to use remote sensing to monitor drought conditions. In order to study the applicability of different remote sensing drought indices in eastern Inner Mongolia, MODIS data in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia from late April to late September 2016 were used to calculate four commonly used remote sensing drought indices : temperature condition index (TCI), vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) and vegetation supply water index (VSWI), and compared with meteorological drought composite index (MCI) and soil relative humidity data. The results show that TCI and VCI had a large deviation in drought monitoring at the beginning of the growing season due to the different reviving periods. The drought indices were basically consistent with drought in the middle and late growth seasons. VCI and MCI had the highest correlation with soil relative humidity. The consistency of MCI with VCI and VSWI was higher in the middle and low coverage grassland, while the highest consistency with TCI was toward to the middle and high coverage grassland. Combined with the characteristics of various drought indices, VSWI is recommended for drought monitoring in eastern Inner Mongolia during the early growing season, and VCI or TCI is recommended for drought monitoring in the middle and late growth season.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the study described here, the capability of space-borne high-resolution L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images (ALOS-2/PALSAR2 data in StripMap SM1 mode) for deriving and mapping two components of the deformation of slow landslides has been investigated. The deformation characterization was carried out on the basis of sub-pixel correlation offset tracking techniques and differential SAR interferometry. On the Hell-Bourg landslide (located on La Reunion Island, with displacements up to about 1 m/year), the deformation maps produced performed significantly better than the C-band or lower-resolution SAR data used in previous studies. A comparison was carried out with Global Navigation Satellite System data acquired on the test site. Even with a reduced image set (seven acquisitions), detailed deformation maps and information on deformation evolution during 2014-2016 could be generated. The combination of L-band data and high resolution was the source of the improved performance provided by this new kind of data.

TI  - Detection of Temporal and Spatial Distributions of Atmospheric Nitric Acid Based on Ground-Based High-Resolution Solar Absorption Spectra
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the high-resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is used to detect the concentrations of nitric acid (HNO3) in the atmosphere above the Hefei site. The vertical profiles and total columns of HNO3 arc retrieved from the mid-infrared solar absorption spectra using the optimal estimation method. The vertical profiles and time series of the total columns of atmospheric HNO3 arc obtained over the entire year of 2017. Further, the characteristics of the seasonal variation of HNO3, sensitivity altitude of concentration detection, averaging kernels of retrieved profiles, and degrees of freedom arc analyzed. The vertical profiles of atmospheric HNO3 in different seasons denote that the HNO3 concentrations arc higher at an altitude of 20-30 km in the stratosphere and that they arc lower in the troposphere. Furthermore, the total columns of HNO3 exhibit obvious seasonal variations, with a maximum in spring and minimum in winter. The amplitude of the seasonal variations is 9.82 x 10(13) molecule/cm(2). The data products obtained from the Aura MLS satellite arc selected for performing comparison with the ground-based data to validate the measurements of the ground-based FTIR using independent data. The comparison results denote that the ground-based remote sensing and satellite observations display a consistent seasonal HNO3 variability. The ground-based data exhibits a good agreement with the satellite data with a high correlation coefficient of 0.83 even though the partial columns of the satellite data arc lower than the corresponding ground-based total columns. The observation results indicate the reliability and accuracy of the ground-based FTIR for observing the temporal and spatial distributions of the atmospheric HNO3.

TI  - Temporal evolution of temperatures in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden based on in situ observations (1958-2017)
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Red Sea holds one of the most diverse marine ecosystems in the world, although fragile and vulnerable to ocean warming. Several studies have analysed the spatio-temporal evolution of temperature in the Red Sea using satellite data, thus focusing only on the surface layer and covering the last similar to 30 years. To better understand the long-term variability and trends of temperature in the whole water column, we produce a 3-D gridded temperature product (TEMPERSEA) for the period 1958-2017, based on a large number of in situ observations, covering the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. After a specific quality control, a mapping algorithm based on optimal interpolation have been applied to homogenize the data. Also, an estimate of the uncertainties of the product has been generated. The calibration of the algorithm and the uncertainty computation has been done through sensitivity experiments based on synthetic data from a realistic numerical simulation.TEMPERSEA has been compared to satellite observations of sea surface temperature for the period 1981-2017, showing good agreement especially in those periods when a reasonable number of observations were available. Also, very good agreement has been found between air temperatures and reconstructed sea temperatures in the upper 100 m for the whole period 1958-2017, enhancing confidence in the quality of the product.The product has been used to characterize the spatiotemporal variability of the temperature field in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden at different timescales (seasonal, interannual and multidecadal). Clear differences have been found between the two regions suggesting that the Red Sea variability is mainly driven by air-sea interactions, while in the Gulf of Aden the lateral advection of water plays a relevant role. Regarding long-term evolution, our results show only positive trends above 40 m depth, with maximum trends of 0.045 + 0.016 degrees C decade(-1) at 15 m, and the largest negative trends at 125 m (-0.072+0.011 degrees C decade(-1)). Multidecadal variations have a strong impact on the trend computation and restricting them to the last 30-40 years of data can bias high the trend estimates.

TI  - Mapping LULC types in the Cerrado-Atlantic Forest ecotone region using a Landsat time series and object-based image approach: A case study of the Prata River Basin, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last 30 years, the growth of the agriculture and livestock industries in the Cerrado biome has caused severe changes in land use and land cover (LULC), and areas previously occupied by native vegetation are changing to agricultural monocultures (e.g., soybean or corn) and/or pastures. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the LULC changes for the years 1986, 1999, 2007, and 2016 based on Landsat time series and object-based image analysis (OBIA) for the Prata River Basin. Twelve LULC classes were mapped: riparian forest, cerrado, swampy grasslands, wetlands, semideciduous forest, pasture, agriculture, fallow agricultural land, barren land, eucalyptus, water bodies, and burnt area. The classifications presented results with an overall accuracy of more than 93% and a kappa coefficient of 0.92. In 2007, the pasture class had the highest increase in area (48.5%), with a total area of 118.32 km(2) of Cerrado biome vegetation converted to pasture, and the classes banhado, riparian forest, swampy grasslands, and cerrado had the greatest reductions in area (41.58%, 29.67%, 25.44%, and 21.63%, respectively). More precisely, the wetlands class underwent the greatest decrease under the advancement of pasture in the studied period (- 36.2%). These changes are due to factors favorable to agropastoral practices, such as a flat relief and soil with good agricultural suitability.Graphical abstract

TI  - Astaxanthin accumulation difference between non-motile cells and akinetes of <i>Haematococcus pluvialis</i> was affected by pyruvate metabolism
T2  - BIORESOURCES AND BIOPROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Haematococcus pluvialis is the best source of natural astaxanthin, known as the king of antioxidants. H. pluvialis have four cell forms: spore, motile cell, non-motile cell and akinete. Spores and motile cells are susceptible to photoinhibition and would die under photoinduction conditions. Photoinduction using non-motile cells as seeds could result in a higher astaxanthin production than that using akinetes. However, the mechanism of this phenomenon has not been clarified. Results Transcriptome was sequenced and annotated to illustrate the mechanism of this phenomenon. All differentially expressed genes involved in astaxanthin biosynthesis were up-regulated. Particularly, chyb gene was up-regulated by 16-fold, improving the conversion of beta-carotene into astaxanthin. Pyruvate was the precursor of carotenoids biosynthesis. Pyruvate kinase gene expression level was increased by 2.0-fold at the early stage of akinetes formation. More changes of gene transcription occurred at the early stage of akinetes formation, 52.7% and 51.9% of total DEGs in control group and treatment group, respectively. Conclusions Genes transcription network was constructed and the synthesis mechanism of astaxanthin was clarified. The results are expected to further guide the in-depth optimization of the astaxanthin production process in H. pluvialis by improving pyruvate metabolism.

TI  - Satellite Monitoring of Natural Reforestation Efforts in China's Drylands
T2  - ONE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification in Northern China degrades air quality in China's eastern cities by causing frequent dust storms. To stop desert expansion, China's government initiated the Three-North Shelterbelt Program, a large-scale reforestation project. Many issues with the project have been raised, from the choice of ill-adapted species to planting methods. Recently, the government implemented "natural reforestation''-closing former pastures to let vegetation regrow naturally. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to estimate the large-scale success of natural reforestation because measuring arid ecosystem productivity is a challenge for optical remote sensing. Here, we use satellite data to monitor vegetation water content and photosynthetic activity, thereby quantifying changes in vegetation biomass and productivity in Northern China. These satellite data corroborate official reforestation data. Our results show that vegetation activity is strongly correlated with both natural and traditional active reforestation, indicating opportunities for new natural reforestation techniques combined with satellite monitoring in other semi-arid regions.

TI  - Photovoltaic power station identification using refined encoder-decoder network with channel attention and chained residual dilated convolutions
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantity and distribution of photovoltaic power stations play an important role in policymaking related to clean energy. High-resolution satellite imagery with a wide field of view enables photovoltaic power station monitoring at low cost. The separability varies greatly due to distinct backgrounds in different regions, which makes photovoltaic power station identification a challenging task. We propose an end-to-end semantic segmentation network to identify photovoltaic power stations under multiple complex backgrounds in Gaofen 1 imageries. Our network adopts the encoder-decoder architecture in which three modules between the encoder and decoder are added, i.e., feature refinement residual module (FRRM), chained dilation attention module (CDAM), and global channel attention module (GCAM). FRRM uses the structure of residual connection to refine the features from each stage of the encoder. CDAM consisting of chained residual dilated convolutions with different dilation rates and channel attention can enlarge the receptive field without reducing image resolution and select useful features. GCAM utilizes high-level features containing rich semantic information as a guide to select more discriminative low-level features. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and the ability of the proposed network to improve photovoltaic power station identification under complex backgrounds.

TI  - Snow climatology in Lithuania based on the cloud-free moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer snow cover product
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover plays an important role in environmental, hydrological and climate systems. To monitor the inter-annual and seasonal variation of snow in Lithuania, daily moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products MOD10A1 and MYD10A1 were employed during the period from 2002 to 2018. The main disadvantage of the MODIS sensor is that it is unable to determine the surface conditions under cloud cover. In this study, a four-step procedure was implemented to remove clouds from the MODIS snow products and estimated the annual and monthly number of snow cover days (SCDs). The steps included a combination of MODIS data from Aqua and Terra satellites, spatial and temporal filtering of cloud covered pixels. Additional daily minimum temperature control filter helped to reduce the misclassification snow errors. The final daily cloud-free MODIS snow maps showed an overall accuracy of 89% when compared with manual ground observations. The lowest validation scores were determined on the Baltic Sea coast, where snow cover is ephemeral, and the highest scores were in the eastern part of the country where the climate is continental. The MODIS-based SCD had larger relative errors in autumn, smaller errors in spring and very good agreement with the in situ observations in the middle of winter. Although the generated cloud-free MODIS snow cover product tended to overestimate the annual SCD on average by 8.5 days, we consider it adequate to describe the inter-annual and monthly variation of snow cover in Lithuania.

TI  - Papillary breast cancer: A retrospective single-centre clinical study
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Papillary carcinoma (PC) of the breast is a rare malignancy that accounts for 0.5%-1% of breast cancers. PC remains an understudied cancer, and we still require further information on its behaviour, staging and management. In particular, a significant proportion of PC cases still undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy without clear empirical justification. In the present study, we provide a valuable cohort of 44 PC patients and examine the clinicopathological features and outcome of loco-regional staging. Our results provide important insights into the behaviour of PC and suggest SLNB may be spared in this condition. Crucially, we show only one histologically confirmed PC case had evidence of nodal metastasis. In addition, up to 5 years postsurgery, no patient in our cohort died from their cancer. Together, our results support further work in the utility of SLNB in PC and highlight the favourable prognosis of this tumour. We propose SLNB should not be routinely indicated for patients with PC treated with breast conservation, and future studies should aim to incorporate prospective data to help inform optimal management of PC.

TI  - Microalbuminuria: a sentinel of neurocognitive impairment in HIV-infected individuals?
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background According to population-based studies, microalbuminuria is associated with subsequent cognitive decline over a 4-6-year period, because of cerebral small-vessel disease (CSVD). This prospective cross-sectional study (NCT02852772) was designed to evaluate whether a history of microalbuminuria is associated with subsequent cognitive decline in combined antiretroviral therapy (cART)-treated persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIVs). Methods From our computerized medical database, we identified 30 PLHIVs (median age 52 years), immunovirologically controlled on cART, who had microalbuminuria in 2008 and had undergone, between 2013 and 2015, a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment (NPA) including seven domains (cases): information-processing speed, motor skills, executive functions, attention/working memory, learning/memory, reasoning and verbal fluency. Forty-nine PLHIVs matched for age (median age 48 years; p = 0.19), sex, and year of first HIV-seropositivity without microalbuminuria in 2008 were identified and underwent the same NPA between 2013 and 2015 (controls). Results Cases performed less well than controls for information-processing speed (p = 0.01) and motor skills (p = 0.02), but no differences were found for the other cognitive domains and global z-scores. A multivariable linear-regression model adjusted for confounding factors confirmed the microalbuminuria effect for the information-processing-speed z score. Conclusion cART-treated PLHIVs with a history of microalbuminuria subsequently had worse cognitive performances for the information-processing-speed domain, possibly because of CSVD. Our observations should be considered preliminary findings of a temporal link between microalbuminuria, CSVD, and subsequent cognitive impairment.

TI  - Working toward Global Justice: Confucian and Christian Ethics in Dialogue
T2  - DAO-A JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Faced with the ongoing tragedy of poverty in our world today, many have long called for a common standard of global justice. Such a standard should not be tied to any one particular strand of justice conceptualizations and it should yet be in harmony with the central motivating beliefs of the various concerned moral worldviews. The article reframes global justice thinking by approaching a core problem, namely motivating people to care for distant needy strangers, in a concrete intercultural manner: it sets out to study and compare the motivational underpinnings for an expansion of social justice, in an exemplary fashion, within two long-standing worldview traditions, namely Christian social ethics and contemporary Confucian ethics, in order to gain a more realistic impression of what a commonly shared and motivationally backed notion of global justice may look like. While the former expresses a universal concern for the poor, the latter has recently attracted interest, since Southeast Asian countries managed to lift millions of people out of abject poverty. As both traditions consider loving communal relationships to constitute the foundation of all justice considerations, the article inquires how this quest shapes each tradition's way to motivate their adherents' compliance with a vision of global justice.

TI  - Long-term changes of surface albedo and vegetation indices in north of Iran
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is a key parameter in earth energy budget and global climate change studies. In this aspect, variation in vegetation covers is one of the most critical issues affecting global energy balance. The present study is conducted to examine the relationship between changes in vegetation cover (by using NDVI and EVI indices) and changes in surface albedo. Using qualified MODIS data, mean annual albedo variations (during the growing season) and their relation with the changes in NDVI and EVI values in 6 climate zones are investigated for the period of 2004 to 2016. The results show that the lowest variations of albedo are observed in the region with SH-C-VW climate and the highest in the SA-C-W climate. With the exception of A-C-W and SA-C-W climates, the absolute value of the Pearson correlation coefficient between albedo and EVI is stronger than NDVI. Hot spots of temperature and precipitation are detected by employing daily measurements of 17 weather stations to find the relationship with the changes in surface albedo. According to the results, surface albedo has increased during the study period in majority of the weather sites. Generally, increase in surface albedo was evident for 61% of the study area, while decreases were detected in 30% and no significant changes in the remaining areas. Also, except for SH-C-VW climate, albedo has experienced an increasing trend in all climates from April to September. The major albedo declines are found in the Hyrcanian forests, where higher vegetation cover is confirmed by Iran Forests, Range and Watershed Management National Organization. Examining the hot spots in temperature and precipitation reveals that the reduction of albedo (due to the increase in vegetation cover) in the areas coincides with more rainfall in the region. In contrast, higher temperatures were observed for areas with the decreased vegetation cover.

TI  - Decadal climatology of the spatial and vertical distributions of tropospheric aerosol over the Arabian Sea based on satellite observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The climatology of aerosol optical properties is retrieved and analysed for the period from June 2006 to November 2017 over the Arabian Sea from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) onboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Aqua satellite. Strong seasonality and latitudinal gradients in the columnar aerosol optical depth, dust aerosol optical depth (DOD) over the Arabian Sea are observed. Most of the aerosols over the North Arabian Sea (NAS) and the Central Arabian Sea are confined to the surface (i.e., 0-3 km). However, the seasonal mean high extinction coefficient is found during summer over the Arabian Sea. The high vertical extent of aerosols (with higher extinction coefficient) at altitudes >4 km emphasizes the continental aerosol effluence from the southwestern peninsular Indian subcontinent during winter, spring and autumn seasons. The contribution of dust extinction coefficient to the total columnar DOD has been observed to be high over NAS (>35%) at 0-1 km altitude bin during all the seasons and it is lowest (<15%) at the altitude range of 5-6 km. Dust fraction (DF) shows a clear latitudinal variation with a peak over NAS and diminishes towards SAS. The highest DF is observed over NAS during spring (82%) even though the dust extinction coefficient attained maximum during summer (0.81 +/- 0.07 km(-1)). This is due to the strong westerly winds over NAS from the coast of Oman during spring. A positive difference between DF derived from MODIS and CALIPSO is noticed, and it might be due to the limitation of MODIS in discriminating the aerosol and the cloud from its passive sensor reliable than an active sensor like lidar in CALIPSO. The outcomes of the present study will serve as a reliable source for future studies of dust-regional scale climate interactions over the Arabian Sea.

TI  - Different Starting Dominant Strain of Seasonal Influenza in China and Other Neighboring Asian Countries in 2019-2020 Winter Season
T2  - CHINA CDC WEEKLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Seasonal influenza is a prevalent and highly contagious acute respiratory disease that causes a major global disease burden. New strains of influenza viruses also have the potential to cause an influenza pandemic. Due to the high variability and the consequent uncertainty about virus strains, the prevention and control of influenza are faced with many challenges. Surveillance is considered a key strategy to lead to the prevention and control of influenza, and influenza is one of first infectious diseases to be monitored globally.Methods: The Chinese National Influenza Surveillance Network conducts routine influenza surveillance and includes 410 network laboratories and 554 sentinel hospitals based on the requirements of National Influenza Surveillance Guidelines. China and other countries submit epidemiological and virological data to the WHO FluMart database, which can be viewed online.Results: Seasonal influenza H3N2 virus was the dominant subtype in China when entering the 2019-2020 winter influenza season, while neighboring countries such as Japan and Republic of Korea reported the dominance of H1N1pdm09 and Mongolia and Russia reported a higher proportion of type B virus than type A virus.Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Asian countries entered the 2019-2020 winter influenza season with different type/subtypes of influenza virus dominant in different areas. Influenza surveillance needs to be strengthened to closely monitor changes in the antigenicity and genetic characteristics of emerging viruses.

TI  - distantia: an open-source toolset to quantify dissimilarity between multivariate ecological time-series
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a large array of methods to extract knowledge and perform ecological forecasting from ecological time-series. However, in spite of its importance for data-mining, pattern-matching and ecological synthesis, methods to assess their similarity are scarce. We introduce distantia (v1.0.1), an R package providing general toolset to quantify dissimilarity between ecological time-series, independently of their regularity and number of samples. The functions in distantia provide the means to compute dissimilarity scores by time and by shape and assess their significance, evaluate the partial contribution of each variable to dissimilarity, and align or combine sequences by similarity. We evaluate the sensitivity of the dissimilarity metrics implemented in distantia, describe its structure and functionality, and showcase its applications with two examples. Particularly, we evaluate how geographic factors drive the dissimilarity between nine pollen sequences dated to the Last Interglacial, and compare the temporal dynamics of climate and enhanced vegetation index of three stands across the range of the European beech. We expect this package may enhance the capabilities of researchers from different fields to explore dissimilarity patterns between multivariate ecological time-series, and aid in generating and testing new hypotheses on why the temporal dynamics of complex-systems changes over space and time.

TI  - Assessment of forest cover and carbon stock changes in sub-tropical pine forest of Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK), Pakistan using multi-temporal Landsat satellite data and field inventory
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed at estimating temporal (1989-2018) change in forest cover, carbon stock and trend in corresponding CO2 emissions/sequestration of a sub-tropical pine forest (STPF) in AJK, Pakistan. Our field inventory estimation shows an average above ground biomass (AAGB) accumulation of 0.145 Kt/ha with average carbon stock (ACS) value of 0.072 Kt/ha. Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI images of 1989, 1993, 1999, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018 were used to extract vegetation fractions through Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis (LSMA) and forest area was calculated for respective years. Based on the forest area and estimated ACS value, the biomass carbon stock with corresponding CO2 emissions/sequestration was worked out for each time and change in forest carbon stock was determined for different time periods from 1989 to 2018. Our analysis shows net increase of 561 ha in forest cover and 40.39 Kt of ACS along with increase in corresponding CO2 sequestrations of 147.83 Kt over the study period. The results based on combination of remote sensing and field inventory provide valuable information and scientific basis to plan and ensure sustainable forest management (SFM) through reforestation, protection and conservation to enhance and maintain adequate forest cover and reduce CO2 emissions.

TI  - Soil erosion risk assessment in the Umzintlava catchment (T32E), Eastern Cape, South Africa, using RUSLE and random forest algorithm
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), based on remotely sensed data, is an important tool for assessing erosion prone areas and serves as a guide towards soil conservation efforts. Besides being a crucial data source from which RUSLE parameters can be derived, remotely sensed data can also be used independently to delineate erosion features. This study aims to assess soil erosion risk in the Umzintlava catchment using two independent methods, i.e. RUSLE and Random Forest (RF), and explore the relationship between soil loss and erosion factors as represented by different RUSLE parameters. To achieve this, rainfall, soil, digital elevation, and satellite data were used. The results indicate that a considerable portion (>90%) of the catchment area is of 'very low' to 'low' erosion risk, while the remainder suffers 'moderate' to 'extremely high' erosion risk. Among erosion factors, the LS-factor (slope length and steepness) showed strong correlation with soil erosion (p < 0.001; R-2 = 0.954). This suggests that areas with steep slopes are the most vulnerable to hillslope erosion, whereas gully erosion is prominent in areas with gentle to nearly flat slopes. The integration of RUSLE-derived soil loss and RF-derived erosion features successfully delineated the spatial patterns of soil erosion across the Umzintlava catchment, providing useful information on erosion risk at least costs. This information is instrumental in targeted management interventions to combat soil erosion within the catchment.

TI  - The Rise of Far-Right Civilizationism
T2  - CRITICAL SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years the rise of far-right politics in North America and Europe has called into question the stability and cohesion of the so-called liberal international order. Scholars and commentators have argued that this swelling configuration of reactionary social forces threatens the future of western hegemony within a 21st century global capitalism. This essay reflects on the role of transnational organizations, organic intellectuals and elite actors in shaping the modern far-right movement. This essay will discuss the rise of a transnational ideology of the contemporary far-right which I call 'far-right civilizationism'. This far-right 'hegemonic project' seeks to challenge the centrist global governance model of 'neoliberal cosmopolitanism', which has been dominant in the West since the end of the Cold War. The reactionary worldview of far-right civilizationism represents an alternative elite grand strategy for world order, purposed to refurbish elite hegemony during a period of profound structural crisis.

TI  - Object-Based Thermal Remote-Sensing Analysis for Fault Detection in Mashhad County, Iran
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) and soil moisture are important factors in environmental hazard modeling. The main objective of this research is to derive the LST and a soil moisture index (SMI) from thermal satellite images. A split-window algorithm is applied to derive the spectral radiance and emissivity from two thermal infrared (TIR) bands of the Landsat 8 satellite in four consecutive years (2015-2018) to serve as input for the LST analysis. First, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is computed from which an emissivity index is calculated using an object-based threshold technique. This is followed by the calculation of the LST via a split-window algorithm. Subsequently, the SMI is modeled to reflect the relationship between the surface temperature and the vegetation cover. A spatial analysis investigates the relationship between the LST and SMI with known geological faults. The results indicate that the areas with low-temperature and high-moisture overlap with fault zones. The authors discuss to what degree fault zones can be detected or predicted based on LST and SMI.

TI  - Calculation Algorithm of Upward Longwave Radiation Based on Surface Types
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Upward longwave radiation (ULR) is an important element for climate change analysis. We calculated ULR using land surface temperature (LST), sea surface temperature (SST), and downward longwave radiation (DLR) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), along with broadband emissivity calculated using four multiple linear regression models designed to consider specific land-cover categories along with MODIS data and reflectivity data for 241 materials from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). Our broadband emissivity values were compared with those of Wang et al. Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 110(D11), (2005); all correlation coefficients were higher than 0.90 for the period from January to December 2016, and the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.00750-0.00825. We then calculated ULR using the broadband emissivity and compared the results with CERES data, resulting in smaller errors relative to CERES than found by Wang et al. (2005). Furthermore, the calculated ULR compared with the observational data of Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and the resultant statistical values of R(correlation coefficient), RMSE, and bias were 0.93, 21.22 W m(-2), and 0.29 respectively.

TI  - Initial results of a novel technique of clipped node localization in breast cancer patients postneoadjuvant chemotherapy: Skin Mark clipped Axillary nodes Removal Technique (SMART trial)
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Removal of clipped nodes can improve sentinel node biopsy accuracy in breast cancer patients post neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). However, the current methods of clipped node localization have limitations. We evaluated the feasibility of a novel clipped node localization and removal technique by preoperative skin marking of clipped nodes and removal by the Skin Mark clipped Axillary nodes Removal Technique (SMART), with the secondary aim of assessing the ultrasound visibility of the various clips in the axillary nodes after NACT. Methods Invasive breast cancer patients with histologically metastatic axillary nodes, going for NACT, and <= 3 sonographically abnormal axillary nodes were recruited. All abnormal nodes had clips inserted. Patients with M1 disease were excluded. Post-NACT, patients underwent SMART and axillary lymph node dissection. Specimen radiography and pathological analyses were performed to confirm the clipped node presence. Success, complication rates of SMART, and ultrasound visibility of the various clips were assessed. Results Twenty-five clipped nodes in 14 patients underwent SMART without complications. The UltraCor Twirl, hydroMARK, UltraClip Dual Trigger, and UltraClip were removed in 13/13 (100%), 7/9 (77.8%), 1/2 (50.0%), and 0/1 (0%), respectively (P = .0103) with UltraCor Twirl having the best ultrasound visibility and removal rate. Removal of three clipped nodes in the same patient (P = .0010) and deeply seated clipped nodes (P = .0167) were associated with SMART failure. Conclusion Skin Mark clipped Axillary nodes Removal Technique is feasible for removing clipped nodes post-NACT, with 100% observed success rate, using the UltraCor Twirl marker in patients with <3 not deeply seated clipped nodes. Larger studies are needed for validation.

TI  - Estimation of Semiarid Forest Canopy Cover Using Optimal Field Sampling and Satellite Data with Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy cover represents different characteristics of forest stands. However, especially in semiarid forest, the estimation of canopy cover by field measurements is too expensive. Therefore, it is necessary to develop appropriate techniques to estimate forest canopy cover for forest management in semiarid areas. In this research, a robust procedure to estimate canopy cover using stratification field sampling and AdaBoostM(1) machine learning algorithm with Landsat 8 OLI imagery is suggested. Approximately 29,000 ha of semiarid forest (Manesht- and Ghelarang-protected area) in west of Iran was selected as the study area. The unsupervised classification was used on NDVI layer extracted from OLI data, and Neyman method was applied for allocation, in stratified areas. The crown cover was measured in percentage in each plot. In inaccessible plots, the optical satellite imagery of Worldview-2 from Google Earth database was used (0.46 m spatial resolution). For the classification of canopy cover, the AdaBoostM1 algorithm with random forest classifier was trained by 75% split original data, while 25% remaining data were used for accuracy assessment using ROC curve, true positive (TP), false positive (FP), overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (K). The results showed the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 91% and 0.88, respectively. Based on the results, the methodology developed in this study is suitable to estimate canopy cover in semiarid forests.

T2  - CONTRAST MEDIA & MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent developments in sentinel lymph node (SLN) and radio occult lesion localization (ROLL) highlight the need for a multimodal contrast agent, providing better presurgical PET imaging and improved intraoperative mapping thanks to fluorescence detection. For this reason, we have studied a trimodal SLN/ROLL targeting agent (Tc-99m-Ga-68-ICG) with commercially available kits of macroaggregated or nanocolloidal albumin (MA/NC-HSA). Ga-68 PET imaging does provide better spatial resolution and makes it possible to predict signal intensity during surgery. The presence of Tc-99m assesses the efficacy of these compounds in vitro and also during the surgery procedure. The aim of this study was to optimise the labelling and tagging of these two radiopharmaceuticals and assess their yields and stability. Kits of MA/NC-HSA particles (Pulmocis (R) and NanoAlbumon (R)) were used for sequential radiolabelling with Tc-99m and Ga-68. Fluorescent tagging was performed using indocyanine green, a tricarbocyanine dye. The ITLC radiochemical purity of the trilabelled MA/NC-HSA was >95%. Fluorescent purity was measured by scanning the strips with a PhotoDynamicEye probe. Finally, in vitro stability tests, performed with DTPA and human serum solutions, assessed the efficacy of fluorescent tagging and radiolabelling.

TI  - Quantitative monitoring of leaf area index in wheat of different plant types by integrating NDVI and Beer-Lambert law
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is one of the most important vegetation indices in crop remote sensing. It features a simple, fast, and non-destructive method and has been widely used in remote monitoring of crop growing status. Beer-Lambert law is widely used in calculating crop leaf area index (LAI), however, it is time-consuming detection and low in output. Our objective was to improve the accuracy of monitoring LAI through remote sensing by integrating NDVI and Beer-Lambert law. In this study, the Beer-Lambert law was firstly modified to construct a monitoring model with NDVI as the independent variable. Secondly, experimental data of wheat from different years and various plant types (erectophile, planophile and middle types) was used to validate the modified model. The results showed that at 130 DAS (days after sowing), the differences in NDVI, leaf area index (LAI) and extinction coefficient (k) of the three plant types with significantly different leaf orientation values (LOVs) reached the maximum. The NDVI of the planophile-type wheat reached saturation earlier than that of the middle and erectophile types. The undetermined parameters of the model (LAI=-ln (a(1)xNDVI+b(1))/(a(2)xNDVI+b(2))) were related to the plant type of wheat. For the erectophile-type cultivars (LOV >= 60 degrees), the parameters for the modified model were, a(1)=0.306, a(2)=-0.534, b(1)=-0.065, and b(2)=0.541. For the middle-type cultivars (30 degrees <LOV<60 degrees), the parameters were, a(1)=0.392, a(2)=-0.88(1), b(1)=0.028, and b(2)=0.845. And for the planophile-type cultivars (LOV <= 30 degrees), those parameters were, a(1)=0.596, a(2)=-1.306, b(1)=0.014, and b(2)=1.130. Verification proved that the modified model based on integrating NDVI and Beer-Lambert law was better than Beer-Lambert law model only or NDVI-LAI direct model only. It was feasible to quantitatively monitor the LAI of different plant-type wheat by integrating NDVI and Beer-Lambert law, especially for erectophile-type wheat (R-2=0.905, RMSE=0.36, RE=0.10). The monitoring model proposed in this study can accurately reflect the dynamic changes of plant canopy structure parameters, and provides a novel method for determining plant LAI.

M3  - Article
AB  - A crisis we face is that moral character seems to be declining in significance in everyday life and is not particularly relevant in evaluations of current political leaders. A case for character, however, can be mounted through the study of moral exemplars; in demonstrating that character is a viable construct and not an artifact of situational factors, that it explains more of moral functioning than cognition alone, and that it is causally operative in moral action. Aspects of the character of exemplary moral character can be found, for example, in the integrated motivation of agency and communion, the positive framing of life events, an expanded worldview, and beneficial early-life experiences. This better-grounded understanding of character can serve to expand the moral domain, enhance intervention efforts, and promote a more civil and caring society.

TI  - Preoperative Ultrasound-guided Core Biopsy of Axillary Nodes for Staging of Clinically Negative Axilla in Breast Cancer Patients - A Pilot Study
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe aim of the current study is to determine the feasibility and accuracy of ultrasound-guided core biopsy for staging the axilla in clinically node-negative patients with invasive breast cancer.IntroductionHistorically, in breast cancer patients, axillary lymph node dissection was performed to stage axilla. Because of the high morbidity of axillary lymph node dissection, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) became the standard of care in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer. However, SLNB is expensive, time consuming, can cause morbidity and can be complicated by seroma formation, sensory nerve injury, lymphedema, etc. Many centers rely on the availability of frozen section on sentinel lymph nodes to avoid a second procedure with the accuracy of procedure ranging from 73 to 96%, however, the availability of frozen section is limited in our part of the world. Pre-operative identification of axillary node positivity in patients with clinically negative nodes by ultrasound imaging of the axilla would allow onestage axillary clearance and can decrease the need for SLNB from 21% to 70%. The aim of the present study is to determine the accuracy and feasibility of ultrasound-guided core biopsy to stage the axilla in clinically node-negative breast cancer patients, comparing with final histopathology as gold standard.Material & methodsThis was a non randomized, prospective interventional study, done at Radiology Department of Aga Khan University Hospital. All patients diagnosed with breast cancer (histologically proven) with clinically negative axilla and ipsilateral positive axillary ultrasound were included. These patients underwent axillary lymph node core biopsy. If the result was negative they were subjected to SLNB. Histopathology result was taken as gold standard.ResultsThe sensitivity of ultrasound-guided core biopsy was 88%, specificity 100%, positive predictive values (PPV) 100%, negative predictive values (NPV) 89.28%, diagnostic accuracy 94%.ConclusionIn conclusion, the present study demonstrated high accuracy of ultrasound-guided axillary lymph node core biopsy in breast cancer patients with clinically node-negative axilla. Positive core biopsy results can thus obviate the need for sentinel lymph node biopsy and allow breast surgeons to directly proceed to axillary lymph node dissection.

TI  - A High-Precision Flat Field Method Based on Image Stitching for Short Wavelength Instruments
T2  - SOLAR PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a method to obtain a large-scale flat field using only small offsets. The method is derived from the Kuhn, Lin, and Loranz (KLL) algorithm (Publ. Astron. Soc. Pacific103, 1097, 1991), but combined with the image stitching technique. Due to complementary images, which optimize and replace the bad edges, the accuracy is better than 0.1 root mean square across the full field of view, and the pixel-level relative error is also better than 0.1%. Another significant advantage is that its small sampling interval provides a rapid sampling time, while maintaining a large-scale and high-precision flat field (beyond 95% proportion). We have proved its high efficiency and robustness by simulating a cosine and a Gaussian CCD response and comparing the results with the KLL algorithm. Finally, a visible non-uniform target experiment with a uniform response was performed to prepare for the upcoming solar X-ray Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (X-EUVI) instrument on the FengYun-3 (FY-3) weather satellite series.

TI  - Mapping Snowmelt Progression in the Upper Indus Basin With Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indus River is a vital resource for food security, ecosystem services, hydropower, and economy for millions of people living in Pakistan, India, China, and Afghanistan. Glacier and snowmelt from the high altitude Himalaya, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush mountain ranges are the largest drivers of discharge in the upper Indus Basin (UIB), and contribute significantly to Indus flows. Complex climatology and topography, coupled with the challenges of field study and meteorological measurement in these rugged ranges, elicit notable uncertainties in predicting seasonal runoff as well as cryospheric response to changes in climate. Here we utilize Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to track ablation season development of wet snow in the Shigar Watershed of the Karakoram Mountains in Pakistan from 2015 to 2018. We exploit opportune local image acquisition times to highlight diurnal differences in radar indications of wet snow, and examine the spatial and temporal contexts of radar diurnal differences for 2015, 2017, and 2018 ablation seasons. Radar classifications for each ablation season show spatial and temporal patterns that indicate a dry winter snowpack undergoing diurnal surface melt-refreeze cycles, transitioning to surface snow that remains wet both day and night, and finally snow free conditions following melt out. Diurnally differing SAR signals may offer insights into important snowpack energy balance processes that precede melt out, which could provide useful constraints for both glacier mass balance modeling and runoff forecasting in remote alpine watersheds.

TI  - Vegetation and hydrogeomorphic features of a large lowland river: NDVI patterns summarizing fluvial dynamics and supporting interpretations of ecological patterns
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The interactions among hydrogeomorphic features of large lowland rivers regulate the spatio-temporal fluvial dynamics and influence the occurrence and understanding of the ecological patterns in these systems. We studied the hydrogeomorphic features that explain the fluvial dynamics of the Parana River floodplain and investigated the usefulness of NDVI patterns in summarizing these dynamics. Information layers related to elevation, drainage network, geomorphic units, runoff dynamics, and NDVI patterns of the study area were generated from multi-source remote sensing data and fieldwork measurements. All these layers were integrated and analysed in a GIS environment, and the statistical association among them was corroborated. In our study area, the interaction among hydrogeomorphic features determined a centrifugal flooding pattern through which inundation occurs when water from remote courses, fluvial lakes, and secondary tributaries reaches the main channel. The areas closest to the main channel are flooded only when it overflows. Five NDVI patterns statistically different in terms of their means and standard deviations were identified and characterized. These NDVI patterns were significantly associated with elevation, geomorphic units, and runoff dynamics, highlighting their usefulness to characterize the fluvial dynamics and support understanding of the ecological patterns.

TI  - Vegetation productivity summarized by the Dynamic Habitat Indices explains broad-scale patterns of moose abundance across Russia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the factors that determine habitat suitability and hence patterns of wildlife abundances over broad spatial scales is important for conservation. Ecosystem productivity is a key aspect of habitat suitability, especially for large mammals. Our goals were to a) explain patterns of moose (Alces alces) abundance across Russia based on remotely sensed measures of vegetation productivity using Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs), and b) examine if patterns of moose abundance and productivity differed before and after the collapse of the Soviet Union. We evaluated the utility of the DHIs using multiple regression models predicting moose abundance by administrative regions. Univariate models of the individual DHIs had lower predictive power than all three combined. The three DHIs together with environmental variables, explained 79% of variation in moose abundance. Interestingly, the predictive power of the models was highest for the 1980s, and decreased for the two subsequent decades. We speculate that the lower predictive power of our environmental variables in the later decades may be due to increasing human influence on moose densities. Overall, we were able to explain patterns in moose abundance in Russia well, which can inform wildlife managers on the long-term patterns of habitat use of the species.

TI  - Anthropogenic and lightning-started fires are becoming larger and more frequent over a longer season length in the USA
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Over the past several decades, wildfires have become larger, more frequent, and/or more severe in many areas. Simultaneously, anthropogenic ignitions are steadily growing. We have little understanding of how increasing anthropogenic ignitions are changing modern fire regimes. Location Conterminous United States. Time period 1984-2016. Major taxa studied Vegetation. Methods We aggregated fire radiative power (FRP)-based fire intensity, event size, burned area, frequency, season length, and ignition type data from > 1.8 million government records and remote sensing data at a 50-km resolution. We evaluated the relationship between fire physical characteristics and ignition type to determine if and how modern U.S.A. fire regimes are changing sensu stricto given increased anthropogenic ignitions, and how those patterns vary over space and time. Results At a national scale, wildfires occur over longer fire seasons (17% increase) and have become larger (78%) and more frequent (12%), but not necessarily more intense. Further, human ignitions have increased 9% proportionally. The proportion of human ignitions has a negative relationship with fire size and FRP and a positive relationship with fire frequency and season length. Areas dominated by lightning ignitions experience fires that are 2.4 times more intense and 9.2 times larger. Areas dominated by human ignitions experience fires that are twice as frequent and have a fire season that is 2.4 times longer. The effect of human ignitions on fire characteristics varies regionally. Ecoregions in the eastern U.S.A. and in some parts of the coastal western U.S.A. have no areas dominated by lightning ignitions. For the remaining ecoregions, more intense and larger fires are associated with lightning ignitions, and longer season lengths are associated with human ignitions. Main conclusions Increasing anthropogenic ignitions - in tandem with climate and land cover change - are contributing to a 'new normal' of fire activity across continental scales.

TI  - Mapping mangrove in Dongzhaigang, China using Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves not only protect the coastline from ocean waves and storms but also provide economical, ecological, and social functions for the human being. Despite the important role mangrove plays, mangrove has suffered great loss over the past decades. Mapping the mangrove extent is essential for its conservation. We examined the potential of original bands, spectral indices, including combined mangrove recognition index (CMRI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and principal component analysis (PCA) of Sentinel-2 to map the mangrove of Dongzhaigang, China in June 2019. Random forest (RF) approach was adopted for the image classification. Results showed that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the image classification can achieve 90.47% and 0.86. The area of mangrove of Dongzhaigang, China in June 2019 is 17.83 km(2). The importance of each variable was calculated and among all the 15 variables, the CMRI ranked first, followed by NDVI, band 3 (green), band 2 (blue), and PCA1 (the first principal component) in turn. Based on the results, we can conclude that vegetation indices and PCA are essential for mangrove extent mapping since the variable importance of these features are relatively higher in the ranking of mean decrease Gini. Also band 3 (green band) provides important information for distinguishing mangrove from land and water class. Furthermore, combining vegetation indices, PCA, and RF model can accurately delineate the extent of mangrove. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

TI  - Land use transitions and the associated impacts on ecosystem services in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt in China based on the geo-informatic Tupu method
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization in China has greatly exacerbated land use transitions (LUTs), which seriously threaten the ecosystem. The existing literature lacks information on the spatio-temporal analysis of LUTs, and assessments of ecosystem services remain incomplete. This lack of information may limit the formation and implementation of landscape plans and ecologically oriented policies. This study attempts to fill this gap by analysing the geographic features of LUTs with the geo-informatic Tupu method and exploring the responses of ecosystem services to LUTs. A newly revised benefit transfer method that utilizes the land use/land cover change data derived from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (MRYREB) is implemented. The results indicate that the area of construction land continued to increase markedly, while the area of cultivated land declined continuously from 1995 to 2015. This increase in construction land was mainly derived from the occupation of cultivated land. The Tupu units of "forestland > cultivated land," "cultivated land > forestland," "cultivated land -> water area," and "water area -> cultivated land" were the dominant driving forces of the changes in ecosystem services value (ESV) in the MRYREB. Hotspots of ESV changes were mainly located in the surrounding mountainous areas during 1995-2005 and 2005-2010, while the coldspots during 2010-2015 were mainly located in the plains. The findings in this study have important implications for ecosystem conservation, ecological function zoning, ecological compensation decision-making, and related land development in the MRYREB.

TI  - Restricted water allocations: Landscape-scale energy balance simulations and adjustments in agricultural water applications
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Research that incorporates information from satellites into conventional biophysical models has great importance and interest. Comprehensive crop water algorithms can help track crop stress, schedule irrigation, and acquire water right information for effective water management and increased productivity in semi-arid and arid environments. Overall objective was to utilize the automated biophysical surface energy balance model BAITSSS (Backward-Averaged Iterative Two-Source Surface temperature and energy balance Solution) to understand critical agricultural water management issues. BAITSSS served as an advanced digital landscape crop water tracker and irrigation scheduler to simulate hourly landscape evapotranspiration (ET) at 30 m spatial resolution. North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) weather data and Landsat-based vegetation indices were inputs of BAITSSS to simulate surface energy balance components along with irrigation (I-rr). Two agricultural-dominated groundwater regions of northwest Kansas, USA within a section of the Ogallala aquifer were studied during a five-year period (2013-2017). We compared model-simulated irrigation to reported within water right management units (WRMU). The sum of reported irrigation and precipitation (P), representing inseason water supply, was also compared to model simulated ET as an indicator of well-watered ET. The model was able to simulate reasonably ET values, and irrigation quantities, and to differentiate various spatial distribution patterns of crops within WRMU. However, unknown water management, within WRMU, constrained explicit inference of actual ET and irrigation amounts. The model appears suitable for quantifying the upper bound of in-season water supply (irrigation plus P) expected for well-watered crops in the U.S. Central High Plains. A WRMU exhibiting significantly different in-season water supply than the simulated ET may present opportunities to modify irrigation rates or to gain inference about deficit irrigation.

TI  - A metropolitan scale water management analysis of the food-energy-water nexus
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the interactions of the food-energy-water (FEW) nexus is crucial to support new policies for the conjunctive management of the three resources. Currently, our understanding of FEW systems in metropolitan regions is limited. Here, we quantify and model FEW interactions in the metropolitan area of Phoenix, Arizona, using the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) platform. In this region, the FEW nexus has changed over the last thirty years due to a dramatic population growth and a sharp decline of cultivated land. We first thoroughly test the ability of WEAP to simulate water allocation to the municipal, agricultural, industrial, power plant, and Indian sectors against historical (1985-2009) data. We then apply WEAP under possible future (2010-2069) scenarios of water and energy demand and supply, as well as food production. We find that, if the current decreasing trend of agricultural water demand continues in the future, groundwater use will diminish by similar to 23% and this would likely result in aquifer safe-yield and reduce the energy demand for water. If agricultural activities decrease at a lower rate or a multidecadal drought occurs, additional (from 7% to 33%) water from energy-intensive sources will be needed. This will compromise the ability to reach safe-yield and increase energy demand for water up to 15%. In contrast, increasing the fraction of energy produced by solar power plants will likely guarantee safe-yield and reduce energy demand of 2%. This last solution, based on an expanded renewable portfolio and current trends of municipal and agricultural water demand, is also projected to have the most sustainable impacts on the three resources. Our analytical approach to model FEW interconnectivities quantitatively supports stakeholder engagement and could be transferable to other metropolitan regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Estimation of maize yield by assimilating biomass and canopy cover derived from hyperspectral data into the AquaCrop model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and timely estimation of temporal and spatial changes in crop growth and yield before harvesting is essential for ensuring global food security. The integration of remote sensing data and crop models is a potential approach for the estimation of key crop growth parameters and crop yields. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assimilate biomass and canopy cover (CC) derived from vegetation indices into the AquaCrop model using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in order to obtain a more accurate estimation of CC, biomass, and yield for maize. The results show that, compared to other vegetation indices, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the three-band water index (TBWI) can be used to obtain a better estimation of CC (R-2 = 0.78 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) =9.84%) and biomass (R-2 = 0.76 and RMSE = 2.84 ton/ha), respectively. Additionally, it was found that the data assimilation approaches in which only CC was used as a state variable (scheme SVcc) and only biomass was used as a state variable (scheme SVbio) can be used to obtain more accurate estimations of CC (R-2 = 0.83 and RMSE = 8.12%) and biomass (R-2 = 0.81 and RMSE = 2.51 ton/ha), respectively; however, larger differences were found between the measured and estimated values of one variable (i.e., CC or biomass) when the other variable (i.e., biomass or CC) was used as the only state variable during the data assimilation. The data assimilation approach in which both CC and biomass were used as state variables (scheme SVcc+bio) produced a robust result, with the estimation accuracy being fairly close to that obtained using the single-variable (SVcc or SVbio) data assimilation approaches. The estimation accuracy for maize yield was slightly better when using a double-variable data assimilation approach (R-2 = 0.78 and RMSE = 1.44 ton/ha) than when using a single-variable data assimilation approach. In summary, this study presents a robust approach for increasing the estimation accuracy for maize CC, biomass, and yield, and for optimizing field management strategies, by assimilating remote sensing data into the AquaCrop model at a regional scale.

TI  - Spatiotemporal characteristics of white mold and impacts on yield in soybean fields in South Dakota
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - White mold of soybeans is one of the most important fungal diseases that affect soybean production in South Dakota. However, there is a lack of information on the spatial characteristics of the disease and relationship with soybean yield. This relationship can be explored with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 8 and a fusion of Landsat 8 and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. This study investigated the patterns of yield in two soybean fields infected with white mold between 2016 and 2017, and estimated yield loss caused by white mold. Results show evidence of clustering in the spatial distribution of yield (Moran's I = 0.38; p < 0.05 in 2016 and Moran's I = 0.45; p < 0.05 in 2017) that can be explained by the spatial distribution of white mold in the observed fields. Yield loss caused by white mold was estimated at 36% in 2016 and 56% in 2017 for the worse disease pixels, with the most accurate period for estimating this loss on 21 August and 8 September for 2016 field and 2017 field, respectively. This study shows the potential of free remotely sensed satellite data in estimating yield loss caused by white mold.

TI  - How much does axillary ultrasound contribute in women undergoing breast-conserving surgery with no palpable axillary nodes?
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The primary objective was evaluation of axillary ultrasound (AxUS) in preoperative staging of patients with invasive carcinoma undergoing breast-conserving surgery. Methods This is a retrospective, observational cohort study of patients with clinically node-negative (cN0) biopsy-proven invasive breast carcinoma undergoing breast-conserving surgery between January 2011 and December 2014 who underwent AxUS with fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of sonographically abnormal lymph nodes. Patient records were reviewed. Results A total of 713 cases were analysed. Four hundred and thirty-three patients underwent formal preoperative AxUS; 100 underwent biopsy for abnormal findings. Of these, 32 had positive FNA biopsy result and underwent level II axillary dissection (axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)). Thirty were T1-2 tumours with AxUS scan/FNA demonstrating sensitivity of 25.2%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100% and negative predictive value of 76.6%. Forty-six patients had a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and axillary dissection. 34.8% of T1 tumours, 47.8% of T2 tumours and 100% of T3 tumours had further positive nodes. The average number of nodes involved per axilla was 1.8 for the T1 group, 4.1 for the T2 group and 4.6 in the T3 group. Macrometastases were a more common finding than micrometastases for all T stages undergoing ALND. A suspicious preoperative AxUS result was significantly associated with positive SLN. Other risk factors for positive SLN biopsy were oestrogen receptor positivity and lymphovascular invasion. Conclusion AxUS identifies patients with high nodal burdens justifying immediate ALND. AxUS did not adversely affect women with histologically negative sentinel nodes. Three percent may have been overtreated.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node positivity in patients undergoing mastectomies for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Current guidelines recommend sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for patients undergoing mastectomy for a preoperative diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). We examined the factors associated with sentinel lymph node positivity for patients undergoing mastectomy for a diagnosis of DCIS on preoperative core biopsy (PCB). The Institutional Breast Cancer Database was queried for patients with PCB demonstrating pure DCIS followed by mastectomy and SLNB from 2010 to 2018. Patients were divided according to final pathology (DCIS or invasive cancer). Clinico-pathologic variables were analyzed using Pearson's chi-squared, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum and logistic regression. Of 3145 patients, 168(5%) had pure DCIS on PCB and underwent mastectomy with SLNB. On final mastectomy pathology, 120(71%) patients had DCIS with 0 positive sentinel lymph nodes (PSLNs) and 48(29%) patients had invasive carcinoma with 5(10%) cases of >= 1 PSLNs. Factors positively associated with upstaging to invasive cancer in univariate analysis included age (P = .0289), palpability (P < .0001), extent of disease on imaging (P = .0121), mass on preoperative imaging (P = .0003), multifocality (P = .0231) and multicentricity (P = .0395). In multivariate analysis, palpability (P = .0080), extent of disease on imaging (P = .0074) and mass on preoperative imaging (P = .0245) remained significant (Table 2). In a subset of patients undergoing mastectomy for DCIS with limited disease on preoperative evaluation, SLNB may be omitted as the risk of upstaging is low. However, patients who present with clinical findings of palpability, large extent of disease on imaging and mass on preoperative imaging have a meaningful risk of upstaging to invasive cancer, and SLNB remains important for management.

TI  - Did water diversion projects lead to sustainable ecological restoration in arid endorheic basins? Lessons from long-term changes of multiple ecosystem indicators in the lower Heihe River Basin
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological water diversion projects (EWDPs) are crucial for dryland ecosystem restoration in arid endorheic basins. Comprehensive and in-depth evaluations of ecological effects and especially the potential risks of EWDPs on long-term ecosystem changes were limited in previous studies. In this study, spatio-temporal variations in multiple indicators (land use/cover, landscape pattern and vegetation cover) derived from Landsat images were integrated to detect ecosystem changes from 1990 to 2015 in the lower Heihe River Basin (HRB), China, where an EWDP was conducted by the Chinese government in 2000. The results showed that the EWDP prevented ecological degradation and effectively restored the arid oasis ecosystem. From 2000 to 2010, the transformation from unused land to natural vegetation and wetlands, was the major land use/cover change; the degree of landscape fragmentation decreased, and the regional normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) increased significantly. However, the EWDP did not restore the ecosystem to the status in 1990, and some vegetation degradation occurred after 2010, with approximately 38% of the study area showing significant decrease in NDVI. Human interventions, especially overexpansion of cultivated oases, which restricted ecological water use, and construction of artificial canals, which reduced groundwater recharge, resulted in the browning trend from 2010 to 2015. Therefore, the EWDPs did not definitely lead to sustainable ecological restoration and ecosystem development. The quantification results can provide significant implications for water resources management and ecosystem planning to prevent ecological degradation in the study area. The multi-indicator method with long-term and high-resolution dataset used here can be adapted to other arid regions for comprehensively evaluating the ecological restoration ability of the EWDP.

TI  - Assessing environmental impacts of urban growth using remote sensing
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper provides a study of the changes in land use in urban environments in two cities, Wuhan, China and western Sydney in Australia. Since mixed pixels are a characteristic of medium resolution images such as Landsat, when used for the classification of urban areas, due to changes in urban ground cover within a pixel, Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) together with Super-Resolution Mapping (SRM) are employed to derive class fractions to generate classification maps at a higher spatial resolution using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) predicted Wavelet method. Landsat images over the two cities for a 30-year period, are classified in terms of vegetation, buildings, soil and water. The classifications are then processed using Indifrag software to assess the levels of fragmentation caused by changes in the areas of buildings, vegetation, water and soil over the 30 years. The extents of fragmentation of vegetation, buildings, water and soil for the two cities are compared, while the percentages of vegetation are compared with recommended percentages of green space for urban areas for the benefit of health and well-being of inhabitants. Changes in Ecosystem Service Values (ESVs) resulting from the urbanization have been assessed for Wuhan and Sydney. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for urban areas are being assessed by researchers to better understand how to achieve the sustainability of cities.

TI  - Spatiotemporal mixed effects modeling for the estimation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> from MODIS AOD over the Indian subcontinent
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The physical processes associated with the constituents of the troposphere, such as aerosols have an immediate impact on human health. This study employs a novel method to calibrate Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) obtained from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS - Terra satellite) for estimating surface PM2.5 concentration. The Combined Deep Blue Deep Target daily product from the MODIS AOD data acquired across the Indian Subcontinent was used as input, and the daily averaged PM(2.5)pollution level data obtained from 33 monitoring stations spread across the country was used for calibration. Mixed Effect Models (MEM) is a linear model to deal with non-independent data from multiple levels or hierarchy using fixed and random effects of dependent parameters. MEM was applied to the dataset obtained for the period from January to August 2017. The MEM considers a fixed and random component, where the random components model the daily variations of the AOD - PM2.5 relationships, site-specific adjustment parameters, temporal (meteorological) variables such as temperature, and spatial variables such as the percentage of agricultural area, forest cover, barren land and road density with the resolution of 10 km x 10 km. Estimation accuracy was improved from an R-2 value of 0.66 from our earlier study (when PM2.5 was modeled against only AOD and site-specific parameters) toR(2) value of 0.75 upon the inclusion of spatiotemporal (meteorological) variables with increased % within Expected Error from 18% to 35%, reduced Mean Bias Error from 3.22 to 0.11 and reduced RMSE from 29.11 to 20.09. We also found that spline interpolation performed better than IDW and Kriging inefficiently estimating the PM2.5 concentrations wherever there were missing AOD data. The estimated minimum PM2.5 is 93 +/- 25 mu g/m(3) which itself is in the upper limit of the hazardous level while the maximum is estimated as 170 +/- 70 mu g/m(3). The study has thus made it possible to determine the daily spatial variations of PM2.5 concentrations across the Indian subcontinent utilizing satellite-based AOD data.

TI  - Land cover mapping based on time-series MODIS-NDVI using a dynamic time warping approach: A casestudy of the agricultural pastoral ecotone of northern China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To curb land degradation, a series of ecological restoration projects have been carried out since 1999, leading to dramatic land cover change (LCC) in the agricultural pastoral ecotone of northern China (APENC). To date, there is still lack of timely and accurate land cover (LC) information for management and assessment actions. This paper presents a LC mapping scheme to map annual LC information based on dynamic time warping (DTW) approach and time-series MODIS-NDVI product for the APENC. The DTW approach was optimized firstly based on the change of vegetation phenology phase. Next, typical reference time-series curves set of different LC types were established and pixel-wise similarity was examined to identify the LC type. Before that, the reconstruction of time-series MODIS-NDVI was performed using harmonic analysis of time-series and reconstruction accuracy was evaluated quantitatively at a regional scale. Results showed that the gap error was relatively large for the high vegetation cover areas while it might be ignored for the moderate and low vegetation cover areas. The overall accuracy of LC mapping in year 2010 (LC-2010) was 77.89% and kappa coefficient reached 0.71, which suggested that LC mapping scheme could extract LC information with high accuracy. The producer's accuracy ranged between 69.83% (grasslands) and 100% (water body), while the user's accuracy changed from 58% (built-up) to 86% (forest). The overall spatial agreement between LC-2010 and GlobaLand30-2010 was about 64.44%. The total area of forests, croplands, water body and built-up exhibited an increasing trend while the contrary trend were found for the grasslands and bare land during the 2001-2017. These LC maps are valuable for research the land degradation investigation and monitoring, benefit evaluation of ecological restoration projects and effect of LCC on surface hydrothermal process in APENC.

TI  - Monitoring crop water content for corn and soybean fields through data fusion of MODIS and Landsat measurements in Iowa
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation water content (VWC) is of vital significance to many applications in agriculture, such as crop yield estimation and precision irrigation. However, previous studies mainly estimate VWC at either high spatial resolution or temporal resolution due to the limitation of space-borne observation systems. In this paper, we target on monitoring daily plant VWC as well as canopy VWC at 30 m high spatial resolution with the fusion of optical measurements from the Land Remote Sensing Satellite (Landsat) Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in an agricultural area. The study area locates in the central of Iowa, the United States (USA), the study period ranges from August 1 to August 17, 2016. Landsat 8 OLI observations are with 16-day revisit cycle and 30-m spatial resolution, MODIS daily surface reflectance product used in this study has 500-m spatial resolution. Six Landsat OLI images and thirty MODIS images were used to estimate daily remotely sensed reflectance data at 30m first. Then, the fused satellite measurements were used to calculate Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). Ground-based plant VWC and canopy VWC measurements were collected during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment (SMAPVEX16) to calibrate and validate the model for plant VMC and canopy VWC estimation separately with the NDWI. The results of validation with in-situ measurements showed an R-2 of 0.44 for the corn plant VWC, an R-2 of 0.66 for the corn canopy VWC; and an R-2 of 0.78 for the soybean plant VWC, an R-2 of 0.85 for the soybean canopy VWC, respectively.

TI  - The effect of oceanic mesoscale eddies on the looping path of the Kuroshio intrusion in the Luzon Strait
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the effects of oceanic mesoscale eddies on the looping path of the Kuroshio intrusion (KI) were symmetrically investigated by composite analysis using merged satellite data. We found that the mesoscale eddies propagating from the east have a significant impact on the looping path over a time scale of 30-60 days. Cyclonic eddies (CEs) enhance the looping path, but anticyclonic eddies decrease it. We also found that strong eddies do not have strong effects on the looping path. For instance, strong CEs induce the strong surface intrusion of the Kuroshio, but the looping currents are weak due to the presence of the strong Luzon Cold Eddy in the South China Sea, which tends to prevent loop formation. The complicated relationship between eddies and the path of the KI results in a nonsignificant correlation coefficient between the KI and eddy activities in the western Pacific.

TI  - New land surface temperature retrieval algorithm for heavy aerosol loading during nighttime from Gaofen-5 satellite data
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable used for studies of the water cycles and energy budgets of land-atmosphere interfaces. The Chinese Gaofen-5 (GF5) satellite, with an onboard visual and infrared multispectral imager (VIMS), is the only satellite that can capture the earth's thermal infrared information for use in the national high-resolution earth observation project of China; it can observe the earth surface at a high spatial resolution of 40 m in four thermal infrared channels and two mid-infrared channels. This article selects the optimum spectral channel combination for reducing the aerosol effect on LST retrieval with the aid of simulated data, and a new four-channel LST retrieval method from GF5 infrared data under heavy dust aerosol during nighttime is proposed. The results show that the channel combination of channels 7, 8, 9, and 10 (denoted as CC1) performed better than the combination of channels 7, 8, 11, and 12 (denoted as CC2). The root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the actual and estimated LST were 0.28 K for the CC1 group with an aerosol optical thickness (AOD) of 0.1 and 1.94 K for the CC1 group with an AOD of 1.0. The RMSEs for CC2 were 0.28 K for the group with an AOD of 0.1 and 2.54 K for the other group with an AOD of 1.0. Moreover, an error analysis for the proposed method was performed in terms of the noise equivalent temperature difference (NE Delta T), the uncertainties of land surface emissivity (LSE), water vapor content (WVC) and AOD. The results show that the LST errors caused by an LSE uncertainty of 0.01, a NE Delta T of 0.2 K, a WVC uncertainty of 20%, an AOD uncertainty of 0.1 were 0.31 similar to 1.01 K, 0.4 similar to 2.0 K, within 0.6 K, and within 0.3 K for CC1 and 0.32 similar to 3.08 K, 0.4 similar to 1.7 K, within 0.7 K, and within 0.3K for CC2, respectively.

TI  - Spatio-temporal prediction of land surface temperature using semantic kriging
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal prediction and forecasting of land surface temperature (LST) are relevant. However, several factors limit their usage, such as missing pixels, line drops, and cloud cover in satellite images. Being measured close to the Earth's surface, LST is mainly influenced by the land use/land cover (LULC) distribution of the terrain. This article presents a spatio-temporal interpolation method which semantically models LULC information for the analysis of LST. The proposed spatio-temporal semantic kriging (ST-SemK) approach is presented in two variants: non-separable ST-SemK (ST-SemK(NSep)) and separable ST-SemK (ST-SemK(Sep)). Empirical studies have been carried out with derived Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images of LST for two spatial regions: Kolkata, India and Dallas, Texas, U.S. It has been observed that semantically enhanced spatio-temporal modeling by ST-SemK yields more accurate prediction results than spatio-temporal ordinary kriging and other existing methods.

T2  - AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Cutaneous sebaceous carcinoma occurs almost exclusively on the head and neck and has a significant propensity for recurrence and metastasis. It is easily mistaken for benign conditions, resulting in inappropriate management. Thus, it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion. Despite previous reports, sebaceous carcinoma may occur with similar frequency in Asians and whites. Recent genetic data suggest there are multiple mutational groups of sebaceous carcinoma, paving the way for targeted treatment. After a diagnosis, investigations for staging and for Muir-Torre syndrome should be considered. The available evidence on the treatment options for sebaceous carcinoma is discussed, and specific recommendations for management are made.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD PRODUCTS MARKETING
M3  - Article
AB  - CRISPR-Cas9 (gene editing) increases the speed and precision of genetic improvements in plant breeding; however, relatively little is known about how consumers will respond to this innovation. Drawing upon Cultural Cognition Theory, the paper examines the influence of cultural worldviews on consumer acceptance of gene editing. Data from an online survey of Canadians show that a hierarchical (versus egalitarian) worldview, positive attitudes toward science and technology, and lower levels of prior risk perceptions influence public acceptance. Attitudes toward the use of gene editing in plant breeding appear less firmly entrenched than for genetic modification, with implications for the scientific community and policymakers.

TI  - Geo-structural stability assessment of surrounding hills of Kuala Lumpur City based on rock surface discontinuity from geological survey data
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Structural field data have been widely used for geological analysis in the past decade. By contrast, structural stability analysis based on surface orientation for large discontinuity planes has received inadequate attention from researchers. This study performs structural stability analysis on Kuala Lumpur (KL) by utilizing surface orientations (1) to investigate the influence of rock stability on the development of transportation corridors and (2) to assess land and infrastructure stability by determining areas susceptible to various rock failures. Data are collected from three parts of KL (east, west and north) that represent different hilly regions. Data from the southern part of the city are not collected because its hilly regions are far from the city. Furthermore, the orientation data of bedding planes, faults and joints are grouped into sets for a thorough understanding. The computed global mean and best fit show that the overall structure of the area is dome- and basin-shaped. Kinematic analysis provides the percentage of potential risk for various rock failures. Our findings show the dominant types of rock failure with high risk around the city and the ranges of probabilities in the eastern, western and northern part of the city, which are 5.22%, 9.8% and 7.37%, respectively. Low probability of wedge sliding, high probability of flexure toppling and medium probability of planar sliding are observed. Results show that the set S(2) with dip angle 55 degrees-60 degrees in the east of KL; S(3), S(4) with dip angle 58 degrees-67 degrees and 65 degrees-70 degrees in the west of KL and S(2), S(6,7) with dip angle 52 degrees-70 degrees and 86 degrees-90 degrees are critical and could contribute to the slope failure risk in the future. It could be understood that rock failures can seriously influence the development of the surrounding agriculture land and infrastructures.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the last few decades, tropical coastal systems such as beaches, dunes, and mangrove forests have experienced high annual rates of loss worldwide due to natural and anthropogenic impacts. Historical remote sensing data have been used to map and monitor these fragile systems, as well as to track specific events through time. The purpose of this study was to examine coastal trends along Marismas Nacionales in Mexico, which is the largest wetland complex of the western coast of the Pacific Ocean. The opening of the Cuautla Canal in 1976 and the construction of several hydroelectric power dams have severely impacted this wetland system. Shoreline variability was estimated based on representative remote sensing images over half a century (1970 to 2019). Results indicate that, after 49 years, 805 ha of beach deposits have been lost in the Cuautla Canal and at the beach ridge region that should otherwise be an accretional coastal zone. Conversely, the southern section of the study site shows 406 ha of constant accretion during the same period due to the presence of the unobstructed San Pedro River. Our study highlights the adverse effects of engineering projects, such as inlets and hydroelectric dams throughout tropical coastal systems that have strongly depended on freshwater input from upstream rivers.

TI  - A geospatial approach for limnological characterization of Nigeen Lake, Kashmir Himalaya
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The lakes of Kashmir Valley show multiple signs of deterioration. This study integrated multiple datasets pertaining to the land system, lake bathymetry and water quality in GIS environment to limnologically characterize the Nigeen Lake. Settlements in the vicinity of the lake were mapped using high-resolution satellite data of 2003 and 2016. Lake depths measured at 235 points spread across the lake surface were used to produce the detailed bathymetry of Nigeen Lake. Surface water quality data at five sites pertaining to 22 physico-chemical parameters was analyzed for limnological characterization of the lake. The quality of lake water is within the permissible limits as per the drinking water standards set forth by World Health Organization (WHO); however, the values of secchi-disc transparency (0.52-1.39 m) and total phosphorous (184-687 mu g L-1) indicate hypereutrophic state of the lake. The settlements in the lake vicinity expanded by 30% from 2003 to 2016. The bathymetry analysis revealed that the lake depth varied from 1.02 to 6.07 m. The reckless urbanization and inadequate sewage treatment system together with high residence time of water in the Nigeen Lake are responsible for enhanced nutrient enrichment and deterioration in water quality.

TI  - A fortuitous find: a unique haplotype of <i>Ooencyrtus nezarae</i> Ishii (Encyrtidae: Encyrtinae) discovered in Florida
T2  - BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The adventive arrival of biological control agents circumvents the regulatory process by introducing exotic species to control invasive pests and is generally followed by post hoc risk evaluation. The bean plataspid, Megacopta cribraria (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Plataspidae), is an invasive pest of leguminous crops in the south-eastern United States that was eventually followed by two parasitoid wasps from its range in the eastern hemisphere, Paratelenomus saccharalis (Dodd) (Scelionidae) and Ooencyrtus nezarae Ishii (Encyrtidae). In North Central Florida, sentinel egg masses, intended to capture Paratelenomus saccharalis, instead yielded Ooencyrtus nezarae, which was previously known only from Alabama (Ademokoya et al. 2018). Two generations of O. nezarae were subsequently reared in the laboratory. COI sequences from the Florida population of O. nezarae differed by 1.3% from the Alabama population and the presence of a different haplotype suggests the possibility of a separate introduction. Laboratory parasitism rates, sex ratios, morphology, molecular diagnosis and implications for agriculture are discussed.

TI  - Surprising similarities in model and observational aerosol radiative forcing estimates
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The radiative forcing from aerosols (particularly through their interaction with clouds) remains one of the most uncertain components of the human forcing of the climate. Observation-based studies have typically found a smaller aerosol effective radiative forcing than in model simulations and were given preferential weighting in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). With their own sources of uncertainty, it is not clear that observation-based estimates are more reliable. Understanding the source of the model and observational differences is thus vital to reduce uncertainty in the impact of aerosols on the climate.These reported discrepancies arise from the different methods of separating the components of aerosol forcing used in model and observational studies. Applying the observational decomposition to global climate model (GCM) output, the two different lines of evidence are surprisingly similar, with a much better agreement on the magnitude of aerosol impacts on cloud properties. Cloud adjustments re-main a significant source of uncertainty, particularly for ice clouds. However, they are consistent with the uncertainty from observation-based methods, with the liquid water path adjustment usually enhancing the Twomey effect by less than 50 %. Depending on different sets of assumptions, this work suggests that model and observation-based estimates could be more equally weighted in future synthesis studies.

TI  - DV3+HED+: a DCNN-based framework to monitor temporary works and ESAs in railway construction project using VHR satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current very high-resolution (VHR) satellite images enable the detailed monitoring of the Earth and can capture the ongoing works of railway construction. We presented an integrated framework applied to monitoring railway construction in China using QuickBird, Gaofen-2, and Google Earth VHR satellite images. We also constructed a deep convolutional neural network-based semantic segmentation network to label the temporary works, such as borrow and spoil areas, camp, beam yard, and environmentally sensitive areas such as resident houses throughout the whole railway construction project using VHR satellite images. In addition, we employed the holistically nested edge detection subnetwork to refine the boundary details and a cross entropy loss function to fit the sample class disequilibrium problem. Our semantic segmentation network was trained on 471, validated on 58, and tested on the 58 VHR true color images. The experiment results showed that compared with the existing state-of-the-art DeepLabV3 plus approach, our approach has improvements with an overall accuracy of more than 80%.

TI  - Utility of Ultrasound and Mammography in Detection of Negative Axillary Nodal Metastasis in Breast Cancer
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe status of axillary lymph nodes is one of the most important prognostic factors in patients with breast cancer. A precise noninvasive evaluation of axillary lymph node status preoperatively, although challenging, is vital for optimization of the treatment plan for patients. The objective of our study was to assess the utility of ultrasound and mammography in detecting the absence of axillary lymph nodal metastasis in patients of breast cancer, taking histopathology as gold standard.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Radiology, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. All female patients between 20 and 95 years of age with a known diagnosis of breast cancer with mammographic and ultrasound imaging done at our institute were included. Patients with abnormal lymph nodes on mammography or on ultrasound, patients already operated for breast cancer, patients who already underwent axillary lymph node dissection and those whose histopathology reports were not available or who did not undergo surgery were excluded.ResultsA total of 262 women with breast carcinoma who had both ultrasound and mammography done and also had surgery performed at our institution were included. At final surgical pathology, a total of 45 of the 262 patients (17.2%) with breast carcinoma had one or more positive lymph nodes. Out of the total 262 patients, 217 patients were found to be true negatives as they had absent axillary nodal metastasis on imaging as well as on histopathology. In all, 45 out of 262 patients were found to be false negatives as they had absent axillary nodal metastasis on imaging; however, they were found to be positive for metastasis on histopathology. The negative predictive value was 82.8%. Patient age was considered as a factor that may influence the outcome of results; the patients were stratified into age ranges seven groups with the age range of 10 years, ranging from 26 to 95 years. Chi-square test showed a p-value of 0.148, which showed no significant difference in the effect of age on diagnosing the absence of metastasis by ultrasound and mammography.ConclusionOur study shows that ultrasound and mammography even when used in combination cannot safely exclude axillary metastasis and thus cannot eliminate the need for sentinel node biopsy.

TI  - Combination of Google Earth imagery and Sentinel-2 data for mangrove species mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge gained about mangrove species mapping is essential to understand mangrove species' development and to better estimate their ecological service value. Spectral bands and spatial resolution of remote sensing data are two important factors for accurate discrimination of mangrove species. Mangrove species classification in Shenzhen Bay, China, was performed using Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral instrument (MSI) data and Google Earth (GE) high-resolution imagery as data sources, and their suitability in mapping mangrove forest at a species level was examined. In the classification feature groups, the spectral bands were from the S2 MSI data and the textural features were based on GE imagery. The support vector machine classifier was used in mangrove species classification processing with eight groups of features, which were based on different S2 spectral bands and different GE spatial resolution textural features. The highest overall accuracy of our mapping results was 78.57% and the kappa coefficient was 0.74, which indicated great potential for using the combination of S2 MSI and GE imagery for distinguishing and mapping mangrove species.

TI  - Schistosomiasis Surveillance - China, 2015-2018
T2  - CHINA CDC WEEKLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The prevalence of schistosomiasis in China is at the lowest level in history, and sentinel surveillance sites of schistosomiasis have fully covered all epidemic areas of China. This article has analyzed the surveillance data for the last four years and can help guide the next stage of surveillance work at the national level, including the scope of surveillance, surveillance content, and surveillance methods, etc.Methods Data from the National Schistosomiasis Surveillance System were collected. The infection rate of schistosomiasis among the human population, livestock, snails, and the change of the breeding area of snails in sentinel surveillance sites for four consecutive years were analyzed, and the trends in schistosomiasis prevalence in surveillance sites were determined.Results The prevalence of schistosomiasis in all sentinel surveillance sites of China showed downward trends from 2015 to 2018 with infection rates decreasing in this time period for local human population (0.05% to 0.00%), the floating population (0.020% to 0.003%), and cattle (0.037% to 0.000%). No infected snails were found during the period. From 2015 to 2018, the total area of newly found habitats of snails (Oncomelania hupensis, O. hupensis) were 34,730 m(2), 1,367,694 m(2), 18,944 m(2), and 50,420 m(2), and the total area of re-emergent habitats of snails (O. hupensis) were 822,194 m(2), 1,391,779 m(2), 1,516,292 m(2), and 1,750,558 m(2), respectively.Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice The prevalence of schistosomiasis in human and livestock is going down and is sustained at a very low level, but new and re-emerging habitats of O. hupensis are new challenges regardless of the achievement of schistosomiasis control. Therefore, two actions are necessary to effectively further reduce the transmission risk of schistosomiasis: 1) taking effective measures to control the source of infection of schistosomiasis; and 2) reducing the breeding areas of O. hupensis.

TI  - Modeling grass yields in Qinghai Province, China, based on MODIS <i>NDVI</i> data-an empirical comparison
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Qinghai Province is one of the four largest pastoral regions in China. Timely monitoring of grass growth and accurate estimation of grass yields are essential for its ecological protection and sustainable development. To estimate grass yields in Qinghai, we used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series data derived from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and a pre-existing grassland type map. We developed five estimation approaches to quantify the overall accuracy by combining four data pre-processing techniques (original, Savitzky-Golay (SG), Asymmetry Gaussian (AG) and Double Logistic (DL)), three metrics derived from NDVI time series (VImax, VIseason and VImean) and four fitting functions (linear, second-degree polynomial, power function, and exponential function). The five approaches were investigated in terms of overall accuracy based on 556 ground survey samples in 2016. After assessment and evaluation, we applied the best estimation model in each approach to map the fresh grass yields over the entire Qinghai Province in 2016. Results indicated that: 1) For sample estimation, the cross-validated overall accuracies increased with the increasing flexibility in the chosen fitting variables, and the best estimation accuracy was obtained by the so called "fully flexible model" with R-2 of 0.57 and RMSE of 1140 kg/ha. 2) Exponential models generally outperformed linear and power models. 3) Although overall similar, strong local discrepancies were identified between the grass yield maps derived from the five approaches. In particular, the two most flexible modeling approaches were too sensitive to errors in the pre-existing grassland type map. This led to locally strong overestimations in the modeled grass yields.

TI  - Combining optical and radar satellite image time series to map natural vegetation: savannas as an example
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Up-to-date land cover maps are important for biodiversity monitoring as they are central to habitat and ecosystem distribution assessments. Satellite remote sensing is a key technology for generating these maps. Until recently, land cover mapping has been limited to static approaches, which have primarily led to the production of either global maps at coarse spatial resolutions or geographically restricted maps at high spatial resolutions. The recent availability of optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) satellite image time series (SITS) which provide access to high spatial and very high temporal resolutions, is a game changer, offering opportunities to map land cover using both temporal and spatial information. These data moreover open interesting perspectives for land cover mapping based on data combination approach. However, the usefulness of combining dense time series (more than 30 images per year) and data combination approaches to map natural vegetation has so far not been assessed. To address this gap, this contribution tests the idea that the combined consideration of optical and radar data combination and time series analyses can significantly improve natural vegetation mapping in the Pendjari National Park, a Sahelian savanna protected area in Benin. Results highlight that the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 SITS performs as well as Sentinel-2 SITS alone in terms of classification accuracy. Land cover maps are however qualitatively better when considering the data combination approach. Our results also clearly show that the use of dense/hypertemporal optical time series significantly improves classification outcomes compared to using multitemporal only a few images per year) or monotemporal data. Altogether, this work thus demonstrates the ability of dense SITS to improve discrimination of natural vegetation types using information on their phenology, leading to more detailed and more reliable maps for environmental management.

TI  - Sea-Land Segmentation Using Deep Learning Techniques for Landsat-8 OLI Imagery
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated coastline extraction from optical satellites is fundamental to coastal mapping, and sea-land segmentation is the core technology of coastline extraction. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have performed well in semantic segmentation in recent years. However, sea-land segmentation using deep learning techniques remains a challenging task, due to the lack of a benchmark dataset and the difficulty of deciding which semantic segmentation model to use. We present a comparative framework of sea-land segmentation to Landsat-8 OLI imagery via semantic segmentation in deep learning techniques. Three issues are investigated: (1) constructing a sea-land benchmark dataset using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery consisting of 18,000 km(2) of coastline around China; (2) evaluating the feasibility and performance of sea-land segmentation by comparing the accuracy assessment, time complexity, spatial complexity and stability of state-of-the-art DCNNs methods; (3) choosing the most suitable semantic segmentation model for sea-land segmentation in accordance with Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) model selection. Results show that the average test accuracy achieves over 99% accuracy, and the mean Intersection over Unions (mean IoU) is above 92%. These findings demonstrate that the Fully Convolutional DenseNet (FC-DenseNet) performs better than other state-of-the-art methods in sea-land segmentation, based on both AIC and BIC. Considering training time efficiency, DeeplabV3+ performs better for sea-land segmentation. The sea-land segmentation benchmark dataset is available at: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1BlnHiltOLbLKe4TG8lZ5xg..

TI  - Evaporation From the Southern Ocean Estimated on the Basis of AIRS Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaporation plays an important role in the global water and energy cycles and, hence, in climate change. Evaporation over the Southern Ocean, where the Antarctic sea ice coverage has a large annual cycle, is poorly quantified. In this study, daily evaporation is estimated for the Southern Ocean with a sea-ice-specific algorithm, using surface temperature and air humidity from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), and wind speeds from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), reanalysis during 2003-2016. An uncertainty of 34% was found in the evaporation product. The results indicate that annual evaporation has considerable interannual and regional variability, but with a decreasing trend during the study period over most of the Southern Ocean. There are, however, areas where evaporation has increased, specifically in the Ross Sea in winter and summer, with smaller positive trends in spring and fall. Overall, the changes in the difference between the surface specific humidity and the air specific humidity, and to a much lesser extent in the wind speed, are the main drivers for the changes in evaporation throughout the year. During spring and fall months, changes to the sea ice cover, which alter the surface specific humidity, are the main drivers for the change, but in summer and winter the main driver is the air-specific humidity. Air masses originating from the Antarctic continent (south) are associated with cold and dry conditions, which increase evaporation, whereas air masses from lower latitudes in the Southern Ocean (north) are associated with warm and moist conditions, decreasing evaporation. Comparisons with other reanalysis evaporation products produce similar trends, although annual averages differ.

TI  - Downscaling NLDAS-2 daily maximum air temperatures using MODIS land surface temperatures
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed and applied a relatively simple disaggregation scheme that uses spatial patterns of Land Surface Temperature (LST) from MODIS warm-season composites to improve the spatial characterization of daily maximum and minimum air temperatures. This down-scaling model produces qualitatively reasonable 1 km daily maximum and minimum air temperature estimates that reflect urban and coastal features. In a 5-city validation, the model was shown to provide improved daily maximum air temperature estimates in the three coastal cities, compared to 12 km NLDAS-2 (North American Land Data Assimilation System). Down-scaled maximum temperature estimates for the other two (non-coastal) cities were marginally worse than the original NLDAS-2 temperatures. For daily minimum temperatures, the scheme produces spatial fields that qualitatively capture geographic features, but quantitative validation shows the down-scaling model performance to be very similar to the original NLDAS-2 minimum temperatures. Thus, we limit the discussion in this paper to daily maximum temperatures. Overall, errors in the down-scaled maximum air temperatures are comparable to errors in down-scaled LST obtained in previous studies. The advantage of this approach is that it produces estimates of daily maximum air temperatures, which is more relevant than LST in applications such as public health. The resulting 1 km daily maximum air temperatures have great potential utility for applications such as public health, energy demand, and surface energy balance analyses. The method may not perform as well in conditions of strong temperature advection. Application of the model also may be problematic in areas having extreme changes in elevation.

TI  - Extrapolation of daily air temperatures of Egypt from MODIS LST data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The limited and poor spatial distribution of meteorological stations is inadequate to reconstruct accurate regional air temperature maps, which are important for environmental planning and resources management. This study aimed to generate a gridded dataset of max/min daily surface air temperatures for Egypt based on remotely sensed data acquired from the MODIS land surface temperature (LST) product. Linear regression analysis was performed between observed air temperatures from ground weather stations and LST records from satellite images. Regression coefficients were as high as 0.8 between min air temperature and night LST data, compared to 0.77 for max air temperature and day LST. Statistical analysis reveals significant correlations (p < .01) for both regression relationships. MODIS data showed a satisfactory performance in producing regional monthly and annual as well as diurnal surface air temperatures maps for Egypt. MODIS data could also highlight the influence of topography, vegetation and lithology on air temperatures.

AB  - The sea ice modeling community is progressing towards pan-Arctic simulations that explicitly resolve leads in the simulated sea ice cover. Evaluating these simulations against observations poses new challenges. A new feature-based evaluation of simulated deformation fields is introduced, and the results are compared to a scaling analysis of sea ice deformation. Leads and pressure ridges - here combined into linear kinematic features (LKFs) - are detected and tracked automatically from deformation and drift data. LKFs in two pan-Arctic sea ice simulations with a horizontal grid spacing of 2 km are compared with an LKF dataset derived from the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System (RGPS). One simulation uses a five-class ice thickness distribution (ITD). The simulated sea ice deformation follows a multi-fractal spatial and temporal scaling, as observed from RGPS. The heavy-tailed distribution of LKF lengths and the scale invariance of LKF curvature, which points to the self-similar nature of sea ice deformation fields, are reproduced by the model. Interannual and seasonal variations in the number of LKFs, LKF densities, and LKF orientations in the ITD simulation are found to be consistent with RGPS observations. The lifetimes and growth rates follow a distribution with an exponential tail. The model overestimates the intersection angle of LKFs, which is attributed to the model's viscous-plastic rheology with an elliptical yield curve. In conclusion, the new feature-based analysis of LKF statistics is found to be useful for a comprehensive evaluation of simulated deformation features, which is required before the simulated features can be used with confidence in the context of climate studies. As such, it complements the commonly used scaling analysis and provides new useful information for comparing deformation statistics. The ITD simulation is shown to reproduce LKFs sufficiently well for it to be used for studying the effect of directly resolved leads in climate simulations. The feature-based analysis of LKFs also identifies specific model deficits that may be addressed by specific parameterizations, for example, a damage parameter, a grounding scheme, and a Mohr-Coulombic yield curve.

TI  - Comparison of TROPOMI/Sentinel-5 Precursor NO<sub>2\</sub> observations with ground-based measurements in Helsinki
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a comparison between satellite-based TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) NO2 products and ground-based observations in Helsinki (Finland). TROPOMI NO2 total (summed) columns are compared with the measurements performed by the Pandora spectrometer between April and September 2018. The mean relative and absolute bias between the TROPOMI and Pandora NO2 total columns is about 10% and 0.12 x 10(15) molec. cm(-2) respectively. The dispersion of these differences (estimated as their standard deviation) is 2.2 x 10(15) molec. cm(-2). We find high correlation (r = 0.68) between satellite- and ground-based data, but also that TROPOMI total columns underestimate ground-based observations for relatively large Pandora NO2 total columns, corresponding to episodes of relatively elevated pollution. This is expected because of the relatively large size of the TROPOMI ground pixel (3.5 x 7 km) and the a priori used in the retrieval compared to the relatively small field-of-view of the Pandora instrument. On the other hand, TROPOMI slightly overestimates (within the retrieval uncertainties) relatively small NO2 total columns. Replacing the coarse a priori NO2 profiles with high-resolution profiles from the CAMS chemical transport model improves the agreement between TROPOMI and Pandora total columns for episodes of NO2 enhancement. When only the low values of NO2 total columns or the whole dataset are taken into account, the mean bias slightly increases. The change in bias remains mostly within the uncertainties.We also analyse the consistency between satellite-based data and in situ NO2 surface concentrations measured at the Helsinki-Kumpula air quality station (located a few metres from the Pandora spectrometer). We find similar day-to-day variability between TROPOMI, Pandora and in situ measurements, with NO2 enhancements observed during the same days. Both satellite- and ground-based data show a similar weekly cycle, with lower NO2 levels during the weekend compared to the weekdays as a result of reduced emissions from traffic and industrial activities (as expected in urban sites). The TROPOMI NO2 maps reveal also spatial features, such as the main traffic ways and the airport area, as well as the effect of the prevailing south-west wind patterns.This is one of the first works in which TROPOMI NO2 retrievals are validated against ground-based observations and the results provide an early evaluation of their applicability for monitoring pollution levels in urban sites. Overall, TROPOMI retrievals are valuable to complement the ground-based air quality data (available with high temporal resolution) for describing the spatio-temporal variability of NO2, even in a relatively small city like Helsinki.

TI  - An ultraviolet to visible scheme to estimate chromophoric dissolved organic matter absorption in a Case-2 water from remote sensing reflectance
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In a typical Case-2 coastal water environment (here, the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), China), chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and suspended particulates dominate the water optical properties, and CDOM fluorescence contributes considerably to surface water reflectance. In this paper, an ultraviolet (UV) to visible scheme to retrieve CDOM absorption (a(g))is developed based on a set of in situ observations. First, the CDOM UV absorption and spectral slope (S-g) are derived directly from the visible remote sensing reflectance; then the S-g is extrapolated to obtain the spectrum from UV to visible spectral range. This algorithm performs well, with an overall mean absolute percent difference (MAPD) of similar to 30%, similar to 5% and similar to 6% for the estimation of a(g) in 250-450 nm, S-g over 250-400 nm, and 250-700 nm, respectively. The effectiveness and stability of the algorithm is further demonstrated in capturing the distribution pattern of CDOM absorption in the PRE from satellite ocean color imagery with multiple spatial and spectral resolution, namely: the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) (750 m/Multispectral), the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) (300 m/Multispectral), the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) (100 m/Hyperspectral), and the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) (30 m/Multispectral). The UV to visible scheme can benefit the CDOM absorption estimation in two aspects: 1) it is free from the disturbance of suspended matter; 2) it avoids uncertainties caused by the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a(g) measurements in the visible range. The algorithm is effective in revealing multiple scales of variation of CDOM absorption from ocean color observations.

TI  - Building damage mapping based on Touzi decomposition using quad-polarimetric ALOS PALSAR data
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Building damage assessment is of great significance to disaster monitoring. Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can record the polarization scattering measurement matrix of ground objects and obtain more abundant ground object information, meaning that they can be used for assessing damage to buildings. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to assess building damage using the Touzi incoherent decomposition and SAR-based characteristics of buildings before and after damage. The March 11th, 2011 earthquake that struck the coast of northeast Japan serves as the demonstration of the technique using quad-polarimetric ALOS PALSAR data acquired before and after the disaster. The analysis shows that after the buildings are damaged, there is a clear decrease in the alpha(s1) (the dominant scattering-type magnitude) components and the degree of this reduction corresponds to the degree of building damage. This means that the alpha(s1) components obtained by Touzi decomposition can effectively reflect the degree of building damage. On this basis, a model based on Touzi decomposition was established to evaluate the degree of damage to buildings, and the accuracy of the model was validated using high-resolution optical data acquired before and after the earthquake. The experimental results show that Touzi decomposition can be effectively used for damage assessment mapping in built-up areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background Influenza virus infections are common and lead to substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. We characterized the first eight influenza epidemics since the 2009 influenza pandemic by describing the distribution of viruses and epidemics temporally and geographically across the WHO European Region. Methods We retrospectively analyzed laboratory-confirmed influenza detections in ambulatory patients from sentinel sites. Data were aggregated by reporting entity and season (weeks 40-20) for 2010-2011 to 2017-2018. We explored geographical spread using correlation coefficients. Results There was variation in the regional influenza epidemics during the study period. Influenza A virus subtypes alternated in dominance, except for 2013-2014 during which both cocirculated, and only one season (2017-2018) was B virus dominant. The median start week for epidemics in the Region was week 50, the time to the peak ranged between four and 13 weeks, and the duration of the epidemic ranged between 19 and 25 weeks. There was evidence of a west-to-east spread across the Region during epidemics in 2010-2011 (r = .365; P = .019), 2012-2013 (r = .484; P = .001), 2014-2015 (r = .423; P = .006), and 2017-2018 (r = .566; P < .001) seasons. Variation in virus distribution and timing existed within reporting entities across seasons and across reporting entities for a given season. Conclusions Aggregated influenza detection data from sentinel surveillance sites by season between 2010 and 2018 have been presented for the European Region for the first time. Substantial diversity exists between influenza epidemics. These data can inform prevention and control efforts at national, sub-national, and international levels. Aggregated, regional surveillance data from early affected reporting entities may provide an early warning function and be helpful for early season forecasting efforts.

TI  - A Global Survey of Apparent Aerosol-Cloud Interaction Signals
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We update and expand analysis of the apparent responses to aerosol variations of the planet's cloud regimes seen by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We distinguish between morning aerosol loadings and afternoon clouds and consider local scales explicitly. Aerosol loading is represented by gridded aerosol optical depth (AOD) from either MODIS or a reanalysis data set, while cloud information comes exclusively from MODIS. The afternoon cloud affected quantities (CAQs) examined in conjunction with morning AOD include precipitation and cloud radiative effect, in addition to cloud properties. One analysis thrust focuses on calculating global means distinguished by morning cloud regime, of afternoon CAQs, for distinct percentiles of grid cell seasonal morning AOD distributions. When the dependence of these global means on AOD is examined, we find persistent increases in cloud radiative fluxes with AOD as predicted by classic aerosol-cloud interaction paradigms, and also deviations from expected cloud responses, especially for precipitation. The other analysis thrust involves calculations at 1 degrees scales of logarithmic CAQ sensitivities to AOD perturbations, approximated by linear regression slopes for distinct morning cloud regime groups. While the calculations are fundamentally local, we concentrate on the prevailing sensitivity signs in statistics of the slopes at global scales. Results from this second analysis approach indicate CAQ directions of change with AOD that are largely consistent with the first approach. When using a rather simple methodology where meteorological variables are treated as if they were CAQs, no conclusive results on the potential influence of meteorology on our findings are inferred.Plain Language Summary We use a variety of satellite data and satellite observations processed through a model to investigate whether we can see at global scales evidence of aerosols affecting clouds and quantities associated with them such as precipitation and the amount of radiation they reflect or emit. The (in)consistencies of what our analysis reveals compared to what is expected based on well-established theoretical and empirical expectations are discussed.

M3  - Article
AB  - A study was performed on the coastal waters of the southeastern Arabian Sea to understand the changes in the inherent properties of optically active substances (OAS). The objective of this study was to obtain insight into the temporal dynamics of OASs for various remote sensing applications. Both the absorption of light by phytoplankton (a(ph)(440)) and detritus (a(d)(440)) varied the 2nd orders of magnitude, whereas the absorption of light by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM; a(CDOM)(440)) exhibited an increasing trend over the years. a(CDOM)(440) increased from 2009 to 2015 at a rate 0.012 m(-1) year(-1). The validation of the satellite data with in situ data indicated that a(d)(443) underestimated the in situ a(d)(443) when the in situ a(d)(443) was less than 0.3 m(-1). The ternary analysis of ocean-colour-climate-change initiative (OC-CCI)-derived inherent optical properties (IOP) during the postmonsoon season indicated increased contribution by a(d)(443). Detritus was the primary light absorber in the coastal waters of Kochi followed by phytoplankton and CDOM. These long-term data sets and their seasonal variation will enable development of seasonal specific regional algorithms for chlorophyll-a, which are employed in potential fishing zone advisories and other applications.

TI  - A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial evaluating vibration therapy as an intervention for postural training and fall prevention after distal radius fracture in elderly patients
T2  - TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Fractures of the distal radius are one of the most common osteoporotic fractures in elderly men and women. These fractures are a particular health concern amongst the elderly, who are at risk of fragility fractures, and are associated with long-term functional impairment, pain and a variety of complications. This is a sentinel event, as these fractures are associated with a two to four times increased risk of subsequent hip fractures in elderly patients. This is an important concept, as it is well established that these patients have an increased risk of falling. Fall prevention is therefore crucial to decrease further morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of low-magnitude high-frequency vibration (LMHFV) on postural stability and prevention of falls in elderly patients post distal radius fracture. Methods This is a prospective single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Two hundred patients will be recruited consecutively with consent, and randomized to either LMHFV (n = 100) or a control group (n = 100). The primary outcome is postural stability measured by the static and dynamic ability of patients to maintain centre of balance on the Biodex Balance System SD. Secondary outcomes are the occurrence of fall(s), the health-related quality of life 36-item short form instrument, the Timed Up and Go test for basic mobility skills, compliance and adverse events. Outcome assessments for both groups will be performed at baseline (0 month) and at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months time points. Discussion Previous studies have stressed the importance of reducing falls after distal radius fracture has occurred in elderly patients, and an effective intervention is crucial. Numerous studies have proven vibration therapy to be effective in improving balancing ability in normal patients; However, no previous study has applied the device for patients with fractures. Our study will attempt to translate LMHFV to patients with fractures to improve postural stability and prevent recurrent falls. Positive results would provide a large impact on the prevention of secondary fractures and save healthcare costs.

TI  - Validating InSAR-SBAS results by means of different GNSS analysis techniques in medium- and high-grade deformation areas
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to validate the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method by using relative and absolute Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) techniques. In this context, two land subsidence areas, one high (Mexico City) and one medium (Aguascalientes), were monitored between 2014 and 2018 by using Sentinel 1A satellite data. The monitoring was carried out with the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) technique using 46 images for Mexico City and 18 images for Aguascalientes. Concordantly, the GNSS Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) data in the regions were analyzed with relative and Precise Point Positioning (PPP) GNSS analysis techniques. The time series obtained from three different analyses were compared and the results were evaluated in light of statistical criteria. According to the results, it is determined that the InSAR-SBAS technique can vary up to +/- 20 mm from the displacement values obtained from GNSS due to various noise sources. Such deviations were limited to a few samples, and in general the differentiations were reasonable in the range of 7-8 mm. The difference between the deformation velocity estimation results obtained from the three different methods varied between 3 and 10 mm/year. In this context, these findings suggest that the InSAR-SBAS technique is an effective method for monitoring land deformation with the accuracy of sub-centimeter decided. In addition, PPP which has become an increasingly popular technique showed fast and reliable results in the range of 5-10 mm for InSAR verification. Moreover, with this study, most current results for Mexico City, which is the world's fastest subsiding metropole, were achieved. In the central region of the city, the detected 300 mm/year of subsidence rate was updated as 370 mm/year. In addition, Aguascalientes was monitored by using the Sentinel 1A satellite mission for the first time in this study. The 60 mm/year subsidence rate obtained for Aguascalientes in previous studies was updated and it was estimated that there are zones where this rate reaches up to - 115 mm/year levels. In this regard, it was concluded that the deformation rate has increased for both regions since the previous monitoring studies.

TI  - Failure mechanism and dynamic processes of rock avalanche occurrence in Chengkun railway, China, on August 14, 2019
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rock avalanches are unpredictable due to their complex geological conditions and dynamics and such features have been regarded as important reasons for property damage and fatalities. The Ganluo rock avalanche of August 14, 2019 in China provides an outstanding case to evaluate the failure mechanism and dynamic process of long-runout rock avalanches. To understand the failure mechanism and dynamics of such events, a combination of in situ investigation, remote sensing data study, and simulation is performed. The result shows that the Ganluo rock avalanche released a rock mass volume of approximately 5.20 x 10(4) m(3) that detached from the slope, and 1.52 x 10(4) m(3) of unstable rock mass is still in the source zone. The analysis indicated that the prerequisite for the rock avalanche was continuous heavy rainfall, which occurred in the preceding months. The simulation shows the maximum sliding velocity is approximately 22 m/s. Additionally, the potential destructive zone of the unstable rock mass is evaluated, which can provide a reference for secondary disaster prediction.

TI  - Impact assessment of a super-typhoon on Hong Kong's secondary vegetation and recommendations for restoration of resilience in the forest succession
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoons of varying intensities severely impact ecosystem functioning in tropical regions and their increasing frequencies and intensities due to global warming pose new challenges for effective forest restoration. This study examines the impact of a super-typhoon (Mangkhut) on the regenerating native secondary forest and exotic monocultural plantations in the degraded tropical landscape of Hong Kong. The super typhoon, which hit Hong Kong on 16 September 2018 lasted for 10 h (09:40-19:40) and was the most severe storm affecting Hong Kong over the past 100 years. Hong Kong's secondary forest is a mosaic of forest patches recovering through natural succession since 1945, and plantation stands of exotic monocultural species. We determine the loss in biomass by performing NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) difference analysis using two Landsat-8 multispectral images acquired before and after the typhoon. This the assessment of typhoon impacts according to successional age group, structural stages of vegetation, landscape topography, and on stands of exotic plantations. Results indicate that hilltops, open shrubland and grassland were hard hit, especially on southwest and southeast facing slopes, and almost 90% of the landscape showed abnormal change. Patches of exotic monoculture plantation (Lophostemon confertus, Melaleuca quinquenervia, and Acacia confusa) were the most severely damaged by the typhoon, showing more than 25% decrease in NDVI, followed by young secondary forest. Field observations confirmed that in exotic plantations, almost the entire canopy was destroyed and there is no generation of young under story trees to replace those lost. The affected young forests and shrublands are mainly dominated by fast growing, soft wooded early successional species such as Mallotus paniculatus or Machilus chekiangensis as well as weak, multi-trunked, fungus infected, or other structurally deficient trees, which were uprooted or seriously damaged by typhoon gusts. The net effect of typhoons in Hong Kong's degraded landscape, appears to reinforce the arrested succession of dense, less diverse stands of weaker early successional species due to the absence of late and middle successional species and native dispersal agents. In order to obtain a stronger, more resilient forest, it would be necessary to enhance biodiversity by artificially planting a species mix, which resembles primary forests in the region. This could be achieved by thinning of young secondary forest followed by enhancement planting of pockets of high diversity forest.

TI  - Impact of rainfall extremes on energy exchange and surface temperature anomalies across biomes in the Horn of Africa
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation extremes have a strong influence on the exchange of energy and water between the land surface and the atmosphere. Although the Horn of Africa has faced recurrent drought and flood events in recent decades, it is still unclear how these events impact energy exchange and surface temperature across different ecosystems. Here, we analyzed the impact of precipitation extremes on spectral albedo (total shortwave, visible, and near-infrared (NIR) broadband albedos), energy balance, and surface temperature in four natural vegetation types: forest, savanna, grassland, and shrubland. We used remotely sensed observations of surface biophysical properties and climate from 2001 to 2016. Our results showed that, in forests and savannas, precipitation extremes led to divergent spectral changes in visible and NIR albedos, which cancelled each other limiting shortwave albedo changes. An exception to this pattern was observed in shrublands and grasslands, where both visible and NIR albedo increased during drought events. Given that shrublands and grasslands occupy a large fraction of the Horn of Africa (52%), our results unveil the importance of these ecosystems in driving the magnitude of shortwave radiative forcing in the region. The average regional shortwave radiative forcing during drought events (-0.64 W m(-2), SD 0.11) was around twice that of the extreme wet events (0.33 W m(-2), SD 0.09). Such shortwave forcing, however, was too small to influence the surface-atmosphere coupling. In contrast, the surface feedback through turbulent flux changes was strong across vegetation types and had a significant (P < 0.05) impact on the surface temperature and net radiation anomalies, except in forests. The strongest energy exchange and surface temperature anomalies were observed over grassland and the smallest over forest, which was shown to be resilient to precipitation extremes. These results suggest that land management activities that support forest preservation, afforestation, and reforestation can help to mitigate the impact of drought through their role in modulating energy fluxes and surface temperature anomalies in the region.

TI  - The 6-8 Aug 2019 eruption of 'Volcano F' in the Tofua Arc, Tonga
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In August 2019 a large raft of pumice appeared in the territorial waters of Tonga. As in many other cases, this pumice raft was the only surface expression of a major submarine volcanic eruption. Discolored water and reconstruction of the drift path of the pumice raft using satellite imagery points towards 'Volcano F' in the Tofua Arc NW of the island of Vava'u as the most likely volcanic source. Here we present imagery from ESA's Sentinel-2 satellite that captured the start of the submarine eruption on 6 August 2019 and the waning of the eruption on 8 August, followed by observations of the drifting pumice raft until 14 August. This start time is consistent with T-phase records at the seismic stations on Niue Island and Rarotonga and the signal delay time of 733 s between the two stations is consistent with an origin at or at least near Volcano F. On 8 August, a >136.7 km(2) large raft of pumice appears at the sea surface. The modelled minimum raft volume is 8.2-41.0*10 6 m(3), which is equivalent to 2.5-12.3*10 6 m(3) dense rock The eruption thus corresponds to a volcanic explosivity index (VEI) 2-3 eruption in the submarine environment. Prior to the volcanic eruption, a series of earthquakes close to Volcano F was recorded. The series started on 5 August with a Mb 4.7 event, followed by at least six shallow earthquakes (Mb >3.9) on 6 August. In December 2018 and January 2019, we surveyed the seafloor around Volcano F with multibeam sonar. Combining our data with pre-existing information, we present the first comprehensive bathymetric map of the volcanic edifice and its geologic setting. We show that Volcano F represents a major arc volcanic complex that is situated in an extensional setting. The basal diameter of the volcanic apron is >50 km with a large central, 8.7 x 6 km caldera with a floor at similar to 700 m water depth. The top of the post-caldera constructional cone complex had a summit depth of 35 m below sea level in 2004. The volcano shows geochemical differences to the adjacent arc volcanoes on Fonualei and Late islands. The volcano's pristine volcanic morphology and two documented eruptions (2001 and 2019) indicate a highly active volcanic system that warrants further scientific attention. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Metastatic fibrohistiocytic tumor of the gallbladder is an exceedingly rare entity that may lead to hemobilia or even hypovolemic shock. Its clinical course presents with acute or chronic upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding. Emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed prior to progression to life-threatening shock. Herein, we report a 47-year-old female presenting with poorly controlled anemia, melena, and fatigue over a half-year period. After surgical and postoperative pathological analysis, she was finally diagnosed as a lymph node hemorrhage associated with intraluminal metastatic fibrohistiocytic tumor of the gallbladder.

TI  - Retrievals of Sea Surface Current Vectors from Geostationary Satellite Data (Himawari-8/AHI)
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An operational sea surface current (SSC) retrieval algorithm was developed using consecutive Himawari-8/AHI data based on a feature tracking method. Comparative analyses were conducted to determine the appropriate input data for the SSC retrieval algorithm. Investigation of the input data revealed some limitations in the use of single-band brightness temperatures caused by atmospheric features under moist conditions, especially in the mid- and low-latitude regions. Because of the motion of atmospheric features, cloud and cloud-contaminated pixels tended to contribute to the overestimation of SSC. To reduce overestimation, sea surface temperature images were used as input data and the feature tracking method was applied to calculate the displacement of the surface current vectors. The estimated currents were subjected to a quality control process to remove erroneous vectors. The accuracy of the retrieved surface currents was assessed by comparing the results with the quality-controlled currents obtained from surface drifters in the full-disk region of Himawari-8/AHI. The results revealed that the estimated current speeds and directions agreed with the drifter-based calculated values-the root-mean-square (bias) errors were 0.35 ms(-1) (0.11 ms(-1)) and 33.28 degrees (5.47 degrees), respectively. The estimated current field showed diverse dynamic ocean features, such as a rotating feature around a mesoscale eddy and the characteristic meandering pattern of the Kuroshio Current. Hourly varying surface current fields from geostationary satellite data with high spatio-temporal resolution are expected to augment oceanic and atmospheric applications in real time.

TI  - Long time series spatialized data for urban climatological studies: A case study of Paris, France
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Historically, the urban climate and its interaction with regional environment and larger-scale meteorological phenomena have been studied by comparing weather stations in urban and surrounding rural areas. Nevertheless, spatialized meteorological data are now available with different spatial resolutions, temporal frequencies, and time depths. Here with the Paris area as a case study, three products were selected for their comparable spatial resolution of 1 km, their daily frequency, and a minimum 15-year time period with substantial common overlap: the MODIS products for land surface temperature (2000-2016), daily maps of minimum and maximum 2-m air temperatures (2000-2017) based on a statistical method of spatialization, and the COMEPHORE analysis for precipitation (1997-2012). Several spatialized indicators were used to monitor the urban climate and its impact on local climate. The intensity and spatial extent of both the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and the urban heat island of urban canopy layer (UHI), as well as the effect of the city on precipitation, were characterized. Based on these indicators, a climatological study was made for the Paris urban area and its surroundings. The comparison of (S)UHI climatologies showed that both phenomena (qualified by their intensity and spatial extent) have comparable seasonalities and orders of magnitude at night. The maximum intensity is reached in July, with more than 60% of the city affected by high temperatures. However, the phenomena differ during the day: the SUHI is mostly driven by the differences in surface properties between urban and rural environments, whereas the UHI is more influenced by general wind circulation and local atmospheric turbulence. Finally, the COMEPHORE analysis highlighted the influence of the Paris urban area on rainfall. It is observed throughout the year with an excess in daily precipitation of 29% downwind of the city, with some seasonal variability showing a more pronounced effect in summer.

TI  - An approach for retrieval of horizontal and vertical distribution of total suspended matter concentration from GOCI data over Lake Hongze
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There are a few studies working on the vertical distribution of TSM, however, understanding the underwater profile of TSM is of great benefit to the study of biogeochemical processes in the water column that still require further research. In this study, three data-gathering expeditions were conducted in Lake Hongze (HZL), China, between 2016 and 2018. Based on the in situ optical and biological data, a multivariate linear stepwise regression method was applied for retrieval of the surface horizontal distribution of TSM (TSM0.2) using GOCI (Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) data. Then, the estimation model of vertical structure of underwater TSM was constructed using layer-by-layer recursion. This study drew several crucial findings: (1) the approach proposed in this paper generated very high goodness of fit results, with determination coefficients (R-2) of 0.83 (p < 0.001, N= 54), and with smaller prediction errors (the mean absolute percentage error is determined to be 16.34%, the root mean square error is 9.01 mg(-1), and the mean ratio is 1.00, N = 26). (2) The monthly surface TSM and the column mass of suspended matter (CMSM) are affected by both wind speed and precipitation in HZL. In addition, the hourly variation of surface TSM and CMSM are driven by local wind, most especially in spring and winter. (3) Compared with the non-uniform hypothesis, the CMSM derived by conventional vertical uniformity hypothesis was underestimated by almost 10% in HZL during 2016. This should warrant the attention of lake managers and lake environmental evolution researchers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Change in Autumn Vegetation Phenology and the Climate Controls From 1982 to 2012 on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Autumn vegetation phenology plays a critical role in the survival and reproduction of vegetation in changing environments. Using GIMMS3g (Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies), MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging and Spectroradiometer), and SPOT (Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre) remote sensing data, we investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of the vegetation dormancy onset date (DOD) and its response to temperature, precipitation, and cold degree days (CDD) in different biomes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) from 1982 to 2012. Our results indicated that there was no significant temporal trend in the DOD for the vegetation on the QTP but found clear regional characteristics in the DOD trends with a notably advancing trend in the central region and a widespread delay in the southwestern region (>1 day year(-1), P < 0.05). Our results also indicated that temperature plays an important role in the trend of delays in vegetation autumn phenology; in particular, the preseason temperature can delay the DOD significantly; the positive correlations were observed in more than 71% of the study areas. Consistent with previous studies, we observed significant negative correlations between preseason CDD and DOD; the negative correlations were observed in more than 72% of the study areas for all the data sets. In contrast, the effects of precipitation on DOD were biome dependent. We found that precipitation could promote the extension of the growing season in meadow and grass biomes but produce weak effects on vegetation dormancy in forest biomes. Therefore, not only the magnitude but also the timing of changes in temperature and precipitation determines the effects of climate factors on DOD and further suggests that biome-specific phenological responses also need to be integrated into vegetation phenology models for future climate change investigations on the QTP.

TI  - Which water bird groups need greater habitat conservation measures in a wetland ecosystem?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - One important issue in wildlife conservation is the identification of the groups of species that need greater conservation measures. In this regard, maps of habitat degradation are useful tools. However, water bird habitat mapping in wetland ecosystem is difficult due to the large extent and complexity of wetlands and the narrow boundary between the habitats of different groups. In this paper, the capabilities of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data were applied to overcome these limitations and to provide a practical scheme to conserve water bird habitats. The significance of this paper is the novel application of the SAR capabilities for water bird habitat conservation. These data were used to separate the habitat of the three water bird groups and to determine the destroyed habitats that should be protected for water birds in wetlands with unstable conditions. Using Sentinel1 (S1) data, habitat maps for the water birds were created during the inundation period in the Hamoun-eHirmand. These habitats included the shrub swamps, flooded meadows, and open water. Based on the four-month flooded period of the wetland and the S1 image archive, habitat maps were created for six dates. The SAR backscattering coefficients of these three habitat classes were first analyzed to investigate the potential of the S1 images to differentiate between the habitat classes. A support vector machine (SVM) was then developed to separate the habitat classes. The accuracy of the six produced maps was calculated to be between 81% and 87.5%, which confirmed the ability of the S1 images to differentiate between water bird habitat classes. Based on the habitat degradation analysis, Anatidae, Charadriiformes, Ciconiiformes, Gruidae, Pelecanidae and the diving ducks need greater conservational measures in their feeding habitats (flooded meadow and open water). This paper introduced S1 data as an effective tool for mapping the habitats of each group of water birds in a wetland.

TI  - The mosquito electrocuting trap as an exposure-free method for measuring human-biting rates by <i>Aedes</i> mosquito vectors
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Entomological monitoring of Aedes vectors has largely relied on surveillance of larvae, pupae and non-host-seeking adults, which have been poorly correlated with human disease incidence. Exposure to mosquito-borne diseases can be more directly estimated using human landing catches (HLC), although this method is not recommended for Aedes-borne arboviruses. We evaluated a new method previously tested with malaria vectors, the mosquito electrocuting trap (MET) as an exposure-free alternative for measuring landing rates of Aedes mosquitoes on people. Aims were to (i) compare the MET to the BG-sentinel (BGS) trap gold standard approach for sampling host-seeking Aedes vectors; and (ii) characterize the diel activity of Aedes vectors and their association with microclimatic conditions. Methods The study was conducted over 12 days in Quininde (Ecuador) in May 2017. Mosquito sampling stations were set up in the peridomestic area of four houses. On each day of sampling, each house was allocated either a MET or a BGS trap, which were rotated amongst the four houses daily in a Latin square design. Mosquito abundance and microclimatic conditions were recorded hourly at each sampling station between 7:00-19:00 h to assess variation between vector abundance, trapping methods, and environmental conditions. All Aedes aegypti females were tested for the presence of Zika (ZIKV), dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses. Results A higher number of Ae. aegypti females were found in MET than in BGS collections, although no statistically significant differences in mean Ae. aegypti abundance between trapping methods were found. Both trapping methods indicated female Ae. aegypti had bimodal patterns of host-seeking, being highest during early morning and late afternoon hours. Mean Ae. aegypti daily abundance was negatively associated with daily temperature. No infection by ZIKV, DENV or CHIKV was detected in any Aedes mosquitoes caught by either trapping method. Conclusion We conclude the MET performs at least as well as the BGS standard and offers the additional advantage of direct measurement of per capita human-biting rates. If detection of arboviruses can be confirmed in MET-collected Aedes in future studies, this surveillance method could provide a valuable tool for surveillance and prediction on human arboviral exposure risk.

TI  - Remotely sensed rivers in the Anthropocene: state of the art and prospects
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rivers of the world are undergoing accelerated change in the Anthropocene, and need to be managed at much broader spatial and temporal scales than before. Fluvial remote sensing now offers a technical and methodological framework that can be deployed to monitor the processes at work and to assess the trajectories of rivers in the Anthropocene. In this paper, we review research investigating past, present and future fluvial corridor conditions and processes using remote sensing and we consider emerging challenges facing fluvial and riparian research. We introduce a suite of remote sensing methods designed to diagnose river changes at reach to regional scales. We then focus on identification of channel patterns and acting processes from satellite, airborne or ground acquisitions. These techniques range from grain scales to landform scales, and from real time scales to inter-annual scales. We discuss how remote sensing data can now be coupled to catchment scale models that simulate sediment transfer within connected river networks. We also consider future opportunities in terms of datasets and other resources which are likely to impact river management and monitoring at the global scale. We conclude with a summary of challenges and prospects for remotely sensed rivers in the Anthropocene. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - The Role of the Orthopaedic Surgeon in the Identification and Management of Nonaccidental Trauma
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGEONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Nonaccidental trauma (NAT) has short- and long-term effects on the patient. The importance of identification and management of injuries related to NAT can be vital to the disruption of patterns of abuse and can ultimately save lives. The purpose of this review is to educate the orthopaedic surgeon as the frontline provider in the treatment of these patients. Understanding the risk factors for abuse, sentinel signs on clinical examination, and questionable fracture patterns related to NAT enables providers to better identify and address children at risk of abuse or neglect. Equally as important, understanding pathologic states that can mimic NAT allows the orthopaedic surgeon the tools necessary to address all patients with multiple and/or unexplained fractures. Understanding the legal expectations and protections for practicing orthopaedic surgeons as mandated reporters and the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to intervention in these settings will improve patient experiences and outcomes.

TI  - Evaluation of NDVI Estimation Considering Atmospheric and BRDF Correction through Himawari-8/AHI
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based vegetation indices are an essential element in understanding the Earth's surface. In this study, we estimated the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data and analyzed the sensitivity of products to atmospheric and surface correction. We used the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative transfer model for atmospheric correction, and kernel-based semi-empirical bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model to remove surface anisotropic effects. From this, top-of-atmosphere, top-of-canopy, and normalized NDVIs were produced. A sensitivity analysis showed that the normalized NDVI had the lowest number of missing values compared with the others and almost no low peaks during the study period. These results were validated by Terra and Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Project for On-Board Autonomy/Vegetation (PROBA) NDVI product, showing the root mean square error (RMSE) and bias of 0.09 and + 0.04 (MODIS) and 0.09 and - 0.04 (PROBA), respectively. These results also satisfied the FP7 Geoland2/BioPar project-defined user requirements (threshold: 0.15; target: 0.10).

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Pollution Evolution in China in Recent 20 Years
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - We use measured aerosol fine particulate matter (PM2.5) data, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, and meteorological parameters (temperature, wind speed, wind direction, boundary layer height, and relative humidity) from the Chinese national control monitoring network, to consider seasonal and regional differences in the relationship between AOD and PM2.5. We propose a two-stage combined estimation model of PM2.5 concentrations based on the epsilon-support vector regression (epsilon-SVR/Epsilon-SVR) and the Mind Evolutionary Computation-BP neural network (MEC-BP) for analyzing spatiotemporal variations in PM2.5 concentrations in China between 2000 and 2017. The results showed that the two-stage combined estimation model provided a reliable estimation of the monthly ground-level PM2.5 concentrations at a spatial resolution of 1 degrees x1 degrees during 2000-2017 in China. This effectively offsets the time and space gaps in the current data sets of the ground monitoring network (R-2=0.838, root mean square errors (RMSE)=11.512 mu g.m(-3), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)=14.905%, mean squared percentage error (MSPE)=0.243%, mean absolute error (MAE)=6.476 mu g.m(-3), mean squared error (MSE)=132.519 mu g.m(-3)). The preliminary spatiotemporal analysis results showed that: (1) Over the period 2000-2017, 2014 represented an important demarcation point for the annual PM2.5 concentration, as its trend changed from one of continuous increase to one of rapid decrease. The PM2.5 concentration decreases more rapidly in areas with high concentrations of PM2.5 in particular, including the northern coastal area, the eastern coastal area, and the middle reaches of the Changjiang River. (2) During the studied period, the annual average PM2.5 concentration exceeded the second level criterion of the Chinese national air quality standard (35 mu g.m(-3)) over more than 65% of China. Although the PM2.5 pollution situation in China improved to a certain extent in the latter years of the studied period, the air pollution situation remained poor.

TI  - Satellite Image-Based Time Series Observations of Vegetation Response to Hurricane Irma in the Lower Florida Keys
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution satellite imaging represents a potentially effective technique to monitor cyclone-caused environmental damage and recovery over large areas at a high spatial scale. This study utilized a 10-m resolution Sentinel satellite image series to document vegetation changes in a portion of the Florida Keys, USA, over which the core of Category 4 Hurricane Irma passed on 10 September 2017. A previously assembled field survey was used to establish land-cover patterns in the satellite data, and concurrent field measurements verified post-hurricane changes. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was utilized as a tracer for pre-storm baseline patterns and through 19 post-storm months. NDVI patterns show that the severity of vegetation damage varied appreciably across the area, with the least damage on islands in the western sector of the hurricane's eye and around its center, and greatest damage on islands just east of the eye. The data reveal that for 2.5 months after the storm, multiple inland vegetation classes showed substantial early regrowth. However, mangrove forests were more negatively affected. The storm caused extensive mortality of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) and red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), corresponding to more than 40% of the total mangrove area on some islands. The full extent of mangrove die-off was not immediately evident, and increased progressively through the first few months after the storm. In addition to demonstrating the utility of high-resolution satellite image series for post-hurricane environmental assessment, this study reveals high-resolution links between vegetation types, their location within the cyclone, and the extent of post-storm recovery.

TI  - Prediction of daily <i>PM</i><sub>2.5</sub> concentration in China using data-driven ordinary differential equations
T2  - APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate reporting and forecasting of PM2.5 concentration are important for improving public health. In this paper, we propose a daily prediction method of PM2.5 concentration by using data-driven ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. Specifically, based on the historical PM2.5 concentration, this method combines genetic programming and orthogonal least square method to evolve the ODE models, which describe the transport of PM2.5 and then uses the data-driven ODEs to predict the air quality in the future. Experiment results show that the ODE models obtain similar prediction results as the typical statistical model, and the prediction results from this method are relatively good. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to evolve data-driven ODE models to study PM2.5 prediction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing structural changes at the forest edge using kernel density estimation
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the strong impact of the composition and structure of the forest edge on forest ecosystems, the value of investigating changes at the forest edge has been recognized for a few decades. Automatic quantification and detection of forest edge changes has advantages over fieldwork with respect to the time and cost required. Based on the structural features extracted from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data, in this study an automatic method using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) was developed to describe ALS point data related to the forest edge in terms of a finite number of interpretable indicators. The method was applied to identify patterns in data sets at the forest edge between two given dates (2001 and 2014) in European temperate mixed forests. The study area has an extent of 1403 km(2) and the total length of forest boundary is approx. 5000 km.The calculated structural features explained the vegetation's height distribution and the structural variance at the forest edge. The kernel density curves represented the general structural diversity of the study area. Three extracted Indicators described the shape of the kernel density curves and reflected the dynamics of the studied forest edge area. Overall, results from this study show that the proposed approach is a promising tool for using remote sensing data to analyze whether or not the vertical structure of the forest edge for the entire study area has changed and thus to assess automatically the progress of forest management at forest edge.

TI  - LiDAR data as a proxy for light availability improve distribution modelling of woody species
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern multifunctional forest management can profit from high-quality information on the potential distribution of woody species generated by species distribution models (SDMs). Forest structure is an important factor in determining the distribution of woody species in forests, for example because it affects light conditions within forest stands. Remotely sensed data from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can capture this three-dimensional structure of forests, leading to the expectation that LiDAR-derived data should enhance the predictive performance of SDMs. We test if and how LiDAR-derived data increases the predictive performance of SDMs for light-demanding and shade-tolerant shrub and tree species in Swiss forests. Our analyses suggest that LiDAR-derived data generally increases predictive performance of models. However, the response to including LiDAR-derived data varies depending on plant functional type: the increase in predictive performance is largest for light-demanding shrubs, reduced for light-demanding trees, and is lost for shade-tolerant species. We further find that shade-tolerant and light-demanding species show opposing responses along the LiDAR-derived predictors. Our results suggest that LiDAR-derived data indeed capture some aspects of light availability in forests, and that including LiDAR-derived predictors in SDMs should be considered for light-demanding shrubs, but may be of less use for trees (especially if shade-tolerant). We conclude that improving SDMs and resulting maps by including LiDAR-derived predictors potentially helps to ameliorate multifunctional, biodiversity-friendly forest stand management.

TI  - Assessments of gross primary productivity estimations with satellite data-driven models using eddy covariance observation sites over the northern hemisphere
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate quantification of gross primary productivity (GPP) has been a major challenge in global climate change research. Satellite data-driven models have been universally used as scientific tools for investigating the carbon cycle, including vegetation index (VI)-based models, light use efficiency (LUE) models, and process-based models. However, inconsistencies and uncertainties have been found in the GPP estimations from various models. The understanding of model behaviors under different climatic conditions remains unclear. In this study, three typical satellite data-driven models, namely, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP (MOD17) model, Temperature and Greenness (TG) model and Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS), respectively, were compared to better understand discrepancies and uncertainties in GPP estimations at 119 northern eddy covariance (EC) sites. Due to the variations in climatic drivers of GPP, temperature, precipitation and incoming solar radiation were selected to describe climatic conditions. The results showed that BEPS and MOD17 exhibited similar performance in simulating GPP, with root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of 2.50 g C m(-2) d(-1) and 2.53 g C m(-2) d(-1), respectively, and performed slightly better than TG (RMSE = 2.98 g C m(-2) d(-1)). Comparison between simulated GPP and EC GPP also revealed that model performance varied substantially among different vegetation types. The three models performed better for deciduous broadleaf forest, evergreen needleleaf forest, and mixed forest, in comparison to the results from evergreen broadleaf forest and crop. Specifically, all three models showed poor performance under the conditions of high temperature and low precipitation, revealing the models' inability to characterize the impact of water stress on photosynthesis when drought occurs. Furthermore, our results indicated that GPP estimations from satellite data-driven models were also sensitive to remotely sensed data, suggesting that the high accuracy of remotely sensed data in describing vegetation canopy is important for carbon modeling. This study highlights the importance of understanding model behaviors in different vegetation types and climatic conditions, so that the model performances may be improved in future carbon cycle studies.

TI  - Characteristics of Nitrogen Metabolism by Denitrifying Bacterial Agents in Low Dissolved Oxygen Black Odor Water
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to deal with low dissolved oxygen black odor water body of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the nitrogen metabolic capacity of ammoniated bacteria, nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria under low dissolved oxygen concentration was studied, and the relationship between denitrification efficiency and nitrogen conversion of different bacteria was clarified, which provided theoretical basis for the treatment of black odor water of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Nitrogen conversion characteristics of ammoniated bacteria (Staphylococcus sp. Ay), nitrifying bacteria (Microbacterium sp. Xw), and denitrifying bacteria (Arthrobacter sp. Fy) in simulated wastewater were detected by different concentration of bacteria and different concentration of substrates. The nitrogen metabolism of Ay, Xw and Fy in black odor water at the same concentration under low dissolved oxygen condition and the characteristics of nitrogen metabolism in different concentrations of black odor water were studied. The results showed that the bacterial concentration of Ay bacterium agent increased three times, but the ammoniation efficiency did not multiply. It indicated that increasing the concentration of ammoniated bacterium was not the best way to increase the ammoniation rate. Xw bacteria have a significant effect on the change of nitrate concentration. At 60 h, the nitrate concentration was increased 180% at low bacterial concentration, was 231% at a high bacterial concentration. Fy denitrification efficiency was high, that nitrate nitrogen can be removed quickly at lower concentration. Appropriate increase of total nitrogen concentration can increase the ammoniation efficiency of Ay microbial agent, but too high would inhibit the nitrogen metabolism efficiency of Ay microbial agent. The concentration of nitrate nitrogen of Xw bacterium reagent was increased (3736%) when the total nitrogen was 25 mg.L-1. The Fy microbial agent has no obvious effect on ammonia nitrogen removal. When the total nitrogen concentration was 25 mg.L-1, the removal rate of nitrate by Fy bacterium was the best. Overall, the results showed that the concentration of ammoniated bacteria and denitrifying bacteria could meet the need of nitrogen metabolism, and the nitrifying bacteria could increase the nitrate nitrogen synthesis rate with the increase of the concentration of nitrifying bacteria. In a certain range, increasing the concentration of substrate could increase the efficiency of nitrogen metabolism of bacterial agents, and excessive concentration would inhibit the effect of nitrogen metabolism. The study provides data support for the problem of black odor water in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

TI  - Integrating multiview optical point clouds and multispectral images from ZiYuan-3 satellite remote sensing data to generate an urban digital surface model
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to accurately extract urban digital surface models (DSMs) at a reasonable cost is quite valuable. In this study, the ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite across-track and along-track modes were used to build stereo pairs and elevation models featuring different views. Image matching processing was used to generate optical point clouds for multiple stereo pairs, which were used to analyze the effects of point cloud fusion under different scenarios and optimize the ZY-3 multiview point cloud integration. Then, with the assistance of a high-precision airborne light detection and ranging point cloud, 12 indices, including the maximum, minimum, mean, and B10 to B90, were selected from the building roof optical point cloud in order to construct an urban building elevation model. The results were as follows: (1) The across-track optical point cloud formed by stereo pairs of ZY-3 nadir images is more suitable for urban DSM extraction due to the high spatial resolution and small base/height ratio of these images. (2) The B70 index performs best in the estimated urban building elevation model [R-2 = 0.91, root mean square error (RMSE) = 5.59 m]; this model accurately identified 95.39% and 95.25% of the whole-building elevations in a narrow-scale test of 3170 buildings and a broad-scale test of 1,510,606 buildings, respectively. Moreover, the model R2 and number of accurate building elevation recognitions gradually increased with increasing numbers of fused point clouds, while the RMSE decreased significantly. (3) A combined ZY-3 multiview point cloud fusion and multispectral data analysis technique delivered a more refined urban DSM and better characterization of building elevation under complex underlying surface scenarios than were obtained using traditional stereo pair technology. This research presents the methods and theory relating to the application of similar to 2- to 6-m resolution satellite images for complex urban underlying surface scenarios.

TI  - Forest aboveground biomass stock and resilience in a tropical landscape of Thailand
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Half of Asian tropical forests were disturbed in the last century resulting in the dominance of secondary forests in Southeast Asia. However, the rate at which biomass accumulates during the recovery process in these forests is poorly understood. We studied a forest landscape located in Khao Yai National Park (Thailand) that experienced strong disturbances in the last century due to clearance by swidden farmers. Combining recent field and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, we first built a high-resolution aboveground biomass (AGB) map of over 60 km(2) of forest landscape. We then used the random forest algorithm and Landsat time series (LTS) data to classify landscape patches as non-forested versus forested on an almost annual basis from 1972 to 2017. The resulting chronosequence was then used in combination with the AGB map to estimate forest carbon recovery rates in secondary forest patches during the first 42 years of succession. The ALS-AGB model predicted AGB with an error of 14 % at 0.5 ha resolution (RMSE = 45 Mg ha(-1)) using the mean top-of-canopy height as a single predictor. The mean AGB over the landscape was 291 Mg ha(-1), showing a high level of carbon storage despite past disturbance history. We found that AGB recovery varies non-linearly in the first 42 years of the succession, with an increasing rate of accumulation through time. We predicted a mean AGB recovery rate of 6.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), with a mean AGB gain of 143 and 273 Mg ha(-1) after 20 and 40 years, respectively. This rate estimate is about 50 % larger than the rate prescribed for young secondary Asian tropical rainforests in the 2019 refinement of the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories. Our study hence suggests that the new IPCC rates, which were based on limited data from Asian tropical rainforests, strongly underestimate the carbon potential of forest regrowth in tropical Asia. Our recovery estimates are also within the range of those reported for the well-studied Latin American secondary forests under similar climatic conditions. This study illustrates the potential of ALS data not only for scaling up field AGB measurements but also for predicting AGB recovery dynamics when combined with long-term satellite data. It also illustrates that tropical forest landscapes that were disturbed in the past are of utmost importance for the regional carbon budget and thus for implementing international programs such as REDD+.

TI  - The effect of long-term brine discharge from desalination plants on benthic foraminifera
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Desalination plants along the Mediterranean Israeli coastline currently provide similar to 587 million m(3) drinking water/year, and their production is planned to increase gradually. Production of drinking water is accompanied by a nearly equivalent volume of brine discharge with a salinity of similar to 80 that is twice the normal, which can potentially impact marine ecosystems. The goal of this study was to examine whether benthic foraminifera, a known sensitive marine bio-indicator, are affected by this brine-discharge. For that, we investigated the seasonal and cumulative effect of brine discharges of three operating desalination facilities along the Israeli coast. Those facilities are located in Ashkelon, Hadera, and Sorek. The brine-discharge in the first two desalination plants is associated with thermal pollution, while the Sorek facility entails increased salinity but no thermal pollution. In four seasonal cruises during one year, we collected surface sediment samples in triplicates by grabs from the outfall (near the discharge site), and from a non-impacted control station adjacent to each study site. Our results highlight that the most robust responses were observed at two out of three desalination shallow sites (Ashkelon and Hadera), where the brine was discharged directly from a coastal outfall and was accompanied with thermal pollution from the nearby power plants. The total foraminiferal abundance and diversity were, generally, lower near the outfalls, and increased towards the control stations. Moreover, changes in the relative abundances of selected species indicate their sensitivity to the brine discharge. The most noticeable response to exclusively elevated salinity was detected at Sorek discharge site, where we observed a sharp decline in organic-cemented agglutinated benthic foraminifera, suggesting that these are particularly sensitive to elevated salinity. The herein study contribute new insights into the effect of brine discharge from desalination plants, on benthic foraminifera, and propose a scientifically-based ecological monitoring tool that can help stakeholders.

TI  - Wide-Swath Altimetric Satellite Data Assimilation With Correlated-Error Reduction
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - For decades now, satellite altimetric observations have been successfully integrated in numerical oceanographic models using data assimilation (DA). So far, sea surface height (SSH) data were provided by one-dimensional nadir altimeters. The next generation Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite altimeter will provide two-dimensional wide-swath altimetric information with an unprecedented high resolution. This new type of SSH data is expected to strongly improve altimetric assimilation. However, the SWOT data is also expected to be affected by spatially correlated errors and, hence, can not be assimilated as easily as nadir altimeters. The present paper proposes to embed a state-of-the-art correlated-error reduction (CER) method for the SWOT data into an ensemble-based DA scheme. The DA with the new correlated-error reduced-data (CER-data) is implemented and tested in a simple SSH reconstruction problem using artificial SWOT data and a quasi-geostrophic model. The results show that, in an energetic large scale region, the DA with CER-data - in comparison to the classical DA- reduces the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of the reconstruction in SSH by approximately 10%, in relative vorticity by 5% and in surface currents by 5-10%, and also slightly improves the noise-to-signal ratio and spectral coherence of the SSH signal at mesoscale (100-200 km) but with a small degradation on the large scales (>300 km). In a less energetic region, the DA with CER-data cuts down the RMSE in SSH by more than 50% on average therefore allowing a significantly more accurate reconstruction of SSH at mesoscale in terms of noise-to-signal ratio, spectral coherence, and power spectral density.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture increasingly contributes to global seafood production, requiring new farm sites for continued growth. In France, oyster cultivation has conventionally taken place in the intertidal zone, where there is little or no further room for expansion. Despite interest in moving production further offshore, more information is needed regarding the biological potential for offshore oyster growth, including its spatial and temporal variability. This study shows the use of remotely-sensed chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter concentrations retrieved from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), and sea surface temperature from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), all validated using in situ matchup measurements, as input to run a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) Pacific oyster growth model for a study site along the French Atlantic coast (Bourgneuf Bay, France). Resulting oyster growth maps were calibrated and validated using in situ measurements of total oyster weight made throughout two growing seasons, from the intertidal zone, where cultivation currently takes place, and from experimental offshore sites, for both spat (R-2 = 0.91; RMSE = 1.60 g) and adults (R-2 = 0.95; RMSE = 4.34 g). Oyster growth time series are further digested into industry-relevant indicators, such as time to achieve market weight and quality index, elaborated in consultation with local producers and industry professionals, and which are also mapped. Offshore growth is found to be feasible and to be as much as two times faster than in the intertidal zone (p < 0.001). However, the potential for growth is also revealed to be highly variable across the investigated area. Mapping reveals a clear spatial gradient in production potential in the offshore environment, with the northeastern segment of the bay far better suited than the southwestern. Results also highlight the added value of spatiotemporal data, such as satellite image time series, to drive modeling in support of marine spatial planning. The current work demonstrates the feasibility and benefit of such a coupled remote sensing-modeling approach within a shellfish farming context, responding to real and current interests of oyster producers.

TI  - Benefit of ozone observations from Sentinel-5P and future Sentinel-4 missions on tropospheric composition
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an observing simulated system experiment (OSSE) dedicated to evaluate the potential added value from the Sentinel-4 and the Sentinel-5P observations on tropospheric ozone composition. For this purpose, the ozone data of Sentinel-4 (Ultraviolet Visible Near-infrared) and Sentinel-5P (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) on board a geostationary (GEO) and a low-Earth-orbit (LEO) platform, respectively, have been simulated using the DISAMAR inversion package for the summer 2003. To ensure the robustness of the results, the OSSE has been configured with conservative assumptions. We simulate the reality by combining two chemistry transport models (CTMs): the LOng Term Ozone Simulation - EURopean Operational Smog (LOTOS-EUROS) and the Transport Model version 5 (TM5). The assimilation system is based on a different CTM, the MOdele de Chimie Atmospherique a Grande Echelle (MOCAGE), combined with the 3-D variational technique. The background error covariance matrix does not evolve in time and its variance is proportional to the field values. The simulated data are formed of six eigenvectors to minimize the size of the dataset by removing the noise-dominated part of the observations. The results show that the satellite data clearly bring direct added value around 200 hPa for the whole assimilation period and for the whole European domain, while a likely indirect added value is identified but not for the whole period and domain at 500 hPa, and to a lower extent at 700 hPa. In addition, the ozone added value from Sentinel-5P (LEO) appears close to that from Sentinel-4 (GEO) in the free troposphere (200-500 hPa) in our OSSE. The outcome of our study is a result of the OSSE design and the choice within each of the components of the system.

TI  - Learning vector quantization neural network for surface water extraction from Landsat OLI images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing concern over surface water dynamics due to an increased understanding of water availability and management with current climate trends. Remote sensing has now become an effective means of water extraction due to the availability of an enormous amount of data with diverse spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. However, water extraction from optical remote sensing data is associated with several major difficulties, such as the applicability of the extraction method over large areas and complex environments; shadow contamination from clouds, buildings, and mountains; and disclosure of shadowed water and exclusion of floating and submerged plants. To address these difficulties, a learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network-based method was proposed and implemented to extract water using Landsat 8 imageries. This method is capable of separating water from clouds, build-up areas, shadows, and shadowed water by the ideal input of bands 1 to 7 and normalized difference vegetation index. This model learns water across Sri Lanka. Eight OLI scenes were tested, and the performance was compared with five widely used machine learning algorithms: support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, discriminant analysis, combination of modified normalized difference water index and modified fuzzy clustering method, and K-means clustering methods. This method performed the best, achieving overall accuracies and the kappa coefficients between 97.8% and 99.7% and between 0.96 and 0.99, respectively. Results have demonstrated robustness, consistency, and preciseness in various dark surfaces, noisiest water environments, and highly water scarce scenes. LVQ revealed a good generalizing ability to detect all types of water with less amount of training samples. This method can be easily adaptable for other sensors and global water to support water resource studies. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Pretrained convolutional neural network for classifying rice-cropping systems based on spatial and spectral trajectories of Sentinel-2 time series
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rice-cropping system in southern China experienced a major change in the past few decades. Rice-cropping systems not only affect the comprehensive utilization intensity of agricultural resources, food security, and the ecological environment but also reveal the conditions of the agricultural policy, regional economy, and rural labor force. Consequently, accurate detection of rice-cropping systems is an essential issue. We present a method for classifying rice-cropping systems using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) that involves extracting deep features of spatial and spectral trajectories. The study area is a major rice-growing region located in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, China. Multitemporal Sentinel-2 satellite images were collected to obtain time series curves of texture (spatial trajectories) and the first derivative vegetation index (spectral trajectories) as inputs of the hierarchical classification model. The classification results of land cover and rice-cropping systems were acquired using the pretrained CNN, and the method achieved overall accuracy of 94.78% and 94.87%, respectively. This method was then compared with the support vector machine (SVM). The accuracy of rice-cropping systems using the pretrained CNN was 7.11% higher than that of the SVM. The adaptability of the model was also investigated using the time series curve in another year with relatively insufficient data. The model obtained satisfactory performance with the overall accuracy of land cover types and rice-cropping systems of 93.52% and 93.23%, respectively. We suggest that the pretrained CNN can improve the accuracy of rice-cropping system mapping by extracting deep features of spatial and spectral trajectories during the rice growth cycle and such method may be applied in other fine crop classifications.

TI  - Long- term effects of water quality on the freshwater bivalve <i>Diplodon chilensis</i> (Unionida: Hyriidae) caged at different sites in a North Patagonian river (Argentina)
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality was monitored along an Andean river of global importance using the freshwater bivalve Diplodon chilensis as sentinel species. Bivalves were placed in cages at three sites (S1-3) in the Chimehuin River in order to evaluate the long-term effects of a trout hatchery (S2) and the open dump and sewage treatment plant of a nearby city (S3). Water samples and bivalves were collected at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, from S3, S2 and from a reference site upstream (S1), and physicochemical parameters and the biological response of the caged bivalves were studied. ROS production, antioxidant response, oxidative damage, energy status and morphometric ratios were included as response biomarkers. Most of biomarkers showed site and time dependence including bivalves transplanted at S1, revealing natural variability. Both anthropogenic perturbed sites (S2 and S3) showed differences in the exposed bivalves with respect to the reference site (S1) in their biomarker responses after 9 and 12 months of exposure (July and September, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed alterations in hemocytes (ROS, TOSC and NRRT50), in energy balance in digestive gland (energy and DGF) and in the detoxification response (GST) and GSH values in gill when bivalves were exposed to hatchery waste; whereas metal and bacterial pollution (S3 in July) caused GSH increase and a reduction of lysosomal damage in hemocytes. Results show that changes in the water quality of Chimehuin River due to the anthropogenic impact can be detected using the biomarkers analysed on D. chilensis, being a useful tool for studies of long-term monitories.

TI  - Land use/land cover change and land surface temperature of Ibadan and environs, Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization is having a considerable impact on various aspects of living, thereby altering the biophysical environment. This study adopted the use of remote sensing technique and geographical information system (GIS) to analyse the relationship between changing land use/land cover and land surface temperature in a rapidly urbanizing tropical city of Ibadan between 1984 and 2019. Landsat series TM, ETM+, and OLI satellite imageries of Ibadan region city for 1984, 2002, and 2019, respectively, were obtained from the US Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat series of Earth Observation satellites accessible on the Google earth engine (GEE) platform. Supervised classification was done using a random forest (RF) machine learning classifier in the GEE platform. Surface emissivity maps were obtained from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) thresholds method and land cover information. The surface emissivity based on NDVI classes was used to retrieve land surface temperature (LST). The results showed an increase in urban cover from 341.72 km(2) in 1984 to 520.58 km(2) in 2019 with an average increase in land surface temperature from 17 degrees C to 38 degrees C, respectively. Temperature sampling in the north-south and west-east transect revealed that highly urbanized areas located at the city centre of Ibadan have the highest LST of about 38 degrees C. It dissipates to about 19 degrees C at the suburb that is less built up. A significant negative relationship exists between the health condition of vegetation (NDVI) and LST with a correlation coefficient of r = - 0.95. The study confirms the potential application of GIS and remote sensing for detecting urban growth as well as relates growth impact to LST, thereby suggesting that fitting strategies will be important for the sustainable management of the urban areas.

TI  - Near-Earth magnetotail reconnection powers space storms
T2  - NATURE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Space storms(1) are the dominant contributor to space weather. During storms, rearrangement of the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field lines at the dayside enhances global plasma circulation in the magnetosphere(2,3). As this circulation proceeds, energy is dissipated into heat in the ionosphere and near-Earth space. As Earth's dayside magnetic flux is eroded during this process, magnetotail reconnection must occur to replenish it. However, whether dissipation is powered by magnetotail (nightside) reconnection, as in storms' weaker but more commonplace relatives, substorms(4,5), or by enhanced global plasma circulation driven by dayside reconnection is unknown. Here we show that magnetotail reconnection near geosynchronous orbit powered an intense storm. Near-Earth reconnection at geocentric distances of 6.6-10 Earth radii-probably driven by the enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure and southward magnetic field-is observed from multi-satellite data. In this region, magnetic reconnection was expected to be suppressed by Earth's strong dipole field. Revealing the physical processes that power storms and the solar wind conditions responsible for them opens a new window into our understanding of space storms. It encourages future exploration of the storm-time equatorial near-Earth magnetotail to refine storm driver models and accelerate progress towards space weather prediction.

TI  - First data set of H<sub>2</sub>O/HDO columns from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Global measurements of atmospheric water vapour isotopologues aid to better understand the hydrological cycle and improve global circulation models. This paper presents a new data set of vertical column densities of H2O and HDO retrieved from short-wave infrared (2.3 mu m) reflectance measurements by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. TROPOMI features daily global coverage with a spatial resolution of up to 7km x 7km. The retrieval utilises a profile-scaling approach. The forward model neglects scattering, and strict cloud filtering is therefore necessary. For validation, recent ground-based water vapour isotopologue measurements by the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) are employed. A comparison of TCCON delta D with ground-based measurements by the Multi-platform remote Sensing of Isotopologues for investigating the Cycle of Atmospheric water (MUSICA) project for data prior to 2014 (where MUSICA data are available) shows a bias in TCCON delta D estimates. As TCCON HDO is currently not validated, an overall correction of recent TCCON HDO data is derived based on this finding. The agreement between the corrected TCCON measurements and co-located TROPOMI observations is good with an average bias of (-0.2 +/- 3) x 10(21) molec cm(-2) ((1.1 +/- 7.2) %) in H2O and (-2 +/- 7) x 10(17) molec cm(-2) ((-1.1 +/- 7.3) %) in HDO, which corresponds to a mean bias of (-14 +/- 17) parts per thousand) in a posteriori delta D. The bias is lower at low- and mid-latitude stations and higher at high-latitude stations. The use of the data set is demonstrated with a case study of a blocking anticyclone in northwestern Europe in July 2018 using single-overpass data.

TI  - An evaluation of the Zambia influenza sentinel surveillance system, 2011-2017
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Over the past decade, influenza surveillance has been established in several African countries including Zambia. However, information on the on data quality and reliability of established influenza surveillance systems in Africa are limited. Such information would enable countries to assess the performance of their surveillance systems, identify shortfalls for improvement and provide evidence of data reliability for policy making and public health interventions. Methods We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to evaluate the performance of the influenza surveillance system (ISS) in Zambia during 2011-2017 using 9 attributes: (i) data quality and completeness, (ii) timeliness, (iii) representativeness, (iv) flexibility, (v) simplicity, (vi) acceptability, (vii) stability, (viii) utility, and (ix) sustainability. Each attribute was evaluated using pre-defined indicators. For each indicator we obtained the proportion (expressed as percentage) of the outcome of interest over the total. A scale from 1 to 3 was used to provide a score for each attribute as follows: < 60% (as obtained in the calculation above) scored 1 (weak performance); 60-79% scored 2 (moderate performance); >= 80% scored 3 (good performance). An overall score for each attribute and the ISS was obtained by averaging the scores of all evaluated attributes. Results The overall mean score for the ISS in Zambia was 2.6. Key strengths of the system were the quality of data generated (score: 2.9), its flexibility (score: 3.0) especially to monitor viral pathogens other than influenza viruses, its simplicity (score: 2.8), acceptability (score: 3.0) and stability (score: 2.6) over the review period and its relatively low cost ($310,000 per annum). Identified weaknesses related mainly to geographic representativeness (score: 2.0), timeliness (score: 2.5), especially in shipment of samples from remote sites, and sustainability (score: 1.0) in the absence of external funds. Conclusions The system performed moderately well in our evaluation. Key improvements would include improvements in the timeliness of samples shipments and geographical coverage. However, these improvements would result in increased cost and logistical complexity. The ISSS in Zambia is largely reliant on external funds and the acceptability of maintaining the surveillance system through national funds would require evaluation.

TI  - Understanding the role of illicit transactions in land-change dynamics
T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in remote sensing have helped to understand the human drivers of land-use change globally, but have neglected the role of illicit transactions. This Perspective presents a framework to identify illicit land transactions, and an approach to link them to land uses using remotely sensed data.Anthropogenic land use has irrevocably transformed the natural systems on which humankind relies. Advances in remote sensing have led to an improved understanding of where, why and how social and economic processes drive globally important land-use changes, from deforestation to urbanization. The role of illicit activities, however, is often absent in land change analysis. The paucity of data on unrecorded, intentionally hidden transactions makes them difficult to incorporate into spatially specific analyses of land change. We present a conceptual framework of illicit land transactions and a two-pronged approach using remotely sensed data to spatially link illicit activities to land uses.

TI  - Influence of forest fire episodes on the distribution of gaseous air pollutants over Uttarakhand, India
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread forest fire events occurred in the foothills of North Western Himalaya during 24 April to 2 May 2016 (Event-1) and 20-30 May 2018 (Event-2). Their impacts were investigated on the distribution of pollutant gases ozone (O-3), carbon monoxide (CO), and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) over Uttarakhand using simulations of Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) and in-situ observations of these gases over Dehradun, the capital of Uttarakhand. During Event-1, the observed CO mixing ratio over Dehradun increased from 25 April 2016 onwards, attained maximum (705.8 +/- 258 ppbv) on 2 May 2016 and subsequently decreased. The rate of increase of daily baseline CO was 29 ppbv/day during HFAP (High Fire Activity Period). During Event-2, daily average concentrations of CO, O-3, and NOx showed systematic increase over Dehradun during HFAP period. The rate of increase of CO was 9 ppbv/day, while it was very small for NOx and O-3. To quantitatively estimate the influence of forest fire emissions, two WRF-Chem simulations were made: one with biomass burning (BB) emissions and other without BB emissions. These simulations showed 52% (34%) enhancement in CO, 52% (32%) enhancement in NOx, and 11% (9%) enhancement in O-3 during HFAP for Event-1 (Event-2). A clear positive correlation (r = 0.89 for Event-1, r = 0.69 for Event-2) was found between increment O-3 (O-3with BB minus O-3without BB) and increment CO (COwith BB minus COwithout BB), indicating rapid production of ozone in the fire plumes. For both the events, the vertical distribution of increment O-3, increment CO, and increment NOx showed that forest fire emissions influenced the air quality upto 6.5 km altitude. Peaks in increment O-3, increment CO, and increment NOx during different days suggested the role of varying dispersion and horizontal mixing of fire plumes.

TI  - The Rise of Faith-Based Welfare Providers in Germany and Its Consequences
T2  - GERMAN POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1970s welfare organisations operated by the churches in Germany have evolved into the country's largest employers. While church affiliation and attendance dropped sharply, the churches grew as employers. Caritas and Diakonie, the two largest faith-based welfare providers, enjoy a special status as ecclesiastical employers. They can dismiss employees that do not live in congruence with their worldview such as homosexuals, those who have re-married or those who exit the church. Moreover their employees are exempted from the right to strike. The following is the first study that offers a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenal rise of faith-based welfare providers in Germany and the consequences of their special status for employees. The encompassing analysis of labour-law conflicts in German courts between ecclesiastical employers and their employees shows that the contentiousness of those controversies has increased over time. We explain this with the changed composition in the workforce of Caritas and Diakonie which has, in contrast to former times, today much less connection to the values of the church. Moreover, our analysis of legal cases shows that Caritas and Diakonie so far have been able to successfully defend their special status in front of German courts.

TI  - Oceanographic preferences of yellowfin tuna (<i>Thunnus albacares</i>) in warm stratified oceans: A remote sensing approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares, Bonnaterre, 1788; YFT) face extensive exploitation pressure worldwide owing to the attractive economics of these fisheries. A better understanding of how oceanography influences the distribution of YFT (or highly migratory species more generally) will improve the ability for fisheries management policies to achieve conservation (e.g., maintain a stocks reproductive capacity), economic (e.g., maximize gross domestic product), and social (e.g., optimize successful fishing opportunities) objectives. Such ecosystem-based linkages, when combined with real-time remote sensing data, provide the predictive framework for enhancing favourable fishing opportunities and limiting excessive harvest. We examined factors influencing YFT distribution and behaviour using pop-up satellite archival tags and remotely sensed oceanographic data from two regions in the northern Indian Ocean. Tagged individuals did not exhibit significant deep diving or diurnal behaviour, and preferred ambient temperatures of 26-30 degrees C and 25-29 degrees C in the Arabian Sea (AS) and the Bay of Bengal (BoB), respectively. In general, tagged YFT were found to be in waters with sea surface temperatures of 26-29 degrees C, 60% of the time and within a sea surface height-anomaly of +/- 6 cm 70% of the time. YFT avoided moving below the relatively shallow oxycline depth, which is indicative of the stratified waters of the AS and the BoB. Low dissolved oxygen levels are likely a limiting factor for tuna movement given their high oxygen demand. The northern Indian Ocean provides an opportunity to study climate impacts on fish distribution and movement, and our findings provide a basis for understanding how habitat and migratory patterns may be altered under climate change.

TI  - Mechanisms for ballistic block ejection during the 2016-2017 shallow submarine eruption of Bogoslof volcano, Alaska
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ejection of ballistic blocks was a characteristic feature of the 2016-2017 Bogoslof eruption. High-resolution satellite images acquired throughout the duration of the 9-month long eruptive period permitted the recognition and mapping of ballistic blocks on the surface of Bogoslof Island. Many of the satellite images recorded the accumulation of ballistic material over several individual eruptive events, but a few images recorded the effects of a single event. The nonuniform spatial distribution of blocks suggests that some of the eruption columns were inclined. Ballistic trajectories were estimated using the Eject! model and indicate that accumulation of blocks on Bogoslof Island required launch angles of 45-80 degrees and initial velocities of 50-100 ms(-1) to reproduce observed travel distances. The amount of ballistic fallout observed in satellite data indicates that there must have been a shallow submarine source of rock within the conduit/upper edifice system. Dense, accidental cryptodome trachyandesite, and juvenile basalt to trachybasalt scoria make up the bulk of the surface ejecta. Abundant accidental fragments and inclined eruption columns point to periodic vent-wall collapse and jetting around edges of temporarily blocked vents as the likely cause of ballistic ejection.

TI  - Streamlined Development of Targeted Mass Spectrometry-Based Method Combining Scout-MRM and a Web-Based Tool Indexed with Scout Peptides
T2  - PROTEOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - MS-based targeted proteomics is a relevant technology for sensitive and robust relative or absolute quantification of proteins biomarker candidates in complex human biofluids or tissue extracts. Performing a multiplex assay imposes time scheduling of peptide monitoring only around their expected retention time that needs to be defined with synthetic peptide. Time-scheduled monitoring is clearly a constraint that precludes from straightforward assay transfer between biological matrices or distinct experimental setup. Any unexpected retention time (RT) shift challenges assay robustness and its implementation for large-scale analysis. Recently, Scout-multiple reaction monitoring that fully releases multiplexed targeted acquisition from RT scheduling by successively monitoring complex transition groups triggered with sentinel molecules called Scout has been introduced. It is herein documented how Peptide Selector database and tool streamlines the building of a multiplexed method thanks to RT indexation relative to Scout peptides. This case study deals with surrogate peptides of biomarker candidates related to drug-induced liver and vascular injury, running such on-line built method (eight Scouts triggering the monitoring of a total of 692 transitions) enables 100% recovery of a panel of 93 spiked-in heavy labeled standards, despite significant RT shifts between serum, plasma, or urine. This result illustrates the simplicity of automatically building and deploying robust proteomics targeted assay.

TI  - Cloud-computing and machine learning in support of country-level land cover and ecosystem extent mapping in Liberia and Gabon
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Liberia and Gabon joined the Gaborone Declaration for Sustainability in Africa (GDSA), established in 2012, with the goal of incorporating the value of nature into national decision making by estimating the multiple services obtained from ecosystems using the natural capital accounting framework. In this study, we produced 30-m resolution 10 classes land cover maps for the 2015 epoch for Liberia and Gabon using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform to support the ongoing natural capital accounting efforts in these nations. We propose an integrated method of pixel-based classification using Landsat 8 data, the Random Forest (RF) classifier and ancillary data to produce high quality land cover products to fit a broad range of applications, including natural capital accounting. Our approach focuses on a pre-classification filtering (Masking Phase) based on spectral signature and ancillary data to reduce the number of pixels prone to be misclassified; therefore, increasing the quality of the final product. The proposed approach yields an overall accuracy of 83% and 81% for Liberia and Gabon, respectively, outperforming prior land cover products for these countries in both thematic content and accuracy. Our approach, while relatively simple and highly replicable, was able to produce high quality land cover products to fill an observational gap in up to date land cover data at national scale for Liberia and Gabon.

TI  - Evaluating the performance of two SEB models for estimating ET based on satellite images in arid regions
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface energy balance (SEB) models are one of the most important methods for estimating evapotranspiration (ET). This study was aimed at assessing the applications of two SEB models under arid conditions. This was achieved by integrating in situ meteorological data and Landsat 8 satellite images for two consecutive years (2014 and 2015) for alfalfa cultivation in 2014 and maize cultivation in 2015. The performance of the two SEB models was evaluated by comparing the ET estimated by the SEB models and that measured using an Eddy covariance (EC) instrument. Mapping the ET at high resolution using internalized calibration (METRIC) displayed the best performance in 2014, with a coefficient of determination, R-2 of 0.8, followed by the simplified surface energy balance index (S-SEBI) model (with R-2 = 0.67). In addition, METRIC showed high efficiency, with a Nash Sutcliffe (NSE) model efficiency coefficient of 0.98, followed by S-SEBI, with an NSE of 0.93. Poor performance was observed in 2015 where the R-2 for both METRIC and S-SEBI were 0.3 and 0.45, respectively. In addition, the NSE for METRIC decreased to 0.91. Conversely, the NSE for S-SEBI improved to 0.97. Therefore, the performance of the models was affected by instability due to soil water content (SWC) and low precipitation (62.2 mm in 2015). However, the performance of METRIC was better than that of S-SEBI. In general, METRIC is considered a good SEB model for arid regions. In addition, S-SEBI could be an adequate model for overcoming the difficulty associated with obtaining meteorological data.

TI  - Intraoperative Molecular Imaging for <i>ex vivo</i> Assessment of Peripheral Margins in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Complete surgical resection is the standard of care for treatment of oral cancer although the positive margin rate remains 15-30%. Tissue sampling from the resected specimen and from the wound bed for frozen section analysis (FSA) remains the mainstay for intraoperative margin assessment but is subject to sampling error and can require the processing of multiple samples. We sought to understand if an ex vivo imaging strategy using a tumor-targeted fluorescently labeled antibody could accurately identify the closest peripheral margin on the mucosal surface of resected tumor specimen, so that this "sentinel margin" could be used to guide pathological sampling. Materials and Methods: Twenty-nine patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma scheduled for surgical resection were consented for the study and received systemic administration of a tumor-targeted fluorescently labeled antibody (Panitumumab IRDye800CW). After surgical resection, the tumor specimen was imaged using a closed-field fluorescent imaging device. Relevant pathological data was available for five patients on retrospective review. For each of these five patients, two regions of highest fluorescence intensity at the peripheral margin and one region of lowest fluorescence intensity were identified, and results were correlated with histology to determine if the region of highest fluorescence intensity along the mucosal margin (i.e., the sentinel margin) was truly the closest margin. Results: Imaging acquisition of the mucosal surface of the specimen immediately after surgery took 30 s. In all of the specimens, the region of highest fluorescence at the specimen edge had a significantly smaller margin distance than other sampled regions. The average margin distance at the closest, "sentinel," margin was 3.2 mm compared to a margin distance of 8.0 mm at other regions (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study suggests that, when combined with routine FSA, ex vivo fluorescent specimen imaging can be used to identify the closest surgical margin on the specimen. This approach may reduce sampling error of intraoperative evaluation, which should ultimately improve the ability of the surgeon to identify the sentinel margin. This rapid sentinel margin identification improves the surgeon's orientation to areas most likely to be positive in the surgical wound bed and may expedite pathology workflow.

TI  - The Triumph of the Will: Evolutionary Psychology and the Conceptual Incoherence of Enhancement
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent decades have witnessed a profound increase in scholarly work and scientific research conducted under the banner of evolutionary psychology. Although evolutionary psychologists typically disavow any historical or conceptual link to the political or scientific project of eugenics, or at the very least downplay the current relevance of such linkages, a growing number of evolutionary thinkers have begun to embrace a biological science of cognitive and moral enhancement. This article examines some of the ways in which advocates of enhancement assume human agency as central to their project even as their naturalistic explanations of human behavior deny that agency. The article also argues that the utopian moral project that animates the evolutionary enhancement movement is undercut by the materialist metaphysics that undergirds the neo-Darwinian worldview employed to ground the project in the first place, a metaphysics that relativizes and ultimately rejects any meaningful morality or moral endeavor whatsoever.

TI  - Effects of bio-physical, economic and ecological policy on forest transition for sustainability of resource and socioeconomics development
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest transition is a product of the interaction among bio-physical characteristics, economic development, and ecological policies. Research on the process and the factors for forest transitions is important for resource protection and socioeconomic sustainability. In this paper, based on Landsat TM data and socio-economic panel data, we examined the dynamics and the spatial determinants of forest transition at the county level on the Loess Plateau (China) using spatial econometric regression models for a 15-year period (2000-2015). We reached the following conclusions: (1) Arable land, Grassland, and Forest land were the dominant land use types. The forested area increased 3262.41 ha from 2000 to 2015, and the increased land was primarily due to the conversion from arable land. (2) The global Moran's I value was greater than 0.3 for the entire 15 years, and the proportion of positive and negative values were larger than 0 for the local Moran's I values, which indicated that the spatial correlation were positive, and thus the spatial autocorrelation should be considered in quantitative analysis of the factors that influence forest transition. (3) The most suitable model for estimating the forested area for empirical analysis and interpretation was the spatial lag model with fixed effects. The forested area was primarily significantly positively correlated with the average annual rainfall and the per capita gross domestic product (significance level 1%). Ecological restoration project also positively affected the forested area, but was not significant. Based on the conclusion, we recommend creating policies for ecological environmental sustainability that were harmonious with economic development in Western China. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Disruption in daily eating-fasting and activity-rest cycles in Indian adolescents attending school
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - A lifestyle with erratic eating patterns and habits predisposes youngsters to obesity. Through a two-phase feasibility study among Indian students living in the Delhi area, we longitudinally examined the following: (1) the daily eating-fasting cycles of students (N = 34) in school and college using smartphones as they transition from high school (aged 13-15 years; nIX = 13) to higher secondary school (HSSS; 16-18 years; nXII = 9) to their first year (FY) of college (18-19 years; nFC = 12); and (2) daily activity-rest cycles and light-dark exposure of 31 higher secondary school students (HSSS) using actigraphy. In phase 1, students' food data were analyzed for temporal details of eating events and observable differences in diet composition, such as an energy-dense diet (fast food (FF)), as confounding factors of circadian health. Overall, the mean eating duration in high school, higher secondary and FY college students ranged from 14.1 to 16.2h. HSSS exhibited the shortest night fasting. Although FY college students exhibited the highest fast food percentage (FF%), a positive correlation between body mass index (BMI) and FF% was observed only among HSSS. Furthermore, the body weight of HSSS was significantly higher, indicating that FF, untimely eating and reduced night fasting were important obesity-associated factors in adolescents. Reduced night fasting duration was also related to shorter sleep in HSSS. Therefore, food data were supplemented with wrist actigraphy, i.e., activity-rest data, in HSSS. Actigraphy externally validated the increased obesogenic consequences of deregulated eating rhythms in HSSS. CamNtech motion watches were used to assess the relationship between disturbed activity cycles of HSSS and other circadian clock-related rhythms, such as sleep. Less than 50% of Indian HSSS slept 6 hours or more per night. Seven of 31 students remained awake throughout the night, during which they had more than 20% of their daily light exposure. Three nonparametric circadian rhythm analysis (NPCRA) variables revealed circadian disruption of activity in HSSS. The present study suggests that inappropriate timing and quality of food and sleep disturbances are important determinants of circadian disruptions in adolescents attending school.

TI  - Symmetries of CMB Temperature Correlation at Large Angular Separations
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new analysis is presented of the angular correlation function C(Theta) of cosmic microwave background temperature at large angular separation, based on published maps derived from Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and Planck satellite data, using different models of astrophysical foregrounds. It is found that using a common analysis, the results from the two satellites are very similar. In particular, it is found that previously published differences between measured values of C(Theta) near Theta = 90 degrees arise mainly from different choices of masks in regions of largest Galactic emissions, and that demonstrated measurement biases are reduced by eliminating masks altogether. Maps from both satellites are shown to agree with C(90 degrees) = 0 to within estimated statistical and systematic errors, consistent with an exact symmetry predicted in a new holographic quantum model of inflation.

T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an optical system of total-reflection night-light remote sensing is designed using the off-axis three-mirror optical structure of COOK TMA based on the development requirements of the urban night-light remote sensing cameras. Its field of view is 5 degrees x 2 degrees, focal length is 500 mm, F number is 3. 8, and working waveband is 0.4-0.8 mu m. The optical axes of the primary, second, and third mirrors arc designed to be coaxial to improve the feasibility of optical installation and adjustment. Initially, the appropriate initial structural parameters arc selected. Then, ray tracing and optimization arc performed using the CODE V software. Results show that the root-mean-square diameter of the spot is 2.305 mu m, which is less than one eighth of a pixel. Further, the optical modulation transfer function is greater than 0. 92 at Nyquist frenquency of 25 lp/mm, which is close to the diffraction limit. The external baffle, blocking rings, diaphragm, and matte paint arc used to decrease the stray-light level. Subsequently, the stray light of the optical-mechanical system is simulated and analyzed using the Traccpro software. The results denote that the point source transmittance is between 10(-11) and 10(-3) when the off-axis field of view is 1 degrees-80 degrees. Furthermore, the point source transmittance is less than 1 x 10(-9) when the solar suppression angle is 65.96 degrees-80 degrees, which satisfies the application requirements.

TI  - Local forest structure variability increases resilience to wildfire in dry western US coniferous forests
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A 'resilient' forest endures disturbance and is likely to persist. Resilience to wildfire may arise from feedback between fire behaviour and forest structure in dry forest systems. Frequent fire creates fine-scale variability in forest structure, which may then interrupt fuel continuity and prevent future fires from killing overstorey trees. Testing the generality and scale of this phenomenon is challenging for vast, long-lived forest ecosystems. We quantify forest structural variability and fire severity across >30 years and >1000 wildfires in California's Sierra Nevada. We find that greater variability in forest structure increases resilience by reducing rates of fire-induced tree mortality and that the scale of this effect is local, manifesting at the smallest spatial extent of forest structure tested (90 x 90 m). Resilience of these forests is likely compromised by structural homogenisation from a century of fire suppression, but could be restored with management that increases forest structural variability.

TI  - Estimating Barcelona's metropolitan daytime hot and cold poles using Landsat-8 Land Surface Temperature
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Barcelona Metropolitan Area (BMA) is located in Catalonia, northeastern Spain. With a population of over 3 billion people, the BMA is one of the most populous metropolitan areas on the Mediterranean coast. A local climatic modification known as the urban heat island (UHI) occurs in the urban areas. The UHI is usually quantified by means of air temperature, although remote sensing can be used to extract a thermal image of the earth's surface to provide temperature values throughout the study area. Estimation of the land surface temperature (LST) for the BMA enabled us to establish the spatial patterns of LST and to detect the poles of heat and cold within the BMA on 24 dates during the 2013-2018 period, distributed among the 4 seasons of the year. To this end we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) and a cluster analysis (CA). Moreover, we employed the Random Forest (RF) regression method to quantify the influence and variation of diverse geographic covariates according to season and location in the study area. Finally, to determine the influence of land covers on temperature, the thermal values of the 4 land covers included in the Corine Land Cover dataset were analyzed: industrial units, continuous urban fabric, green urban areas, and forest areas. Results show that the heat poles are concentrated in industrial areas primarily, followed by urban fabric areas. On the contrary, the cold pole is found in green urban areas, as well as forested areas. The maximum temperature range between land covers was detected in spring and summer, while in winter this difference was negligible. Our study showed that green urban areas presented temperatures up to 2.5 degrees C lower than in urban areas. The results of the present research are intended to serve as a roadmap for enhancing thermal comfort in the BMA. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effectiveness of influenza vaccine in children in preventing influenza associated hospitalisation, 2018/19, England
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - 2013/14 saw the start of the introduction of a new live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) programme for children in England. 2018/19 saw co-circulation of both A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), when LAIV was offered to all healthy children 2-9 years of age. LAIV effectiveness against influenza hospitalisation is not well described. This paper presents the 2018/19 end-of-season adjusted vaccine effectiveness (aVE) against laboratory confirmed influenza related hospitalisation in children aged 2-17. The test negative case control approach was used to estimate aVE by influenza A subtype and vaccine type. Cases and controls were selected from a sentinel laboratory surveillance system which collates details of individuals tested for influenza with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory samples. Vaccine and clinical history was obtained from general practitioners of study participants. There were 307 hospitalised cases and 679 hospitalised controls. End-of-season influenza aVE was 53.0% (95% CI: 33.3, 66.8) against influenza confirmed hospitalisation; 63.5% (95% CI: 34.4, 79.7) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 hospitalisation and 31.1% (95% CI: -53.9, 69.2) against influenza A(H3N2). LAIV aVE was 49.1% (95% CI: 25.9, 65.0) for any influenza and 70.7% (95% CI: 41.8, 85.3) for A(H1N1)pdm09, whereas for those receiving quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV), aVE was 64.4% (95% CI: 29.4, 82.0) and 44.4% (95% CI: -51.9, 79.6) respectively. We provide evidence of overall significant VE for both LAIV and QIV against influenza associated hospitalisation in children 2-17 years of age, most notably against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, with non-significant protection against A(H3N2).

TI  - Protection provided by influenza vaccine against influenza-related hospitalisation in ≥65 year olds: Early experience of introduction of a newly licensed adjuvanted vaccine in England in 2018/19
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - 2018/19 was the first season of introduction in England of a newly licensed adjuvanted influenza vaccine (aTIV) for adults 65 years or older, who were previously offered standard-dose, non-adjuvanted vaccine, achieving uptake levels >70%, often with poor effectiveness. This paper presents the end-of-season adjusted vaccine effectiveness (aVE) against laboratory confirmed influenza hospitalisation in this population. A frequency-matched test negative case control approach was used to estimate aVE by influenza A subtype and vaccine type. Cases were influenza confirmed hospitalisations and controls influenza negative hospitalisations who were 65 years or more. Cases and controls were selected from a sentinel laboratory surveillance system which collates details of inpatients and outpatients routinely tested on clinical advice for influenza infection with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory samples. Vaccine and clinical history was obtained from the general practitioners of study participants. A total of 428 cases and 1013 controls were included in the analysis. End-of-season any-influenza aVE against hospitalisation was 53.4% (95% CI: 39.9, 63.9). By influenza A subtype, aVE was 64.8% (95% CI: 49.6, 75.3) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 39.3% (95% CI: 6.5, 60.6) against influenza A(H3N2). There was insufficient data to estimate influenza B VE. aVE estimates for all influenza, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) for aTIV were 53.8% (39.8, 64.5); 65.9% (50.6, 76.4) and 39.5% (4.8, 61.5) respectively. We provide evidence of significant influenza VE in the elderly, most notably against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, but also against A(H3N2) for aTIV. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Identifying signatures of the impact of rotavirus vaccines on hospitalizations using sentinel surveillance data from Latin American countries
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Passive surveillance data are often the only available source of data that can be used to evaluate the population-level impact of vaccination, but such data often suffer from important limitations such as changes in surveillance efforts. This study provides an example of how to identify important signatures of rotavirus vaccine impact, including evaluating the overall effectiveness and changes in rotavirus seasonal dynamics.Methods: We used data from a standardized sentinel rotavirus surveillance network in six Latin American countries (Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay, and Venezuela) from 2004 to 2017. A random-effects model was used to evaluate changes in the proportion of rotavirus-associated hospitalizations following vaccine introduction. Harmonic regression models were used to estimate vaccine impact on the number of rotavirus hospitalizations, controlling for trends in rotavirus-negative cases. Changes to rotavirus seasonality were evaluated using center of gravity analysis, wavelet analysis, and harmonic regression.Results: All countries observed declines in the proportion of rotavirus-positive acute diarrhea samples with a mean reduction of 16% (95% confidence interval: 10-22%). We estimate that each 10% increase in vaccine coverage was associated with declines in the number of rotavirus-positive cases, ranging from 4.3% (1.3-7.2%) in Honduras to 21.4% (16.8-25.9%) in Venezuela. The strength of the seasonal peak in rotavirus incidence became smaller after vaccine introduction in Guatemala, Honduras, and Venezuela. Seasonal peaks also shifted later in the surveillance year, especially in higher-mortality countries.Conclusions: The combination of methods we applied have different strengths that allow us to identify common signatures of rotavirus vaccine impact.

TI  - The yoga of sustainable diets: Exploring consumers mind and spirit
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Unsustainable food choice and dietary behaviors put pressure on ecosystems and supply chain structures worldwide. Knowledge on the intrinsic values driving food consumption behavior are, therefore, essential in order to foster sustainability on a global, national and community based level. This study aims at exploring the relationship between different food consumption related behaviors and the intrinsic value shaping constructs of spirituality and mindfulness. Online questionnaire data on self-reported dietary behavior, self-reported food choice behavior, spirituality, and mindfulness were drawn from a population subsample in India and the United States of America. Factorial relationships between spirituality and mindfulness traits were explored using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis was performed to estimate the effect of the derived factor structures on different food choice and dietary behavior variables. The EFA resulted in 4 factors, of which two each frame spirituality and mindfulness. These factors are: (1) supernatural spirituality, (2) natural spirituality, (3) supportive mindset, and (4) scattered mindset. In both country data sets, factors 2 and 3 had significant adverse effects on the consumption of convenience foods and a positive effect on the consumers' dietary awareness. Even though ambiguities exist concerning important dietary sustainability measures, e.g. the consumption of animal-protein based foods, this research reinforces the value of spirituality and spiritual practice measures for sustainability research, especially for consumer sciences. Further elaboration and application of these concepts may proof valuable for various stakeholders involved as they point to a more integral aspect of human psychology and behavior.

TI  - Vegetation expansion in the subnival Hindu Kush Himalaya
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The mountain systems of the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) are changing rapidly due to climatic change, but an overlooked component is the subnival ecosystem (between the treeline and snow line), characterized by short-stature plants and seasonal snow. Basic information about subnival vegetation distribution and rates of ecosystem change are not known, yet such information is needed to understand relationships between subnival ecology and water/carbon cycles. We show that HKH subnival ecosystems cover five to 15 times the area of permanent glaciers and snow, highlighting their eco-hydrological importance. Using satellite data from the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 missions, we measured change in the spatial extent of subnival vegetation from 1993 to 2018. The Landsat surface reflectance-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index product was thresholded at 0.1 to indicate the presence/absence of vegetation. Using this product, the strength and direction of time-series trends in the green pixel fraction were measured within three regions of interest. We controlled for cloud cover, snow cover and evaluated the impact of sensor radiometric differences between Landsat 7 and Landsat 8. Using Google Earth Engine to expedite data processing tasks, we show that there has been a weakly positive increase in the extent of subnival vegetation since 1993. Strongest and most significant trends were found in the height region of 5,000-5,500 m a.s.l. across the HKH extent: R-2 = .302, Kendall's tau = 0.424, p < .05, but this varied regionally, with height, and according to the sensors included in the time series. Positive trends at lower elevations occurred on steeper slopes whilst at higher elevations, flatter areas exhibited stronger trends. We validated our findings using online photographs. Subnival ecological changes have likely impacted HKH carbon and water cycles with impacts on millions of people living downstream, but the strength and direction of impacts of vegetation expansion remain unknown.

TI  - A Modified Semi-Empirical Radar Scattering Model for Weathered Rock Surfaces Un modele de diffusion radar semi-empirique modifie pour les surfaces rocheuses alterees
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a modified semi-empirical radar scattering model for weathered rough rock surfaces. Weathered rocks generally have dry surfaces except for a few hours after heavy rain due to their rapid drainage compared to bare soils. We find that the dielectric properties of the rocks themselves and the moisture content of a marginal amount of soil patches in and around the rock surfaces have a negligible effect on radar backscattering. Therefore, radar backscattering from rock surfaces is mainly controlled by surface roughness. Here, we modified the cross-polarization ratio model developed by Oh, which is formulated by only surface roughness parameters with no dependence on soil moisture. Based on LiDAR surface topography data collected from weathered rock surfaces in the Canadian Arctic and corresponding quad-polarimetric RADARSAT-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, we determined the best fit radar backscattering model for weathered rock surfaces. The modified model was successfully applied to estimate the surface roughness of weathered rock surfaces up to approximately ks = 7 where k is the radar wavenumber (= 2 pi/lambda) and s is the root mean square (RMS) height. This approach avoids the rapid saturation feature observed at ks > 3 in other models.

TI  - Trap Comparison for Surveillance of the Western Tree Hole Mosquito, Aedes sierrensis (Diptera: Culicidae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The western tree hole mosquito, Aedes sierrensis (Ludlow), is a common nuisance mosquito and vector of Dirofilaria immitis (Leidy), the etiologic agent of dog heartworm, in western North America. Here, we compare weekly mosquito collections made with Mosquito Magnet (MM) traps, Biogents Sentinel (BGS) traps, and Biogents Bowl (BGS Bowl) traps set in Salt Lake City, UT, from the start of June to mid-August 2017. We found the number of mosquitoes decreased with rainfall and temperature independently of trap type.The highest number of mosquitoes were caught by BGS traps baited with carbon dioxide (CO2) and BG lure, which collected 62% (n = 422) of all mosquitoes, followed by the MM at 31% (n = 213), and both the BGS and BG Bowl with BG lure had 3.5% (n = 24) each. Aedes sierrensis females were caught weekly at similar densities (mean +/- SD) in BGS with CO2 and lure (1.17 +/- 2.93) and the MM (1.17 +/- 2.66) traps during the study period. Given that BGS with CO2 and lure traps have several operational advantages over MM traps, including a quicker setup, smaller size, and lower cost, we consider BGS with CO2 and lure traps as the best suited surveillance tool to detect and remove Ae. sierrensis in the western United States and similar settings throughout North America.

TI  - Mapping and monitoring of glacier lake outburst floods using geospatial modelling approach for Darkut valley, Pakistan
T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and human activities have resulted in the receding of glaciers throughout the world including Pakistan. Glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are amongst the most common climate-change-induced hazards in northern Pakistan. In the present study, GLOF mapping and modelling was carried out using remote sensing and geographical information system techniques coupled with ground-truthing. Change detection techniques such as the normalized difference water index were applied on Landsat imagery for the identification of the temporal behaviour of Darkut glacial lake for the last 25 years. The depth of the lake was estimated to be 81 m and the volume of the lake was calculated using a digital terrain model and extracted as 9.79 x 10(6) m(3). The glacial lake extent has increased from 0.045 to 0.154 km(2) in the last two decades. Two GLOF scenarios (peak and extreme flood) were developed on an existing volume of water in the study. There are 14 households exposed to medium flood and 10 to low flood risk while one helipad and one school are also in the low flood zone in the first scenario (i.e. peak flood) based on 87.84 m(3)center dot s(-1) of water. The second scenario (i.e. extreme flood) was executed on 3,128 m(3)center dot s(-1) of water, in which 14 households are at high flood risk, eight at medium and 35 in a low flood zone, as well as one school, a helipad and a community stockpile which are exposed to low flood. The outcomes of the study will help in the development of risk management plans, preparedness strategies and risk reduction from GLOF hazard.

TI  - Analysis of Landsat 8 detection of the interannual variability of grassland curing in Greater Melbourne, Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the main components of Grassland Fire Danger Index, grassland curing degree provides crucial information for determining grassland fire danger. Accurate estimates of grassland curing are critical for determining grassland fire risk. This research focuses on the use of Landsat 8 to estimate grassland curing. Results demonstrate that Landsat 8 observations can be used to estimate curing percentages as assessed by visual and ground sampling measurements. Grassland interannual variability for the Greater Melbourne region using Landsat 8 imagery from 2013 to 2019 is examined. Slight differences in curing times and degree are observed for sample sites surrounding Greater Melbourne due to climatic differences across the region. Precipitation is regarded as an essential variable affecting curing degree and this relationship is evident for all five sample sites. Landsat 8 curing results are compared to both visual observations and destructive sampling, the most accurate method, for accuracy assessment. At 95% confidence level, Landsat 8 estimations are no different from destructive ground sampling estimations. Overall, this study validates the use of Landsat 8 data as an effective and accurate way for grassland curing monitoring.

TI  - Stem Mortality and Forest Dieback in a 20-Years Experimental Drought in a Mediterranean Holm Oak Forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatic warming is predicted to increase the intensity and duration of extreme weather such as droughts and heat waves. Climate change could therefore increase stem mortality and forest dieback in many ecosystems around the world, especially in semi-arid forests. We investigated the influence of climatic conditions and a throughfall displacement experimental treatment (15% decrease in the amount of soil moisture) on the intensity of stem mortality in a Mediterranean forest. We also investigated the use of remotely sensed data from MODIS as a tool to estimate the intensity of stem mortality and a possible strategy of forest management to mitigate this forest dieback induced by climate change. Stem mortality was higher when mean annual temperature was higher and rainfall was lower, especially during spring and summer. Mortality was higher and more affected by the drought treatment in the holm oak, Quercus ilex, than in co-occurring species of tall shrubs better adapted to drier conditions. Two spectral MODIS indices (NDVI and EVI) were good predictors of stem mortality, but others (GPP, PsnNet, and NPP specifically calculated to predict forest health and development) were not clearly correlated with stem mortality. Selective stem thinning strongly reduced stem mortality (especially in Q. ilex) by buffering the effects of climate change on forest structure. Finally, the possible future substitution of the current dominant species of this forest, Q. ilex, by species of tall shrubs better adapted to drought is also discussed.

TI  - Estimation of methane emissions based on crop yield and remote sensing data in a paddy field
T2  - GREENHOUSE GASES-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is important for addressing global warming. In this regard, empirical models were constructed to evaluate the feasibility of using rice yield and canopy spectral properties for estimating paddy cumulative methane (CH4) emissions (CCE). A field experiment with shading treatments was conducted in 2017. A static chamber-gas chromatography was used to measure CH4 fluxes during the growing season. Canopy hyperspectral reflectance was measured and then used to calculate the multispectral normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the ratio vegetation index (RVI), and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI). The results show that CH4 emissions were positively correlated to rice yield and biomass, indicating that higher biomass provided more substrates for CH4 generation. O-2 availability maybe a main factor in the CCE differences under shading treatments. RVI and EVI showed a stronger positive relationship to CH4 emissions than NDVI. The empirical model including yield and EVI-JS (EVI of jointing-booting stage) as input variables performed better (adj-R-2 = 0.85, root mean square error [RMSE] = 12.26 kg ha(-1)) than the model that included only yield (adj-R-2 = 0.5, RMSE = 22.5 kg ha(-1)). This study suggests that it is feasible to apply remote sensing in paddy CH4 estimation, providing a referable attempt for future regional agricultural GHG emissions quantification.

TI  - Mass Loss From Calving in Himalayan Proglacial Lakes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The formation and expansion of Himalayan glacial lakes has implications for glacier dynamics, mass balance and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Subaerial and subaqueous calving is an important component of glacier mass loss but they have been difficult to track due to spatiotemporal resolution limitations in remote sensing data and few field observations. In this study, we used near-daily 3 m resolution PlanetScope imagery in conjunction with an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) survey to quantify calving events and derive an empirical area-volume relationship to estimate calved glacier volume from planimetric iceberg areas. A calving event at Thulagi Glacier in 2017 was observed by satellite from before and during the event to nearly complete melting of the icebergs, and was observed in situ midway through the melting period, thus giving insights into the melting processes. In situ measurements of Thulagi Lake's surface and water column indicate that daytime sunlight absorption heats mainly just the top metre of water, but this heat is efficiently mixed downwards through the top tens of metres due to forced convection by wind-blown icebergs; this heat then is retained by the lake and is available to melt the icebergs. Using satellite data, we assess seasonal glacier velocities, lake thermal regime and glacier surface elevation change for Thulagi, Lower Barun and Lhotse Shar glaciers and their associated lakes. The data reveal widely varying trends, likely signifying divergent future evolution. Glacier velocities derived from 1960/70s declassified Corona satellite imagery revealed evidence of glacier deceleration for Thulagi and Lhotse Shar glaciers, but acceleration at Lower Barun Glacier following lake development. We used published modelled ice thickness data to show that upon reaching their maximum extents, Imja, Lower Barun and Thulagi lakes will contain, respectively, about 90 x 10(6), 62 x 10(6) and 5 x 10(6) m(3) of additional water compared to their 2018 volumes. Understanding lake-glacier interactions is essential to predict future glacier mass loss, lake formation and associated hazards.

TI  - Mangroves protect coastal economic activity from hurricanes
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates whether mangroves can mitigate the impact of hurricanes on economic activity. The paper assembles a region-wide panel dataset that measures local economic activity using nightlights, potential hurricane damages using a detailed wind field model, and mangrove protection by mapping the width of mangrove forests on the path to the coast. The results show that hurricanes have negative short-run effects on economic activity, with losses likely concentrated in coastal lowlands that are exposed to both wind and storm surge hazards. In these coastal lowlands, the estimates show that nightlights decrease by up to 24% in areas that are unprotected by mangroves. By comparison, the impact of the hurricanes observed in the sample is fully mitigated in areas protected by mangrove belts of 1 km or more.

TI  - Sensitivity of primary production to precipitation across the United States
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Primary production, a key regulator of the global carbon cycle, is highly responsive to variations in climate. Yet, a detailed, continental-scale risk assessment of climate-related impacts on primary production is lacking. We combined 16 years of MODIS NDVI data, a remotely sensed proxy for primary production, with observations from 1218 climate stations to derive values of ecosystem sensitivity to precipitation and aridity. For the first time, we produced an empirically-derived map of ecosystem sensitivity to climate across the conterminous United States. Over this 16-year period, annual primary production values were most sensitive to precipitation and aridity in dryland and grassland ecosystems. Century-long trends measured at the climate stations showed intensifying aridity and climatic variability in many of these sensitive regions. Dryland ecosystems in the western US may be particularly vulnerable to reductions in primary production and consequent degradation of ecosystem services as climate change and variability increase in the future.

TI  - Assessing the impact of land cover changes on selected ecosystem services in upper Suha watershed, Gojjam, Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted in the upper Suha watershed in Enemay district, Gojjam, Ethiopia. The aim of the study was to assess land use/cover (LULC) change of the study area between 1986 and 2015 and to analyse its impact on selected ecosystem services. The LULC change was assessed by using Landsat Thematic Mapper(TM) 1986 and Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIS) 2015. The socio-economic survey was collected through key informant interviews and focus group discussion. The Landsat data were analysed using ERDAS IMAGINE 2014 (R) and ArcGIS 10.5 (R) softwares. The ecosystem services were estimated using the value transfer method. The results revealed that farmland, plantation forests and settlement increased by 18%, 93% and 125%, respectively whereas natural forest, shrubland and grassland decreased by 54%, 82% and 16%, respectively. The result also showed that the total ecosystem service value decreased from $31.5 million in 1986 to $24.36 million in 2015 mainly due to the decreasing areas of natural forest, shrubland and grasslands. The research results suggest that future land use planning should give emphasis on properly managing the natural and semi-natural vegetation that has high ecosystem service values.

TI  - Solo Smart Fluorogenic Probe for Potential Cancer Diagnosis and Tracking in Vivo Tumorous Lymphatic Systems via Distinct Emission Signals
T2  - ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - A versatile twisted-intramolecular-charge-transfer (TICT)-based near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe (L) has been judiciously designed and synthesized that could be utilized for potential cancer diagnosis and to track lymph node(s) in mice through distinct emission signals. Essentially, the probe rendered the capability to preferentially recognize the cancer cells over the noncancer cells by polarity-guided lipid droplet specific differential bioimaging (in green emission channel) studies. The probe also exhibited selective turn-on fluorescence response toward HSA/BSA in physiological media (aqueous PBS buffer; pH 7.4) at far-red/NIR regions, because of the 1:1 chelation between the probe and HSA/BSA. Therefore, the fluorescent probe was then maneuvered to track the draining lymphatic system and sentinel lymph node in tumor mice model by fluorescence imaging (NIR/deep-red channel), wherein the accumulated albumin protein in the draining tumor lymphatic system facilitated the in situ formation of the fluorescent albumin-L complex.

TI  - Estimating Daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> over Italy Using an Ensemble Model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporally resolved particulate matter (PM) estimates are essential for reconstructing long and short-term exposures in epidemiological research. Improved estimates of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were produced over Italy for 2013-2015 using satellite remote-sensing data and an ensemble modeling approach. The following modeling stages were used: (1) missing values of the satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) product were imputed using a spatiotemporal land-use random-forest (RF) model incorporating AOD data from atmospheric ensemble models; (2) daily PM estimations were produced using four modeling approaches: linear mixed effects, RF, extreme gradient boosting, and a chemical transport model, the flexible air quality regional model. The filled-in MAIAC AOD together with additional spatial and temporal predictors were used as inputs in the three first models; (3) a geographically weighted generalized additive model (GAM) ensemble model was used to fuse the estimations from the four models by allowing the weights of each model to vary over space and time. The GAM ensemble model outperformed the four separate models, decreasing the cross-validated root mean squared error by 1-42%, depending on the model. The spatiotemporally resolved PM estimations produced by the suggested model can be applied in future epidemiological studies across Italy.

TI  - A detailed comparison of MYD11 and MYD21 land surface temperature products in mainland China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter in land surface system. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recently released new Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST products (MOD21 and MYD21). Here, we conducted a detailed comparison between the MYD11 and MYD21 LST data in mainland China. The LSTs of MYD21 were approximately 1 degrees C higher than those of MYD11 averaged for mainland China, as MYD21 corrected the cold bias of MYD11. The proportions of the valid value of MYD21 were generally lower than those of MYD11 because the cloud removal method of MYD21 was stricter than that of MYD11. Furthermore, the outliers were less significant in MYD11 than in MYD21 because the outliers in MYD11 were removed using temporal constraints on LST. The outliers in MYD21A2 resulted in a difference of greater than 3 degrees C in average seasonal surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) between MYD11A2 and MYD21A2. Finally, using MYD11 may underestimate the slope of long-term trends of SUHII. MYD21 LST data may have some uncertainties in urban areas. This study provided a reference for users for selecting LST products and for data producers to further improve MODIS LST products.

T2  - FAMILY RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we address foundational and innovative aspects of preparing educators who teach about families, including theoretical, methodological, and practical considerations. We approach our task by defining and utilizing a human development and family science (HDFS) worldview, which, like the related foci on translational family science and family life education, integrates both the need for comprehensive academic grounding and professional preparation in the service of improving individual and family lives. We integrate the HDFS worldview with critical pedagogy and feminist praxis in family science that explicitly calls attention to inequality, oppression, and the need to empower individuals, families, communities, and societies. One of the hallmarks of HDFS scholarship and pedagogy on families is the intentional approach of teaching students to work in fields where they are seeking to name and redress individual and family vulnerability. In addition, we provide a comprehensive case study of collegiate education for training graduate students who are preparing to teach undergraduate students in the interdisciplinary field of HDFS. Finally, we provide directions for future research and implications for practice in HDFS pedagogy and teacher training in academic and community settings.

TI  - Trends in utilization of sentinel node biopsy and adjuvant radiation in women ≥ 70
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives Omission of routine axillary staging and adjuvant radiation (XRT) in women >= 70 years old with early stage, hormone receptor-positive, clinically node-negative breast cancer has been endorsed based on several landmark studies. We sought to determine how much omission of axillary staging/XRT has been adopted. Methods Using the National Cancer Data Base, we selected malignant breast cancer cases in women >= 70 with ER + tumors, <= 2 cm with clinically negative lymph nodes who underwent breast conservation and had known XRT status in 2005-2015. The use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) and XRT status was summarized by year to determine trends over time. Results In total, 57 230/69 982 patients underwent SNB. Of the 12 752 patients in whom SNB was omitted, 6296 were treated at comprehensive community cancer programs. Regarding XRT, 33 891/70 114 received adjuvant XRT. There were no significant trends with regards to patients receiving SNB or those receiving XRT. Conclusion Since 2005, there has been no change in SNB or XRT for early stage ER + breast tumors. However, there was a difference in omission of SNB based on facility type and setting. Future monitoring is needed to determine if these trends persist following the recently released Choosing Wisely (R) recommendations.

TI  - Determining the effect of land consolidation on agricultural production using a novel assessment framework
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land consolidation (LC) is regarded as a useful tool to improve agricultural production. Measuring the effect of LC on agricultural production (ELCAP) is helpful for the planning of LC activities. In the past, it is difficult to measure ELCAP at regional level due to the lack of field observation, the change of crop planting structure, and high cost of sample collection. Satellite data have large coverage and high spatiotemporal resolution for vegetation observation, which can provide a new idea for estimating ELCAP at regional level. This study aims to build a novel assessment framework to quantitatively investigate ELCAP by developing several satellite-based metrics. In addition, this study also explored the characteristics of ELCAP using the method of spatial autocorrelation and the geographical detector method in 1,281 LC areas in China. Our results show that agricultural productivity in more than 90% of total LC areas shows an increasing trend during 2001-2016. LC could play the positive but limited effects on agricultural production, and its productivity-boosting effect (64.87% of total LC areas) is greater than its stability-improving effect (46.53% of total LC areas). The spatial agglomeration of ELCAP is weak (Moran's I < 0.06), which may be resulted from the differences in field conditions and natural-social-economic situations across LC areas. The interaction between several factors has a greater effect on the ELCAP than each of these factors. Methodology in this study provides a new and useful framework for evaluating ELCAP, and results can be used to guide the planning of LC activities.

TI  - Melanoma of the nail apparatus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of current challenges and prognosis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Nail apparatus melanoma (NAM) is a rare dermatologic malignancy. Its prognosis is poor because it is often diagnosed late. However, progression and survival of NAM patients have only been studied among small populations. Early biopsy could help to identify suspicious lesions at a less invasive stage. While surgery is generally seen as the treatment of choice, the extent of excision margins and the use of sentinel biopsy remain debated. This systematic review aims to summarize the treatment procedures and observed prognosis in the literature during the last two decades and present pooled survival and progression rates of NAM by using meta-analysis. A systematic review on studies assessing pathology, treatment and prognosis of NAM was carried out up to end of 2018. After evaluation of eligible studies, the main emerging topics were outlined and pooled survival outcomes estimated. A total of 30 articles out of 624 identified records were included for systematic review. Finally, meta-analysis of pooled mortality rates including 18 studies was 4.6 x 100 patient-years (95% CI: 2.7, 6.8) equivalent to 5-year cumulative survival of 77.0%. Additionally, the pooled progression rate based on 17 studies was 6.3 x 100 patient-years (95% CI: 4.1, 8.9) with estimated 5-year cumulative progression-free survival of 68.5%. While the optimal extent of surgical treatment remains debated, prompt biopsy could help to identify early lesions. This is the first study to present pooled survival and progression rates by meta-analysis.

TI  - Soil salinity assessment by using near-infrared channel and Vegetation Soil Salinity Index derived from Landsat 8 OLI data: a case study in the Tra Vinh Province, Mekong Delta, Vietnam
T2  - PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinity intrusion is a pressing issue in the coastal areas worldwide. It affects the natural environment and causes massive economic loss due to its impacts on the agricultural productivity and food safety. Here, we assessed the salinity intrusion in the Tra Vinh Province, in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Landsat 8 OLI image was utilized to derive indices for soil salinity estimate including the single bands, Vegetation Soil Salinity Index (VSSI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Salinity Index (NDSI). Statistical analysis between the electrical conductivity (EC1:5, dS/m) and the environmental indices derived from Landsat 8 OLI image was performed. Results indicated that spectral values of near-infrared (NIR) band and VSSI were better correlated with EC1:5 (r(2) = 0.8 and r(2) = 0.7, respectively) than the other indices. Comparative results show that soil salinity derived from Landsat 8 was consistent with in situ data with coefficient of determination, R-2 = 0.89 and RMSE = 0.96 dS/m for NIR band and R-2 = 0.77 and RMSE = 1.27 dS/m for VSSI index. Findings of this study demonstrate that Landsat 8 OLI images reveal a high potential for spatiotemporally monitoring the magnitude of soil salinity at the top soil layer. Outcomes of this study are useful for agricultural activities, planners, and farmers by mapping the contamination for better selection of accomodating crop types to reduce economical loss in the context of climate change. Our proposed method that estimates soil salinity using satellite-derived variables can be potentially useful as a fast-approach to detect the soil salinity in the other regions with low cost and considerable accuracy.

AB  - Bogoslof volcano, in the central Aleutian arc, experienced a major eruption between December 2016 and August 2017 that was characterized by explosive activity (Volcanic Explosivity Index 2 to 3) and the extrusion of lava domes. The Alaska Volcano Observatory tracked the activity in real time using seismicity observed on distant stations as well as infrasound, lightning, satellite data, and occasional visual observations. In this study, we measure the duration of seismic signals associated with individual explosive events to track their progression during the two explosive phases of the eruption. Seismic recordings of Bogoslof explosions show complex waveforms that suggest both individual explosive events and sequences of several explosions separated by lower amplitude tremor. The lack of local seismic monitoring (stations at distances of 1 km to 15 km distance) unfortunately limits our ability to closely observe seismicity and to interpret changing conditions at the vent such as position, the presence of a lava dome or plug, and the role of seawater associated with the eruption. We use the rate of explosive activity, seismic waveform character, and repose time between explosions to infer the conditions within the conduit.

TI  - Cloud_cci Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer post meridiem (AVHRR-PM) dataset version 3: 35-year climatology of global cloud and radiation properties
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - We present version 3 of the Cloud_cci Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer post meridiem (AVHRR-PM) dataset, which contains a comprehensive set of cloud and radiative flux properties on a global scale covering the period of 1982 to 2016. The properties were retrieved from AVHRR measurements recorded by the afternoon (post meridiem - PM) satellites of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Polar Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) missions. The cloud properties in version 3 are of improved quality compared with the precursor dataset version 2, providing better global quality scores for cloud detection, cloud phase and ice water path based on validation results against A-Train sensors. Furthermore, the parameter set was extended by a suite of broadband radiative flux properties. They were calculated by combining the retrieved cloud properties with thermodynamic profiles from reanalysis and surface properties. The flux properties comprise upwelling and downwelling and shortwave and longwave broadband fluxes at the surface (bottom of atmosphere - BOA) and top of atmosphere (TOA). All fluxes were determined at the AVHRR pixel level for all-sky and clear-sky conditions, which will particularly facilitate the assessment of the cloud radiative effect at the BOA and TOA in future studies. Validation of the BOA downwelling fluxes against the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) shows a very good agreement. This is supported by comparisons of multiannual mean maps with NASA's Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) products for all fluxes at the BOA and TOA. The Cloud_cci AVHRR-PM version 3 (Cloud_cci AVHRR-PMv3) dataset allows for a large variety of climate applications that build on cloud properties, radiative flux properties and/or the link between them.

TI  - How much benthic information can be retrieved with hyperspectral sensor from the optically complex coastal waters?
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Baltic Sea represents an optically complex case 2 water type, where high concentrations of water column constituents limit acquisition of benthic information. Different preprocessing steps were applied to the hyperspectral compact airborne spectrographic imager (CASI) image to extract as much useful benthic information as possible. Atmospheric correction, minimum noise fraction transform, and sun-glint correction were performed to acquire water surface reflectance data. Additionally, a water column removal procedure was applied to acquire bottom reflectance data. Although retrieved CASI water surface reflectance spectra generally matched the magnitudes and shapes of in situ measured spectra, then the applied water column correction algorithm did not yield accurate bottom reflectance spectra. Therefore, both benthic habitat and bathymetry maps were retrieved from the CASI sea surface image data set. An image-based supervised classification method produced a good quality benthic habitat map from the shallow Pakri study area (depth < 3.0 m) with an overall accuracy of 80%. A site-specific algorithm was developed for the bathymetry retrieval utilizing a green-yellow CASI band ratio. Validation of the bathymetry map for depths shallower than 4.0 m revealed an R-2 value of 0.88 and a root-mean-square error of 0.32 m. The assessment of the benthic substrate detectability limits in the Baltic Sea revealed that, at the wavelength of deepest light penetration (near 570 nm), the depth restriction for CASI benthic substrate detection was 7.6 m for sand, 5.0 m for green macroalgae, 3.0 m for higher order vegetation, and 3.1 m for brown macroalgae. The depth limit to which bathymetric mapping is practical in our study site was estimated to be around 3.5 to 4.0 m. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Steady-state and Flux-based Trehalose Estimation as an Indicator of Carbon Flow from Gluconeogenesis or Glycolysis
T2  - BIO-PROTOCOL
M3  - Article
AB  - Trehalose (and glycogen) is a major storage carbohydrate in many cells, including S. cerevisiae. Typically, trehalose (a disaccharide of glucose) is synthesized and stored through gluconeogenesis. However, trehalose can also be made directly from glucose, if glucose-6-phosphate is channeled away from glycolysis or pentose phosphate pathway. Therefore, analyzing trehalose synthesis, utilization or its accumulation, can be used as a sentinel read-out for either gluconeogenesis or rewired glucose utilization. However, the steady-state measurements alone of trehalose cannot unambiguously distinguish the nature of carbon flux in a system. Here, we first summarize simple steady-state enzymatic assays to measure trehalose (and glycogen), that will have very wide uses. Subsequently, we describe methods of highly sensitive, quantitative LC-MS/MS based to measure trehalose. We include methods of C-13 stable-isotope based pulse-labeling experiments (using different carbon sources) with which to measure rates of trehalose synthesis, from different carbon metabolism pathways. This approach can be used to unambiguously determine the extent of carbon flux into trehalose coming from gluconeogenesis, or directly from glucose/glycolysis. These protocols collectively enable comprehensive steady-state as well as carbon flux based measurements of trehalose. This permits a dissection of carbon flux to distinguish between cells in a gluconeogenic state (conventionally leading to trehalose synthesis), or cells with rewired glucose metabolism (also leading to trehalose synthesis). While the methods presented are optimized for yeast, these methods can be easily adapted to several types of cells, including many microbes.

T2  - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nehnar glacier is located in the Sindh sub-basin of the Jhelum River in the Kashmir Himalayas. We studied the dynamic response of the glacier (area, snout, Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA), specific mass balance, volume) using Survey of India (SOI) toposheets and Landsat imagery series from 1962 to 2017. The results show that this glacier has lost an area of 1.4 km(2) (50.35%) during this period of 55 years. The snout position and ELA have risen significantly, with varying rates at different time intervals. The specific mass balance of the glacier changed from -2.3 cm water equivalent (w.e.) to -35.1 cm w.e. during this period, with a loss of glacier volume from 0.17 km(3) to 0.07 km(3). Annual mean maximum (Tmax) and mean minimum (Tmin) temperatures show significant increases, whereas an insignificant decrease in precipitation has been recorded from 1980 to 2016. The continuous glacier retreat will have a significant impact on streamflow, agriculture, and other sectors of the Kashmir Himalayas.

TI  - Characteristics of environmental factors contributing to ALOS-2 PALSAR wind speed errors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental factors affecting the errors in wind speed estimates were investigated using the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) data for the period from 1 November 2014 to 30 November 2017. In total, 45 ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 Stripmap Fine mode images with horizontal dual-polarization were collected, and the wind speeds were calculated using the L-band Geophysical Model Function (GMF) in 2009. Validation of the SAR-derived wind speeds to in-situ wind, converted to the 10-m neutral wind, resulted in the root-mean-square error of 2.11 ms(-1), bias error of -1.16 m s(-1), and standard deviation of 1.78 m s(-1). Investigation of the wind speed errors revealed the contributions of diverse oceanic environmental factors such as the ship and its side-lobe effect that is negligible at a distance of more than 200% of the ship radius, v-shaped ship wakes are accompanied by the Kelvin waves and turbulent wakes caused by ship movement. The sand ridge, formed due to the interaction of shallow bathymetry and tidal currents, contributed to the wind speed errors of more than 50%. The internal waves caused prominent wind speed errors of more than 100%. The atmospheric gravity waves, generated by the orographic effect, caused wind speed fluctuations up to 13.4 m s(-1). This study addressed the importance of understanding the factors that affect the normalized radar cross-section of the SAR image in order to correctly retrieve wind speeds from SAR data.

TI  - Identification of Groundwater Potential Zones Using RS, GIS and AHP Techniques: A Case Study in a Part of Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP), Maharashtra, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article deals with the remote sensing and geographic information system techniques in assessing groundwater potential zones by the manipulation and analysis of the individual layer of spatial controlling data in a part of Deccan Volcanic Province, Maharashtra. Available geology, geomorphology, and soil maps were collected. Land use and land cover (LULC) and Lineament maps had been prepared using the LANDSAT-8 (TM and OLI) Satellite Image (November 2015). The SRTM DEM (resolution: 30 m) data had been employed for the preparation of slope and drainage maps. These maps were converted into the raster format. Analytic hierarchy process was applied to weight, ranking, and reclassify these maps in the ArcGIS version 10.4. Then, groundwater prospect map had been prepared by overlaying the maps. The results show that five groundwater potential zones such as very poor (11.77%), poor (21.73%), moderate (30.13%), good (25.34%), and very good (11.02%) exit. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the lineament density, LULC, and slope increase the area slightly only in the very poor to poor potential zones. Besides, the well yields, groundwater level fluctuation corresponding rainfall data had been utilized to validate. The yield values vary from 5.94 to 14.88 l/s in the good to very good potential zones, whereas 0.38 to 1.37 l/s within the poor to very poor potential zones. In addition, cross-correlation coefficients among groundwater level and rainfall is well-related to the groundwater potential index (R-2 = 0.84), which will help to construct artificial recharge structures and the planning of sustainable groundwater management.

TI  - Impact of urbanization on creeks of Mumbai, India: a geospatial assessment approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Creeks are the inherent coastline feature that connects rivers to the sea and plays an important role in the ecological processes and the material transfer. In the present study, an impact of urbanisation on the creeks of Mumbai, India namely Thane, Malad and Manori creeks, has been addressed. Multi-temporal satellite images of Landsat for the years 1972, 1994 and 2016 are considered to perform the changes in the mudflat and growth of the mangrove, as well as the changes in creeks width apart from the Land use Land cover (LULC). Object-based image analysis using multi-spectral resolution confirmed that there is an overall increase in the spatial extent of mangroves and reduction in the width of all the creeks. Mangroves around Thane creek and Manori creek have increased from 50.7 km(2) to 57.6 km(2) and 8.4 km(2) to 25.2 km(2)respectively. However, there is a decrease in mangroves around Malad Creek from13.3 km(2) to 9.7 km(2)during 1972 to 2016. The relationship between the creek geometry and LULC was also explored, and it has been revealed that the creek width has reduced due to urbanisation. Life expectancy analysis projected a further reduction in the width of the creeks for the years 2025 and 2050. The study suggests that there must be stringent bye-laws for disposal of sewage into the creeks and development activity near the creek areas. Further, upper stretches of the creeks require cleaning and dredging so that the tidal water will be approached up to the upper portion to maintain the creek ecosystem.

TI  - Accuracy verification and evaluation of Sentinel-1A repeat track differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar in monitoring mining subsidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) in monitoring the ground subsidence is a major challenge to be addressed urgently. Using the repeat track DInSAR and GIS spatial analysis tools, eight C-band Sentinel-1A SAR images of the Guotun coal mine (China) were processed to determine the mining subsidence from November 27, 2015 to July 24, 2016. The mining data of 13 working faces and the DInSAR-and leveling-monitored results were compared. A method was proposed to solve the problem of time inconsistency between DInSAR-and leveling-monitored results. The location, spatial distribution, scope, and variations of mining subsidence monitored by Sentinel-1A repeat track DInSAR were consistent with the mining progress of the working faces. The accuracy of the DInSAR-monitored subsidence values was directly related to the coherence of the subsidence zones, and the absolute difference from the leveling-monitored values was small at the subsidence edge but large at the subsidence center.

TI  - Establishment of Asia-Pacific Network for Enterovirus Surveillance
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Enteroviruses (EV), the major pathogens of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina, affect millions of children each year. Most human enteroviruses cause self-limited infections except polio-viruses, enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), and several echoviruses (Echo) and cox-sackieviruses (CV). Especially, EV-A71 has repeatedly caused large-scale outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific region since 1997. Some Asian countries have experienced cyclical outbreaks of severe EV-A71 infections and initiated development of EV-A71 vaccines. Five EV-A71 vaccine candidates have been clinically evaluated and three of them were approved for marketing in China. However, none of the China-approved products seek marketing approval in other countries.This situation supports a role for collaboration among Asian countries to facilitate clinical trials and licensure of EV-A71 vaccines. Additionally, enterovirus D68 outbreaks have been reported in the US and Taiwan currently and caused severe complications and deaths. Hence, an Asia-Pacific Network for Enterovirus Surveillance (APNES) has been established to estimate disease burden, understand virus evolution, and facilitate vaccine development through harmonizing laboratory diagnosis and data collection. Founded in 2017, the APNES is comprised of internationally recognized experts in the field of enterovirus in Asian countries working to raise awareness of this potentially fatal and debilitating disease. This article demonstrated the summaries of the first expert meeting, 2017 International Workshop on Enterovirus Surveillance and Vaccine Development, held by APNES in Taipei, Taiwan, March 2017.

TI  - Impact of climate change on sea surface wind in Southeast Asia, from climatological average to extreme events: results from a dynamical downscaling
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Southeast Asia (SEA) climate shows a large range of variability scales, from extreme events to interannual variability. Understanding its answer to climate change is of primary scientific and socio-economic importance. IPCC 5th assessment report however pointed the lack of knowledge in regional climate change and its impact in SEA. In particular little is known about the answer of wind to climate change. The impact of climate change on sea surface wind speed is investigated here, examining changes in daily and extreme event scales, interannual variability and climatological average between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. For that the RegCM4 regional model was used to perform a dynamical downscaling of CMIP5 simulations done with CNRM-CM5 global climate model under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 hypothesis. Comparisons with QuikSCAT satellite data show that the downscaled simulations perform overall better than the global simulations. Both models produce regionally and seasonally contrasted results in terms of daily wind speed answer to climate change. Global simulations produce mostly weak and non-significant changes, only suggesting an intensification of northeast winter monsoon in the northern SEA. Conversely regional downscaled simulations suggest from March to November in the northern South China Sea and Pacific regions a significant weakening of wind speed from climatological to daily scales (summer monsoon to extreme values), for regions and periods of initially strong values, associated with a 40-50% decrease of tropical cyclones frequency. These changes result from the increase of mean meridional south to north sea level pressure gradient and decrease its daily variability.

TI  - Snowmelt timing impacts on growing season phenology in the northern range of Yellowstone National Park estimated from MODIS satellite data
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Trends and geographic patterns of change in vegetation phenology metrics and snowmelt timing from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data sets were analyzed for the Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park over the period 2001 to 2017. Objectives The main question posed in this analysis was "Where has the growing season length, amplitude, and integrated greenness cover changed over the past two decades on the Northern Range, particularly in relation to vegetation cover types and the timing of spring snowmelt?" Methods Phenology metric patterns derived from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series at 250-m resolution were used to track changes in the growing season length, amplitude, and integrated greenness cover over the past two decades. Results Trend analysis showed that end of the growing season timing (EOST) and integrated greenness increased significantly over nearly 30% of the Northern Range study area, and NDVI amplitude increased significantly in several large drainages, particularly in shrub-grassland cover types. Significant variation in the start of the growing season (SOST), NDVI amplitude and integrated greenness could be further explained by the timing of spring snow melt. In years with relatively late snowmelt dates (after mid-May), higher plant growth was observed over the ensuing growing season, as captured in the amplitude and integrated greenness metrics, potentially due to elevated snow water inputs that can maintain available soil moisture levels for plant growth into the mid- and late-summer months. Conclusions The ecological implications of an extended period in November-December when grassland and shrub biomass supplies remain relatively snow-free and readily accessible to grazing ungulates will require further assessments.

TI  - Retrieving the global distribution of the threshold of wind erosion from satellite data and implementing it into the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory land-atmosphere model (GFDL AM4.0/LM4.0)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust emission is initiated when surface wind velocities exceed the threshold of wind erosion. Many dust models used constant threshold values globally. Here we use satellite products to characterize the frequency of dust events and land surface properties. By matching this frequency derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue aerosol products with surface winds, we are able to retrieve a climatological monthly global distribution of the wind erosion threshold (V-threshold) over dry and sparsely vegetated surfaces. This monthly two-dimensional threshold velocity is then implemented into the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory coupled land-atmosphere model (AM4.0/LM4.0). It is found that the climatology of dust optical depth (DOD) and total aerosol optical depth, surface PM10 dust concentrations, and the seasonal cycle of DOD are better captured over the "dust belt" (i.e., northern Africa and the Middle East) by simulations with the new wind erosion threshold than those using the default globally constant threshold. The most significant improvement is the frequency distribution of dust events, which is generally ignored in model evaluation. By using monthly rather than annual mean V-threshold, all comparisons with observations are further improved. The monthly global threshold of wind erosion can be retrieved under different spatial resolutions to match the resolution of dust models and thus can help improve the simulations of dust climatology and seasonal cycles as well as dust forecasting.

TI  - Development of mapping techniques for off road trafficability to support military operation
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrain plays a vital role in any military operation, however terrain trafficability assessment is the key requirement for planning any military operation in advance. In this study, terrain conditions for off-road trafficability assessment, an integrated approach used because it is affected by large number of factors. While evaluating terrain mobility, its topography along with land use/land cover are important factors. Maps have been the basic ingredient of topographic information throughout history of planning. In the current context of work, to generate mobility maps, an out-of-box methodology was experimented. This was performed by evaluating the relative direct and in-direct parameters from satellite data and terrain ancillary information. Hence the main objective of this study was to assess the potential of all the factors in providing relevant assisting information for vehicle mobility. To assess the relative importance of factors and its contribution in estimating off road trafficability requires the domain expertise and field experience. Based on qualitative assessment along with field studies, the overall impact can be converted into quantitative terms and ultimately it will pave the way for automation of trafficability, which will be useful in planning of corridors during military operations.

TI  - Application of GRACE to the estimation of groundwater storage change in a data-poor region: A case study of Ngadda catchment in the Lake Chad Basin
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is to explore the feasibility of GRACE-based estimation of a groundwater storage change in a data-poor region using a case study of the Ngadda catchment in the Lake Chad Basin. Although the Ngadda catchment has only one set of in situ time series data of groundwater from 2006 to 2009 and a limited number of groundwater measurements in 2005 and 2009, GRACE-based groundwater storage change can be evaluated against the in situ groundwater measurements combined with specific yield data. The cross-correlation analysis in the Ngadda catchment shows that maximum rainfall reached in July and August, whereas both the maximum total water storage anomaly and the maximum groundwater storage anomaly occurred 2months later. Whereas the mean annual amplitude of total water storage anomaly is about 17cm from both the average total water storage anomaly from three mascon products and the one from three spherical harmonic products, the mean annual amplitude of soil moisture storage anomaly is substantially varied from 5.58cm for CLM to about 14cm for NOAH and Mosaic. The goodness-of-fit tests show that CLM soil moisture produces the closest estimation of groundwater storage anomaly to the in situ groundwater measurements. The present study shows that GRACE-based estimation for groundwater storage anomaly can be a cost-effective and alternative tool to observe how groundwater changes in a basin scale under the limitation of modelling and in situ data availability.

TI  - Unequal Appropriation of Urban Vegetation in Argentine Cities
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seventy-five percent of the human population will live in urban areas by 2050, and urban vegetation will be the main source of ecosystem services. Unequal access to urban vegetation might exacerbate existing socioeconomic differences. Studies performed in cities of developed countries show that the population with higher socioeconomic status has more access to ecosystem services provided by vegetation. In urban areas, with small internal climatic variation, plant productivity measured through satellite imagery is a good indicator of vegetation availability that can be mapped. In this study, we characterized the distribution of plant productivity in 40 Argentine urban centers and we identified socio-environmental variables that control its spatial patterns within and among urban centers. We used socioeconomic indicators obtained from the 2010 National Population and Households Census and a 4-year mean plant productivity measured through the integration of NDVI values derived from MODIS satellite images. In most of the analyzed cities, plant productivity increased as socioeconomic status decreased; and only in 25% of the cities, we found a positive relationship between socioeconomic status and plant productivity. In the latter case, most of the cities were placed in arid environments, where both the cost of watering and the effect of subsidized water on plant productivity are proportionally higher. Buenos Aires and Bariloche, which also showed positive associations between socioeconomic status and plant productivity, are located in humid environments, but Buenos Aires is the most densely populated city of Argentina and Bariloche is a touristic city; in these cities, the relative cost of keeping green spaces instead of building housing infrastructure is also high. These results show that vegetation distribution among socioeconomic status is more diverse than suggested by the literature and that the appropriation of vegetation productivity by groups with higher socioeconomic status only occurs when vegetation cost increases to the point of becoming a luxury good.

TI  - Interannual variability and trends of combustion aerosol and dust in major continental outflows revealed by MODIS retrievals and CAM5 simulations during 2003-2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Emissions and long-range transport of mineral dust and combustion-related aerosol from burning fossil fuels and biomass vary from year to year, driven by the evolution of the economy and changes in meteorological conditions and environmental regulations. This study offers both satellite and model perspectives on the interannual variability and possible trends of combustion aerosol and dust in major continental outflow regions over the past 15 years (2003-2017). The decade-long record of aerosol optical depth (AOD, denoted as tau), separately for combustion aerosol (tau(c)) and dust (tau(d)), over global oceans is derived from the Collection 6 aerosol products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard both Terra and Aqua. These MODIS Aqua datasets, complemented by aerosol source-tagged simulations using the Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CAM5), are then analyzed to understand the interannual variability and potential trends of tau(c) and tau(d) in the major continental outflows. Both MODIS and CAM5 consistently yield a similar decreasing trend of -0.017 to -0.020 per decade for tau(c) over the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea that is attributable to reduced emissions from North America and Europe, respectively. On the contrary, both MODIS and CAM5 display an increasing trend of +0.017 to +0.036 per decade for tau(c) over the tropical Indian Ocean, the Bay of Bengal, and the Arabian Sea, which reflects the influence of increased anthropogenic emissions from South Asia and the Middle East in the last 2 decades. Over the northwestern Pacific Ocean, which is often affected by East Asian emissions of pollution and dust, the MODIS retrievals show a decreasing trend of 0 :021 per decade for tau(c) and -0.012 per decade for tau(d), which is, however, not reproduced by the CAM5 model. In other outflow regions strongly influenced by biomass burning smoke or dust, both MODIS retrievals and CAM5 simulations show no statistically significant trends; the MODIS-observed interannual variability is usually larger than that of the CAM5 simulation.

TI  - Mineralogical mapping using Landsat-8 OLI, Terra ASTER and Sentinel-2A multispectral data in Sidi Flah-Bouskour inlier, Moroccan Anti-Atlas
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The massif of Saghro in Moroccan Anti-Atlas is known for several important economic deposits. Thanks to its high potential in terms of production, the deposit of Bouskour is considered among the most important and promising ones on the national scale. The objective of this work is to evaluate the potential of the new Multispectral Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A sensors in comparison with the Terra ASTER sensor in mineralogical mapping. This task was completed using the band ratio (BR), independent component analysis (ICA) and mixture tuned matched filtering (MTMF) methods. In addition, a field survey was carried out in order to control and validate the obtained mineralogical abundances. The approach followed gave satisfactory results with respect to the field data and the previous studies. Therefore, the sensors used showed great potential for mineralogical mapping and they can be exploited in other regions.

TI  - Mapping Annual Land Use and Land Cover Changes in the Yangtze Estuary Region Using an Object-Based Classification Framework and Landsat Time Series Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A system understanding of the patterns, causes, and trends of long-term land use and land cover (LULC) change at the regional scale is essential for policy makers to address the growing challenges of local sustainability and global climate change. However, it still remains a challenge for estuarine and coastal regions due to the lack of appropriate approaches to consistently generate accurate and long-term LULC maps. In this work, an object-based classification framework was designed to mapping annual LULC changes in the Yangtze River estuary region from 1985-2016 using Landsat time series data. Characteristics of the inter-annual changes of LULC was then analyzed. The results showed that the object-based classification framework could accurately produce annual time series of LULC maps with overall accuracies over 86% for all single-year classifications. Results also indicated that the annual LULC maps enabled the clear depiction of the long-term variability of LULC and could be used to monitor the gradual changes that would not be observed using bi-temporal or sparse time series maps. Specifically, the impervious area rapidly increased from 6.42% to 22.55% of the total land area from 1985 to 2016, whereas the cropland area dramatically decreased from 80.61% to 55.44%. In contrast to the area of forest and grassland, which almost tripled, the area of inland water remained consistent from 1985 to 2008 and slightly increased from 2008 to 2016. However, the area of coastal marshes and barren tidal flats varied with large fluctuations.

TI  - Sentinel species for biomonitoring and biosurveillance of environmental heavy metals in Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART C-TOXICOLOGY AND CARCINOGENESIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nigeria receives copious annual precipitation to nourish its forests and agriculture, it has an extensive river drainage system, and it possesses valuable mineral deposits that stimulate both commercial and artisan mining activities. The combination of these features complicates Nigeria's efforts to produce adequate amounts of healthy foods to support its population. Toxic heavy metals like lead, cadmium, and mercury, and toxic metalloids such as arsenic, are also present in its mineral deposits and they migrate gradually into the soil and water of Nigeria by natural means. However, mining activities can liberate higher levels of toxic metals, which adversely affect Nigerian ecosystems and its food chains. Thus, environmental pollution due to anthropogenic activities is a major public health concern in Nigeria. This review covers the importance of native Nigerian and African wild and cultivated plants along with livestock and wild animals as sentinel species to evaluate heavy metals as environmental stressors and the use of sentinel species for food safety monitoring and for predicting potential risks to human health.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture in arid vegetation communities using MODIS vegetation and dryness indices
T2  - ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the methods devised to delineate soil and water information, optical/thermal remote sensing offers great capabilities by providing spatiotemporally multi-scale data and products like surface dryness indices. In this context, the present study utilized the MODIS-based TVDI, iTVDI, and VDI indices to scrutinize the effect of dryness on soil moisture in three vegetation communities: Artemisia spp. (sagebrush), Astragalus spp. (astragale) and grassland in central Iran during a wet (2004) and a dry year (2008). The MOD13A2, MOD11A2, and MOD09A1 products acquired on DOYs (day of the year) 97, 129, 161, and 193 were used to extract dryness and vegetation indices. The downscaled 32-day interval PERSIANN-CCS products and field-measured soil moisture were used to appraise the validity of indices. The results showed statistically significant relationships (P < .05) between iTVDI and cumulative precipitation and soil moisture in all vegetation communities and on most DOYs, suggesting iTVDI as an effective indicator to monitor dryness status. Foremost among the vegetation indices, NDVI was found as a good complementary indicator to estimate vegetation-soil moisture conditions due to exhibiting stronger linear associations with precipitation, particularly in grassland during the wet (R-2 = 0.81) and the dry (R-2 = 0.72) year. The lowest values of dryness indices were observed in western and southern parts of the study area. In general, it was concluded that side by side assessment of vegetation and dryness indices was a more promising approach to dryness assessment and management over arid and semi-arid rangelands.

TI  - Trump's "American System" and Canada
T2  - AMERICAN REVIEW OF CANADIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Donald Trump's tenure as President of the United States has been among the most disruptive in American history. In many areas, President Trump has upended convention, undermined norms, and cast aspersions on a host of institutions. Trump's imposition of punitive tariffs on steel and aluminum, along with the threat to withdraw from the NAFTA have been significant threats to the Canadian economy. The President's instincts on trade may be one of the few constants in a worldview on foreign policy that has otherwise lacked consistency. This article argues that Trump's actions on trade have other precedents in American history, many of which have similarly embroiled Canada.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to explore the root cause of growing gap in Islamic moral ideals and practices by examining paradigmatic foundation and moral axioms of Islamic business ethics. It compares and contrasts Tawhidi and secular paradigms in terms of their moral axioms and ethical mandates. Design/methodology/approach The paper first presents the paradigmatic foundation of Islamic ethics, namely, ihsan ethics. Second, it compares Tawhidi paradigm of Islam with secular paradigm in respect to their ontological, axiological, anthropological and teleological differences. Third, it links to Islamic moral axioms to the relevant paradigmatic pillars. Fourth, it defines "ihsan ethics" based on Tawhidi paradigm and moral axioms. Finally, it sheds some light on the gap between moral ideals and realities through the theory of ihsan ethics. Findings The paper attempts to provide strong conceptual and theoretical tools to understand ethical problems in the Muslim societies. The paper makes a strong case that Muslim minds shall be de-secularized to perceive the reality, truth and telos within Tawhidi worldview. As Muslims reach the level of ihsan by perceiving transcendental reality, they are likely to practice what they preach. Originality/value The paper proposes "ihsan ethics" based on Tawhidi worldview and Islamic moral axioms.

TI  - Mapping the Roman Water Supply System of the Wadi el Melah Valley in Gafsa, Tunisia, Using Remote Sensing
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, very high-resolution satellite remote-sensing tools have been progressively used in archaeological prospecting to acquire information and improve documentation. Satellite remote sensing has also benefited from technical improvements, including better spectral and spatial resolution of sensors, which have facilitated the detection and discovery of unknown archaeological areas. This paper focuses on investigations conducted using multi-spectral satellite remote-sensing data of the ancient canal systems of the Wadi el Melah Valley (WMV) in southern Tunisia. The area used to be part of a huge military defense system along the desert border. This paper describes the use of GeoEye-1 and Ziyuan-3 satellite remote-sensing data to reveal ancient Roman canals, which were part of an advanced hydraulic system devised to capture runoff water and cope with the lack of water in the area. In general, this research provides new information on some essential sections of the Roman walled defense system Limes (Fossatum) in the southern part of the empire, where we study previously undetected sites.

TI  - Axillary ultrasound for prediction of response to neoadjuvant therapy in the context of surgical strategies to axillary dissection in primary breast cancer: a systematic review of the current literature
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose Data on the optimal treatment strategy for patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) who initially presented with metastatic nodes and convert to node-negative disease (cN+ -> ycN0) are limited. Since NAT leads to axillary downstaging in 20-60% of patients, the question arises whether these patients might be offered less-invasive procedures than axillary dissection, such as sentinel node biopsy or targeted removal of lymph nodes marked before therapy. Methods We performed a systematic review of clinical studies on the use of axillary ultrasound for prediction of response to NAT and ultrasound-guided marking of metastatic nodes for targeted axillary dissection. Results The sensitivity of ultrasound for prediction of residual node metastasis was higher than that of clinical examination and MRI/PET in most studies; specificity ranged in large trials from 37 to 92%. The diagnostic performance of ultrasound after NAT seems to be associated with tumor subtype: the positive predictive value was highest in luminal, the negative in triple-negative tumors. Several trials evaluated the usefulness of ultrasound for targeted axillary dissection. Before NAT, nodes were most commonly marked using ultrasound-guided clip placement, followed by ultrasound-guided placement of a radioactive seed. After chemotherapy, the clip was detected on ultrasound in 72-83% of patients; a comparison of sonographic visibility of different clips is lacking. Detection rate after radioactive seed placement was ca. 97%. Conclusion In conclusion, ultrasound improves prediction of axillary response to treatment in comparison to physical examination and serves as a reliable guiding tool for marking of target lymph nodes before the start of treatment. High quality and standardization of the examination is crucial for selection of patients for less-invasive surgery.

TI  - Mapping heat and traffic stress of urban park vegetation based on satellite imagery-A comparison of Bucharest, Romania and Leipzig, Germany
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large and comparatively compact European cities such as Bucharest and Leipzig struggle with considerable urban heat island (UHI) effects characterized by heat and drought together with high concentrations of air pollutants (NO2, SO2, O-3, CO2). However, a healthy urban green infrastructure is necessary to reduce the impacts of UHI on human health. Therefore, continuous monitoring schemes are required for green infrastructure in order to improve human life in such cities. Satellite remote sensing can provide the means for monitoring urban vegetation status. In this study, vegetation indices, mostly based on the spectral bands located in the red-edge region, were computed from Sentinel-2 imagery, and land surface temperature (hereafter LST) was estimated from Landsat 8 data. The aim was to assess the individual and cumulative effects of both vicinity to roads and estimated LST on tree vegetation health in urban parks using analysis of variance. Vegetation indices indicated stressed vegetation. However, tracking urban tree health required a combination of indices, and therefore of spectral ranges, rather than one specific index alone, as the effect sizes varied between parks, cities and along the centre-periphery gradient. Therefore, spaceborne data can provide spatially-explicit indicators for stressed urban vegetation and, thus, decreasing ecosystem services delivery. Future studies are encouraged to decipher further the relation the spatial configuration of urban systems and remote sensing based stress indicators of urban trees using publicly available datasets to enable comparative studies.

TI  - Lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel lymph node biopsy in vulvar carcinoma: update from a European expert panel
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose This study aimed to update the clinical practice applications and technical procedures of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in vulvar cancer from European experts. Methods A systematic data search using PubMed/MEDLINE database was performed up to May 29, 2019. Only original studies focused on SLN biopsy in vulvar cancer, published in the English language and with a minimum of nine patients were selected. Results Among 280 citations, 65 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. On the basis of the published evidences and consensus of European experts, this study provides an updated overview on clinical applications and technical procedures of SLN biopsy in vulvar cancer. Conclusions SLN biopsy is nowadays the standard treatment for well-selected women with clinically negative lymph nodes. Negative SLN is associated with a low groin recurrence rate and a good 5-year disease-specific survival rate. SLN biopsy is the most cost-effective approach than lymphadenectomy in early-stage vulvar cancer. However, future trials should focus on the safe extension of the indication of SLN biopsy in vulvar cancer. Although radiotracers and optical agents are widely used in the clinical routine, there is an increasing interest for hybrid tracers like indocyanine-Tc-99m-nanocolloid. Finally, it is essential to standardise the acquisition protocol including SPECT/CT images, and due to the low incidence of this type of malignancy to centralise this procedure in experienced centres for personalised approach.

TI  - A Pyro-Engraved Gourd from Cahuachi: An Iconographic and Technical Analysis of a Nasca Masterpiece
T2  - NAWPA PACHA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article addresses a complex pyro-engraved gourd of Nasca culture, with unusual dimensions and decorative treatment. The gourd was discovered as an offering associated with ceramics from the last phases of the Early Horizon (Ocucaje 8-10) and the beginning of the Early Intermediate Period (Nasca 1-4) during the 1994 Nasca Project's excavations (CISRAP) in Cahuachi, a ceremonial center located in the basin of the Rio Grande de Nazca. We study this particular artifact from a comparative perspective, based on its archaeological context, technical characteristics, and imagery, in order to explore Early Nasca production practices, iconographic repertoire, and worldview.

TI  - The grey-green divide: multi-temporal analysis of greenness across 10,000 urban centres derived from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of green spaces within city centres has been recognized as a valuable component of the city landscape. Vegetation provides a variety of benefits including energy saving, improved air quality, reduced noise pollution, decreased ambient temperature and psychological restoration. Evidence also shows that the amount of vegetation, known as 'greenness', in densely populated areas, can also be an indicator of the relative wealth of a neighbourhood. The 'grey-green divide', the contrast between built-up areas with a dominant grey colour and green spaces, is taken as a proxy indicator of sustainable management of cities and planning of urban growth. Consistent and continuous assessment of greenness in cities is therefore essential for monitoring progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11. The availability of multi-temporal greenness information from Landsat data archives together with data derived from the city centres database of the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) initiative, offers a unique perspective to quantify and analyse changes in greenness across 10,323 urban centres all around the globe. In this research, we assess differences between greenness within and outside the built-up area for all the urban centres described by the city centres database of the GHSL. We also analyse changes in the amount of green space over time considering changes in the built-up areas in the periods 1990, 2000 and 2014. The results show an overall trend of increased greenness between 1990 and 2014 in most cities. The effect of greening is observed also for most of the 32 world megacities. We conclude that using simple yet effective approaches exploiting open and free global data it is possible to provide quantitative information on the greenness of cities and its changes over time. This information is of direct interest for urban planners and decision-makers to mitigate urban related environmental and social impacts.

TI  - Estimating the suspended sediment concentration from TM/Landsat-5 images for the Araguaia River ? Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, 68 images from TM/Landsat-5 sensor were used to estimate Suspended Sediment Concentration (SSC) along of the Araguaia River, Brazil. These were combined with in-situ SSC, hydrosedimentometric station (categorical variable), and remote sensing reflectance. Top-of-Atmosphere (ToA) and surface reflectance data were evaluated. Multiple regression models with ToA reflectance using VNIR bands, band ratios, SWIR band 5 as input and station as categorical variable were more accurate with adjusted coefficient of determination (adjusted R-2) = 0.87 and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) = 10.09% compared to the models with surface reflectance with adjusted R-2 = 0.60 and NRMSE = 15.43%. Results confirm the potential for estimation of SSC from TM/Landsat-5 historical series data between 1984 and 2012, for which in-situ database is rare. Based on this empirical model, future studies may provide better analysis of spatiotemporal variations of sediment transport along the Araguaia River with the SSC temporal series reconstitution.

TI  - Response of the barrier island coastal region of southwestern Nigeria to climate and non-climate forcing
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite threats emanating from the influence of climate and non-climate forcing on the barrier island coastal region of southwestern Nigeria, the extent of the coastal erosion is poorly understood. We report evidence of coastal erosion and sediment accumulation in the region over a 34-year period (1973-2017), using Landsat imagery at intervals of approximately six years. Landsat image corrections and various water-extraction algorithms were used to systematically delineate coastal erosion and accumulation in the area. The region was subdivided into western and eastern subregions separated by Lagos Harbour. In the west, erosion took place during the periods 1973-1979, 1979-1984, 1990-1999 and 2005-2011, whereas in the east, erosion occurred during 1973-1979, 1990-1999 and 1999-2005. Coastal sediment accumulation occurred in the east during 1979-1984, 1984-1990, 2005-2011 and 2011-2017, whereas gains in the west occurred during 1984-1990, 1999-2005 and 2011-2017. The study revealed substantial net erosion of 1 228.1 ha in the region as a whole, over the full period. Sediment accumulation accompanying the coastal erosion appears to be linked to longshore drift. Erosion between 1973 and 2011 was probably attributable to climate change (storms and tidal conditions), longshore drift, the inflow and outflow of water at Lagos Harbour, coastal morphology and, possibly, human impacts. However, the coastal changes between 2011 and 2017 were more obviously associated with human activities, such as development of the Eko Atlantic construction project. Coastal surveillance, together with the use of environmentally sensitive protective measures, could possibly help to reduce coastal erosion in the region. Careful coastal management practices, including artificial nourishing and the installation of resilient structures (e.g. seawalls), should be undertaken to protect human settlements that are already at risk from sea-level rise.

TI  - Assessing the suitability of FROM-GLC10 data for understanding agricultural ecosystems in China: Beijing as a case study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The first 10 m resolution global land-cover map, FROM-GLC10 was released in early March 2019. Due to its high spatial resolution and reliable global accuracy, we evaluated the suitability of FROM-GLC10 data for understanding agricultural ecosystems in Beijing using a comparable vector data set, Google Earth images and field survey data. The overall accuracy (OA) for FROM-GLC10 based on three data sets was 71.08%, 79.63% and 80.36%, respectively. Meanwhile, there were notable misclassifications between cropland, grassland and forest. The limited accuracy for these vegetation types might be attributed to the spatially mixed vegetation structures, seasonal variations of vegetation and the temporal inconsistence between Landsat and Sentinel data set. Due to its satisfactory OA, FROM-GLC10 data have the potential to be widely employed for evaluating the progress of large-scale ecological restoration projects. On the other hand, the data producers, who can pre-set and classify some customized land-cover types, consider time-series analysis and big data fusion methods and conduct large-scale verification, and data users, who can integrate different data sources, should work together to enhance the suitability and reliability of FROM-GLC10 data for understanding agricultural ecosystems in China.

TI  - Towards a New Environmentalism: Indigeneity, Ethics and Ecology in Vargas Llosa's <i>The Storyteller</i> and Two Recent Ecocritical Studies
T2  - CURRENT WRITING-TEXT AND RECEPTION IN SOUTHERN AFRICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Starting with the premise that postcolonial writers are increasingly interested in aspects of indigenous thinking, this paper draws on recent ecocriticism to analyse Mario Vargas Llosa'sThe Storyteller. In this novel, Llosa dramatises in fictional form the worldview of the Machiguenga Indians of Peru. He constructs the voices of two university friends in Lima: those of Saul Zuratas and an unnamed narrator. Chapter by chapter, through their juxtaposed conversations, visits to the remote jungles of Cusco and Madre de Dios in eastern Peru, and Saul's narration of the stories he tells the Machiguengas, the reader encounters the worldview of this small isolated tribe. Their cosmology values and customs are revealed to be ecologically sensitive, offering an interconnected communal vision on which the survival of the ecosphere depends.

TI  - Barbadian Gothic: The Moving Coffins of the Chase Vault in Socio-Cultural Context
T2  - FOLKLORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chase family vault (Oistins, Barbados) is widely known as the setting of a macabre nineteenth-century story of moving coffins. On several occasions between 1812 and 1821, on opening the sealed vault to add a new burial, the neatly stacked coffins were found scattered. This legend has never been examined within its contemporary setting, including the Gothic literary and cultural movement. This article seeks to show that the episode reveals much about the negotiation of power in an island society on the edge of slave rebellion, where the planter class were fearful of the enslaved peoples' continued practice of the banned spiritual and healing rituals known as Obeah. The article further examines how the story reflects notions of otherness, death, materiality, and memory in early nineteenth-century Barbados, where the ordered Protestant world of the planters clashed with what they perceived as the elemental worldview of the enslaved African and Afro-Barbadian population.

TI  - The Generalised Settlement Area: mapping the Earth surface in the vicinity of built-up areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Geo-information on settlements from Earth Observation offers a base for objective and scalable monitoring of the evolution of cities and settlements, including their location, extent and other attributes. In this work, we deploy the best available global knowledge on the presence of human settlements and built-up structures derived from Earth Observation to advance the understanding of the human presence on Earth. We start from a concept of Generalised Settlement Area to identify the Earth surface within which any built-up structure is present. We further characterise the resulted map by using an agreement map among the state of the art of remote sensing products mapping built-up areas or other strictly related semantic abstractions as urban areas or artificial surfaces. The agreement map is formed by a grid of 1 km(2), where each cell is classified according to the number of EO-derived products reporting any positive occurrence of the abstractions related to the presence of built-up structures. The paper describes the characteristics of the Generalised Settlement Area, the differences in the agreement map across geographic regions of the world, and outlines the implications for potential users of the EO-derived products used in this study.

TI  - Monitoring land degradation at national level using satellite Earth Observation time-series data to support SDG15-exploring the potential of data cube
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Avoiding, reducing, and reversing land degradation and restoring degraded land is an urgent priority to protect the biodiversity and ecosystem services that are vital to life on Earth. To halt and reverse the current trends in land degradation, there is an immediate need to enhance national capacities to undertake quantitative assessments and mapping of their degraded lands, as required by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular, the SDG indicator 15.3.1 ("proportion of land that is degraded over total land area"). Earth Observations (EO) can play an important role both for generating this indicator as well as complementing or enhancing national official data sources. Implementations like Trends.Earth to monitor land degradation in accordance with the SDG15.3.1 rely on default datasets of coarse spatial resolution provided by MODIS or AVHRR. Consequently, there is a need to develop methodologies to benefit from medium to high-resolution satellite EO data (e.g. Landsat or Sentinels). In response to this issue, this paper presents an initial overview of an innovative approach to monitor land degradation at the national scale in compliance with the SDG15.3.1 indicator using Landsat observations using a data cube but further work is required to improve the calculation of the three sub-indicators.

TI  - Artificial neural network models by ALOS PALSAR data for aboveground stand carbon predictions of pure beech stands: a case study from northern of Turkey
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study was to estimate aboveground stand carbon (AGSC) of pure beech stands in Turkey with ground measurements as well as topographic information and remote sensing data. For this purpose, 153 sample plots were collected from pure beech stands in study area. The AGSC of each sample plot was computed. Eight texture images (variance, dissimilarity, homogeneity, entropy, contrast, mean, second moment and correlation) with five window sizes (3 x 3, 5 x 5, 7 x 7, 9 x 9 and 11 x 11) generated from ALOS PALSAR L-band satellite image. The AGSC models predicting the relationships between ALOS PALSAR texture values and topographic information, and sample plot AGSC were developed by using multiple linear regressions (MLR). Also, artificial neural networks (ANNs) architectures were trained by comparing various numbers of neurons and activation functions in its network types. Our results revealed the ability of ANNs was better than MLR models to predict AGSC values.

TI  - Extraction of snow cover from high-resolution remote sensing imagery using deep learning on a small dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is of great significance for many applications. However, automatic extraction of snow cover from high spatial resolution remote sensing (HSRRS) imagery remains challenging, owing to its multiscale characteristics, similarities to clouds, and occlusion by the shadows of mountains and clouds. Deep convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation are the most popular approach to automatic map generation, but they require huge computing time and resources, as well as a large dataset of pixel-wise annotated HSRRS images, which precludes the application of many superior models. In this study, these limitations are overcome by using a sequence of transfer learning steps. The method starts with a modified aligned ?Xception? model pre-trained for object classification on ImageNet. Subsequently, a ?DeepLab version three plus? (DeepLabv3+) model is trained using a large dataset of Landsat images and corresponding snow cover products. Finally, a second transfer learning step is employed to fine-tune the model on the small dataset of GaoFen-2, the highest resolution HSRRS satellite in China. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this framework for automatic snow cover extraction.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The unprecedented extreme flood occurred in Jhelum basin, India in the first week of September, 2014 due to continuous spell of high intensity antecedent rainfall. The rainstorm observed over the basin during the event was unprecedented in terms of accumulated rainfall. In this study, Operational Land Imager (OLI) Landsat images taken before and after flood were employed to assess the morphologic and geomorphic effects of the flood along both the sides of the Jhelum River. The total erosion and sedimentation for the study reach due to flooding were 278 and 2.7 ha respectively. The flow length and the average channel width were decreased by 500 m and 25 m respectively. The study reach was divided into meander loops (M), straight stretches (S), and island bars (B) based on sinuosity and braiding. The maximum erosion in the meander loops was observed in M5 section, B4 section in island bars, and S7 section in straight stretches of the river. The maximum erosion was observed in the riparian cover due to this flood. However, damage to the built-up cover was practically very limited to the selected river reaches due to the reinforced channel banks. It is evident from the findings of the erosion on different sections of the meander loops and straight reaches that as the sinuosity increases, the erosion also increases for a relatively significant areal extend of each land cover. This result gives insight to the incompetent management measures of riparian cover, which is a principal reason for the huge economic losses during flood.

TI  - The Impacts of the Expansion of Urban Impervious Surfaces on Urban Heat Islands in a Coastal City in China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of the expansion of urban impervious surfaces on surface urban heat islands (UHIs) has attracted research attention due to its relevance for studies of local climatic change and habitat comfort. In this study, using five satellite images of Xiamen city, Southeast China (four images from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and one from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS)) acquired in summer between 1989 and 2016, together with spatial statistical methods, the changes in impervious surface area (ISA) were investigated, the spatiotemporal variation of the intensity of urban heat islands (UHIs) was explored, and the relationships between land surface temperature (LST) and the percentage of impervious surface area (ISA%), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and fractional vegetation coverage (Fv) were investigated. The results showed the following: (1) According to the biophysical composition index (BCI) combined with an ISA post-processing method, Xiamen has witnessed a substantial increase in ISA, showing a 6.1-fold increase from 1989 to 2016. The direction of ISA expansion was consistent throughout the study period in each of the five districts of Xiamen; (2) a bay-like UHI form is observed in the study area, which is remarkably distinct from the central-radial UHI form observed in previous studies of other cities; (3) the extent of UHIs in Xiamen greatly increased between 1989 and 2016, experiencing a 4.7-fold increase in UHI areas during this time. However, during the same period, the urban heat island ratio index (URI)-that is, the ratio of UHI area to ISA-decreased slightly. The UHI area decreased in some urban parts of Xiamen due to a significant increase in vegetation coverage, urban village redevelopment, and the construction of new parks; (4) sea ports and heavy industrial zones are the greatest contributor to surface UHI, followed by urban villages; and (5) LST is strongly positively correlated with ISA%. Each 10% increase in ISA was associated with an increase in summer LST of 0.41 to 0.91 K, which compares well with the results of related studies. This study presents valuable information for the development of regional urban planning strategies to mitigate the effects of UHIs during rapid urbanization.

TI  - Comparison of the cloud top heights retrieved from MODIS and AHI satellite data with ground-based Ka-band radar
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand the accuracy of cloud top heights (CTHs) derived from passive satellite data, ground-based Ka-band radar measurements from 2016 and 2017 in Beijing are compared with CTH data inferred from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI). Relative to the radar CTHs, the MODIS CTHs are found to be underestimated by -1.10 +/- 2.53 km on average and 49% of CTH differences are within 1.0 km. The AHI CTHs are underestimated by -1.10 +/- 2.27 km and 42% are within 1.0 km. Both the MODIS and AHI CTH retrieval accuracy depends strongly on the cloud depth (CD). Large differences are mainly due to the retrieval of thin clouds of CD < 1 km, especially when the cloud base height is higher than 4 km. For clouds with CD > 1 km, the mean CTH difference decreases to -0.48 +/- 1.70 km for MODIS and to -0.76 +/- 1.63 km for AHI. It is found that MODIS CTHs with higher values (i.e. > 6 km) show smaller discrepancy with radar CTH than those MODIS CTHs with lower values (i.e. < 4 km). Statistical analysis illustrate that the CTH difference between the two satellite instruments is lower than the difference between the satellite instrument and the ground-based Ka-band radar. The monthly accuracy of both CTH retrieval algorithms is investigated and it is found that summer has the smallest retrieval difference.

TI  - Crop classification using spectral indices derived from Sentinel-2A imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND TELECOMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing is one of the most attractive options for generating crop cover maps because it enables computation of vegetation indices, which are useful for assessing the condition of vegetation. The Sentinel-2A Multispectral Instrument (MSI), which is a multispectral sensor with 13 bands covering the visible, near infrared and short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelength regions, offers a vast number of vegetation indices. Spectral indices, which are combinations of spectral measurements at different wavelengths, have been used in the previous studies and they sometimes contributed to improve classification accuracies. In this study, 91 published spectral indices were calculated from the MSI data. Additionally, classification algorithms are essential for generating accurate maps and the random forests classifier is one of which possesses the five hyperparameters were applied. The improvements in classification accuracies were confirmed achieving an overall accuracy of 93.1% based on the reflectance at 4 bands and 8 spectral indices.

TI  - Estimation of recent changes in thickness and mass balance of the Patsio glacier in the Great Himalayan region using geodetic technique and ancillary data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - An understanding of glacier mass budget in the Himalayas is important for regional water resource management. This study presents a detailed estimation of mass budget of the Patsio glacier (The Great Himalaya) using SRTM-X (2000), Cartosat-1 (2005) and TanDEM-X (2013) DEMs. Geodetic findings indicate an overall mass loss by -0.26 +/- 0.11 m.w.e/yr,-0.30 +/- 0.10 m.w.e/yr and -0.16 +/- 0.11 m.w.e/yr during 2000-2013, 2000-2005 and 2005-2013 respectively. Maximum downwasting was observed in the terminus area of the glacier during the period 2000-2013. The observed lower rate of mass loss between 2005 and 2013 was attributed to declining temperature during that period. However, long-term temperature trends depict warming, so was exhibited by mass loss during 2000-2013. Geodetic based findings were found to be concordant with GPR based estimation. This study confirms the suitability of geodetic mass balance technique for mountainous glaciers, which will be useful to evaluate future changes in the glacial extent and runoff study.

TI  - Supervisors' Perception of Vicarious Trauma and Growth in Australian Refugee Trauma Counsellors
T2  - AUSTRALIAN SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Vicarious trauma is a well-accepted phenomenon supported by more than 20 years of research, yet the body of research on the positive impact, known as vicarious post-traumatic growth, is relatively small. Based on a metasynthesis of qualitative peer-reviewed vicarious trauma studies, Cohen and Collens propose a model of the co-occurrence of vicarious trauma and vicarious post-traumatic growth. This model was examined through a qualitative study involving 11 interviews with supervisors of refugee trauma counsellors working in Forum of Australian Services for Survivors of Torture and Trauma (FASSTT) member agencies. This research project both reviewed the model from the perspective of experienced supervisors and illuminated what occurred within the supervision process to manage vicarious trauma and encourage vicarious post-traumatic growth. While the research project affirmed aspects of the model, the failure of the model to consider socio-political factors limited its applicability to FASSTT agencies. IMPLICATIONSFASSTT clinical supervisors engage in supervision in a manner that may assist counsellors to process how their clients' trauma disclosures impact on their levels of stress and change their perception of self, their role, and their worldview. Including recognition of the influence of the socio-political context of refugee trauma and trauma recovery may be an important additional component of supervision practice.

TI  - Sunshine duration in Poland from ground- and satellite-based data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study is to characterise the spatial variability of sunshine duration in Poland. The study used ground-based and satellite-based data from 1983 to 2018 multi-annual period, from the territory of Poland. The ground-based data include daily sums of sunshine duration from 29 Institute of Meteorology and Water Management-National Research Institute stations and two stations of the Jagiellonian University. Satellite-based data from the product "SDU - Sunshine Duration, v003" were used with a resolution of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees, coming from the nearest pixel of a given meteorological station. These values were obtained from the SARAH-2.1 database, published by The European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). It was found that the mean annual sums of sunshine duration calculated on the basis of ground-based data in Poland range from about 1,460-1,500 hr in the south and south-west of the country (mountain areas) to 1,800-1,830 hr in the north-the region of the eastern Baltic coast. Satellite-based data are in line with ground-based data in relation to the dependence of sunshine duration on latitude, that is, the increase in sunshine duration from the south to the north in the summer and in the spring, and the decrease in the winter. In the autumn, the spatial variability based on satellite data is more latitudinal than in the case of ground-based data. Moreover, in the autumn and winter, the sums of sunshine duration based on satellite data are overestimated and, in the summer, especially since the turn of the 20th and 21st century, they have been underestimated. The performed analysis has shown that there is some conformity of the results, but the accuracy of matching satellite-based data and ground-based data depends on the location of the station and is subject to fluctuations in the annual and multi-annual cycle.

TI  - Meteorological modeling relevant to mesoscale and regional air quality applications: a review
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
M3  - Review
AB  - The highest correlative relations for air pollution levels are often with meteorological variables such as temperature and wind speed. Today, sophisticated gridded high-resolution meteorological models are used to produce meteorological fields that drive chemical transport models for air quality management. Errors in specification of the physical atmosphere such as temperature, clouds and winds can affect the air quality predictions. Additionally, the efficiency and efficacy of emission control strategies can be compromised by errors in the meteorological fields. In this paper, the role of meteorology in air quality behavior, primarily from the viewpoint of regional ozone modeling as carried out in the U.S., is reviewed. Particular attention is given to physics and new techniques for improving meteorological model performance. Uncertainties in model turbulent mixing in the nighttime boundary layer, where large model differences exist, are examined. The role of spatial mesoscale features such as topography and land/water systems in models are discussed. The nocturnal low-level jet, a mesoscale temporal and spatial feature, and its impact on air quality are examined. Traditional air quality concerns have focused on synoptic conditions at the center of high-pressure systems. However, high ozone levels have also been associated with stationary fronts. The ability of models to capture mesoscale structure and yet retain synoptic structure and its timing is challenging. Data assimilation and its ability to improve model performance are examined. Particular attention is given to vertical nudging strategies that can affect formation of the nocturnal low-level jets. Finally, clouds can have a major impact on air quality since insolation impacts temperature, biogenic emissions and photolysis rates and extremes in stability. Traditional techniques, which attempt to insert cloud water where there is not dynamical support, can lead to additional errors. New dynamical approaches for improving model cloud performance are discussed. Implications: This article shows that there has been a considerable improvement in meteorological models used for air quality simulations. In particular, improvement in the tools for incorporating both traditional observations and new satellite data for retrospective studies has been beneficial to air quality community. However, while this trend is continuing, many challenges remain. As an example, due to having many options available in configuring a model simulation, there is a need to evaluate and recommend sets of options that provide important performance measures.

TI  - Long-term dynamics of woodland vegetation with response of climate variability in the lowlands of north western part of Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is one of the main earth's surface resources. It serves as a bridge among some earth's components like soil, atmosphere and water cycle. It is the most sensitive indicator of seasonal change and environmental degradation. Analysis of terrestrial vegetation dynamics allows a better understanding of climate effects on terrestrial ecosystems. Vegetation growth is influenced by the climate conditions. But, there is a debate whether woodland vegetation decreases or increases in the study area. The area was selected purposely where vegetation is sensitive too much to precipitation (RF) and relative humidity (RH). LANDSAT image has been selected from United State Geological Survey website. Starting 1984-2014 period collection of LANDSAT image with TM, ETM scanner has designed for normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) analysis. Meteorological data were collected from Ethiopian Methodological Agency. The maximum value of NDVI was computed using ERDAS 2010 and ArcGIS10.2 software. It was analyzed with meteorological data by multiple regression analysis approach using R-statistical package. Statistical analysis result showed that woodland vegetation NDVI value and RH had positive correlation with precipitation while temperature was negative. It indicated that precipitation and woodland vegetation have strong relationship. Precipitation was significant key factor for woodland vegetation. The value of R-2 = 0.71 and P < 0.05 showed us NDVI could contribute significantly for climate variability. Spatial and temporal dynamics of woodland vegetation was found greater in the semiarid area. This was due to sensitivity nature of woodland vegetation and fire experience of the study area. Therefore, woodland's vegetation was highly sensitive to climate factor's variability and seasonal change.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns and Drivers of the Surface Urban Heat Island in 36 Major Cities in China: A Comparison of Two Different Methods for Delineating Rural Areas
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) are an important issue in urban sustainability, and the standardized calculation of surface urban heat island (SUHI) intensity has been a common concern of researchers in the past. In this study, we used the administrative borders (AB) method and an optimized simplified urban-extent (OSUE) algorithm to calculate the surface urban heat island intensity from 2001 to 2017 for 36 major cities in mainland China by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. The spatiotemporal differences between these two methods were analyzed from the perspectives of the regional and national patterns and the daily, monthly, and annual trends. Regardless of the spatial or temporal scale, the calculation results of these two methods showed extremely similar patterns, especially for the daytime. However, when the calculated SUHI intensities were investigated through a regression analysis with multiple driving factors, we found that, although natural conditions were the main drivers for both methods, the anthropogenic factors obtained from statistical data (population and gross domestic product) were more correlated with the SUHI intensity from the AB method. This trend was probably caused by the spatial extent of the statistical data, which aligned more closely with the rural extent in the AB method. This study not only explores the standardization of the calculation of urban heat intensity but also provides insights into the relationship between urban development and the SUHI.

TI  - Validation of environmental DNA sampling for determination of <i>Ceratonova shasta</i> (Cnidaria: Myxozoa) distribution in Plumas National Forest, CA
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ceratonova shasta is the etiological agent of myxozoan-associated enteronecrosis in North American salmonids. The parasite's life cycle involves waterborne spores and requires both a salmonid fish and a freshwater fabriciid annelid. The success and survival of annelids can be enhanced by flow moderation by dams, and through the erosion of fine sediments into stream channels following wildfires. In this study, the presence of C. shasta environmental/ex-host DNA (eDNA) in river water and substrate samples collected from areas affected by recent fire activity in California, USA, was investigated. Additionally, DNA loads in the environment were compared to C. shasta infection in sentinel-exposed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Significant associations between C. shasta detection in environmental samples and location within a wildfire perimeter (p = 0.002), between C. shasta detection in sentinel fish and exposure location within a wildfire perimeter (p = 0.015), and between C. shasta detection in fish and locations where water temperature was above the median (p < 0.001) were observed. Additionally, a higher prevalence of C. shasta infection in fish was detected where C. shasta was also detected in environmental samples (p < 0.001). Results suggest that pathogen eDNA sampling can be used as a non-invasive, rapid, specific, and sensitive method for establishing risk of C. shasta infection in wild populations. Knowledge of the complete life cycle of the target parasite, including ecology of each host, can inform the choice of eDNA sampling strategy. Environmental DNA sampling also revealed a novel species of Ceratonova, not yet observed in a host.

TI  - Fire dynamics in Mato Grosso State, Brazil: the relative roles of gross primary productivity
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The fires and biomass burning are responsible for affect ecosystem processes in a wide range of biomes at regional and global scales. In Brazil, the state of Mato Grosso is one of the most affected by the occurrence of forest fires. Thus, this study aims to quantify the long-term changes in the temporal and spatial patterns of fire occurrence and their effect on gross primary productivity (GPP) in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, considering the biomes that compose it. The images used in the study were acquired by satellite Terra and Aqua combined in the product MCD64A1.006, a monthly resolution of 500m by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, during the period from 01/10/2000 to 12/31/2018. The MOD17A2 product derived from the MODIS sensor provides the accumulated value of GPP. The points without the presence of burning presented higher values of GPP for all studied biomes. In some points with the presence of burning the GPP even decreased by 44.20%, 30.04% and 55.78% for Amazonia, Cerrado, and Pantanal, respectively. According to the results presented here, it is concluded that the burnings negatively impact gross primary production in the biomes of the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil and the dynamics of the burns do not keep up with the intensity of drought years. The use of cluster analysis techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), is an alternative to bigdata analysis when the objective is to evaluate the presence of forest burning in more than one biome.

TI  - Watersheds Characteristics and Prioritization Using Morphometric Parameters and Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchal Process (FAHP): A Part of Lower Subansiri Sub-Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, the study of watersheds plays an important role for any kind of developmental activities and sustainable management. The present study lies in tectonically active regions of Northeast India, which needs to be given proper consideration prior to taking up any kind of developmental activity. The main objective of the research is to understand the behaviors of the watersheds in response to the neo-tectonic and to prioritize the watersheds using morphometric parameters and fuzzy-AHP. For the present studies, nine watersheds have been extracted from the Cartosat DEM using ArcGIS 10 software. Sixteen morphometric parameters indicating neo-tectonic domain have been considered for the study of prioritization of the watersheds. Firstly, the deviation of linear regression in Horton's law of drainage order and drainage length has been discussed which indicates that all the watersheds are influenced by endogenic force, which induces the changes of the landform. Based on the FAHP weighted value, the prioritization of watershed is classified into five classes, namely very low (< 0.044), low (0.0466-0.0645), medium (0.0645-0.1112), high (0.1112-0.1818), and very high (0.1818-0.2691). The watersheds A and D are assigned to highest rank as they were within the 0.182 and 0.270 weighted values. And watershed E is lowest among the nine watersheds with weighted value of < 0.044, respectively. Finally, Kappa method has been used to validate the results and observed that 47% and 30% of the collected data fall within very high and high prioritization zones.

The majority of hospitalizations reported by provinces and territories have been associated with influenza A(H3N2) (76%), and the greatest proportion have been among adults 65 years and older (40%). Among sentinel pediatric influenza hospitalizations, 55% were associated with influenza B and the majority have been under five years of age (63%). Antigenic and genetic characterization results to date suggest that the majority of circulating A(H3N2) and B viruses are not similar to the virus components recommended for use in the 2019-2020 seasonal influenza vaccines and that the majority of circulating A(H1N1) viruses are similar to the vaccine reference strains.

TI  - A statistical study of pre-summer hourly extreme rainfall over the Pearl River Delta metropolitan region during 2008-2017
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we explored the hourly extreme rainfall over the Pearl River Delta metropolitan region (PRDMR) by performing a statistical analysis on a 10-year hourly precipitation dataset combined with the fifth generation of ECMWF atmospheric hourly reanalysis (ERA-5) and half-hourly FengYun-2 geostationary satellite observations during the pre-summer rainy season from 2008 to 2017. Results showed that hourly extreme rainfall events over the PRDMR increased at a significant pace during the most recent 10 years, which frequently occurred during the early morning (0400-0900 local standard time [LST; UTC + 8 hr]) and afternoon (1300-1800 LST) over the central urban district and 100-km downstream area. Comparative analysis of the meteorological conditions between the two peak periods revealed that the hourly extreme rainfall events over the PRDMR during the pre-summer rainy season were overall prefrontal rainstorms that occurred under the influence of dominant south-westerlies and weak easterly backflows of warm-moist air at lower atmospheres. The hot plumes rooted at the urban surface may be the key local environmental factors responsible for generating hourly heavy rainfall over the PRDMR. Given favourable large-scale conditions, the interaction of urban heat island effects with sea breezes and mountain-valley breezes can promote convection by altering the thermodynamic and dynamic structures around the PRDMR. By comparison, the hourly extreme rainfall events that occurred during morning periods over the PRDMR were more sensitive to moderate to strong wind shear at the lower planetary boundary layer, whereas those that occurred during afternoon periods were more likely to occur in the presence of an environment with high conditional instability.

TI  - Re-understanding of land surface albedo and related terms in satellite-based retrievals
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo is a critical variable in determining surface energy balance, and regulating climate and ecosystem processes through feedback mechanisms. Therefore, climatic modelers and radiative monitoring require accurate estimates of land surface albedo. With the instrument development, algorithm upgrade, spectral-band-adjustment in wavelength center or band width, and the increasing distinct requirement from diversified communities, various albedo terms have been generated in related satellite-based products. The lack of understanding on the divergence of these terminologies can introduce potential considerable errors in the subsequent applications, or an elevated probability to invert the deduced conclusion. We surveyed the basic concepts of reflectance quantities, retrieval strategies, and models developed since the 1970s, and discuss both strength and opportunity for improvements on land surface albedo extraction, and product generation. In addition, we exemplified the difference of albedo terms using the daily MODIS product (MCD43A) to emphasize the potential risk of the ambiguous usage, over typical IGBP land covers in Northern Kazakhstan. Our investigation shows that relative differences among various albedo terms can reach up to 181% and 50%, while 0.266 and 0.118 of absolute variance respectively in the narrow and broad-band surface albedo, which illuminated cautions against the ambiguous understanding of albedo terminologies or erroneous usage of albedo products.

TI  - Exploring the Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Winter Rape on the Middle Reaches of Yangtze River Valley Using Time-Series MODIS Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapeseed is an important oil product in China. China's current soybean trade issues with major soybean producing countries have caused a large decline in soybean import since 2017. This may bring the increasing needs of rapeseed import, which would have an impact on domestic production. However, our knowledge on the effects of international rapeseed trade on domestic production remains unknown. It is thus important to understand the pattern of rapeseed in China under this scenario, as it may provide necessary information for all relevant stakeholders. With this goal, this study aims to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of winter rape in China's major winter rape production region, the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River Valley (MYR), during 2003-2015 using time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. A decision tree according to the difference in enhanced vegetation index (EVI) profiles of land-cover types was built to extract winter rape. The results show that there is an essential decrease in both the number and density of winter rape patches under the opening global rapeseed market. There are significant hotspots of winter rape gain and loss, within which the loss dominated the trend. The significant cost advantage of rapeseed in the international market may largely reduce the domestic cultivation in China through telecoupling effects. Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of winter rape on the MYR has significant economic and policy implications and can provide great supports for the agricultural production, policy-making, and oil products trade in the international market.

TI  - Exposing the urban continuum: implications and cross-comparison from an interdisciplinary perspective
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an increasing availability of geospatial data describing patterns of human settlement and population such as various global remote-sensing based built-up land layers, fine-grained census-based population estimates, and publicly available cadastral and building footprint data. This development constitutes new integrative modeling opportunities to characterize the continuum of urban, peri-urban, and rural settlements and populations. However, little research has been done regarding the agreement between such data products in measuring human presence which is measured by different proxy variables (i.e. presence of built-up structures derived from different remote sensors, census-derived population counts, or cadastral land parcels). In this work, we quantitatively evaluate and cross-compare the ability of such data to model the urban continuum, using a unique, integrated validation database of cadastral and building footprint data, U.S. census data, and three different versions of the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) derived from remotely sensed data. We identify advantages and shortcomings of these data types across different geographic settings in the U.S., which will inform future data users on implications of data accuracy and suitability for a given application, even in data-poor regions of the world.

TI  - Case library construction method using high-resolution remote sensing land cover classification information
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Using high-resolution remote sensing images, we propose a case classification method using a land cover classification case library. Case-based reasoning is applied to several aspects of this approach: case representation, case feature selection, case weight, case structure and a similarity measurement model. A detailed study and discussion of the construction of a land cover classification case are presented. Worldview-2 satellite images with 0.5-m spatial resolution are used and the case library construction process for land cover classification information is applied; the effectiveness of the proposed method is then verified using the library. Land cover classification information is thus successfully extracted.

TI  - The past and future of global river ice
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - More than one-third of Earth's landmass is drained by rivers that seasonally freeze over. Ice transforms the hydrologic(1,2), ecologic(3,4), climatic(5) and socio-economic(6-8) functions of river corridors. Although river ice extent has been shown to be declining in many regions of the world(1), the seasonality, historical change and predicted future changes in river ice extent and duration have not yet been quantified globally. Previous studies of river ice, which suggested that declines in extent and duration could be attributed to warming temperatures(9,10), were based on data from sparse locations. Furthermore, existing projections of future ice extent are based solely on the location of the 0-degrees C isotherm11. Here, using satellite observations, we show that the global extent of river ice is declining, and we project a mean decrease in seasonal ice duration of 6.10 +/- 0.08 days per 1-degrees C increase in global mean surface air temperature. We tracked the extent of river ice using over 400,000 clear-sky Landsat images spanning 1984-2018 and observed a mean decline of 2.5 percentage points globally in the past three decades. To project future changes in river ice extent, we developed an observationally calibrated and validated model, based on temperature and season, which reduced the mean bias by 87 per cent compared with the 0-degree-Celsius isotherm approach. We applied this model to future climate projections for 2080-2100: compared with 2009-2029, the average river ice duration declines by 16.7 days under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, whereas under RCP 4.5 it declines on average by 7.3 days. Our results show that, globally, river ice is measurably declining and will continue to decline linearly with projected increases in surface air temperature towards the end of this century.

TI  - Incorporating dynamic factors for improving a GIS-based solar radiation model
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar radiation has been a major input to agricultural, hydrological, and ecological modeling. However, solar radiation is usually influenced by three groups of dynamic factors: sun-earth position, terrain, and atmospheric effects. Therefore, an integrated approach to accurately consider the impacts of those dynamic factors on solar radiation is essential to estimate solar radiation over rugged terrain. In this study, a spatial and temporal gap-filling algorithm was proposed to obtain a seamless daily MODIS albedo dataset. A 1 km-resolution digital elevation model was used to model the impact of local topography and shading by surrounding terrain on solar radiation. A sunshine-based model was adopted to simulate radiation under the influence of clouds. A GIS-based solar radiation model that incorporates albedo, shading by surrounding terrain, and variations in cloudiness was used to address the spatial variability of these factors in mountainous terrain. Compared with other independent solar radiation products, our model generated a more reliable solar radiation product over rugged terrain, with an R-2 of 0.88 and an RMSE of 2.55 MJ m(-2) day(-1). The improved solar radiation products and open source app can be used further in practice or scientific research.

TI  - A Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Urban Expansion and Pollutant Emissions in Fujian Province
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization processes at both global and regional scales are taking place at an unprecedent pace, leading to more than half of the global population living in urbanized areas. This process could exert grand challenges on the human living environment. With the proliferation of remote sensing and satellite data being used in social and environmental studies, fine spatial- and temporal-resolution measures of urban expansion and environmental quality are increasingly available. This, in turn, offers great opportunities to uncover the potential environmental impacts of fast urban expansion. This paper investigated the relationship between urban expansion and pollutant emissions in the Fujian province of China by building a Bayesian spatio-temporal autoregressive model. It drew upon recently compiled pollutant emission data with fine spatio-temporal resolution, long temporal coverage, and multiple sources of remote sensing data. Our results suggest that there was a significant relationship between urban expansion and pollution emission intensity-urban expansion significantly elevated the PM2.5 and NOx emissions intensity in Fujian province during 1995-2015. This finding was robust to different measures of urban expansion and retained after controlling for potential confounding effects. The temporal evolution of pollutant emissions, net of covariate effects, presented a fluctuation pattern rather than a consistent trend of increasing or decreasing. Spatial variability of the pollutant emissions intensity among counties was, however, decreasing steadily with time.

AB  - This research has purpose on examination of influential relationships with other religions and investigation of this phased development process.Shamanistic death rituals was affected by outlook of afterlife from China, so they have features of Gino Gui, which lead dead men to the other world. In Shamanism, the dead mens’ judges, Ten Kings are perceived as the most important gods. Ten Kings are analyzed to be introduced to Goryeo dynasty based on the worldviews of Taoism and Buddhism, and gave influences to Goryeo shamanism.China also had recognized the other world as the place with other various names which can go by shamasnistic Gino Gui before the idea of Ten kings was established. However, after the foundation of idea of Ten Kings, it was regarded that the place that the dead men could go was chosen through the judgement from Ten Kings. It seems that the view of the other world was present before the inflow of the idea of Ten Kings, and it can be inferred from ancient tombs and shamanistic mythologies. In shamanistic mythologies, the concept of the other world is interpreted to be gone through the constant steps and established to be the present form of the worldview of afterlife. Buddhism of Ten Kings was the most influential in these steps.Before the inflow of Buddhism of Ten Kings, belief system about the death developed through constant stages and became what it is today by accepting Buddhist view of the other world. This was discussed to be the change from horizontal stage to vertical stage. According to documents from Seosamuga(narrative shamanism), the possibility of the presence of the other stage before the horizontal stage was raised. It is interpreted to embody the point that shamanistic belief system means continuation of life in the other world in the ritualistic cites.To dead men, not only the journey to the other world and reincarnation, but also lives in there are accorded important meanings. The other world in shamanism means the world where Ten Kings are and believed as resuscitation and ideal world. This is different perspective from Buddhism, which considers padma garbha loka dhatu(蓮華藏世界, ideal world inside a lotus flower),a heaven as the ideal type of world. Different with that Ten Kings are believed as the gods who judge the dead mens’ sin stage by stage in Buddhism, Ten Kings are regarded as the gods who rule the spatial area of dead mens’ ideal world. It means, the worldview of Ten Kings is more expanded in shamanism.

AB  - In recent years, the phenomenon of cutting and burning of palm trees in many areas of Iraq has been observed to turn them into residential lands, causing great environmental damage. Hyper spectral image (EO1) for 2003 were used, bands were reduced to 155 bands,after making a subset of the study area in Baghdad with area about 40.88km(2) and performed the radiometric correction and atmospheric correction. Palm class was then extracted from the image and spectral angle mapper algorithm was applied with spectral angle 0.1 and 0.05 to determine palm areas.Sentinel-2 was used for years 2016 and 2018. After making subset of the same study area and doing the aerial correction and putting the mask on the palm areas extracted from hyper image 2003, permanent palm category was extracted from the images and Spectral Angle Mapper algorithm was applied at different angles to reach the permanent palm areas. The results shows changed from 19% palm area in 2003 to 7% palm area in 2018, meaning that the proportion of harvested date palm accounts for 12% of the total area.

AB  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been used for both image generation and image style translation. In this paper, we aim to apply GANs to multispectral satellite image. For the image generation, we take advantage of the progressive GAN training methodology, that is purposely modified to generate multi-band 16 bits satellite images that are similar to a Sentinel-2 level-1C product. The generated images that we obtained imitate closely the spectral signatures of the kind of terrain in the images, as it can be seen by comparing typical spectral view between synthetic and natural images.Furthermore, we consider the recent use of GAN architectures for transferring the style of the images and apply them to perform land-cover transfer of satellite images. Specifically, we used the unpaired style transfer method to modify images that are dominant in vegetation land cover into images that are dominated by bare land cover and vice versa. The land-cover transfer via GANs gives very promising results and the visual quality for the transferred images is also satisfactory, showing that the land-cover transfer is an easier task compared to the GAN generation from scratch. Especially, results are good when the target domain is bare land, in which the visual quality for the transferred images is also very good.

AB  - A study was described and analyzed using the Landsat series of images to detect flood waters in Al shuwayja marsh for the period 1972 to 2019, monitor the spatial scale and spread of flooding. The images were first classified in two ways unsupervised and supervised. Subsequently, QGIS was applied to extract the area of submerged areas from the Landsat images. These spaces were analyzed to determine the nature of the spatial scale and duration of the flood and to show how the flood spread over time. This study demonstrates that it can use satellite images with geographic information systems to effectively monitor and analyze the spread of flood waters in an area prone to flooding. Therefore, the results of this study will help to take an initiative to reduce the impact of flood risks and increase flexibility in flood management.

AB  - The fused image is one of the image processing branches that employed within this paper for satellite images to obtain one image with optimal details. Different satellite images with a different quality to the same location used in the suggest fused algorithm. This algorithm depends on statistical methods, classification method, and edge contrast method. The statistical methods are mean, standard deviation, signal to noise ratio, and statistic contrast vector. Classification step used the minimum distance method that applied to satellite images. Contrast edge methods applied after the classification step to add tine details to the fused image. The results show good quality of the fused image depending on the statistical criteria in all steps.

AB  - Clouds exert a great influence on land surface temperature (LST). It remains unclear how clouds affect the LST change in satellite images. The focus of the study is to examine the effects of cloud on LST change in Landsat 8 images over various ground surface types, cloud sizes and seasonal scales. The difference between solar and satellite geometry over the images provides the possible way to identify the impact of cloud in Landsat 8 images. The shadow of cloud represents the true effects of cloud on LST change. Using the available mono-window algorithm, we were able to retrieve the L ST of the shadow for the analysis of the cloud effects. Four typical ground surfaces were selected for the analysis: desert/bare surface, vegetation, urban and water covered area. The L ST difference between the shadow and its nearby clear-sky region represents the effects of cloud on L ST change in the corresponding ground surface. The results indicated that the, highest L ST difference was observed over dessert/barren land in the magnitude of 8.28 degrees C. Moreover, when the cloud size relatively smaller or larger the effect on LST slightly varies. The summer season has the most remarkable effect of cloud on LST change. The water surface has the lowest LST difference in overall cloud analysis. These change of LST under cloud in various conditions can be helpful for the studies which are focus on LST estimation during cloudy conditions.

AB  - On a large scale, the land cover classification has been investigated throughout the world in remote sensing for different kinds of applications such as water resources, agricultural, environmental, as well as ecological and hydrological applications. In order enhance accuracy of the classification results, Landsat and multispectral bands are used to study the numerous classification methods. Remote sensing thermal data provides valuable information in order to examine the effectiveness of applying the thermal bands to extract useful land cover thematic maps. In this research, Landsat-8 satellite data captured by Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared (TIRS) Sensors, with using remotely sensing data and Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis with using ground truth data collect from fieldwork in same time of imagery capturing by using infrared thermometer camera. In 2018, single date Landsat-8 image of the study area in Iraq was captured in winter. This image is used to estimate Land Surface Temperature (LST) by split window algorithm and performing Land Cover (LC) classification after image noise removal by using supervised classification algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM) with multi-spectral and thermal bands combinations to find out which one has more accuracy. Result shows the effective and efficiency of the proposed method compared by traditional classification methods. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient are 94.25%, 64.43% and 0.93, 0.63, respectively.

M3  - Article
AB  - The water demand in Egypt has risen due to limited surface water and varied uses. Geological and hydrological data, radar, optical remote sensing data, and Geographic Information System techniques delineate groundwater availability zones in the study area. Thematic layers (lithology, topography, slope, stream networks, lineaments, and rainfall) were integrated into the ArcGIS 10.4 using a linear weighted combination technique. The final groundwater prospective zones (GWPZ) map revealed six zones, very low, low, moderate, high, very high, and excellent, covering areas of 7.49%, 14.93%, 3.74%, 28.88%, 37.30%, and 7.62%, respectively. The GWPZ map was tested and compared to the abstraction rates, locations of existing wells, and thickness of the water-bearing formations. NDVI analysis revealed an increase in the area's vegetation from 1984 to 2017. Geochemical analyses of 43 groundwater samples revealed water-rock interactions, ion exchange, evaporation, and the influence of irrigation-return flows as prominent processes influencing ion enrichment of the groundwater.

T2  - TOXICOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the rise of mycotoxin contamination in food materials was found to be due to several factors, including climatic changes' impact. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide a novel food product that allows the reduction of aflatoxin impact in animal tissues. Chicory root-extract (CRE) was evaluated for its active components, antioxidant potency, and antimicrobial activity. The CRE was utilized to produce functional yogurt (FY) that was evaluated in-vivo using experimental rats. The CRE showed high antioxidant activity and recorded valuable content of the active components. Results also showed a high antimicrobial effect against toxigenic fungal strains. The results have reflected the efficiency of the FY to suppress aflatoxin impacts in the animal tissues and biochemical parameters of rats-serum. An enhancement was recorded inliver and kidney functions for rats taking FY with the presence of aflatoxin. It was concluded that consumption of the FY assisted in suppression of the oxidative stress in rats-tissues.

TI  - Automatic Weighted Splines Filter (AWSF): A New Algorithm for Extracting Terrain Measurements From Raw LiDAR Point Clouds
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne raw light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements are georeferenced three-dimensional coordinates of ground surface, including all natural and man-made features. Extracting terrain surface measurements from raw LiDAR data is referred to as "filtering." Many filtering algorithms have been published, indicating the difficulty of the task; however, none performs equally well on all kinds of landscapes. This article presents a new algorithm, automatic weighted splines filter (AWSF), to extract the terrain points from raw LiDAR measurements. The mathematical model of the AWSF algorithm utilizes both the cubic smoothing splines (to interpolate and fit raw LiDAR data) and z-shaped function (to estimate the weight value of each point). The AWSF algorithm performance is compared against 14 filtering algorithms published between 1998 and 2019, as well as one unpublished (proprietary) algorithm designed by the world-leading company in processing remote sensing data, Harris Geospatial Solutions. Diverse landscape scenarios are used, ranging from open fields, rural land, and urban areas to dense forests on mountains where most of the filtering algorithms struggle as these areas represent the most difficult and challenging landscapes because the canopy prevents LiDAR pulses from reaching the ground surface. A total of 19 samples were tested; the results clearly show that the filtered terrain measurements are accurate and that the performance of the AWSF algorithm is stable for all the LiDAR data samples in comparison with the other filtering approaches.

AB  - In this article, Western Saudi Arabia underwent remote sensing investigation via Operational Land Imager (OLI), Advanced Land Observing Satellite/ Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS/PALSAR), Sentinal-1 and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). Image-transformation and enhancement techniques such as Band ratios, principal component analysis (PCA), and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) were utilized. Applying Sentinel-1 and SRTM DEMs enhanced the perspective views of the terrain. The main results are highlighting of geologic rock units, geomorphic and structural features, and extraction and visualization of dominant lineaments. N-S foliations that are associated with folds N-S tight, isoclinal, and asymmetric (F1), NW-SE trending Najd system strike-slip faults and NNE-SSW, NE-SW NW-SE, and E-W Cenozoic faults are the major identified structural lineaments, which were analyzed and synthesized via rose diagrams. Visible Near Infra-Red/Short Wave Infra-Red (VNIR/SWIR) radar data are very important data set for water resources applications.

AB  - Climate change is the leading environmental problem that human being faces and urban growth exacerbates this problem due to higher population growth, private transportation demands, electricity usage, and demand for larger residential homes. Thus, estimating future growth of cities becomes more popular than before. The main objective of this study is to predict future urban growth and land use change dynamics of the city of Bursa so that it would provide a basis for better urban management. SLEUTH model was used in this study and calibrated with historical data derived from a time series of satellite images. The model was coupled with geographic information systems and remote sensing data to simulate urban growth of the city from 2011 to 2040. Two different scenarios were designed to predict the urban development from 2011 to 2040.

TI  - VNet: An End-to-End Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Road Extraction From High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most important tasks in the advanced transportation systems is road extraction. Extracting road region from high-resolution remote sensing imagery is challenging due to complicated background such as buildings, trees shadows, pedestrians and vehicles and rural road networks that have heterogeneous forms with low interclass and high intraclass differences. Recently, deep learning-based techniques have presented a notable enhancement in the image segmentation results, however, most of them still cannot preserve boundary information and obtain high-resolution road segmentation map when processing the remote sensing imagery. In the present study, we introduce a new deep learning-based convolutional network called VNet model to produce a high-resolution road segmentation map. Moreover, a new dual loss function called cross-entropy-dice-loss (CEDL) is defined that synthesize cross-entropy (CE) and dice loss (DL) and consider both local information (CE) and global information (DL) to decrease the class imbalance influence and improve the road extraction results. The proposed VNet+CEDL model is implemented on two various road datasets called Massachusetts and Ottawa datasets. The suggested VNet+CEDL approach achieved an average F1 accuracy of 90.64% for Massachusetts dataset and 92.41% for Ottawa dataset. When compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning-based frameworks like FCN, Segnet and Unet, the proposed approach could improve the results to 1.09%, 2.45% and 0.39%, for Massachusetts dataset and 7.21%, 1.86% and 2.68%, for Ottawa dataset. Also, we compared the proposed method with the state-of-the-art road extraction techniques, and the results proved that the proposed technique outperformed other deep learning-based techniques in road extraction.

TI  - SEPARATING THE TERRAIN COVER OF IRAQI MARSHES REGION USINQ NEW SATELLITE BAND COMBINATION
T2  - IRAQI JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A band combination (542) has been adopted and applied as a new method to classify the Iraqi marshes regions which they are located in the southern of Iraq using Landsat-5 TM scene. The results of proposed band combination were compared to the standard band combinations which they are selected to classify scene classes (541, 543 and 742). In addition, the results reveal that the standard band combinations are failed to discriminate between the scene classes that due to the aquatic nature of the scene, which makes the spectral response of the different classes very close, thus, they miss-classify the scene. Furthermore, the green band which was used in the proposed band combination enhanced the spectral response to discrimination between the different land cover classes. It was found that the support vector machine technique that performed to classify the scenes was revealed to be a very good classifier. The contribution of this study is obvious as the resulting outcomes can be capitalized as guidelines to separate the land cover classes in the aquatic nature to an accuracy that has been reached to 98% compared with the scene's region of interest.

AB  - The call for greener processes and eco-friendly products has been the essence of the 2030's core agenda on 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The major challenge is in bringing systems thinking and holistic worldview to the planning and strategies to develop the Economics whilst incorporating the Environment, and Socio-cultural diversity dimension as equal components. This means a total revamp of human activities such that the discussion on climate change, famine and poverty, destruction of eco-systems and habitat for wildlife, and the emerging infectious diseases, is as relevant as, if not more important than, discussing about artificial intelligence, robotics, flying and driver-less vehicles, and exploration to Mars. There is an urgent need for resource optimization, better biodiversity management and improved agro-practices for food production and distribution, affordable health care, and cleaner energy, air and water, with strict monitoring, regulation and enforcement to minimize emission, pollution and wastage. The focus of this presentation is to highlight research and development efforts towards the realization of sustainable bioenergy production, environmental remediation and conversion into biomaterials via integrated algal biorefinery and palm oil milling processes. Recent development in microalgal research with nanotechnology for biopharmaceuticals and anti-cancer products will be discussed. The image problem and the negative perception surrounding oil palm industries especially with regards to the impact on the environment, and the efforts towards a more sustainable production route will be highlighted. This hopefully could bring forth insights towards partnerships and collaboration among the industrialists, investors, economists, scientists, engineers, and social scientists to tackle the immediate and pressing problems facing the Planet and the People, whilst reaping the Profit, yesterday, today and tomorrow.

AB  - This study is concerned with the recent changes that occurred in the last three years (2017-2019) in the marshes region in southern Iraq as a result of the changes in the global climate, the study included all the water bodies in the five governorates that are located in the southern regions of Iraq (Wasit Maysan, Dhi-Qar, Qadisiyah and Basrah), which represent the marshes lands in Iraq. Scenes of the Landsat 8 satellite are used to create a mosaic to cover the five governorates within a time window with the slightest difference between the date of the scene capture, not to exceed 8 days. The results of calculating the changes in water areas were obtained using the classifier support vector machine, where high accuracy ratios were recorded in the study area classification for the three years. The study showed that the year 2019 represents a turning point in the behavior of the marshes, which were suffering from a period of drought, as the area of the marshes increased by about 140% as much as in 2018 and 60% of what they were in 2017, as well as the recovery of marshes that had ceased due to the previous drought period.

AB  - Occurrence of extreme events such as dust storms are now very frequent and fatal causing significant loss to the mankind Therefore, understanding the origin of a dust storm and its propagation has become pivotal. But its forecasting is quite challenging. However, space based remote sensing has been quite useful so far in monitoring such extreme events. With the recent addition of satellites such as INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR, which present very high spatiotemporal information, monitoring extreme events have been taken front foot in meteorology studies. In this paper, few cases of extreme dust storm events those occurred over India in pre-monsoon seasons of 2018 and 2019, which has been quite hazardous, are monitored using INSAT-3D/3DR sounders and imagers. The propagation and the impact of presence of dust are identified on different Infrared channels by analyzing the various observations present in the satellite data. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis also carried out to understand the response of satellite's remote sensing due to the influence of dust storms. Thus, this work can provide not only an insight to the impact of dust storms on meteorological parameters but also the scope and utility of such satellite meteorology in capturing signatures of extreme dust events. And therefore this study also weighs and highlights the potential of INSAT-3D/3DR in assisting the weather forecasting and now-casting programs of extreme events.

AB  - This bibliographic study analyzes the evolution of international scientific production concerning the interface between health, climate change and land use in the last decades, emphasizing the understanding of health in its broad sense, highlighting the environmental, social and climate dimensions by assessing publications indexed in the Scopus database. To achieve this objective, two methodologies were applied: (1) a descriptive-analytical systematic review of the international literature, incorporating qualitative and quantitative methods; (2) and network analysis based on the categorization of keyword dynamics using the application software VOSviewer. Applying search filters to the database resulted in 283 articles, where 162 articles represent the health and climate change interface, 86 represent the health and land use interface, 13 the land use and climate change interface, and the last 22 included all three. There has been a growing increase in the number of publications in the last decade, especially 2008, 2014 and 2018. The use of multivariate methodologies is prevalent, namely (i) ecological niche modeling; (ii) maximum entropy niche modeling; (iii) life cycle assessment; (iv) analysis of sentinel areas; (v) multiple residue analysis; (vi) remote sensing; (vii) linear regression analysis, among others, which show the existence of multiple drivers and vulnerabilities when dealing with the relation between climate change, health and land use. The biggest challenge in aggregating socioenvironmental, climatic and epidemiological variables is the availability of primary and secondary data on a municipal scale with national coverage and a time series of at least 20 years.

AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) maps represent a primary requirement for several geospatial applications around the world such as change detection, time series analysis, environment, and urban researches. Mapping LULC from remotely sensed data based on satellite image classification handle the rapid changes in extensive geographical areas. Several effective and efficient mechanisms suggested for supervised satellite image classification. The neural networks machine learning algorithm became a major method in supervised satellite image classification. The objective of this article is to employ neural networks as a machine learning algorithm for LULC mapping. The study applied in Ankara area, which is the capital city of Turkey. This work utilized a free Landsat 8 satellite image with the Operational Land Imager OLI sensor to implement the analysis. The image was obtained and processed in ArcGIS software. Then, the machine learning data set developed using Python scripting language. Every band out of 8 bands from Landsat 8 image considered as an explanatory variable, while the output variable defined based on visual interpretation. The training dataset built based on the signature file and random sample points. The training dataset divided into three sections, for training, for validation and the last section for testing. The training and testing processes were implemented using Google-Tensor Flow Keres library from Anaconda distribution. Feedforward neural network structure implemented with 500 neurons in the hidden layer. Confusion matrix used as accuracy assessment metrics to measure the performance of the developed model. The overall accuracy of the developed model was 92%. In terms of overall accuracy and robustness, the neural networks algorithm was effectively implemented and the LULC map produces. The model gained high accuracy that it is satisfied with the geospatial accuracy target. The consequence showed the competence of neural networks algorithm to generating LULC maps from Landsat 8 satellite images.

TI  - On a yearly basis prediction of soil water content utilizing sar data: a machine learning and feature selection approach
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil water content (SWC) performs an important role in many areas including agriculture, drought cases, usage of water resources, hydrology, crop diseases and aerology. However, the measurement of the SWC over large terrains with standard computational techniques is very hard. In order to overcome this situation, remote sensing tools are preferred, which can produce much more successful results in less time than standard calculation techniques. Among all remote sensing tools, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has a significant impact on determining SWC over large terrains. The main objective of this study is to predict SWC on a yearly basis over the vegetation-covered terrains with the aid of different machine learning techniques and SAR based Radarsat-2 data, which obtained in 2015 and 2016 years.The proposed system consists of several stages, respectively. In the feature extraction stage, the backscatter coefficients of different polarizations and the parameters obtained from different models of decomposition (Freeman-Durden and H/A/alpha) were combined and nine polarimetric features were formed for each sample point. In the next stage, support vector regression (SVR), generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were employed for the prediction of SWC. In the last stage, a machine learning based feature selection was implemented to the obtained feature vectors for determining optimal feature sets. Finally, a feature set with 6 parameters was determined as most optimal feature set over the SWC prediction and a slightly better performance was observed thanks to this feature set compared to the other results.

TI  - Soil Moisture Inversion Via Semiempirical and Machine Learning Methods With Full-Polarization Radarsat-2 and Polarimetric Target Decomposition Data: A Comparative Study
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, surface soil moisture was retrieved from Radarsat-2 and polarimetric target decomposition data by using semiempirical models and machine learning methods. The semiempirical models and machine learning techniques employed were Oh (1992), Dubois (1995), Oh (2004) and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Least Squares - Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Kernel based Extreme Learning Machine (KELM), Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), respectively. In addition, Yamaguchi, van Zyl, Freeman-Durden, H/A/alpha and Cloude polarimetric target decomposition methods were used in this study. For soil moisture inversion, firstly, preprocessing was applied to the Radarsat-2 image of two different dates with bare and moderately vegetated soil. Then, sigma nought coefficients and the polarimetric decomposition components were extracted as feature vector from preprocessed SAR image pixels corresponding to ground measured points. Lastly, sigma nought coefficients were used in semiempirical inversion models, and sigma nought coefficients and polarimetric decomposition components were used as input to machine learning methods. The best accuracy results for semiempirical models were 13.01 vol. % and 17.91 vol. % Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for bare and moderately vegetated soil, respectively. The best accuracy for machine learning techniques were 4.04 vol. % and 2.72 vol. % RMSE for two dates, respectively. The results indicated that the machine learning techniques performed much better than the semiempirical models.

AB  - This study aims to predict the impact of land-use change in Ussu sub-catchment area during the last ten years on the rate of soil erosion and sedimentation yield in the Malili River. The USLE method was used to predict soil erosion rates in 2009 and 2015 using DEM data, Landsat 8 Image, station rainfall data, and land use. Sediment yield was determined using flow rates calculated using the spline cubic interpolation method, the SDR of the water sample was verified by the equations developed by SCS, Vanoni, Boyce and Auswald based on the suitability of the measured surrounding sub-watershed. The results show that soil erosion rates have increased in the period of 6 years. The erosion rate increased from 58,693 tons in 2009 to 155,136 tons in 2015. SDR value was obtained at 0.1894, so the potential sedimentation in the Malili River was predicted to a maximum of 1.57 cm in 2009 and 4.15 cm in 2015. Contributions of soil erosion on sedimentation have occurred as the impact of the increased deforested land around 654.8 ha.

AB  - Soil erosion affects about half of the global land area resulting in annual average soil losses of eight to about 50 t/ha. Soil loss leads to challenges in agricultural production, threatens soil health, and ecosystem services, especially in mountainous regions. Ecosystem managers, therefore, must carry out an appropriate evaluation of the amount of soil lost by water erosion for sustainable soil management. Therefore, this study generated a small-scale soil erosion model with site-specific data obtained from field observations, Sentinel-2 multispectral images, 30 meters SRTM, and rainfall data using RUSLE with advanced GIS and remote sensing techniques. The results showed an average yearly soil erosion of 13 t/ha year, with a low to extremely high erosion covering about 21% of the park. Areas with low vegetation protective cover of less than 40% experienced a high level of erosion, and areas with high topographic factors experienced a very low amount of soil loss. Validation was done using an error matrix between observed field soil erosion and predicted soil erosion resulting in an accuracy of 80%.

TI  - A Data-Driven Model-Based Regression Applied to Panchromatic Sharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image fusion is growing interest in recent years, thanks to the huge amount of data acquired everyday by sensors on board of satellite platforms. The enhancement of the spatial resolution of a multispectral (MS) image through the use of a panchromatic (PAN) image, usually called pansharpening, is getting more and more relevant. In this work, we focus on the problem of the estimation of the injection coefficients that rule the enhancement of the spatial resolution of the MS image by properly adding the PAN details. In particular, a statistical analysis of the residuals coming from the linear multivariate regression between details extracted from the PAN image and the MS image is performed. A novel hybrid model is introduced for accurately describing the statistical distribution of these residuals, together with a procedure for efficiently estimating both the parameters of the residual distribution and the injection coefficients. The improvements achieved by the proposed approach are assessed using two very high resolution datasets acquired by the WorldView-3 and Worldview-4 satellites. The benefits of the proposed approach are particularly clear when vegetated areas are involved in the fusion process.

AB  - Kelantan state is located in the north-eastern of Peninsular Malaysia, with 5.8 million hectares is covered by forested areas. Gross primary production (GPP) is the amount of carbon captured by plants and it is an important biophysical parameter in the spatio-temporal dynamics of CO2. GPP estimates derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are converted to the forest area and compared. GPP is estimated through a light use efficiency model (LUE) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) as a proxy of greenness to address spatial and temporal variation in terrestrial photosynthetic activities. This study is important because the output will be used as a reference to estimate the approximate total carbon in Kelantan. Estimation GPP of Kelantan state is also useful for natural resource and land management, regional carbon cycle analysis, ecosystem status assessment, and environmental change monitoring. The objective of this study is to estimate Gross Primary Production (GPP) value of forested area in Kelantan using MODIS data. MODIS data was preprocessed, classified and analysed to get the estimated GPP of study site. The results show that average GPP value of Kelantan was estimated within the range of 0 to 646 gC/m2/month. In average, GPP in Kelantan was at 428.63 gC/m2/month. Gua Musang recorded the highest GPP value, while the lowest GPP value detected were in Kota Bharu, Tumpat and Bachok where lot of development are found at the area. The estimation of GPP in Kelantan using MODIS data is a timely significant method. However, the requirement of more study that uses MODIS data in different terrestrial types and vegetation is needed for future study.

AB  - The high global numbers of road accidents due to bad roads and the failure of other engineering structures have necessitated this study, particularly as road transport accounts for a higher percentage of cargo movement in African countries. The geophysical investigation was carried out on six failed and two stable sections along the Ibadan-Iwo-Osogbo highway to examine the geological factors responsible for highway failure in the area. A Landsat ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) imagery of the study area and its environs was acquired and processed for lineaments analyses. Magnetic, Very Low Frequency Electromagnetic (VLF-EM) and electrical resistivity methods involving Schlumberger Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) and 2-D imaging using a dipole-dipole array were utilized. Lineaments were identified across failed localities. Lateral magnetic variations in the near-surface geological materials characterized the study area. The 2-D VLF-EM models generated showed conductive zones corresponding to fractured zones of conductive clay materials within the basement rocks. Subgrade soils below the highway pavement along the failed sections are typical of incompetent clayey and sandy clay/clayey sand formations with resistivity values between 20-475 Omega.m. In comparison, the subgrade soil beneath the stable sections has moderate to high resistivity values of 196-616 Omega.m. 2-D resistivity structures across the failed segments identified low resistivity water-absorbing clay and lithological contacts. Water absorbing, clay enriched subgrade soils and the identified near-surface linear conductive features are the major geologic factors, and poor drainage network resulted in the highway failure. Remote sensing and geophysical investigations of the geological sequence and structures underlying the highway should be carried out before construction to effectively complement the routine geotechnical studies to ensure the sustainability of road infrastructure.

AB  - The main efforts of modern geoecology facus on various aspects of monitoring the state of the natural environment within the sphere of anthropogenic impacts on raw materials complexes and on determining the irreversible level of adverse impacts and consequences of natural disasters in the absence of effective tools and systems for early forecasting and detection of hazards and environmental risks (erasion, oil spills, oil and gas leaks and contamination of surface and groundwater, landslides, collapses, subsidence, mining, fire, among others). As a result, even with the highest methodological and technical level of modern research, there remains trivial conclusion on the need to protect nature. This leaves open the main question of effective methods of nature protection and the necessary changes in technologies and methods of data management.The improvement of the methodological basis for the design of mining systems to achieve integrated development of subsoil is aimed at advancing the innovative energy and resource-saving geotechnologies, which ensure the required efficiency and safety of work, including early detection of potential hazards and risks. In this study, an integrated approach to the processing of remotely sensed data is being developed, which is envisaged to share the results of the measurements obtained in Russia and Kenya by various satellite-based technologies in both optical and radar bands.

TI  - A GIS-based analysis for sanitary landfill sites in Abuja, Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The absence of sanitary landfill in Abuja, Nigeria has been a challenge that needs the full attention of the authorities. The improper disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW) on open land is a burden to the government due to the health implications and the socioeconomic issues associated with it. In order to mitigate environmental degradation, health risk concern and public vexation, the study aims at identifying suitable sites for MSW disposal in Abuja Municipal Area Council and Bwari area council of Abuja which meets global specification and standards. The integration of Geospatial data: Landsat-7ETM+, NigeriaSat-X, ASTER-GDEM, base map, soil and geology maps and multi-criteria evaluation, was used to evaluate the relative importance of each criterion in the study. Each map layers were formed by using the spatial analysis potential of the ArcGIS10.1 software and final suitability map was created using the weighted overlay analysis. The results of the analysis identified six potential sites for sanitary landfill; however four out of the six sites were considered due to the land area size of the sites and its non-intersection with the Abuja land use plan. Also, results showed that none of the existing MSW disposal sites met the global standards considered. In view of the ecological and environmental challenges regarding MSW disposal sites in Abuja, this study shows that GIS is an effective tool in MSW management, which will assist decision makers to plan appropriately toward achieving an aesthetic, healthy and sustainable environment.

TI  - Mapping forest structural heterogeneity of tropical montane forest remnants from airborne laser scanning and Landsat time series
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical montane forests are important reservoirs of carbon and biodiversity and have a central role in the hydrological cycle. They are, however, very fragmented and degraded, leaving isolated remnants across the landscape. These montane forest remnants have considerable differences in forest structure, depending on factors such as tree species composition and degree of forest degradation. Our objectives were (1) to analyse the reliability of airborne laser scanning (ALS) in modelling forest structural heterogeneity, as described by the Gini coefficient (GC) of tree size inequality; (2) to determine whether models are improved by including tree species-sensitive spectral-temporal metrics from the Landsat time series (LTS); and (3) to evaluate differences between three forest remnants and different forest types using the resulting maps of predicted GC. The study area was situated in Taita Hills, Kenya, where indigenous montane forests have been partly replaced by single-species plantations. The data included field measurements from 85 sample plots and two ALS data sets with different pulse densities (9.6 and 3.1 pulses m(-2)). GC was modeled using beta regression. We found that GC was predicted more accurately by the ALS data set with a higher point density (a cross-validated relative root mean squared error (rRMSE(CV)) 13.9%) compared to ALS data set with lower point density (rRMSE(CV) 15.1%). Furthermore, important synergies exist between ALS and LTS metrics. When combining ALS and LTS metrics, rRMSE(CV) was improved to 12.5% and 13.0%, respectively. Therefore, if the LTS metrics are included in models, ALS data with lower pulse density are sufficient to yield similar accuracy to more expensive, higher pulse density data acquired from the lower altitude. In Ngangao and Yale, forest canopy has multiple layers of variable tree sizes, whereas elfin forests in Vuria are of more equal tree size, and the GC value ranges of the indigenous forests are 0.42-0.71, 0.20-0.74, and 0.17-0.76, respectively. The single-species plantations of cypress and pine showed lower values of GC than indigenous forests located in the same remnants in Yale, whereas Eucalyptus plantations showed GC values more similar to the indigenous forests. These results show the usefulness of GC maps for identifying and separating forest types as well as for assessing their distinctive ecologies.

AB  - In spite of the high relevance of the satellite data for collecting information regarding precipitation at global scale, validating satellite retrievals with measurements collected by sensors at ground is still a challenging task. To date, the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) aboard the Core Satellite of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission is the only one able to provide, at global scale, vertical profiles of rainfall rate, radar reflectivity, and Drop Size Distribution (DSD) parameters. In this study, we compare near surface GPM retrievals with almost 6 years of DSD parameters estimated by a laser disdrometer in Rome (Italy) since the launch of GPM mission. The comparison shows limited difference in performances of the different GPM algorithms, also with reference to the dual frequency algorithm with respect to the single frequency one. Furthermore, the agreement between satellite and ground based data depends on the considered precipitation variable as well as on the spatial and temporal scale matching constrains.

TI  - Forest and Land Fires Are Mainly Associated with Deforestation in Riau Province, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has experienced extensive land-cover change and frequent vegetation and land fires in the past few decades. We combined a new land-cover dataset with satellite data on the timing and location of fires to make the first detailed assessment of the association of fire with specific land-cover transitions in Riau, Sumatra. During 1990 to 2017, secondary peat swamp forest declined in area from 40,000 to 10,000 km(2) and plantations (including oil palm) increased from around 10,000 to 40,000 km(2). The dominant land use transitions were secondary peat swamp forest converting directly to plantation, or first to shrub and then to plantation. During 2001-2017, we find that the frequency of fire is greatest in regions that change land-cover, with the greatest frequency in regions that transition from secondary peat swamp forest to shrub or plantation (0.15 km(-2) yr(-1)). Areas that did not change land cover exhibit lower fire frequency, with shrub (0.06 km(-2) yr(-1)) exhibiting a frequency of fire >60 times the frequency of fire in primary forest. Our analysis demonstrates that in Riau, fire is closely connected to land-cover change, and that the majority of fire is associated with the transition of secondary forest to shrub and plantation. Reducing the frequency of fire in Riau will require enhanced protection of secondary forests and restoration of shrub to natural forest.

TI  - RUSSIAN POETIC PICTURE OF THE WORLD: LINGUISTIC APPROACH
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the concepts of "poetic consciousness" and "national poetic picture of the world", as well as the issues of structuring of the Russian poetic picture of the world through the spectacles of linguistics and its study in terms of diachrony and in comparison with the poetic pictures of the world of other cultures. The article formulates the tasks to be performed while studying stable and variable aspects of the Russian poetic picture of the world and proposes solutions. The aim of this article is to clarify the concepts of "poetic consciousness" and "national poetic picture of the world", to outline the ways and to suggest the methods to study the Russian poetic picture of the world in its linguistic representation. The object of research is the verbal reflection of the Russian poetic picture of the world. As the theoretical foundation, the article uses materials of Slavic mythology, folklore, Russian poetry of the 18th - 20th centuries, mass songs, online poetry of the 21st century, as well as the author's previous research and recent master's degree theses written and defended under the supervision of the author of the article. The study uses the descriptive and comparative methods coupled with contextual semantico-stylistic analysis of the word usage and quantitative estimation of the lexical units under study and the units from their close environment. The research results include the suggested structure of the Russian poetic picture of the world with its stable and variable aspects and with elite, folk, mass and online variations. The article substantiates the necessity of comparative study of national poetic pictures of the world; it names such differences of poetic pictures of the world of various cultures as differences of the life of the people, poetry language traditions and different visions of the same phenomena; furthermore, the articles sets tasks for further studies (to identify universal and variable aspects of the Russian poetic picture of the world of different periods and to compare them with other aspects of our culture and poetic pictures of other cultures) and proposes the ways and methods to solve these problems. The research results can be used to study language of poetry in general and in terms of poetic lexicography.

T2  - Hellenic Plant Protection Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - A prototype for pest development stages forecasting is developed in Kazakhstan exploiting data from the geoinformation technologies and using codling moth as a model pest in apples. The basic methodology involved operational thermal map retrieving based on MODIS land surface temperature products and weather stations data, their recalculation into accumulated degree days maps and then into maps of the phases of the codling moth population dynamics. The validation of the predicted dates of the development stages according to the in-situ data gathered in the apple orchards showed a good predictivity of the forecast maps. Predictivity of the prototype can be improved by using daily satellite sensor datasets and their calibration with data received from a network of weather stations installed in the orchards.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of free and open access radar satellite datasets, like those of Sentinel-1, has provided new opportunities for monitoring archaeological sites and monuments in a systematic way, and especially after earthquake events. While optical sensors are established in the scientific literature and radar sensors are lately introduced in the relevant literature, the role of satellite-driven ready products is still limited discussed. With the continuous improvement of remote sensing satellite data quality and accuracy, high-resolution data needs to be processed, while at the same time, this required high computational complexity. In respect to this, over the last years, various efforts have been made to support high-performance cloud-based processing, providing to the end-users ready products in a short time. This study presents the results from the exploitation of a relevant new cloud platform, namely the Hybrid Pluggable Processing Pipeline (HyP3) system that integrates GAMMA software, for detecting ground displacement within archaeological sites in Cyprus, after a 5.6 magnitude scale earthquake in 2015. Ascending and descending pairs of Sentinel-1 images, acquired before and after the event, were processed through the HyP3 platform, revealing small relative ground displacements in the area under study. The processing chain was performed in less than 1 h -per pair- on the HyP3 system, indicating that similar approaches could be beneficial in the future to support cultural heritage management of large areas.

TI  - Optimal Spatial Resolution for the Detection and Discrimination of Archaeological Proxies in Areas with Spectral Heterogeneity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Subsurface targets can be detected from space-borne sensors via archaeological proxies, known in the literature as cropmarks. A topic that has been limited in its investigation in the past is the identification of the optimal spatial resolution of satellite sensors, which can better support image extraction of archaeological proxies, especially in areas with spectral heterogeneity. In this study, we investigated the optimal spatial resolution (OSR) for two different cases studies. OSR refers to the pixel size in which the local variance, of a given area of interest (e.g., archaeological proxy), is minimized, without losing key details necessary for adequate interpretation of the cropmarks. The first case study comprises of a simulated spectral dataset that aims to model a shallow buried archaeological target cultivated on top with barley crops, while the second case study considers an existing site in Cyprus, namely the archaeological site of "Nea Paphos". The overall methodology adopted in the study is composed of five steps: firstly, we defined the area of interest (Step 1), then we selected the local mean-variance value as the optimization criterion of the OSR (Step 2), while in the next step (Step 3), we spatially aggregated (upscale) the initial spectral datasets for both case studies. In our investigation, the spectral range was limited to the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum. Based on these findings, we determined the OSR (Step 4), and finally, we verified the results (Step 5). The OSR was estimated for each spectral band, namely the blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands, while the study was expanded to also include vegetation indices, such as the Simple Ratio (SR), the Atmospheric Resistance Vegetation Index (ARVI), and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The outcomes indicated that the OSR could minimize the local spectral variance, thus minimizing the spectral noise, and, consequently, better support image processing for the extraction of archaeological proxies in areas with high spectral heterogeneity.

TI  - Decreasing hospital length of stay and enhancing recovery in Total Knee Arthroplasty.
T2  - Journal of clinical orthopaedics and trauma
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) typically have early postoperative pain and decreased mobility, especially so in the first 24 h. Achieving a pain free knee in the immediate postoperative period and reducing complications using multimodal pain and blood management protocols forms a keystone in early mobilization and functional recovery. Enhanced Recovery after Surgery pathways (ERASp) since their inception, have significantly improved perioperative care and functional outcomes, thereby reducing the average length of stay (ALOS), complications and overall healthcare costs. ERASp modified suitably for TKA have had encouraging results. We have retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of the ERASp for TKA at our tertiary care centre with equal emphasis on pre-hospital preparations, in-hospital care, and post-hospital discharge.METHODS: All TKA patients operated by the senior author between July 2016 and January 2018 with a minimum one year follow up were included. The outcomes measured were: Visual Analogue Score (VAS) for pain at rest and on movement, milestones, transfusion requirements, postoperative complications, ALOS and functional scores at one year follow-up.RESULTS: 775 patients (392 unilateral TKA {UTKA} and 383 bilateral {BTKA}) met our inclusion criteria. Both groups were comparable demographically. Mean VAS pain scores at rest were 3.15 ± 2.15 on the day of surgery, 2.5 ± 1.86 on the first postoperative day and 2.08 ± 1.81 on the second day, and 6.2 ± 2.38, 5.77 ± 2.34 and 4.71 ± 2.48 on movement respectively in the UTKA group. In the BTKA group, the mean VAS pain scores at rest were 4.39 ± 2.25 on the day of surgery, 3.98 ± 2.36 on the first postoperative day and 3.05 ± 2.12 on the second day and 6.21 ± 2.38, 5.77 ± 2.34 and 4.71 ± 2.48 on movement respectively. 85.49% of UTKA and 77.22% of BTKA patients walked on the day of surgery. Decrease in haemoglobin and transfusion rates were 1.25 ± 0.41 g% and 0.5%, 1.85 ± 0.62 and 3.9% in the UTKA and BTKA groups respectively.The average length of hospital stay (LOS) was 3.98 days. LOS was 3.17 and 4.78 days with 1.55% and 6.05% major complications in the UTKA and BTKA groups respectively.There was a significant improvement in Oxford Knee and WOMAC scores at 3, 6 and 12 months in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Pain following TKA is a major deterrent in early mobilization thereby delaying functional recovery and increasing ALOS. We recommend our multimodal interdisciplinary protocol to achieve early mobilization, better pain scores and minimize complications, resulting in overall reduced LOS.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article shows one of possible applications of the results of lineament analysis in the solution of environmental management tasks. The proposed methodology can be successfully applied to assess the mineralogical potential of the study areas regardless of the type of mineral deposit. Results can be used while planning investments by the industry of advanced materials and mining companies at the next stages of exploration. The authors have conducted a pre-processing and complex interpretation of remote sensing data in order to study the shape of individual faults and the spatial orientation of the whole network of dislocations. The final structural scheme was built in the results. The authors chose a fixed rectangular polygon within the Mongolo-Okhotsk fold belt (MOFB) as a reference area. By implementing algorithms of automated and visual methods of lineament analysis, it has been established that two groups of long-distance faults develop in the sub-latitudinal direction. Significant feature is the determination of a group of low-ranking lineaments that extend discordantly to the structure of MOFB. Identification of the form and spatial location of mapped lineament groups made it possible to identify potential areas for further detailed studies of the faults network and the spatial relationship of dislocations with mineral deposits.

AB  - In this study we investigate the potential for using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to provide high resolution defoliation and regrowth mapping of trees in the tundra-forest ecotone. Using aerial photographs, four areas with live forest and four areas with dead trees were identified. Quad-polarimetric SAR data from RADARSAT-2 was collected from the same area, and the complex multilook polarimetric covariance matrix was calculated using a novel extension of guided nonlocal means speckle filtering. The nonlocal approach allows us to preserve the high spatial resolution of single-look complex data, which is essential for accurate mapping of the sparsely scattered trees in the study area. Using a standard random forest classification algorithm, our filtering results in over 99.7% classification accuracy, higher than traditional speckle filtering methods, and on par with the classification accuracy based on optical data.

AB  - Dealing with multi-look polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (Po1SAR) images requires averaging several independent looks to generate a sample covariance matrix of similar target scattering vectors. Along this, estimation of optimal similarity between target scattering vectors is still an open issue. In the literature, this intrinsic task has been mainly addressed in the information-based, geometric-based and detection-based frameworks. However, the derived measures mainly rely on the model assumption such as fully developed speckle and circular complex Gaussian distribution of the scattering vectors, which may not be held in high-resolution images of urban environments. To cope with this possible issue a discriminative model-free measure is proposed, where the similarity of target scattering is computed in the framework of non-local or patch based algorithm. In particular, the discriminative measure is constructed using the ratio between two pre-estimated covariance matrices of the scattering vectors. Experimental validation of the proposed measure is provided using ALOS-PALSAR image and compared with existing criterions in the literature.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography has shown great potential in multi-dimensional monitoring of urban infrastructures and detection of their possible slow deformations. Along this line, undeniable improvements in SAR tomography (TomoSAR) detection framework of multiple permanent scatterers (PSs) have been observed by the use of a multi-looking operation that is the necessity for datas covariance matrix estimation. This paper attempts to further analyze the impact of a robust multi-looking operation in TomoSAR PS detection framework and assess the challenging issues that exist in the estimation of the covariance matrix of large stack data obtained from long interferometric time series acquisition. The analyses evaluate the performance of non-local covariance matrix estimation approaches in PS detection framework using the super-resolution multi-looked Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT). Experimental results of multi-looking impact assessment are provided using two datasets acquired by COSMO-SkyMED (CSK) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) over Tehran, Iran, and Toulouse, France, respectively. The results highlight that non-local estimation of the sample covariance matrix allows revealing the presence of the scatterers, that may not be detectable using the conventional local-based framework Copyright: info:eu-repo/semantics/restrictedAccess License: http://dans.knaw.nl/en/about/organisation-and-policy/legal-information/DANSLicence.pdf

AB  - Karst is one of the typical of landscape which is formed by soluble rock and mineral formation such as limestones, dolomites, gypsum, anhydrites and others types that have the same chacateristic. Based on Permen ESDM 17/2012, Karst Landform Area has two main function; conservation and development area. Mangkalihat Karst has some critical issues both on conservation and sustainable utilisation of its resources. We aim to delineate karst landform and other limestones formation in the area. Using DEMNAS-based combined with the multispectral imagery from Landsat OLI 8, we were able to delineate the karst area according to visual interpretation on karst morphology. Mangkalihat Karst presents as half-circular morphology consists of Tendehantu Hills in the west and Mangkalihat Hills in the east. The stratification of limestones formation has been clearly visible on image structured parallel strike with the arc. The slope is very steep (more than 45%) and it is densely vegetated areas. To the north, karst morphology formed undulated karst hills as slope average ranging from very steep to moderate. Scattered conical hills were identified as a result of surface karstification. However, drainage pattern had not clearly formed in karst landscape, they were formed subsurface. Tendehantu Formation (Tmt) is the main rock formation in the Mangkalihat Karst. Field investigation indicated that Tendehantu Formation (Tmt) is composed by coral limestones, white to light yellowish in color, well bedded and depsited during Middle Miocene in shallow marine (neritic zone). Caves and subsurface rivers had been identified in the area as a manifestation of endogenic and exogenic karst. The result can be approched for resource sustainability in Mangkalihat Karst Area.

AB  - The foremost issues of 21st century are challenging demand of electrical energy and to control the emission of Green House Gases (GHG). In the regard of zero carbon emission, fossil fuel independency, efficiency and reliability improvement of conventional grid, renewable energy resources based sustainable microgrid emerges as only feasible solution for future energy demand. In this paper optimization and implementation of institutional based sustainable microgrid discussed on the basis of cost analysis, carbon emission, and availability of energy resources. Various microgrid topologies are considered for addressing the most ideal solution. A sustainable microgrid proposed with PV panel (150kW), Wind turbine system (100kW), and Storage system (250kWh) in grid connected mode to sell back excess energy. Cost of energy ( COE), Net Present Cost (NPC), operating cost (OC0 reduces from INR 6.0, 28.1 M, 2.17 M to 2.85, 20.5 M, 0.44 M, while 80% emission reduces. The metrological data such as irradiance is acquired from solar satellite data of NASA while the data for wind speed is taken from synergy enviro engineer's site. HOMER (R) simulation tool is used for modelling and optimization purpose.

AB  - For clean hydropower generation while sustaining ecosystems, minimizing harmful impacts and balancing multiple water needs is an integral component. One particularly harmful effect not managed explicitly by hydropower operations is thermal destabilization of downstream waters. To demonstrate that the thermal destabilization by hydropower dams can be managed while maximizing energy production, we modelled thermal change in downstream waters as a function of decision variables for hydropower operation (reservoir level, powered/spillway release, storage), forecast reservoir inflow and air temperature for a dam site with in situ thermal measurements. For data-limited regions, remote sensing-based temperature estimation algorithm was established using thermal infrared band of Landsat ETM+ over multiple dams. The model for water temperature change was used to impose additional constraints of tolerable downstream cooling or warming (1-6°C of change) on multi-objective optimization to maximize hydropower. A reservoir release policy adaptive to thermally optimum levels for aquatic species was derived. The novel concept was implemented for Detroit dam in Oregon (USA). Resulting benefits to hydropower generation strongly correlated with allowable flexibility in temperature constraints. Wet years were able to satisfy stringent temperature constraints and produce substantial hydropower benefits, while dry years, in contrast, were challenging to adhere to the upstream thermal regime.

AB  - Deep learning classifiers, particularly, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been demonstrated to be very effective in the area of SAR automatic target recognition (ATR). Despite of this achievement, there is still a problem with proper classification of target objects from their speckled SAR imagery. In this paper, we address this technical challenge by implementing a two-step Hybrid Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoder (HSDAE) as an effective holistic denoiser and classifier model. Since there is no publically available comprehensive real or synthetic SAR dataset of aerial vehicles, we primarily employed the IRIS Electromagnetic modeling and simulation system to generate the required synthetic noisy SAR images from an array of test physics- based CAD models placed in different operating environments. Our generated test dataset contains synthetically generated SAR images of more than 300 aerial and ground vehicles. These images are systematically scanned from various azimuth and elevation angles as well as from different ranges and in different operating environments. They are regarded as the ground truth object radiation backscattering reflectivity map of test objects. Furthermore, these images are modulated with appropriate additive multiplicative noise to form speckled SAR images. Using a partial collection of ground-truth test vehicles images along with their corresponding speckled SAR images, we train a two-step concurrent denoising auto encoder followed by a CNN model to classify vehicles. Through the initial step, a denoising operation in performed and the test objects' features like shape, size, and orientation attributes are recovered from any given input speckled SAR images. The output image from this denoising process is next passed as input to a CNN classifier for performing object recognition and classification. In this paper, we presented the architecture of HSDAE and its variants and compare their performances. Our results indicate the proposed HSDAE meets higher accuracy and repeatability for recognizing and classifying the target objects under different operating conditions.

T2  - ENGAGING SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Breakdown, trespass, seepage, degradation: this is late industrialism. Over the past decade, the term has become synonymous with collapse, describing everything from crumbling infrastructure to outmoded paradigms. But the "late" in "late industrial" carries radical potential, too. It points toward the possibility of another world taking shape within the wreckage as people retrofit broken systems, build flexible coalitions, and work creatively with time. In this collection, we train our eyes on these refashionings, asking how late industrial systems might be put to life-affirming work. Specifically, we track cases where breath, air, and atmosphere help inaugurate a "phase shift" (Choy and Zee 2015) from breakdown toward worlds otherwise. Breath has sentinel qualities: it can warn of trouble in the air. But it is also an animating force. Taking conceptual cues from this duality, contributors attend to late industrialism as it is sensed and transformed into something vital.

TI  - SAR and Optical Image Fusion for Urban Infrastructure Detection and Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS V
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications in Urban Environments V held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Optical sensors, are one of the main sources of Earth observation in the present age. Both the data types have their inherent advantages and disadvantages. Spaceborne Optical sensor are restricted by clouds but can offer strong information content in ideal conditions. On the other hand, SAR sensors rely on their own energy and can see through clouds. SAR is potentially an all-weather day/night imager. But SAR sensors have limitations in terms of data collection geometry and algorithmic approximations. Both sensors offer complimentary information for exploitation in data fusion for enhanced results. This research is focused on capitalizing the fusion potential for spaceborne High resolution SAR and Optical data in urban settings. The fusion of high reflection of SAR energy from urban areas and optical features of such areas can be combined to enhance the urban infrastructure detection and monitoring in a SAR/Optical fused scenario. SAR/Optical fusion can take place at three levels 1) pixel level, 2) feature level; and 3) information level. Pixel level fusion is often considered most difficult for high resolution data as precise registration up to subpixel level is required and even slight misregistration results in unfavorable circumstances. Simon Fraser University (SFU) Burnaby Mountain Campus has been chosen for area of interest because of its ongoing student housing and university infrastructure developmental projects. TerraSAR-X High Resolution Spotlight (TSX-HS) Single Look Complex (SLC) images of 1.0 m resolution have continuously being acquired over SFU; along with high resolution Optical (RGB) and Infrared (IR) images (3.0 m resolution each) from "The Planet" acquisitions. Limited high-resolution images from "Google Earth" (GE) in the coinciding period of TSX-HS acquisitions were also acquired for the study. Six fusion techniques have been studied for urban infrastructure detection and have been categorized based on their performance. Precision change maps will be created based on time series analysis for SAR/optical fused data in conjunction with Interferometric SAR (InSAR) analysis to study the long-term effect of urban infrastructure developments over a period of two years.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim To determine the validity of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in case of complete pathological response of axillary lymph node. Patients and methods This is a prospective study that included female patients with cancer breast who became clinically and radiologically node negative (cN0) after receiving NAC during the period of March 2016 to October 2018 in Alexandria Medical Research Institute, Alexandria, Egypt. Dual technique was used to identify the SLN followed by standard axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Analysis of the pathological reports was used to determine the false-negative rate (FNR) of SLN. Results Of the 86 patients who completed the NAC and showed cN0, SLN could be identified in 76 (88.4%) patients. ALND was completed for the 76 patients, and SLNs showed false-negative results in nine (11.8%) patients. Patients in whom three or more (10.3%) SLNs could be identified showed better FNR compared with patients with two SLNs or less (16.7%). Conclusions SLN biopsy after NAC for patients with cN0 seems to be a reliable technique to replace ALND if certain precautions are applied. The use of a dual technique for SLN identification and determination of at least three SLNs to be the minimum number accepted is an essential requirement to be applied in this selective approach to ensure FNR within accepted range. In addition, patients should be counseled regarding benefits of the SLN biopsy technique and the possibility of failure to identify the SLN or being false negative.

T2  - The Korean Journal of Philosophy of Education
T2  - 교육철학연구
M3  - research-article
AB  - This study aims to examine the worldview upon which Toegye’s education theory is based. Toegye systematically organizes his educational theories in his magnum opus, Seonghaksipdo (聖學十圖; The Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning). In his educational theories mainly presented in “Sohakdo” (小學圖; Diagram of the Elementry Learning) and “Daehakdo” (大學圖; Diagram of the Great Learning), he proposes “Taegeukdo” (太極圖; Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate) and “Seomyeongdo” (西銘圖; Diagram of the Western Inscription) as the worldview his educational theories are originated from and grounded upon. Therefore, interpreting “Taegeukdo” and “Seomyeongdo” in the context of Toegye's educational theories can lead us to see how his worldview is related to education theory. Toegye presents a worldview centered on li (理; principle) through “Taegeukdo” and “Seomyeongdo”. His worldview differs from the existing Confucian worldview in that it gives activeness to the metaphysical thing, li. In his worldview, humans have possibilities of education in that they can recognize this li. Toegye's li-centered worldview integrates the natural order and the social order, thereby making the realization of li as humans nature that of an ideal society. In a society that exists organically through li, everyday life is a field in which li is active. Also, education is a process of realization and expansion of li through individuals and it is a means of realizing an ideal society in which li is fully realized. Toegye's worldview suggests that even when his educational theory is interpreted with a focus on individual discipline, the organic relationship with the whole society should always be premised as the basis of his theory.

AB  - Purpose: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in breast cancer patients has the advantage of decreasing related morbidities by reducing the extent of axillary surgery. However, it remains a controversy with regards to the appropriate extent of axillary lymph node dissection after NACT. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the accuracy of breast ultrasonography (US) and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the axillary nodal status after NACT. Methods: We reviewed pre- and post-NACT axillary imaging and clinicopathological data of patients who received NACT for primary breast cancer and underwent surgery. After NACT, accuracy of imaging modalities were evaluated through the comparison of pathologic lymph node (LN) status and imaging LN status. Results: Fifty seven patients completed NACT and underwent surgery. Breast US was found to have a sensitivity of 61.1%, specificity of 57.7%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 68.2%, and positive predictive value (PPV) of 50.0%. For breast MRI, sensitivity was 58.3%, specificity 75.8%, NPV 71.4%, and PPV 63.6%. For US combined with MRI, sensitivity was 66.7%, specificity 54.5%, NPV 69.2%, and PPV 51.6%. The accuracy of imaging modalities was 59.1% for US, 68.4% for MRI, and 59.6% for US combined with MRI. Conclusion: In breast cancer patients who received NACT, MRI showed a higher specificity, NPV, and PPV than US, although it had a lower sensitivity. However, due to the low accuracy, breast MRI alone is not sufficient to determine the extent of axillary surgery. Therefore, determining the extent of axillary surgery based on the results of intraoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy may be the right method for accurate staging.

AB  - “A Buddhist Hand in a Christian Glove”(外基內佛) means that something seems to be Christian on the outside, but in fact, truly is Buddhism.Religious pluralism, both inside and outside Christianity, raises questions about the traditional and orthodox Christian identity. Even within Christianity, there are attempts to reinterpret the traditional doctrines of Christianity through the worldview of other religions. The purpose of this paper is to examine the attempts to reinterpret Christianity in a Buddhist way of thinking. Those who reinterpret Christianity in terms of Buddhism urge to learn from each other through dialogue with other religions, and even promote syncretism. It seems that Buddhist reinterpretation attempts to turnChristianity into an ordinary religion that focuses on ‘teaching’ rather than ‘atonement’ by removing the orthodox and traditional identities inherent in Christianity.The Gospel is the “Good News” that focuses on the Cross and Resurrection events that God acted for human salvation. The Gospel is intrinsically distinct from other religions that focus on ‘teaching’ and ‘lessons’, or ‘knowledge’. Traditionally, the orthodox Christianity focuses on the salvation of forgiveness by the atonement of Jesus Christ. The Buddhist reinterpretation removes guilt and the concept of original sin, emphasizes ‘teaching’ instead of the atonement of Jesus Christ, and emphasizes enlightenment instead of repentance. It emphasizes the true self and proposes a mystic unity based on pantheistic monism. In this way, the religion of the ‘event’ becomes the religion of the ‘knowledge’, and the religion of revelation becomes the religion of enlightenment.

AB  - In Daesoon Thought, Matteo Ricci is regarded highly as a Jongjang, ‘religious leader,’ (of Christianity). This paper deals with the life and philosophical/theological thought of Matteo Ricci as homo-religiosus from the perspective of phenomenology of religion. Examining his historical background and biographical sketch, I will analyze Ricci’s understanding of God, humanity, and salvation and re-evaluate his relationship with Daesoon Thought.Matteo Ricci, born in Italy, became a Jesuit missionary to China and transmitted various products of western civilization. Accepting the pro-cultural approach of Jesuit mission, he applied it to Chinese culture and language by learning the Chinese language and regarding Chinese people as his friends. This was a sympathetic way to transmit Western religion and culture while on Chinese soil. He suggested eight reasons to look towards the future of China with optimism and taught Chinese people his Christian message through his indirect means of understanding and persuasion.In China, Jesuit missionaries called the Christian God ‘Tianzhu (Cheonju in Sino-Korean),’ meaning Lord of Heaven. Ricci identified the Confucian notion of ‘Shangdi (Sangje in Sino-Korean),’ meaning Supreme Emperor (or God) with Tianzhu. While translating Confucian scriptures, he found the common ground between Confucianism and Christianity to be the monotheism of ancient Confucianism. He criticized the concepts of God in Buddhism and Daoism, and justified the Christian doctrine of God by way of a Confucian understanding of deity. Ricci’s understanding of humanity was based on his Christian faith in creation, and he criticized the Buddhist concept of transmigration. He proposed Christian ethics and doctrine of salvation by using discourse on the afterlife and in particular, the concepts of heaven and hell.Concerning the relationship between Daesoon Thought and Ricci, the following aspects should be examined: 1.) Ricci’s contribution to the cultural exchanges between East and West, 2.) his peaceful approach to his mission based on dialogue and persuasion, 3.) the various activities conducted by Ricci as a Christian leader, and 4.) his belief in miraculous healings. His influence on Korea will likewise be explored. Ricci’s ultimate aim was to communicate with Asian people and unify East and West under a singular worldview by emphasizing the similarities between the Christian and Confucian concepts of God.

AB  - This paper deals with the consciousness of chosen people and multiculturalism in the dimensions of belief, ritual, and community of Bahai Faith. The 19th festival of Bahai faith is open to anybody and Bahai films play an important role of transmitting Bahai universal values to the world. The objection to clergy system helps Bahais to freely interpret their scriptures and to develop internal virtues of individual behaviors. In Bahai ritual, there are no particular formal rituals like other world religions. As the foundations of multiculturalism, internal virtues and peaceful missions have been emphasized. After Iranian revolution, the systematic persecution and oppression against Bahai community led Bahais to respond in two different ways: obedience and escape.In the interview with Korean Bahais, we find the consciousness of chosen people in a wide sense, not in a narrow one. The doctrine of progressive revelation, which is based on the relativity and evolution of truth, explains the coexistence and differences of existing world religions. Bahai worldview that a new religion appears every 800 years presupposes the repeated God’s dramatic love for humanity and spiritual development of humanity. Bahai international gatherings embrace various cultures and Bahais marry internationally, which are good examples of Bahai multicuturalism.

AB  - This paper deals with the characteristics and limitations of religious education in Christian University, analyzing the change of structure and operation in the case of Pai Chai University. In the 21st century, the paradigm of religious education shifted from the education of particular religion to the education of general religion and religions. Among the methods of understanding religious traditions, situation is more important than faith and text.In mutlcultural education, there are Christian education, education of general religion, education of particular religion, education of religions, and education of Christian values. The religious education of Pai Chai University consists of chapel attendance and general education. Chapel attendance is the education of religion, and general education is the education about religion. <Christian spirit and Appenzeller personality> seeks for the educaion of Christian values.The general education of religion in Christian university examines the viable attitudes to neighboring religions. The religious education of Pai Chai University constructs pluralistic pluralism beyond the stages of exclusivism and inclusivism, emphasizing differences rather than common ground. This approach is close to Lindbeck's cultural-linguistic model. The changes of textbooks published in 1998, 2003, and 2014 influenced the aims and contents of education: from conversion and mission to Christian ethics, Christian social welfare and life spirituality.In conclusion, based on the case of Pai Chai University, phenomenological suggestions for the viable general education about religion in Christian University are given: (1) empathetic understanding towards homo religiosus and religious worldview, (2) multicultural approaches to religion, and (3) the extension to spirituality beyond religion.

AB  - Hans Rookmaaker was a Dutch art historian and professor of art history at Free University in Amsterdam. He was influenced by Dutch neo-Calvinism spanning to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Dutch neo-Calvinism, it is imporant to clarify underlying assumption about philosophy and Abraham Kuyper's Christian worldview. At the end of century, the formalist view of art were generally prevalent led by Heinrich Wolfflin (1864-1945) and Alois Riegl(1858-1905). However, Rockmaarker's prophetic genius created a principle of art using the Netherlands Christian Aesthetics framework of creation, fall and redemption, focusing on the influence of historical and spiritual worldviews. And it is distinguished by the fact that the fruits of aesthetics and art theory are well integrated with theology and philosophy.In summary, Rookmaaker interpreted art in a universal or Christian worldview to capture permanent principles and values, regardless of cultural ideology or cultural change. Thus, art became an area from which a rational universe (or universal principle) could be derived. After 1870, the Western world experienced a dynamic boom in material prosperity. But Rookmaaker’s dream and vision for man is for art to be a spiriturally prosperous being. Thus, principle of art he discovered centers on the aesthetic theory of redemption and recovery, there are many traces of putting a lot of effort and care into the fundamental issue of 20th-century art, “Truthfulness as a aesthetic Consciousness,”

AB  - As a key payload on the Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) polarorbit meteorological satellite, the medium resolution spectral imager (MERSI) is installed to provide the global coverage of top-of-atmosphere radiances. In order to ensure the on-orbit radiometric data quality of the MERSI, the modified calibration equation for the thermal infrared channel can be obtained by the blackbody (BB) and deep space view (SV). Different calibration algorithms are investigated to obtain the time series of the calibration coefficients a(0), a(1) and a(2), and the accuracy of the radiometric calibration is evaluated by comparing the BB irradiance calculated by those calibration coefficients and the standard BB irradiance, whose irradiance differences are within the order of 10(-4) W/m(2)/ mu m/sr. Moreover, the differences of the BB inversed and equivalent temperatures by different algorithms show a similar behavior, whose values changing from 0.26 K to 0.28 K. These works provide important information for tracking the instrument performance along with the quantitative remote sensing application.

TI  - Understanding the cardiac toxicity of the anthropogenic pollutant phenanthrene on the freshwater indicator species, the brown trout (<i>Salmo trutta</i>): From whole heart to cardiomyocytes
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater systems are faced with a myriad of stressors including geomorphological alterations, nutrient overloading and pollution. Previous studies in marine fish showed polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to be cardiotoxic. However, the cardiotoxicity of anthropogenic pollutants in freshwater fishes is unclear and has not been examined across multiple levels of cardiac organization. Here we investigated the effect of phenanthrene (Phe), a pervasive anthropogenic pollutant on a sentinel freshwater species, the brown trout (Salmo trutta). We first examined the electrical activity of the whole heart and found prolongation (similar to 8.6%) of the QT interval (time between ventricular depolarization and repolarization) of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and prolongation (similar to 13.2%) of the monophasic action potential duration (MAPD) following ascending doses of Phe. At the tissue level, Phe significantly reduced trabecular force generation by similar to 24% at concentration 15 mu M and above, suggesting Phe reduces cellular calcium cycling. This finding was supported by florescent microscopy showing a reduction (similar to 39%) in the intracellular calcium transient amplitude following Phe exposure in isolated brown trout ventricular myocytes. Single-cell electrophysiology was used to reveal the mechanism underlying contractile and electrical dysfunction following Phe exposure. A Phe-dependent reduction (similar to 38%) in the L-type Ca2+ current accounts, at least in part, for the lowered Ca2+ transient and force production. Prolongation of the MAPD and QT interval was explained by a reduction (similar to 70%) in the repolarising delayed rectifier K+ current following Phe exposure. Taken together, our study shows a direct impact of Phe across multiple levels of cardiac organization in a key freshwater salmonid. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - BULLETIN OF THE MINERAL RESEARCH AND EXPLORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The abundance of the NE-SW direction veins mineralized in barite, copper, lead and zinc in the Tadaout-Tizi n'Rsas (TTR) anticline make this area one of the principal vein fields in Tafilalet (easternmost border of the Eastern Anti-Atlas). Reactivation of faults and alternation of competent (thicks Ordovician series, Silurian limestone and Devonian limestone) and incompetent levels (Silurian shales and Devonian marls) have an important role in the deformation of the TTR anticline during the NE-SW Variscan shortening. Our work based on lineaments extraction using a Landsat 8 OLI combined with some geological cross sections, shows a N130 degrees major fold corresponding to TTR anticline. This big fold shows internal N130 degrees, N95 degrees and N20 degrees minor folds. This structure indicates that the TTR area was formed in the hinge between the Anti-Atlas and the Ougarta belts. A number of these folds are the consequence of the underlying Precambrian faults reactivation and alternation of competent and incompetent levels. Brittle tectonics is dominated by NE-SW normal faults which result from the NE-SW shortening consequence of the Gondwana and Eurasia continents collision. Consequently, the mineralization of TTR is necessarily related to late or post-Variscan orogeny.

AB  - Segara Anakan, Cilacap District is an area that embodies the largest mangrove forest in Indonesia, namely 8,576.06 ha in 2016. The observation and mapping of vegetation index surrounding the forest are done by utilizing remote sensing to acquire satellite images. Plants have adequate reflectance to Near Infrared (NIR) lights. Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) is classified to have high accuracy in mapping mangrove in an area. The concept of NDVI is considerably simple, namely by observing the best NIR light reflected by the chlorophyll and red light radiation absorbed by green plants. Algorithm or equation used is (NIR - RED)/(NIR + RED). The results from the algorithm will then be used to derive index value ranging from -1 to 1. This index value will be employed as a parameter to indicate whether the mangroves are healthy or not. This study is done in 2020 incorporating data from 2017 to 2020 that are relevant to Segara Anakan, Cilacap District and implementing NDVI method to analyze the mangroves' health. Results from the satellite images show that mangroves in Segara Anakan are experiencing a negative trend regarding their health from year to year. The result in 2017 shows a majority of 0.9 index with pixel vegetation frequency of 17,500 which drastically declined in 2020 to only 7,000 with majorities of 0,2;0,6;0,8 which is caused by deforestation and natural causes inhibiting the sowing and growth of mangroves.

AB  - With the availability of global satellite remote sensing observations of surface soil moisture, it is now possible to quantify important hydrological fluxes such as evapotranspiration (ET) and drainage. Furthermore, given the current level of accuracy of remotely sensed soil moisture, these fluxes can be estimated without the need for large-scale land surface or climate modeling. In this work, remote sensing data from the NASA SMAP mission, at 36 [km] scale, and gauge-based precipitation data over the US are utilized within an adjoint-state variation estimation method to obtain time-series daily estimates of ET and drainage. The approach uses only SMAP measurements and precipitation. Neither a hydrology or land surface model nor ancillary hydrologic data are used. ET estimates are compared to eddy covariance measurements from the AmeriFlux network and are shown to capture up to 70% of the in-situ measurements' annual variance. Similarly, Drainage estimates are compared to USGS streamflow measurements. On average Drainage under-estimates streamflow by 1-2 [mm day(-1)] with seasonal correlation (R-2) varying between 0.52-0.77. These estimates close the surface water budget with only SMAP measurements and precipitation information.

TI  - OPERATION AND PUBLISHING: DISCOURSE OF THE 1974 CYPRUS PEACE OPERATION IN THE RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS NEWSPAPER
T2  - BILIMNAME
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Turkish modernization experience, the press and media played an important role and had a founding identity. Different segments of the world of thought conveyed their ideas to the public through newspapers and magazines, and concepts such as homeland, nation and nationality were introduced to the public in these modern terms. The Presidency of Religious Affairs, which was established to organize religious affairs after the proclamation of the Republic, started to publish the Diyanet Gazetesi (Religious Affairs Newspaper) in 1968. The Diyanet Gazetesi, which strives to support the general culture of the people as well as religious issues, has taken a stance that supports the policy of the state regarding the policies put forward by the state. One of the important examples of this stance can be seen in the publishing activities of the newspaper during the 1974 Cyprus Peace Operation. Because even though various treaties and systems have been tried on the Cyprus which is an important island for Turkey, there has been always a failure to maintain order and peace, Greece supported to perform military coup to the island's legitimate government, Turkey has made an operation in accordance with the right of guarantee arising from international treaties on 20 July 1974.In line with its mission to support the state, Diyanet Gazetesi included the Cyprus Peace Operation before, during and after the action and put forward a parallel discourse with the state. As a result, the Presidency of Religious Affairs has realized the understanding that religion and politics are brothers in the Turkish thought tradition and that the state is responsible for protecting and exalting religion while the religion supports it through Diyanet Gazetesi. In this study, it was aimed to examine the problem of how Diyanet Gazetesi developed discourse in the face of international issues around the Cyprus Peace Operation process and accordingly, the articles on Cyprus in the newspaper were analyzed by discourse analysis method. The conclusion was that Diyanet Gazetesi followed a publishing policy that supported state policy during the Cyprus Peace Operation.In Turkish thought, the way of thinking about the relations of religion and politics is shaped on the fact that these elements are brothers. In this way of thinking, religion supports politics and politics protects religion. Although these elements may look different in shape, religion and politics have been regarded as the same in terms of their basic purposes. This has been the case in the Republican era as well as in the Seljuk and Ottoman thought traditions. The Presidency of Religious Affairs, which was founded after the establishment of the Republic, supported the state around the aforementioned traditional way of thinking, and the state protected it and enabled it to continue its activities. Although the principle of secularism was added to the principles of the state, no changes were made to the Presidency of Religious Affairs, and this structure continued its existence as it was. Since its establishment, the Religious Affairs Department has undertaken the duty of conducting religious affairs, as well as the duty of educating, enlightening and raising public awareness.In the Turkish modernization experience, the press and publication have played a very important role, while these elements have a supporting nature in different modernization practices, they have been a founding character in Turkish modernization. Different segments of the world of thought conveyed their ideas to the public through newspapers and magazines, and concepts such as homeland, nation and nationality were introduced to the public in these modern terms. Westernism, Islamism and nationalism movements were conveyed to the public by producing ideas about how contemporary politics and modernization should be made through newspapers and magazines and the members of these movements came together to form their own communities. During the Republican period, these press and publication activities maintained their importance and function, and the worldview of the newly established state was conveyed to the public through these elements.The idea of Islamism, which could be described as a continuation of the Turkish modernization experience within the framework of the search for solutions to the problem of modernization in the Ottoman period, had to pull back to the underground after the establishment of the Republic. Since the 1960s, a new idea of Islamism has emerged which based on translated sources instead of local sources in Turkey. The advocates of this new Islamic thought, which produced ideas around the translations of books such as Seyyid Kutup, Hasan el-Benna, Eb'ul Ala Mevdudi, Ali Seriati, Ayetullah Humeyni, who are among the Islamists of Egypt, Indian subcontinent and Iran, aimed to disseminate these ideas with the magazines they published; they have tried to put forward a new understanding by criticizing the traditional understanding of religion. The Presidency of Religious Affairs started to publish Diyanet Gazetesi (Religious Affairs Newspaper) against these developments in order to defend Turkish traditional Islam understanding. Diyanet Gazetesi, which is basically a religious newspaper, has also undertaken responsibility to inform the public on many issues such as agriculture, animal husbandry, health and history and has published articles written by the people who carry out studies in these fields. From this point of view, it is possible to say that Diyanet Gazetesi has a quality that affects every area that concerns the society.Cyprus, which is an important island for the dominance and security of the Mediterranean in every period of history, passed to the British from the Ottomans in 1878 and since then, structural problems have emerged on the island. England ruled the island which was the property of the Ottoman Empire until 1914, and when World War I started, England announced that it annexed the island. After that, the Greeks and Turks on the island started to fight for the sovereignty of the island, the Greeks established armed terrorist organizations around Enosis, which was the idea that Cyprus should be a part of Greece and attacked the Turks on the island. Because even though various treaties and systems have been tried on the island, there has been always a failure to maintain order and peace, Greece supported to perform military coup to the island's legitimate government, Turkey has made an operation in accordance with the right of guarantee arising from international treaties on 20 July 1974. In line with its mission to support the state, the Religious Affairs newspaper included the Cyprus Peace Operation before, during and after the action and put forward a parallel discourse with the state. Prior to the operation, Religious Affairs had allocated space for all the armed forces of land, air, sea and gendarmerie elements and expressed their importance and advised them to be supported through certain foundations established to provide financial support to these institutions and carried this to the Friday Khutba sections in the magazine. In this period, in addition to the newspaper, Military Special Issue supplements were also published and presented to the reader. When the operation started, in addition to the publication calendar of the Diyanet Gazetesi, a Special Issue of Cyprus Peace Operation was published and this number was fully devoted to the said operation. In the other issues published during the operation, the Cyprus Peace Operation was frequently found a place for itself, the spiritual, financial helps and prayers of the personnel of the Presidency of Religious Affairs were included in the magazine and this way the public was encouraged to provide financial aid for the armed forces. After the end of the operation, although the articles on this subject were suspended for a while, Cyprus came to the agenda once again after the announcement of the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus. In this period, all the works aimed at making out the Turkish presence on the island in line with Islam again; in this perspective all the developments from the mosques that were reconstructed in Cyprus to the activities and observations of the religious personnel sent to Cyprus by the Presidency of Religious Affairs during the operation period and also telling the history of the Cyprus from the first conquest of the island by Muslims were found a place for themselves in the magazine.As a result, the Presidency of Religious Affairs has realized the understanding that religion and politics are brothers in the Turkish thought tradition and that the state is responsible for protecting and exalting religion while the religion supports it through Diyanet Gazetesi. The publications published by the newspaper before, during and after the operation of the Cyprus Peace Operation in 1974 clearly show that this way of thinking is still dominant in the understanding of politics.

Satellite data are most suitable for solving the problems of quantitative and qualitative assessment of propagation of atmospheric pollutants. The contamination of the atmosphere over large territories which depends on the natural and anthropogenic sources of emission of trace gases can be determined from space. The statistical analysis of ground-based data on the atmospheric concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) over the most polluted big industrial cities is performed. The CO content in the atmosphere over Kazakhstan is analyzed using MOPITT satellite IR radiometer data for the period of 2007-2017. The seasonal and long-term variability of the total CO is revealed. The CO maximum falls on March-April, the minimum is registered in July to October. The average CO content in the atmosphere over Kazakhstan has decreased by 4.7% in the recent decade.

Radiocarbon uncalibrated dates for these sites fall within 18 and 16000 BP. Figurines differ in form, but they are united by technological methods of manufacturing and the style / schematic of the zoomorphic image. Their archaeological context is similar. The items were left by the ancient people deliberately while leaving the site. We believe their similar semantics and purpose of zoomorphic figurines associated with specific hunting rituals. Particular attention is paid to the image of a horse / horse, which, according to one hypothesis, is important in the worldview of the ancient inhabitants of these sites.

TI  - DEVERBATIVES IN RUSSIAN DIALECTS SPOKEN ON THE TERRITORY OF MORDOVIA
T2  - VESTNIK VOLGOGRADSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-YAZYKOZNANIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with deverbatives (names of actions) represented in Russian dialects spoken on the territory of the Republic of Mordovia. The research aim is to describe semantic peculiarities and uniqueness of the word formation and morphemic structure of the nouns belonging to this class. Deverbatives are considered as syncretic unities that are built by merging the grammatical features of both a verb and a noun, typical of the Russian language. The deverbative origin results in preserving the semantics of an abstract action; according to their semantic structure, they can be divided into two main groups: the actions performed by human beings and the ones without their participation. The latter are animals' and birds' motions, natural phenomena, stages in a process or time intervals. It is noted that some language units are subjected to specialization of lexical meaning, processual semantics loss sand are used to nominate an object, place or time of action. Deverbatives have been characterized as demonstrating underdeveloped system of paradigmatic relations. They are derived of national and dialectal verbal stems in full accordance with the general Russian word formation rules and models, including the most productive morphological pattern with its suffixal and zero affixation variants, and the least productive ones, as prefixation-suffixation and complex suffixation. Since deverbatives are closely connected with intellectual human activity, worldview and reality awareness, they constitute unique fragments of dialectal mentality.

TI  - Narrowband-to-Broadband Conversions for Top-of-Atmosphere Reflectance from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current lack of a long, 30+ year, global climate data record of reflected shortwave top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation could be tackled by relying on existing narrowband records from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments, and transform these measurements into broadband quantities like provided by the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES). This paper presents the methodology of an AVHRR-to-CERES narrowband-to-broadband conversion for shortwave TOA reflectance, including the ready-to-use results in the form of scene-type dependent regression coefficients, allowing a calculation of CERES-like shortwave broadband reflectance from AVHRR channels 1 and 2. The coefficients are obtained using empirical relations in a large data set of collocated, coangular and simultaneous AVHRR-CERES observations, requiring specific orbital conditions for the AVHRR- and CERES-carrying satellites, from which our data analysis uses all available data for an unprecedented observation matching between both instruments. The multivariate linear regressions were found to be robust and well-fitting, as demonstrated by the regression statistics on the calibration subset (80% of data): adjusted R2 higher than 0.9 and relative RMS residual mostly below 3%, which is a significant improvement compared to previous regressions. Regression models are validated by applying them on a validation subset (20% of data), indicating a good performance overall, roughly similar to the calibration subset, and a negligible mean bias. A second validation approach uses an expanded data set with global coverage, allowing regional analyses. In the error analysis, instantaneous accuracy is quantified at regional scale between 1.8 Wm-2 and 2.3 Wm-2 (resp. clear-sky and overcast conditions) at 1 standard deviation (RMS bias). On daily and monthly time scales, these errors correspond to 0.7 and 0.9 Wm-2, which is compliant with the GCOS requirement of 1 Wm(-2).

M3  - Review
AB  - Gynecologic cancers, including cervical, primary peritoneal, ovarian, uterine/endometrial, vaginal and vulvar cancers and gestational trophoblastic disease, are characterized by abnormal cell proliferation in female reproductive cells. Due to the variable pathology of these cancers and the lack of appropriate screening tests in developing countries, cancer diagnosis can be reported in advanced stages in most women and this situation adversely affects prognosis and clinical outcomes of illness. For this reason, many researchers in the field of gynecological oncology have carried out many studies.The treatment of various gynecological problems, which cause physical, biological and psychosocial conditions such as fear, shame, blame and anger, has been important throughout the history. Treatment with herbs has become popular nowadays due to the serious side effects of the synthetic drugs used in treatment and the medical and economical problems caused by them. Many scientists have identified various active drug substances through in vivo and in vitro biological activity studies on medicinal plants from the past to the present. While the intrinsic complexity of natural product-based drug discoveries requires highly integrated interdisciplinary approaches, scientific and technological advances and research trends clearly show that natural products will be among the most important new drug sources in the future.In this review, an overview of the studies conducted for the discovery of multitargeted drug molecules in the rational treatment of gynecological cancers is presented.

M3  - Article
AB  - The shortened revisit times and accurate orbits of the new generation of radar satellites like Sentinel-1 improved the applicability of the synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technique to investigate more moderate size events. Here the technique is used to characterize the 27 May 2017 Mw 5.2 Saruhanli (Manisa) earthquake that took place in western Turkey in the Gediz Graben. Though seismological focal mechanism solutions of the earthquake clearly indicated that the event is due to normal faulting, the nodal plane ambiguity and the presence of two closely located faults in the epicentral region prevented the assessment of the causative fault. Data from the Sentinel-1 radar satellites and subsequent modeling indicate that a 9-kin-long, NE-dipping fault had ruptured during the earthquake with the shallow rupture coinciding with the Ozanca Fault in the region.

TI  - Soil Moisture Monitoring of the Plant Root Zone by Using Phenology as Context in Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the phenological behavior and energy balance of plants are used as a sensory mechanism for root-zone soil moisture monitoring using both in-situ and satellite remote sensing data. The commonly used in-situ measurements are not feasible for mapping soil moisture at large-scale agricultural areas. Local direct root-zone soil moisture measurements cannot be reliably interpolated owing to the high spatial variability of soil structure and the vegetative content. Remote sensing methods are negatively affected by vegetation coverage and density regarding penetration and backscattering characteristics. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a root-zone soil moisture estimation method utilizing a context-aware data clustering process, which can be applied prior to any statistical analysis, for empirical evaluation of data. In this aspect, the crops' phenological stages and soil-air temperature differences are defined as the two contexts for data clustering. Parameters such as canopy-air temperature difference, land surface temperature, and solar radiation with respect to plant energy and water processes are used for the analysis. The proposed model is utilized using piecewise linear regression of data obtained from 16 rainfed wheat parcels distributed across Turkey, under different climatic and topographic conditions. It is shown that the proposed context-aware data clustering process enables the nonlinear plant behavior to be analyzed linearly. The correlation value of the whole season increased from 21% to a range between 78% and 95% for different clusters. The outliers became relevant and the parameters became significant after the proposed context-aware data clustering.

AB  - Wetlands and open waters are key components of the hydrological and carbon cycles but their spatio-temporal dynamics are still not well known at global scale. Current paper presents a new methodology to retrieve water fraction at coarse scale and high temporal resolution (one week) using L-Band multi-angular and dual polarisation remote sensing data from SMOS mission. The dataset labeled G-SWAF (or Global-SWAF) is an extention of the SWAF approach which did not consider the separate contributions of the Soil, Vegetation and water fractions. The comparison to existing datasets shows more water fraction detecting in Tropical areas but better consideration of high latitudes is still needed to be included in future studies. The use of such datasets with the future data from the SWOT (NASA/CNES) mission will provide global evaluation of inland open water volumes at 10 days scale.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, land suitability evaluation (qualitative classification) has been determined for Wheat, Barley and corn in Al-Kufa central of Iraq by using remote sensing and GIS as well as soil data. Thirty five sites representing dominant variations within the study area were selected. The study area laying between 31 degrees 59'59.90"N to 32 degrees 10'04.76"N and 44 degrees 19'31.49"E to 44 degrees 34'49.28"E with total area of 27664 ha. Sites were georeferenced on landsat 8 image taken in 2015 using GPS. Soil samples were taken from each of the selected sites and analyzed in laboratory to determine some physical and chemical soil properties. The results revealed that most soils of the study soils are Haplosalids and to some extent the presence of Torrifluvents. Most soils are suffering from salt accumulation. Rating scores for soil properties were evaluated using FAO (2007) system to determine the suitability classes for each soil sites for growing wheat, barley and corn. The results indicated that soils of the study showed different suitability for wheat, Barley and corn and ranging from 57, 37% and 71%, respectively. These variations are due to the degree of tolerance for each crop and to the effect of salt accumulation and to some extent to low content of organic carbon.

AB  - Detection of land cover (LC) changes allows policymakers to recognize the complexities of environmental modification and change to achieve sustainability of economic growth. As a result, recognition of LC features has appeared as an essential research dimension and, consequently, an appropriate and reliable methodology for classifying LC is occasionally required. In this research, Landsat 8 satellite data captured by Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Scanner (TIRS) were utilized for the LC classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier algorithm. The aim of the study is to enhance classification accuracy by integrating the use of data from satellite thermal and spectral imaging. Land Surface Temperature (LST) is sensitive to the soil surface characteristics, therefore, it may be used to gather LC feature information. The classification accuracy was designed to enhance the integration of thermal information from Landsat 8's thermal band TIRS and Landsat 8 OLI's spectral data. In this study, Advanced Thermal Integrated Vegetation Index (ATLIVI) and Thermal Integrated Vegetation Index (TLIVI) established and revealed fairly strong correlations with the related surface temperature (Ts) by R2=0,7 and 0,65 respectively. The relationship between Ts and the other vegetation indices based on the empirical parameterization demonstrate that these two indices showed an improvement of almost 6% in the overall accuracy of the LC classification results compared to the Landsat 8 Standard False Colour Composite image as an input data using SVM algorithm.

AB  - Carrier Aggregation is one of the essential approaches to achieve several orders of magnitude increase in peak data rates. While carrier aggregation benefits have been extensively studied in terrestrial wireless systems, its application to satellite has not been substantially explored. Carrier aggregation can be a prominent solution to address the issue of the spatially-heterogeneous satellite data traffic demand. This paper studies introducing carrier aggregation into satellite systems from a link layer perspective. The proposed modifications at the link layer have been carefully designed to make carrier aggregation transparent to the other layers. However, deployment of carrier aggregation in satellite systems with the combination of multiple carriers that have different characteristics requires effective scheduling schemes for reliable communications. Since channel awareness is indispensable for any efficient resource allocation schemes, we have proposed a perceptive scheduling algorithm that takes into account channel properties along with the instantaneous available resources to ensure that the received data packets are delivered without perturbing the original transmission order. Simulation results are given to validate our analysis and demonstrate the design tradeoffs, and thus, our results provide useful insights to practical scheduler design.

TI  - Large-Scale Retrieval of Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter in Northern Lakes Using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the significant societal value of inland water resources, there is a need for cost-effective monitoring of water quality on large scales. We tested the suitability of the recently launched Sentinel-2A to monitor a key water quality parameter, coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), in various types of lakes in northern Sweden. Values of a(420)(CDOM) (CDOM absorption at 420 nm wavelength) were obtained by analyzing water samples from 46 lakes in five districts across Sweden within an area of approximately 800 km(2). We evaluated the relationships between a(420)(CDOM) and band ratios derived from Sentinel-2A Level-1C and Level-2A products. The band ratios B2/B3 (460 nm/560 nm) and B3/B5 (560 nm/705 nm) showed poor relationships with a(420)(CDOM) in Level-1C and 2A data both before and after the removal of outliers. However, there was a slightly stronger power relationship between the atmospherically-corrected B3/B4 ratio and a(420)(CDOM) (R-2 = 0.28, n = 46), and this relationship was further improved (R-2 = 0.65, n = 41) by removing observations affected by light haze and cirrus clouds. This study covered a wide range of lakes in different landscape settings and demonstrates the broad applicability of a(420)(CDOM) retrieval algorithms based on the B3/B4 ratio derived from Sentinel-2A.

TI  - Scientific elements for a Yemeni wetland conservation strategy: overview of the main factors explaining the diversity and characteristics of wetlands.
T2  - Bulletin de l'Institut Scientifique Section Sciences de la Terre - Rabat
M3  - Article
AB  - Day after day, the wetlands of arid regions reveal new secrets about their importance, in terms of biodiversity as well as functions and services. Yemen, a mountainous country surrounded by seas and a desert, has a flora and fauna heritage shaped by both African, Asian and Palearctic influences, and by a pronounced insularity that has enriched it with endemic forms of world interest. However, this biodiversity has still not received the attention it deserves, in terms of conservation. This lack prompted us to carry out a general diagnosis of the Yemeni wetlands, providing the essential scientific elements allowing to initiate a sustainable use strategy of these ecosystems. This diagnosis focuses first on the main factors that control the functioning of these wetlands, then on the characteristics of these, presented for each type, according to a usual classification scheme. While relating the richness already discovered in the seas and islands, this article provides arguments in favor of the originality of the estuarine and fluvial ecosystems. The creation of a geodatabase, using satellite data (digital elevation model, precipitation, thematic images) has made it possible to illustrate the high density of the river network in Yemen, which is justified by the census of some 450 estuaries, identified along a 2,500 km long coast. This base was enriched by cartographic inventories (in particular those of hydraulic dams and towns and villages), reconstructed from bibliographic and unpublished information, which also gives often non-cartographic information on the distribution of habitat types (especially marine). The striking features of these ecosystems are highlighted through arguments borrowed especially from orography, climate and human pressures. These are very old, but their recent increase is alarming, due to the rapid growth of the population and of its needs in agricultural and urban, even industrial, water and space. Urgent solutions are essential to improve and protect wetlands in Yemen, starting with research likely to lead to a complete classification and inventory of these ecosystems, but also to a better characterization of their originalities and their functioning and of the pressures they undergo.

TI  - Multi-Temporal InSAR Analysis for Monitoring Ground Deformation in Amorgos Island, Greece
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar Interferometry is a widely used method for estimating ground deformation, as it provides precision to a few millimeters to centimeters, and at the same time, a wide spatial coverage of the study area. On 9 July 1956, one of the strongest earthquakes of the 20th century in the area of the South Aegean, occurred in Amorgos, with a magnitude of Mw = 7.7. The objective of this research is to map ground deformation in Amorgos island, using InSAR techniques. We conducted a multi-temporal analysis of all available data from 2003 to 2019 by exploiting historical ENVISAT SAR imagery, as well as the dense archive of Sentinel-1 SLC imagery. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PS) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) methods were implemented. Results of both data-sets indicate a small-scale deformation on the island. A multi-track analysis was implemented on Sentinel-1 data to decompose the line of sight velocities to vertical and horizontal. The central south coast is experiencing horizontal movement, while uplift of a maximum value of 5 mm/y is observed in the southeastern coast. The combination of the good spatial coverage achievable via InSAR, with GPS measurements, is suggested an important tool for the seamless monitoring of Amorgos island towards tectonic hazard estimation.

AB  - Eutrophication is characterized by excessive plant and algal growth due to the increased of organic matter, carbon dioxide and nutrients in water body, Although eutrophication naturally occurs over centuries as lakes age, human activities have accelerated it processes and caused dramatic changes to the aquatic ecosystems including elevated algae blooms and risk for hypoxia as well as degradation in the quality of drinking water and fisheries. Monitoring eutrophic processes is therefore highly important to human health and to the aquatic environment. However, the spatial and seasonal distribution of the phenomena and its dynamic are difficult to be resolved using conventional methods as water sampling or sparse acquisition of remote sensing data. This research work proposes a methodology that takes advantage of the high temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 (S2) for monitoring eutrophic reservoir. Specifically, it uses large temporal series of S2 images and advanced temporal unmixing model to estimate the abundance of [Chia] and algae species in San Roque reservoir, Argentina, in the period August 2016 to August 2019. The spatial patterns and the temporal tendencies of these aquatic indicators, that have a direct link to Eutrophication, were analysed and evaluated using in situ data in order to assess their contribution to the local water management.

AB  - Extensive eutrophication process in water body may lead to the creation of algal blooms, reduction in oxygen supplies, death of aquatic life and danger to human health. Monitoring eutrophic processes is therefore mandatory to the aquatic environment and human health. However, the changes in the spatial and seasonal distribution of the phenomena are difficult to be resolved using sparse water sampling or acquisition of remote sensing data. Therefore, this research work proposes a methodology that takes advantage of the temporal and spectral resolution of Sentinel-2 (S2) for monitoring eutrophic reservoir. Specifically, it uses large temporal series of S2 images and advanced temporal unmixing model to study the spectral response of the turbid and productive water of San Roque reservoir, Argentina. The spatial patterns and the temporal tendencies of these aquatic indicators are analysed and evaluated in order to assess their contribution to the local water management.

TI  - 3D Iterative Spatiotemporal Filtering for Classification of Multitemporal Satellite Data Sets
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current practice in land cover/land use change analysis relies heavily on the individually classified maps of the multitemporal data set. Due to varying acquisition conditions (e.g., illumination, sensors, seasonal differences), the classification maps yielded are often inconsistent through time for robust statistical analysis. 3D geometric features have been shown to be stable for assessing differences across the temporal data set. Therefore, in this article we investigate the use of a multitemporal orthophoto and digital surface model derived from satellite data for spatiotemporal classification. Our approach consists of two major steps: generating per-class probability distribution maps using the random forest classifier with limited training samples, and making spatiotemporal inferences using an iterative 3D spatiotemporal filter operating on per-class probability maps. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can consistently improve the individual classification results by 2%-6% and thus can be an important postclassification refinement approach.

TI  - MAPPING OF WAVE-CUT PLATFORMS ON THE COAST OF ESPIRITO SANTO STATE THROUGH REMOTE SENSING
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping shore platforms along coastlines with an echosounder using traditional vessels is hampered by shallow depths and high wave agitation. The present work mapped the emerged and submerged shore platform along the coast of Espirito Santo State, Brazil, up to a water depth of 10 m using remote sensing techniques. Data were obtained from Landsat 8 satellite images, Digital Globe (Google Earth) and orthophotographs, evaluating the effectiveness of each in the proposed mapping. All three types of images used for remote mapping showed interference from environmental factors, mainly clouds and turbidity due to the suspension of fine sediments. Images derived from Google Earth had the highest resolution among the 3 types, but were less available due to lower frequency of overflight, limiting the choice of days with ideal mapping conditions. Landsat images, with lower resolution, allowed more freedom for selection of days with favorable conditions for mapping. Orthophotographs proved useful for mapping details. Remote sensing results were compared to bathymetric survey data, collected using a kayak-mounted echosounder, creating a representation of the relief in 3D with better indication of the roughness of the rocky substrate.

TI  - First-Year and Multiyear Sea Ice Incidence Angle Normalization of Dual-Polarized Sentinel-1 SAR Images in the Beaufort Sea
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic and visual sea ice classification of SAR imagery is impeded by the incidence angle dependence of backscatter intensities. Knowledge of the angular dependence of different ice types is therefore necessary to account for this effect. While consistent estimates exist for HH polarization for different ice types, they are lacking HV polarization data, especially for multiyear sea ice. Here we investigate the incidence angle dependence of smooth and rough/deformed first-year and multiyear ice of different ages for wintertime dual-polarization Sentinel-1 C-band SAR imagery in theBeaufort Sea. Assuming a linear relationship, this dependence is determined using the difference in incidence angle and backscatter intensities from ascending and descending images of the same area. At cross-polarization rough/deformed first-year sea ice shows the strongest angular dependence with -0.11 dB/1 degrees followed by multiyear sea ice with -0.07 dB/1 degrees, and old multiyear ice (older than three years) with -0.04 dB/1 degrees. The noise floor is found to have a strong impact on smooth first-year ice and estimated slopes are therefore not fully reliable. At co-polarization, we obtained slope values of -0.24, -0.20, -0.15, and -0.10 dB/1 degrees for smooth first-year, rough/deformed first-year, multiyear, and old multiyear sea ice, respectively. Furthermore, we show that imperfect noise correction of the first subswath influences the obtained slopes for multiyear sea ice. We demonstrate that incidence angle normalization should not only be applied to co-polarization but should also be considered for cross-polarization images to minimize intra ice type variation in backscatter intensity throughout the entire image swath.

AB  - the coastal areas geomorphological characteristic is greatly active, where land accretion and erosion is a continuous phenomenon with different degrees. The temporal change in coastline location is an important sign of coastal development and it can provide quantitative and descriptive information on beach dynamics. To investigate coastal variability trends, when field-based surveys are inaccessible or absent, historical remote sensing data and GIS analysis can be effective techniques. This study focuses on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) coastline that stretches for more than 1,000 km to cover the entire coastal area of the country. Multi-temporal Landsat satellite images cover more than 45 years had been used to assess the coastal land dynamics by first delineate land areas from existing water bodies accurately using GIS and remote sensing approaches. Then, quantify coastline variability by measuring erosion and accretion rates, using the statistical operations within Digital Shoreline Analysis Software (DSAS) that include, Net Shoreline Movement(NSM), Linear Regression Rate (LRR), and End Point Rate (EPR). Finally, compare and analyse these rates with the associate causes for a better understanding of the coast area dynamic nature. The study results can be a feasible management tool to help coastal planners and policymakers to consider the identified coastal dynamic trends before starting any urban development.

AB  - Over the last decade, Dubai emirate witnessed a vast, rapidly growing population, that doubled since 2008. Nowadays, Dubai considers as the most populated emirate within the United Arab Emirates (UAE). With such an increasing population and new urban developments, sustainable urban planning procedures play an essential role in Dubai's environmental quality such as air quality, and pollution. Therefore, this study will utilize the Remote Sensing and Geographic Information system (GIS) to investigate Dubai's environmental quality by addressing and locating green areas and pollution percentages within each district. The study methodology is divided into three steps. First, Landsat Satellite medium spatial resolution and multi- spectral imagery will be used as an input for segmentation and object-based analysis. Considering the spectral and spatial signatures for green areas machine learning techniques will be adopted to select the most significant features to classify and extract green areas. Second, using environmental relational indices, green areas percentages will be quantitatively compared to Sentinel air quality data, such as NO2 and SO2, as well as the population density maps. Finally, GIS techniques will be used to create Dubai Environmental Critical Map (DECM), to locate districts with limited green areas and high pollution to improve environmental standards. The study results can be used as a measure for the municipality policymakers to ensure sustainable urban development for a healthy living.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on-board the Aqua and Terra spacecraft have provided valuable science data for the last 18 and 20 years, respectively. Each instrument is equipped with 36 spectral bands, 20 of which are reflective solar bands (RSBs). These bands cover a wavelength range of 0.4 {2.2 mu m and are calibrated on-orbit using several on-board calibrators (OBCs), such as a solar diffuser (SD) and a solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM), along with regularly-scheduled lunar observations through the space view (SV) port. The gain (1/m1) and response-verses-scan angle (RVS) are updated on a near-monthly basis and act as the primary look-up-tables (LUTs) for the RSB calibration. A set of separate uncertainty LUTs for each of the RSBs are also delivered regularly and incorporated into the Level 1B (L1B) product to generate a pixel-level Uncertainty Index (UI). In addition to the gain, RVS and uncertainty, there are several other LUTs associated with the reflective bands that are either updated less frequently or remain static. The accuracy of both the forward-predicted and historical RSB LUTs, which are derived by the MODIS Characterization Support Team (MCST), is important in maintaining the quality and accuracy of the L1B and science products. To ensure a timely and accurate LUT update, MCST has established a comprehensive set of procedures. This paper provides an overview of the calibration process, along with the current LUT delivery process for the RSBs in Collection 6 (C6) and Collection 6.1 (C6.1). Improvements to be implemented in future collections are also discussed.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on-board the Terra spacecraft has provided valuable Earth data to the science community for the last 20 years. Equipped with several on-board calibrators (OBCs), MODIS has continued to operate nominally since its launch in December 1999. The SpectroRadiometric Calibration Assembly (SRCA) is one such OBC that is able to provide on-orbit measurements of the MODIS reflective solar bands (RSBs) in radiometric, spatial and spectral modes. While the SRCA is operating in spectral mode, it is able to monitor the center wavelength (CW), bandwidth (BW) and in-band relative spectral response (RSR) of most RSBs. Prelaunch measurements of the CWs, BWs and RSRs of the RSBs were performed at the system level using the Spectral measurement Assembly (SpMA). Using both the prelaunch measurements and the measurements obtained on-orbit using the SRCA, the changes in the spectral response of the MODIS reflective bands can be monitored throughout the mission. This paper will provide a brief description of the spectral calibration approach and report on-orbit changes in these spectral performance parameters and their uncertainties over the last 20 years. It will also address changes to the SRCA operation on-orbit and their impact on measured spectral calibration results. Despite two decades in orbit, the spectral responses for most Terra MODIS reflective bands continue to remain within their design specifications.

CL  - RVS Tech Campus, Coimbatore, INDIA
AB  - A novel hybrid multiscaled Remote Sensed (RS) image classification method based on spatial-spectral feature extraction using pretrained neural network approach is proposed in this paper. The spectral and spatial features like colour, texture and edge of RS images are extracted by using nonlinear spectral unmixing which is further scaled by using bilinear interpolation. The same RS image in parallel path is first scaled using bilinear interpolation and further spectrally unmixed. These two paths are further fused together using spatial-spectral fusion to give multiscaled RS image which is further given to a pretrained network for feature extraction. For authentication and discrimination purposes, the proposed approach is evaluated via experiments with five challenging high-resolution remote sensing data sets and two famously used pretrained network (Alexnet/Caffenet). The experimental results provides classification accuracy of about 98% when classified at multiscale level compared to 83% when classified at single scale level using pretrained convolutional networks.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Early readmissions (ER) occur during the 30 days after discharge, ER are common and expensive, associated with a decrease in the quality of care. The rate of ER in polytraumatic patients (PTP) is estimated between 4.3-15%. Our objective was to identify those factors associated with ER and its characteristics after suffering mild-moderate trauma in our area.Material and method: This is a retrospective observational study, including data of patients with (PTP) mild or moderate admitted between July 2012 and June 2017 in our institution and their ER in public hospitals and/or outpatient centers. Demographic variables, diagnoses, procedures and characteristics of readmissions were collected. After a bivariant analysis was done, a Logistic regression had benn performed to determine risk factors for ER.Results: 1013 patients were included, with median age of 38 years, ISS of 3 points and initial hospital stay of 1 day. 185 patients were readmitted (18.3%). Independent factors associated with ER were: injury mechanism, especially bicycle accident (OR 2.26), comorbidities highlighting HBP (OR 1.83) and COPD (OR 1.98), fracture immobilization (OR 1.99) and hospital admission in the initial care (OR 0.56). The causes of ER were: pain 61.6%, wound infection 15.1%, scheduled cures and deferred interventions 12.97%, medical 6.4% and psychiatric decompensation. 2.7%Conclusion: The ERs in mild-moderate PTP are multifactorial, our results show an association between factors such as injury mechanism, the presence of comorbidities and the procedures performed in the sentinel episode and the rate of ER. The implementation of simple interventions at discharge could reduce its incidence clearly. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. on behalf of FECA.

AB  - Ocean depth measurement plays a fundamental role to plan and manage marine resources and safe boat navigation. Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) is presented as a complementary technique to determine coastal water depth through remote sensing tools and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The goal of this study was to determine the applicability of the SDB method in shallow waters in the Punta Luna sector in Bahia Solano, northern Colombian Pacific coast, using Landsat 8 satellite images from January 2017 and in situ bathymetric survey data from November 2016. The main result obtained in this study was a depth estimate of up to +/- 7 m with R-2 = 0.80, as well as an RMSE and an MAE equivalent to 1.49 and 2.22 m, respectively. Depth estimates obtained using SDB meet 51.17% of the Total Vertical Uncertainty (TVU) for the Special Order category, regarding the Standards for Hydrographic Surveys from the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). Results obtained will serve as a reference to calculate depth using multispectral images and a benchmark for hydrographic officials and academics interested in coastal and marine research in the region.

AB  - More than 65% of Russian and 18% of world gas reserves are concentrated on the territory of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug. A geological information system for the territory of the Purovsky district of the Yamalo-Ne nets Autonomous Okrug was constructed using satellite Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery, the https://gis.sobr.geosys.ru/information resource, and surface studies. The main unfavorable factors were revealed that adversely affected the state of the environment in the Purovsky district because of the oil production and transportation. Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images, 53 Hare units for the flaring of associated petroleum gas on a total area of 108.6 thousand km(2) were detected. Based on data of ground studies, a GIS of oil-contaminated lands has been constructed.

The convergence of natural and mathematical studies and the Humanities through the concept of dialogue of cultures is becoming one of the high school's educational priorities. It enables graduates' continuous worldview formation and their readiness to practice self-directed learning. In this context, the purpose of this research is to provide theoretical justification and rationale for the formation of an educational environment which will enable a contextual approach to intercultural dialogue.The article provides theoretical justification and clarification of the category of 'mathematical culture' and at submitting experimental proof of the need to create an educational intercultural environment.The framework of the research includes methods of theoretical analysis, generalizations, scientific literature interpretation, as well as empirical research methods such as surveys and observation (search and standardized observation) and pedagogical experiment.The paper presents a theoretical model of the levels of high school students' mathematical culture formation. The model's criteria and its measurements have been provided for. A set of didactic conditions for the development of high school students' mathematical culture based on the dialogue of cultures is identified.The practice-oriented materials presented in the article will help schoolteachers in creating an intercultural educational environment that will enable the development of high school graduates' mathematical culture.

TI  - A Sentinel-1 Based Processing Chain for Detection of Cyclonic Flood Impacts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the future, climate change will induce even more severe hurricanes. Not only should these be better understood, but there is also a necessity to improve the assessment of their impacts. Flooding is one of the most common powerful impacts of these storms. Analyzing the impacts of floods is essential in order to delineate damaged areas and study the economic cost of hurricane-related floods. This paper presents an automated processing chain for Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. This processing chain is based on the S1-Tiling algorithm and the normalized difference ratio (NDR). It is able to download and clip S1 images on Sentinel-2 tiles footprints, perform multi-temporal filtering, and threshold NDR images to produce a mask of flooded areas. Applied to two different study zones, subject to hurricanes and cyclones, this chain is reliable and simple to implement. With the rapid mapping product of EMS Copernicus (Emergency Management Service) as reference, the method confers up to 95% accuracy and a Kappa value of 0.75.

TI  - Tick-borne encephalitis foci in northeast Italy revealed by combined virus detection in ticks, serosurvey on goats and human cases
T2  - EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a severe zoonotic neurological disease endemic in northeast Italy since 1992. In the Province of Trento, a sharp increase in TBE incidence has been recorded since 2012, despite the vaccination efforts. To assess current TBE infection hazard in this area, we applied an integrated approach combining the distribution of human cases, the seroprevalence of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in sentinel hosts and the screening of questing ticks for TBEV. A total of 706 goat sera from 69 farms were screened for TBEV-specific antibodies resulting in 5 positive farms, while the location of human cases was provided by the local Public Health Agency. Tick sampling was concentrated in areas where TBEV circulation was suggested by either seroprevalence in goats or human cases, resulting in 2,410 Ixodes ricinus collected and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Four tick samples from 2 areas with record of human cases were positive to TBEV corresponding to a 0.17% prevalence in the region, while risk areas suggested by serology on goats were not confirmed by tick screening. Our results revealed an increase in TBEV prevalence in ticks and the emergence of new active TBE foci, compared to previous surveys, and demonstrated the importance of an integrated approach for TBE risk assessment. A phylogenetic analysis of the partial E gene confirmed that the European TBEV subtype is circulating in northeast Italy and suggested that the different Italian TBEV strains originated independently as a result of different introductions from neighbouring countries, presumably through migratory birds.

AB  - The analysis of remote sensing data enables us to detect changes and monitor land surface temperature (LST). How-ever, analysis of times series data poses some challenges, including weather conditions, seasonality and noise, that limit the effectiveness of change detection algorithms. While existing algorithms perform relatively well for detecting abrupt transitions, reliable detection of gradual changes is more difficult. In this paper, we formulate the problem of spatiotemporal LST detection as a statistical sequential change detection problem. LST images are modeled as stochastic processes, with temperature changes reflected as changes in the parameters (i.e., mean) of the process. A generalized likelihood ratio test is used to detect these changes and estimate the exact time/space where they occur. To minimize processing time and memory requirements, we represent LST images by their reduced dimensionality using direct cosine transformation followed by principal component analysis. Statistical sequential analysis is used to provide a unified mathematical framework for the detection of both abrupt and gradual changes in LST observations of Bridgeton Missouri landfill over 17 years.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The monitoring of archaeological sites declared World Heritage Sites is a fundamental activity to protect and safeguard cultural heritage. In this context, monitoring with sensors mounted on a satellite platform represents a valuable tool. The availability of satellite images at high temporal frequency allows a continuous monitoring of the areas to be protected. The images acquired with the Sentinel-2 constellation are available free of charge and with a high temporal frequency; this mean that it is possible a continuous monitoring of the areas to be protected. In addition, the change-detection techniques and, in particular, the "Image Differencing" technique may be used, thanks to its simplicity and speed of application, in the monitoring activity. This technique provides that to each radiance value of an image acquired on a given date, the corresponding values of another image dating back to a high date are subtracted; in other words, to each pixel of an image is subtracted the value of the corresponding pixel of a second image acquired on a different date from the first one. The investigation was conducted on the archaeological site of the Temple of "Ain Dara" located in Syria, which is recognized in 2011 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The temple was destroyed in January 2018.

AB  - Oman is a hot, arid and highly water-stressed country. The less amount of rainfall, not exceeding 100 mm per annum, leads to the dire need of optimum water management practices. Evapotranspiration estimates plays an important role in water management practices. Traditional methods to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa) are dependent on climatological data providing only point-based outcomes, In this study, two remote sensing surface energy-based models namely Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) were applied to estimate ETa in the city of As'Suwaiq, Oman over a period of two years. Results shown that SEBAL model under estimating ETa especially, in the peak summer. Whereas strong correlation of METRIC model with Penman Monteith model with R-2 value of 0.71 as compared to R-2 value of 0.13 with SEBAL. The study concluded that METRIC model performed better than SEBAL in estimating ETa for As'Suwaiq region as it provided results with high spatial and temporal resolution.

M3  - Article
AB  - Religious values as the most important component of the worldview can significantly affect various aspects of human life - from everyday practices to political preferences. The analysis of changes in religiosity shows that in the post-Soviet space, there is a clear tendency of the transition from atheistic attitudes to the religious revival. In the contemporary Kazakhstan society, a complex model of religious identity develops - it combines ideals and norms of religious consciousness with ideas of spirituality and national revival, but the confession values can often only be of an external, declarative nature. According to different studies, in Kazakhstan, the share of believers following religious practices increases. The question is whether people really observe religious rites and traditions and follow religious regulations. The article summarizes the results of the study conducted by the Center for the Study of Public Opinion to assess the religiosity of the Almaty urban community. The survey showed that the share of people who identify themselves as a part of some confession is significant; however, this is not a direct indicator of the increase in the number of true believers seeking to actively follow all religious rules and practices. The article presents the data on the activity of respondents in religious practices, their knowledge and understanding of some religious postulates. The study showed that the religious renaissance among the youth can be accompanied by undeveloped religious consciousness and insufficient religious knowledge, which provides grounds for the dissemination of pseudo-religious ideas including the extremist ones.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In this chapter we focus the use of knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) methods as a guide to machine learning algorithms whereby relevant contextual knowledge can be leveraged upon. In this way, the learning methods improve performance by taking into account causal relationships behind errors. Performance improvement can be obtained by focusing the learning task on aspects that are particularly challenging (or prone to error), and then using added knowledge inferred by the reasoner as a means to provide further input to learning algorithms. Said differently, the KRR algorithms guide the learning algorithms, feeding it labels and data in order to iteratively reduce the errors calculated by a given cost function. This closed loop system comes with the added benefit that errors are also made more understandable to the human, as it is the task of the KRR system to contextualize the errors from the ML algorithm in accordance with its knowledge model. This represents a type of explainable AI that is focused on interpretability. This chapter will discuss the benefits of using KRR methods with ML methods in this way, and demonstrate an approach applied to satellite data for the purpose of improving classification and segmentation task.

T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rabigh is a thriving coastal city located at the eastern bank of the Red Sea, Saudi Arabia. The city has suffered from shoreline destruction because of the invasive tidal action powered principally by the wind speed and direction over shallow waters. This study was carried out to calibrate the water column depth in the vicinity of Rabigh. Optical and microwave remote sensing data from the European Space Agency were collected over 2 years (2017-2018) along with the analog daily monitoring of tidal data collected from the marine station of Rabigh. Depth invariant index (DII) was implemented utilizing the optical data, while the Wind Field Estimation algorithm was implemented utilizing the microwave data. The findings of the current research emphasis on the oscillation behavior of the depth invariant mean values and the mean astronomical tides resulted in R-2 of 0.75 and 0.79, respectively. Robust linear regression was established between the astronomical tide and the mean values of the normalized DII (R-2 = 0.81). The findings also indicated that January had the strongest wind speed solidly correlated with the depth invariant values (R-2 = 0.92). Therefore, decision-makers can depend on remote sensing data as an efficient tool to monitor natural phenomena and also to regulate human activities in fragile ecosystems.

AB  - Seagrass beds play an important role in carbon storage, as well as an effective removal of CO2 from the "biosphere-atmosphere" system, which plays a significant role in the amelioration of climate change impacts. The present study focused on carbon content modeling and mapping in submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) including seagrass and algae species in coastal water areas (-0.5 to -7 m depth) of the Arabian Gulf using field sampling, laboratory analyses and satellite-based approach. The used Landsat-OLI image, acquired simultaneously with field sampling, was preprocessed rigorously to remove all radiometric and geometric anomalies. The modeling is applied on 55 samples collected from the seabed including biomass of the canopy (above-ground biomass: AGB), roots and rhizomes (below-ground biomass: BGB) and sediments (within a depth 15 cm). Each sampling location was automatically labeled and recorded using a "Deep-Blue-Pro" underwater digital camera equipped with a sub-meter GPS survey and connected to a laptop computer allowing a real time viewing of seabed. The carbon content was analyzed in the laboratory considering separately the AGB, BGB, and sediments in each sample, and then converted and calculated at the OLI pixel size level. A linear regression at 95% confidence interval was applied between the obtained carbon content at the pixel level and: a) calibrated reflectances in the VNIR spectral bands, b) water spectral indices, and c) percentage of SAV cover (PSAVC) fraction determined by a semi-empirical relation developed previously. The results revealed that the best fit (R-2 = 0.87) was obtained between PSAVC and the total carbon content derived from the biomass (AGB and BGB) and sediments. The cross-validation of derived carbon map based on the proposed modeling approach showed a good correlation (R-2 = 0.74) and an acceptable RMSE of +/- 0.4 kg/m(2). However, despite the limited number of sampling points, the uncertainly of carbon content scaling up at the pixel level, and the errors propagation in modeling process, these preliminary results are encouraging for carbon content modeling and mapping over a large area in shallow water based on optical remote sensing.

T2  - GOSUDARSTVO RELIGIYA TSERKOV V ROSSII I ZA RUBEZHOM
M3  - Article
AB  - Religious studies devote considerable attention to the research of doctrinal influences on social behavior and everyday practices among followers of various religious movements. This study analyzes the demographic behavior of the postniks (one of the "old Russian sectarian" movements) in the Tambov region of the early twentieth century. The paper relies on the relational database developed by the authors during this research. The systematization of archival statistical data and other sources allows the authors to take a closer look at the postniks' religious life. The population pyramid based on the available data indicates their deep distinction from "ordinary" Orthodox peasants of the Tambov province. The same significant differences exist in the number of children in a family and other compared indicators. The authors argue that this specific demographic behavior is a consequence of the worldview attitudes of the postniks rather than any external factors.

TI  - High-frequency Temporal Wave-pattern Reconstruction from a Few Satellite Images: A New Method towards Estimating Regional Bathymetry
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - It is currently impossible to accurately estimate coastal risks considering the lack of accurate and up-to-date bathymetric knowledge. We enter a new era of satellite coastal observation which offers unprecedented regional monitoring capabilities with a high spatial resolution. Methodologies to estimate bathymetry from waves developed for shore-based video camera systems are now widely used but require high frequency (several frames per second) and long duration (a few minutes) videos. Only a few satellite missions offer the possibility to acquire videos from space over regional domains (Pleiades persistent mode, WorldView-2). These are on-demand acquisitions at specific dates and generally expensive. At the same time, most of continuous Earth Observation missions, which have the potential to cover coastal evolution, offer short sequences using the different bands (2 to 10 bands within typically similar to 1-2 seconds, e.g. Sentinel-2) or a sequence of a few images for stereo or tri-stereo topography purpose (2 or 3 images with lags of similar to 8s, e.g. Pleiades). Here, we present how high-frequency wave pattern time-series can be reconstructed using a spatiotemporal cross-correlation, gathering surrounding sparse temporal wave information while conserving its high-resolution spatial information. This new methodology breaks several locks and enables deriving full wave characteristics from a limited number of images to quantify a robust regional bathymetry.

AB  - Background: Lymphoscintigraphy imaging procedure is performed at the nuclear medicine department to evaluate sentinel lymph nodes for excisional biopsy in patients with melanoma, and to assess the use of the intraoperative gamma probe in the operating room. The objective of this study is to evaluate the radiation dose of patients during lymphoscintigraphy SPECT/CT procedure and to estimate its radiogenic risk.Methods: Of the thirty patients that underwent SPECT/CT in this research, 63.3 % (19 patients) and 36.7 % (11 patients) were females and males, respectively. For SPECT/CT [GE Hualun Medical Systems (Discovery NM/CT 670Pro)].Results: The effective dose (mSv) per procedure ranges from 0.21 to 0.5 mSv, with an average dose value of 0.22 mSv. The effective dose for CT examination is 0.05 (ranging from 0.04 to 0.1 mSv per procedure). Therefore, the effective dose for CT is lower than that for SPECT by a factor of 5. This radiation risk is equivalent to 5 weeks of natural background radiation exposure.Conclusions: This place it under the category of low radiation risk for cancer, equivalent to 1 cancer case per 105 SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy procedures. Moreover, this dose is lower than previously published studies suggesting that the patients were well protected during the entire procedure.

TI  - Trauma and Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms: The Role of Worldview Assumptions and Obsessive Beliefs
T2  - TURK PSIKOLOJI DERGISI
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the factors that play a role in the emergence and persistence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms might be childhood neglect and abuse. The main aim of this study was to examine the mediating role of worldview assumptions and the severity of obsessive beliefs in the relationship between childhood traumas and the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Furthermore, gender differences in childhood traumas, worldview assumptions, obsessive beliefs, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms were investigated. Five hundred sixty-two college students (M-age = 21.54, SD = 3.60; 113 male, 449 female) completed Childhood Traumas Scale, Worldview Assumptions Scale, Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire, and Vancouver Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory via electronic mail. It was found that both worldview assumptions and severity of obsessive beliefs have mediating roles in the relationship between the frequency of childhood traumas and the obsessive-compulsive symptom severity. More specifically, the relationship between the frequency of childhood traumas and severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms was mediated by negative worldview assumptions through the severity of obsessive beliefs. In addition, none of the variables revealed gender difference. The results of the study shed light on the complex mechanism in the relations between childhood traumas and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Results also imply that inquiry of childhood neglect and abuse, negative worldview assumptions, and obsessive beliefs may contribute to the treatment of obsessive-compulsive symptoms.

TI  - Characteristic and psychosocial consequences of sexually abused children referred to a tertiary care facility in Oman: Sentinel study
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) has been reported from different parts of the world. With regard to countries in the Arabian Gulf, there have been some anecdotal and impressionistic observations of CSA and Oman is no exception.Aims: In order to lay the groundwork for empirical scrutiny of this phenomena, the present study elaborates on the description of the CSA along with exploring the socio-demographic and psychosocial consequences among children with a history of sexual abuse referred to a tertiary care center providing mental services catering to the needs of children and adolescents mental health services (CAMHS).Method: 34 children referred for a one-year period to the CAMHS fulfilled the criteria for inclusion of the study. Socio-demographic, CSA, and psychosocial information were collected for each subject. Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and multiple logistic regression analysis was used to explore which variables associated with children having depressive symptoms.Result: Majority of children abused were female (64.7%, n = 22), age below 12 years (67.6%, n = 23), and with low family income (85.3%, n = 29). Multivariate analysis shows that CSA and psychological variables were significant risk factors for depression. Children who were penetrative abused were more likely (OR = 24.897, p = 0.044) to have depression than non-penetrative children. Children who reported problems with sleep-wake cycles (OR = 44.636, p = 0.012) were more likely to occurrence of depressive symptoms than children who reported no such problem.Conclusion: The patterns of CSA and its consequences in Oman appears to echo the trends from other parts of the world. As the country is becoming increasingly aware of the international best practice towards CSA, this study will serve as a milestone for more studies in the area using robust methodology.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the main principles behind the ontological doctrine of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as well as the characteristics of its genesis, development and functioning in a Protestant environment. The work provides a basic definition of ontology as the science of being, determines its conceptual content in the religious dimension and characterizes essential moments of the sacral history of the Universe and mankind from the perspective of Mormonism that are essential for the study of the ontological aspects of this belief system. The research is accompanied by comparative analysis of the ontological doctrine of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and philosophical systems that have directly or indirectly influenced the Mormons' worldview, including G. Leibniz's monadology, Aristotle's first principles and Plato's theory of ideas. At the same time, the authors identify the specific features of monotheistic ideas in the doctrine of Mormonism and its difference from other monotheistic beliefs. Fundamental ontological categories, such as movement, time, space, spirit and matter are analyzed through the prism of Mormon perception.

TI  - Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing Platform for Remote Sensing Big Data Applications: A Comprehensive Review
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) systems have been collecting massive volumes of datasets for decades, managing and analyzing of which are not practical using common software packages and desktop computing resources. In this regard, Google has developed a cloud computing platform, called Google Earth Engine (GEE), to effectively address the challenges of big data analysis. In particular, this platform facilitates processing big geo data over large areas and monitoring the environment for long periods of time. Although this platform was launched in 2010 and has proved its high potential for different applications, it has not been fully investigated and utilized for RS applications until recent years. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively explore different aspects of the GEE platform, including its datasets, functions, advantages/limitations, and various applications. For this purpose, 450 journal articles published in 150 journals between January 2010 and May 2020 were studied. It was observed that Landsat and Sentinel datasets were extensively utilized by GEE users. Moreover, supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, were more widely applied to image classification tasks. GEE has also been employed in a broad range of applications, such as Land Cover/land Use classification, hydrology, urban planning, natural disaster, climate analyses, and image processing. It was generally observed that the number of GEE publications have significantly increased during the past few years, and it is expected that GEE will be utilized by more users from different fields to resolve their big data processing challenges.

AB  - In this paper, we present new accurate and efficient semi-automatic segmentation method for Sentinel-2 satellite images which is used in NaturaSat software for exploration of Natura 2000 habitats. The method is based on the Lagrangian approach to evolving plane curves and the mathematical model incorporates the tangential redistribution of grid points. The Lagrangian curve evolution is solved by the semi-implicit scheme and new robust and efficient initial condition for curve evolution is proposed. The final semi-automatic segmentation is automatically adjusted to represent the desired boundaries accurately with a control of the smoothness of the final segmentation result. Together with comprehensive discussion on semi-automatic segmentation, the NaturaSat software design and its functionality is presented as well.

AB  - Research in New Zealand indicates that winter forage grazing on steep land creates a high risk of sediment loss. This loss can have a significant impact on sediment and associated nutrient content of waterways. A national-scale map of winter forage cropping on land with slope of greater than 7 degrees was created using spectral and temporal analysis of Sentinel-2 imagery. Images between March and September 2018 were masked for cloud, cloud shadow, and snow using a time-series-controlled layer. Land cover classification using maximum likelihood estimation was applied. Field boundaries were generated using the temporal image stack so that field-level homogeneity could be exploited. The mode classification per-polygon and bare ground observation dates allowed polygons totaling 0.69% of New Zealand's agricultural hill country to be stratified into three certainty levels of risky agricultural practice. For the first time, extent and spatial distribution of these practices have been estimated for policy development.

TI  - CALCULATION AND VALIDATION OF ACTUAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION FROM SATELLITE DERIVED INDICES WITH OBSERVED DATA IN DELINEATED AGRO-CLIMATIC ZONES OF PUNJAB USING REMOTE SENSING AND GIS TECHNIQUES
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is the major restrictive constraint for agricultural growth and production. Agro-climate zones refer to the areas with homogenous agro-potential characteristics. The objective of this study is to delineate the agro-climate zones of Punjab, Pakistan and to calculate Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from actual and satellite data. Potential evapotranspiration (ET0) was calculated by using climatic normal of 25 years (1990-2015). On the basis of Potential evapotranspiration (ET0) and Moisture Index, study area was delineated into seven agro-climatic zones. Secondly, ETa was investigated by adopting a fraction of Normalized difference vegetation index. Landsat 8 data for the year (2016) was used to determine pixel-based vegetation coefficients. Actual ET maps were prepared to analyze spatial variation of ETa in all zones. Actual ET was determined in mm/day. Daily ETa values in the months of Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct and Dec were 1.0, 1.71, 2.70, 3.5, 4.41, 5.01, 5.2, 4.5, 4.37, 3.01, 2.0 and 1.4 mm respectively. Finally, it was observed that there is a strong relation between both results calculated from satellite data and climatic data of selected crops, i.e. wheat, rice, cotton, sugarcane and maize R-2 = 0.96, 0.94, 0.90, 0.98 and 0.95 respectively. Above results shown that satellite data are widely useful with ground validation for sustainable crop production as well as for policy makers with respect to water conservation.

AB  - In this paper it is described a study case of a rapid assessment of change detections for post-cyclone Idai vegetated damage and flood extension estimation by fusion of multi-temporal Landsat and sentinel-1 SAR images. For automated change detection, after disasters, many algorithms have been proposed. To visualize the changes induced by cyclone we tested and compared two automated change detection techniques namely: Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and image segmentation. With the image segmentation of multispectral and SAR images, it was possible to visualize the extension of the wet area. For this specific application, PCA was identified as the optimal change detection indicator than NDVI. This study suggested that image segmentation, principal components analysis, and normalized difference vegetation index can be used for change detection of surface water due to flood and disasters especially in prone countries like Mozarribique.

TI  - Assessing the water spread area available for fish culture and fish production potential in inland lentic waterbodies using remote sensing: A case study from Chhattisgarh State, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland lentic waterbodies have a major role in contributing to nutritional and livelihood security of the rural poor in India. Generating a spatio-temporal resource inventory of the small waterbodies has immense potential in evidence-based fisheries development planning, so as to enhance the fish production (quantity) and productivity (quantity per unit area). The present study provides a framework for mapping these waterbodies using high resolution Cartosat 1 PAN and IRS ResourceSAT LISS IV merged imagery, determining the spatio-temporal water spread area and effective water spread area available for fish culture using Sentinel 2 Multi Spectral Imagery, for the years 2016-18. It provides an approach for determining the number of fingerlings required and estimating the production potential under standard production parameters, based on the extent of water available for fish culture in the waterbodies. The framework was piloted in Chhattisgarh, a landlocked State in Central India, which has a large number of inland waterbodies. A total of 121,529 waterbodies, with an area of 202,016 ha were mapped, of which 97% had an extent less than 5 ha. The total extent of waterbodies was 37% higher than the most recent estimate by Government of India. Availability of water in the waterbodies of the state, for a duration of at least 8 and 11 months in a year, was found to be 74% (149,484 ha) and 50% (102,167 ha) respectively, which indicates the vast scope for promotion of intensive aquaculture in the state. Minimum number of fingerlings required for stocking the available water was estimated as 403 million. This framework can be replicated across the country and other regions with poor in-situ data, for effective management of inland waterbodies through location-specific data-driven intervention planning.

AB  - Objectives　Comprehensive community sports clubs (CCSCs), of which more than 3,500 exist in Japan, have the potential to contribute to healthy aging in older adults, but their effect on this population has not, thus far, been well explored. This study aimed to investigate the current environment affecting seniors at Japanese CCSCs and to examine issues identified by the analysis.Methods　Data were collected from the FY 2016 Survey Results on Comprehensive Community Sports Clubs, conducted by the Japan Sports Agency. A total of 2,444 clubs were divided equally into four groups after calculating the proportion of senior members (ages 60 and over) per total number of members in each club. The groups were then ranked from lowest to highest according to proportion of senior members: Groups A, B, C and D. Additionally, the 2,444 clubs were classified into six regions according to location. Group designation (A to D) and regional classification were used as independent variables. The dependent variables were categorized as follows: basic information (e.g. total number of members), crisis management and accident prevention measures (13 specific items in total), and each club's compliance with legal obligations.Results　Study results revealed that Group D, containing the highest proportion of senior members, had fewer total members, lower monthly membership fees, lower annual club income, less annual club budget apportioned to each member, and fewer instructors than other groups. Regarding crisis management and accident prevention measures, Group D had lower completion rates on 6 items (health certificate submissions, liability insurance enrollment, safety workshop implementation, heatstroke prevention, liaison with healthcare professionals, and AED availability). Group D also showed a lower rate of compliance with legal obligations than other groups. In comparisons between the six regions, the median proportion of senior members was found to be highest in Chugoku-Shikoku and lowest in Chubu, although each median ranged from only 20% to 30%. Regarding crisis management and accident prevention measures, clubs in Kanto region had the highest completion rates for 10 items, whereas clubs in Kinki region had the lowest completion rates for 8 items.Conclusion　The CCSCs with higher proportions of senior members had smaller budgets, fewer members and staff, and delayed implementation of crisis management and accident prevention measures. Regional disparities were also observed both in club scale and management of medical and safety issues. Although our study identified several shortcomings in this area, medical and safety management implementation is an important consideration for CCSCs with high proportions of senior members, as these members are at higher risk for disease and frailty. Affected CCSCs and relevant authorities should therefore acknowledge and address this issue cooperatively.

AB  - Lowering on land surface which is commonly known as land subsidence is quite an issue in Indonesia today especially for coastal low elevation young sediment area, including cities or urban area lies on top of it. Jakarta is one of the city with most famous for land subsidence at the moment. If we go along northern coast of Java, many cities are experiencing the same situation as Jakarta and even more. As the impact from land subsidence, those coastal areas may experience water disaster such as sea water inundation and intrusion, wider expansion of flood and aquifer damage. Investigation of such areas in large and even regional scale with limited research budget is a problem. Nevertheless we found way for at least reducing the problem by using the capabilities of remote sensing product, geological and geostatistic data. We can identify land subsidence, coastal effected by subsidence like mentioned above by only time series of satellite image archive such as Google earth or Landsat free distributed, geological map and published geostatistic data like water consumption and population growth, with sample validated by land subsidence measurement and groundwater monitoring points. This paper will highlight our finding.

M3  - Article
AB  - The problems related to the investigation of the lunar surface structure using the methods of multi-parameter analysis and fractal geometry were considered. In order to build a digital model of the lunar surface, we used the data from the Clementine, Kaguya, and LRO space missions. An electronic database of altimetry measurements was constructed. These measurements were confined to a single reference system by robust modeling. For the construction of the digital model, the altimetry satellite data were expanded into harmonic series of the spherical functions. After that, we used the developed model to determine fractal parameters and fractal similarity coefficients of the lunar surface structure and plotted diagrams of their distribution in monochromatic and color modes. The digital cartographic surface was analyzed by the method of fractal geometry aimed at assessing the fractal similarity coefficients and fractal dimensions. The digital model was transformed into a color map with regard to the color height scale. A method was developed to identify SRGB (Square, Red, Green, Blue) dimensions for the model of lunar surface. More than 150 SRGBs were analyzed, and color fractal parameters were found for them. The obtained results can be helpful for creating a global model of the lunar structure.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the converging epic lines in three novels by Leo Tolstoy. The author argues that in the second half of the 19Ih century Russian novelists were able to create the artistic worlds, in which prominence is given both to common destiny of the nation and individual fates. The novel War and Peace, specifically, is described as an innovative work of epic fiction based on current and recent Russian history that became a model of epic writing for many novelists then and later. It's claimed that Tolstoy developed and deepened the epic dimensions of fictional world in his subsequent novels, namely, Anna Karenina and Resurrection. For these three novels the author offers a close analysis of the following parameters: the ratio of the individual and the common; the integrity and totality of fictional worlds, the scope of events, narrative objectivity, precedential worldview, etc. In addition, a special emphasis is laid on the religious consciousness of Russian novelists, their search and affirmation of Orthodox Christian values, instrumental to the making of an epic novel.

AB  - Biogenic oil film is a natural surface film that is usually derived from marine flora and fauna and has been frequently observed around aquaculture facilities. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of detecting biogenic oil films near aquaculture facilities using SAR data. An automated procedure was developed for downloading, processing, classifying and extracting vectors that can be used for further analysis. Our dataset consisted of 257 Sentinel-1 SAR images for a one-year period (November 2019-November 2020), and a Python based automated algorithm was developed in order to detect the biogenic oil film and distinguish it from lookalikes. The algorithm was tested in Kratigos, Lesvos Island, Greece. Our first results indicate the existence of the film near aquaculture farms and the strong need for further investigation of its impacts to the coastal one enviromnent and activities.

AB  - Biogenic oil film is a natural surface slick that is mainly derived by sea flora and fauna. The often observation of the film near aquaculture facilities has raised awareness on the possibility of the linkage between the development of the film and the anthropogenic activities taking place on site (i.e. artificial feeding and liquid waste). This study aims to investigate the possibility of the detection of biogenic oil film on optical satellite images and discriminate it from other oceanographic phenomena. For the purposes of the study we have used a Sentinel-2 (S2) dataset consisted of 73 images for the year 2019 to detect the film on three aquaculture areas. An automatic procedure was developed on a Python based algorithm which included the following stages: (a) downloading images, (b) preprocessing the input data, (c) identifying dark formations in the adjacent fish farming area, (d) extracting attribute tables with the statistical characteristics of the formations (shape, area, etc.), (e) classification of formations as biogenic film or other (lookalike) and (f) extraction of biogenic film vectors. The developed algorithm was able to detect biogenic oil film successfully however some misleading results regarding the decision of true or false positive (biogenic oil film or lookalike) was evidenced. The efficiency of the algorithm was tested against manual classification with overall accuracy 82,6%. As further step the results of this study should be validated with in-situ measurements and further work is required to verify the results obtained by testing the methods in other sites.

M3  - Review
AB  - Between 1980 and 2004, six randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed to evaluate the width of surgical margin excision for primary cutaneous melanoma and its influence on recurrence and survival. These trials have led to the current recommendation of not more than a 2-cm margin excision and have allowed reduced morbidity of surgery for primary melanoma. Long-term follow-up data has been published which has led to impactful knowledge of the natural history of this disease, yet controversy remains for 1- to 2-mm thickness melanomas. Interpretation of these trials must be done in light of them enrolling patients before the use of sentinel node biopsy and contemporary immunotherapy regimens. These RCTs as well as a contemporary, actively enrolling trial are summarized and discussed in this review.

AB  - This paper presents an unsupervised workflow to assess the extension of the burned areas due to wildfire events over green vegetated areas, in particular woods and forests, based on open access and high spatial resolution multispectral images from the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites, together with open access high temporal resolution products (MODIS and VIIRS). The idea is to use jointly these kinds of data to combine the advantages linked to the use of high spatial resolution data with those ones derived from the exploitation of high temporal resolution data. Experimental results, carried on different case studies, show the effectiveness of the proposed method on forest fires, by reaching a performance in terms of the F-measure parameter, that ranges from 0.69 to 0.95, depending on the specific case study.

AB  - Objective To test the hypotheses that emerging viruses are associated with neurological hospitalizations and that statistical models can be used to predict neurological sequelae from viral infections. Methods An ecological study was carried out to observe time trends in the number of hospitalizations with inflammatory polyneuropathy and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) in the state of Rio de Janeiro from 1997 to 2017. Increases in GBS from month to month were assessed using a Farrington test. In addition, a cross-sectional study was conducted analyzing 50 adults hospitalized for inflammatory polyneuropathies from 2015 to 2017. The extent to which Zika virus symptoms explained GBS hospitalizations was evaluated using a calibration test. Results There were significant increases (Farrington test, P<0.001) in the incidence of GBS following the introduction of influenza A/H1N1 in 2009, dengue virus type 4 in 2013, and Zika virus in 2015. Of 50 patients hospitalized, 14 (28.0%) were diagnosed with arboviruses, 9 (18.0%) with other viruses, and the remainder with other causes of such neuropathies. Statistical models based on cases of emerging viruses accurately predicted neurological sequelae, such as GBS. Conclusion The introduction of novel viruses increases the incidence of inflammatory neuropathies.

TI  - Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair Metrics: Establishing Face, Content, and Construct Validity in a Cadaveric Model
T2  - ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To create and determine face validity and content validity of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) performance metrics, to confirm construct validity of the metrics coupled with a cadaveric shoulder, and to establish a performance benchmark for the procedure on a cadaveric shoulder. Methods: Five experienced arthroscopic shoulder surgeons created step, error, and sentinel error metrics for an ARCR. Fourteen shoulder arthroscopy faculty members from the Arthroscopy Association of North America formed the modified Delphi panel to assess face and content validity. Eight Arthroscopy Association of North America shoulder arthroscopy faculty members (experienced group) were compared with 9 postgraduate year 4 or 5 orthopaedic residents (novice group) in their ability to perform an ARCR. Instructions were given to perform a diagnostic arthroscopy and a 2-anchor, 4-simple suture repair of a 2-cm supraspinatus tear. The procedure was videotaped in its entirety and independently scored in blinded fashion by trained, paired reviewers. Results: Delphi panel consensus for 42 steps and 66 potential errors was obtained. Overall performance assessment showed a mean inter-rater reliability of 0.93. Novice surgeons completed 17% fewer steps (32.1 vs 37.5, P = .001) and enacted 2.5 times more errors than the experienced group (6.21 vs 2.5, P= .012). Fifty percent of the experienced group members and none of the novice group members achieved the proficiency benchmark of a minimum of 37 steps completed with 3 or fewer errors. Conclusions: Face validity and content validity for the ARCR metrics, along with construct validity for the metrics and cadaveric shoulder, were verified. A proficiency benchmark was established based on the mean performance of an experienced group of arthroscopic shoulder surgeons.

AB  - This paper presents a time-domain synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processor designed for Sentinel-1 Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) monostatic data. The processor focuses Interferometric Wide (IW) swath and Extra Wide (EW) swath data on a selected region-of-interest (ROI) and consists of the following main stages: decoding of Level-0 data, selection of the relevant burst and pulses for the targeted ROI, range compression, azimuth frequency unfolding and resampling, and image focusing by a fast subaperture-based version of the back-projection algorithm. The performances of the developed processor are assessed on datasets acquired in IW and EW imaging modes. Such a time-domain processor can be regarded as a first step towards a geometry/frequency-agnostic SAR processing kernel for future monostatic/multistatic spaceborne SAR missions.

T2  - RUPKATHA JOURNAL ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the aesthetics and shades of portrayals of ghosts as supernatural and metaphysical realities in two Nollywood films Heart of a Ghost and A Ghost Story as representations of Igbo worldviews on ghosts' realities. Our aim is to present an analytical explanation of the filmic attributions in relation to historical as well as the subsisting socio-cultural worldviews of the Igbo people regarding ghosts. Therefore to extrapolate on the subsumed Igbo worldviews and philosophies about ghosts in the selected films, this study adopts theoretical purviews on magical realism and Charles Peirce's inclination on interpretive community theory as the preferred conceptual praxis. Furthermore, this study applies critical interpretive analysis as the adopted analytical approach. Thus, the relevance of these portrayals to the subsisting sociocultural worldviews about ghosts among the Igbo forms part of our thematic purview. Essentially this study sufficiently provides plausible answers to questions bothering on whether ghosts exist in the manner portrayed in the two films, as well as plausible analysis of the significations of ghosts' appearances in clothing and whether ghosts do change their clothing like humans from time to time.

AB  - Aerosols are defined as solid or liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere which directly affect the Earth's radiation budget, cloud properties, air quality, and human health. Aerosol Optical Depth/Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOD/AOT) is a measure of aerosol loading, integrated through the atmospheric column. In this paper, a comparison of AOD obtained from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) at Jaipur, Pune, Gandhi College, and Karunya University is made for the years 2017, 2018. Finally, the daily average AOD obtained for May 2018 over New Delhi IMD, Jaipur, Pune, Gandhi College, Karunya University is compared and results are discussed. The comparative study of the AOD trend over Karachi and Gandhi College during the period of September 2006 to August 2014 is also made.

TI  - GLOFs of Laguna de los Tempanos, glacier-dammed side lake of Glaciar Steffen, Hielo Patagonico Norte, Chile, since 1974
T2  - BULLETIN OF GLACIOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier lake outburst floods (GLOF) at Laguna de los Tempanos, a glacier-dammed side lake of Glaciar Steffen, Hielo Patagonico Norte, were documented for a period between December 1974 and February 2020. With manual interpretation of 150 remote sensing images of aerial surveys, vertical aerial photographs, Landsat MSS, TM, ETM and OLI, ALOS, and ASTER images, 19 GLOFs were captured/ inferred by focusing on icebergs and water levels, except two periods in the 1980 s and the 1990 s for which no image was available. This translates to the occurrence of the GLOF on average once ca. every 14 months. Many GLOFs occurred in late summer to early fall, with a few in late spring: but one GLOF was inferred to have occurred in wintertime. The causes of GLOFs were supposed to be heavy rainfalls, probably accompanied with rapid snow/ice melting by warm air temperatures, judging from the general weather condition over the laguna area. The latest two GLOFs (2016 & 2017) were very large, enough to have completely exposed the lake floor in the middle section. The GLOF of 2017 (Mar. 31) was registered in a hydrograph set up at Lower Rio Huemules. After this GLOF, the water level has become stable with a more or less continuous outlet stream along the glacier sidewall and there has been no GLOF to date. So probably the prospect of another GLOF has considerably diminished by now. As Glaciar Steffen receded about 6 km during this study period, the glacier has thinned accordingly, to which the water level adjusted with three distinctive relatively stable states while fluctuating frequently.

TI  - Chlorophyll Concentration Retrieval by Training Convolutional Neural Network for Stochastic Model of Leaf Optical Properties (SLOP) Inversion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Miniaturized hyperspectral imaging techniques have developed rapidly in recent years and have become widely available for different applications. Combining calibrated hyperspectral imagery with inverse physically based reflectance models is an interesting approach for estimating chlorophyll concentrations that are good indicators of vegetation health. The objective of this study was to develop a novel approach for retrieving chlorophyll a and b values from remotely sensed data by inverting the stochastic model of leaf optical properties using a one-dimensional convolutional neural network. The inversion results and retrieved values are validated in two ways: A classical machine learning validation dataset and calculating chlorophyll maps from empirical remotely sensed hyperspectral data and comparing them to an index that has strong negative correlation with chlorophyll concentration. With the validation dataset, coefficients of determination of 0.97 were obtained for chlorophyll a and 0.95 for chlorophyll b. The chlorophyll maps correlate with the map. The correlation coefficient (R) is -0.87 for chlorophyll a and -0.68 for chlorophyll b in selected plots. These results indicate that the approach is highly promising approach for estimating vegetation chlorophyll content.

CP  - International Conference on Geomatics in Civil Engineering (ICGCE)
CL  - Roorkee, INDIA
AB  - Rapid changes and sudden shootouts of development are occurring in most of the major cities in developing countries, leading to a requirement for mass transit facilities. Envisaging Urban Sprawl helps in finding out the future needs and critical locations of development. This paper validates the use of Shannon's entropy in finding out the sprawl in Nagpur, one of the fast developing cities of India, with the help of remote sensing data and GIS tools. In the present study, the spatial pattern of urban sprawl has been worked out based on location factors. Remotely sensed data obtained from Landsat and IRS LISS-III sensors were utilized. The entropy values show that the city is spreading outward following the transportation corridors. The observed growth pattern can be used for the future development plans of the city to mitigate some of the environmental impacts and provide sustainable growth.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article studies the linguistic worldview of the great Russian writer I.A. Bunin in the context of an extreme situation and measures the manipulation potential of his diary "Cursed Days" written in the period of wars and revolutions in the early 20th century, the time of cardinal changes in all spheres of life. The author shows how the writer's worldview changed influenced by the political, historic and cultural events of those days. The phenomenon of linguistic manipulation is the object of the research, which is explained by the character of the linguo-cultural and historical situation at the time of the diary's publishing. The empirical material is helps to study manipulative behavior in an extreme situation, which requires special speaking skillfulness, a high degree of persuasion, and mobilizing all available means and tools.The study focuses on key means of argumentation and manipulation that I.A. Bunin uses to express his personal views on the historic events, as well as on lexical means, stylistic devices and techniques that enable the writer to affect the reader.The author proves that the diary "Cursed Days" contains not only semantic interpretation of the environment, but also a wide range of feelings and emotions, which, thus, makes the diary a synthesis of meanings and emotional states, and therefore, an efficient tool of manipulation.

TI  - Dynamics of changes in the agroecosystem of a shade-grown coffee plantation in the upper <i>La Antigua</i> river basin, Veracruz
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In Mexico, shade-grown coffee agroecosystems form part of the agroforestry landscape and provide shelter for a wide range of biological diversity. However, they are subject to transformation processes derived from the needs of producers and market demands, which affects the configuration of the agroecosystem. The present study aimed to quantify the transformations of land use cover related to coffee plantations in the upper La Antigua river basin, that has occurred over a period of 24 years. The dynamics of change in the coverage of land use and vegetation was analyzed, by generating cartography with the supervised classification technique of the LANDSAT images (TM, ETM, and OLI) of the years of 1993, 2003 and 2017 and the analysis of the factors that have promoted the changes that determine the current configuration of the agroforestry landscape, based on interviews with key stakeholders in the region. The results show that the transformation of the agroforestry systems in shade-grown coffee plantations is caused by land use changes and the government programs implemented in the region. Coffee growing represents one of the main sources of income in the Ecological Corridor of the Sierra Madre Oriental of the state of Veracruz, which requires the development of strategies that guarantee the maintenance and sustainability of this economic activity in the zone to avoid the potential impacts to the local development of the communities, as well as the affectation or loss of the natural ecosystems remaining in the region.

T2  - Revista Mexicana de Fitopatologia
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we evaluated satellite images from Sentinel 2 to estimate the severity of needle cast in pine and field evaluations. Three indexes were used: a) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), b) Moisture Stress Index (MSI), and c) Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). These indexes were obtained from the combination of satellite bands acquired monthly during February to July 2017. The values obtained by the indexes were correlated with the severity of needle cast of pine, estimated in 24 sampling sites. The values obtained from MSI correlated positively with the observed values of severity (0.70783, p<0.0001), the values obtained from NDVI had a moderate positive correlation with severity (0.53316, p<0.0001). Nevertheless, the data obtained from SAVI had a low positive correlation with severity (0.24844, p=0.0062). The results showed that the use of satellite images from Sentinel 2 and MSI can be used like a tool for monitoring the severity of Lophodermium sp. in pine forest.

M3  - Article
AB  - The water quality of the Rapel reservoir was assessed by using two well-known spectral indices of water quality parameters simultaneously sensitive to algae density, suspended sediments and colored dissolved organic matter parameters, derived from a Landsat multitemporal satellite image set acquired with a near-decadal frequency between 1975 and 2016. Both indices exhibited a clear average diminishing trend in the water quality for the whole study period, showing some hikes in their values for specific time intervals. Some discrepancies were found in the spatial and temporal behavior of both indices which remarks the need of validate them by field-based data. The results mostly agree with previous findings, standing out the usefulness of this kind of remote sensing techniques for the quality assessment of water bodies.

TI  - Surface Temperature of the Planet Earth from Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change regular scientific assessments of global warming is based on measurements of air temperature from weather stations, buoys or ships. More specifically, air temperature annual means are estimated from their integration into climate models, with some areas (Africa, Antarctica, seas) being clearly underrepresented. Present satellites allow estimation of surface temperature for a full coverage of our planet with a sub-daily revisit frequency and kilometric resolution. In this work, a simple methodology is developed that allows estimating the surface temperature of Planet Earth with MODIS Terra and Aqua land and sea surface temperature products, as if the whole planet was reduced to a single pixel. The results, through a completely independent methodology, corroborate the temperature anomalies retrieved from climate models and show a linear warming trend of 0.018 +/- 0.007 degrees C/yr.

AB  - Here, we examine a deep learning approach to perform land cover classification using country-wide SAR mosaics compiled using multitemporal Sentinel-1 imagery. We capitalize on our earlier study [1], demonstrating the suitability of deep learning models for land cover mapping using satellite C-band SAR images A set of SAR mosaics compiled from consecutive Sentinel-1 IW mode acquisitions covering the whole territory of Finland was used in production of the whole-country land cover map. The imagery were used as an input to the state-of-the-art deep-learning model for semantic segmentation called FC-DenseNet. This model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and further fine-tuned in this study. CORINE land cover map was used as a reference, and the model was trained to distinguish between 5 Level-1 CORINE classes. Upon the evaluation and benchmarking, we found that the FC-DenseNet model is able to achieve nearly 90% overall classification accuracy. These results indicate the suitability of deep learning approaches to support efficient operational wide-area mapping using satellite SAR imagery.

AB  - Drought is closely related to water reserves that are in the soil, both water reserves for land and for everyday human needs. In plantation, drought has a significant impact. Drought can be a barrier to plant production which will have an impact on local economic conditions. However, information about land drought is still lacking at this time. Even though the information is very much needed by various parties. This research uses remote sensing data on Landsat 8 imagery where this research aims to obtain a drought index value using the transformation of Land surface temperature (LST), NDWI and TVDI which will then be performed correlation regression equations and test the interpretation of accuracy of field data on the potential for a drought of plantation land in the research area. The results of data processing showed that the distribution of the most drought potential of plantation areas in Rempang Island was the potential for high drought with the total area of plantations having a high drought potential of 5737.073029Ha. The potential for moderate drought in the plantation area on Rempang Island has an area of 2851,479327 Ha. Low drought potential has the smallest area with a total area of the entire plantation area of 447.271236 Ha.

The method was used Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) using waves, mangrove ecosystems, bathymetry, and relief as the main data from 2016-2019. The coastal vulnerability was assessed using models from InVEST software and coastline change were detected using CoastSat software with Landsat 7 and 8 images data from 2000-2019. The result showed that the vulnerability in West Java coast is still at a high level, especially in the northern region. Each city or district has different parameters that influence its vulnerability. The occurrence of shoreline changes is due to the vulnerability parameter as well.

TI  - Species discrimination and individual tree detection for predicting main dendrometric characteristics in mixed temperate forests by use of airborne laser scanning and ultra-high-resolution imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate the combined use of two types of remote sensing data - ALS derived and digital aerial photogrammetry data (based on imagery collected by airborne UAV sensors) - along with intensive field measurements for extracting and predicting tree and stand parameters in even-aged mixed forests. The study is located in South West Romania and analyzes data collected from mixed-species plots. The main tree species within each plot are Norway spruce (Picea abies L Karst.) and Beech (Fops sylvatica L).The ALS data were used to extract the digital terrain model (UM), digital surface model (DSM) and normalized canopy height model (CHM). Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) dassification was performed to automatically detect and separate the main tree species. A local filtering algorithm with a canopy-height based variable window size was applied to identify the position, height and crown diameter of the main tree species within each plot. The filter was separately applied for each of the plots and for the areas covered with Norway spruce and beech trees, respectively (i.e. as resulted from OBIA classification).The dbh was predicted based on ALS data by statistical Monte Carlo simulations and a linear regression model that relates field dbh for each tree species with their corresponding ALS-derived tree height and crown diameter. The overall RMSE for each of the tree species within all the plots was 5.8 cm for the Norway spruce trees, respectively 5.9 cm for the beech trees. The results indicate a higher individual tree detection rate and subsequently a more precise estimation of dendrometric parameters for Norway spruce compared to beech trees located in spruce-beech even-aged mixed stands. Further investigations are required, particularly in the case of choosing the best method for individual tree detection of beech trees located in temperate even-aged mixed stands.

AB  - It is well known that in order to study the shoreline evolution in an accurate way, successive time series of high-resolution images are needed. However, the availability of historical high-resolution data is limited to analogue air photos while the more recent high-resolution satellite images are quite expensive. Thus, many researchers have based their coastal evolution studies on low-resolution images like Sentinel and Landsat data. As a result, a main question is raised about the accuracy of the results of such studies.As the Landsat program has started in 1972, there is archival data spanning almost 50 years. This is a great tool for long-term shoreline change monitoring in researchers' hands. Another advantage of the specific data set is the existence of diverse multispectral bands and the opportunity to extract band ratios sensitive to existence or not of water. The biggest challenge for using this archive for shoreline monitoring is its limited spatial resolution (30m).In the current study, the accuracy of low-resolution satellite data such as Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat TM, ETM+ and 8 OLI for coastal monitoring is under control. Many low-resolution images were digitally processed, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as well as on-screen digitizing are used in order to automatically and manually separate the sea from the land respectively and extract the coastline in different periods. Then, the shoreline vectors derived from the Landsat and Sentinel-2 data were compared to the respective shorelines derived from high resolution satellite data such as Worldview-2 (0.5 m resolution) and orthomosaics created from digital airphotos with 1m spatial resolution. The study area is located in the Gulf of Patras in the North Peloponnese, Greece. The accuracy control covered three different periods from 1996 to 2018 and in every case, shorelines extracted from low resolution data sets were compared to shorelines created from high resolution data sets. Statistical analysis was performed, and the results are presented and discussed in the current paper.

AB  - Segmentation networks have proven to be popular tools for large scale pixel-wise remote sensing image classification as they can deal with wide spatial areas efficiently, as opposed to convolutional neural networks trained with pixel centered patches. However, they are often criticized in terms of spatial consistency. As such, they have received various extensions through the last few years, in the form of dilated convolutions and skip connections and more. In this paper, we address the same issue by feeding attribute filtered images, that contain inherently a multiscale hierarchical representation of the underlying image, as input to a segmentation network, in an effort to both accelerate convergence and render easier the feature learning task of the bottom layers. We validate our approach through the production of land-use and land-cover maps for a large area of Turkey using Sentinel 2 multispectral images and ground truth from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service.

TI  - Towards a Reconstruction of Enrique Dussel's Theological System
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to seeking the elements of a theological outlook from a set of writings of the Argentinean philosopher Enrique Dussel and reconstructing them into a complex system. The author questions whether it is relevant to believe that Dussel can be described as one of the founders of the liberation theology. Hence, the paper represents a brief analysis of the liberation theology and philosophy. Furthermore, the author overviews the literature referring to the topic and shows that Dussel's considerations on the theological questions have not been significantly covered in the academic milieu yet. Next, the author analyzes fundamental views of Enrique Dussel upon such aspects as christology, hamartiology, soteriology, eschatology, ecclesiology, maryology and describes his attitude towards such burning issues for the Latin American region as poverty, violence, guerrilla, etc. The research is based on the writings of Dussel which are compared with the general tendencies within the theology of liberation as well as a range of ideas of Karl Marx whose works had a profound impact on Dussel's worldview. The concluding part summarizes that Dussel can be called one of the most prominent representatives of the liberation theology. Nevertheless, the author presupposes that along with that Dussel contributed to making the realm of the liberation theology vaguer. The main direction of such erosion deals with shifting from challenge of poverty to the concern of discrimination in general which implies a wider understanding of who the oppressed are.

TI  - Gully Head-Cut Distribution Modeling Using Machine Learning Methods-A Case Study of NW Iran
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - To more effectively prevent and manage the scourge of gully erosion in arid and semi-arid regions, we present a novel-ensemble intelligence approach-bagging-based alternating decision-tree classifier (bagging-ADTree)-and use it to model a landscape's susceptibility to gully erosion based on 18 gully-erosion conditioning factors. The model's goodness-of-fit and prediction performance are compared to three other machine learning algorithms (single alternating decision tree, rotational-forest-based alternating decision tree (RF-ADTree), and benchmark logistic regression). To achieve this, a gully-erosion inventory was created for the study area, the Chah Mousi watershed, Iran by combining archival records containing reports of gully erosion, remotely sensed data from Google Earth, and geolocated sites of gully head-cuts gathered in a field survey. A total of 119 gully head-cuts were identified and mapped. To train the models' analysis and prediction capabilities, 83 head-cuts (70% of the total) and the corresponding measures of the conditioning factors were input into each model. The results from the models were validated using the data pertaining to the remaining 36 gully locations (30%). Next, the frequency ratio is used to identify which conditioning-factor classes have the strongest correlation with gully erosion. Using random-forest modeling, the relative importance of each of the conditioning factors was determined. Based on the random-forest results, the top eight factors in this study area are distance-to-road, drainage density, distance-to-stream, LU/LC, annual precipitation, topographic wetness index, NDVI, and elevation. Finally, based on goodness-of-fit and AUROC of the success rate curve (SRC) and prediction rate curve (PRC), the results indicate that the bagging-ADTree ensemble model had the best performance, with SRC (0.964) and PRC (0.978). RF-ADTree (SRC = 0.952 and PRC = 0.971), ADTree (SRC = 0.926 and PRC = 0.965), and LR (SRC = 0.867 and PRC = 0.870) were the subsequent best performers. The results also indicate that bagging and RF, as meta-classifiers, improved the performance of the ADTree model as a base classifier. The bagging-ADTree model's results indicate that 24.28% of the study area is classified as having high and very high susceptibility to gully erosion. The new ensemble model accurately identified the areas that are susceptible to gully erosion based on the past patterns of formation, but it also provides highly accurate predictions of future gully development. The novel ensemble method introduced in this research is recommended for use to evaluate the patterns of gullying in arid and semi-arid environments and can effectively identify the most salient conditioning factors that promote the development and expansion of gullies in erosion-susceptible environments.

AB  - Method for estimation of multiple reflection, scattering and absorption in mountainous areas of remote sensing satellite data is proposed. An experiment of TOA: Top of the Atmosphere radiance evaluation for miniature forest with slope grades, tree species, tree canopy shapes in modeled V-shape mountainous areas is conducted. Through experiments, it is found that the influences due to multiple reflection between two slope surfaces are quite significant; the maximum radiance rates are about 4% to 5%. It is also found that the multiple reflection can reveal important differences in clarifying radiative transfer process in atmosphere. The results are also simulated by means of Monte-Carlo based radiative transfer model with forestry surface model.

AB  - The article aims at revealing the specificity of linguistic interpretation of knowledge about the world in stative format. The material of our research is non-professional discourse which characterizes the state of regional economics. The starting point of the study based on the fundamentals of Cognitive Linguistics consists in ascribing the conceptual structure of REGIONAL ECONOMICS taking into consideration economic, social and environmental dimensions of its functioning. With the help of social poll method the representative linguistic data is collected and processed. Among the most influential findings there are, first, the interpretive nature of STATE OF REGIONAL ECONOMICS concept, and, second, its matrix structure. It is proved that linguistic interpretation of the concept under study is dependent on several factors, the most important of them are the region and its peculiarities and the interpreter with his/her sociocultural identity together with here-and-now situational specificity. Moreover, the deeper interpreter's knowledge about the world is, the more creative the level of linguistic interpretation of STATE OF REGIONAL ECONOMICS is fixed. The present study contributes not only to the problem of construing the world in language but reveals some dominant aspects of stative interpretation of knowledge about the world.

TI  - Deformation associated with sliver transport in Costa Rica: seismic and geodetic observations of the July 2016 Bijagua earthquake sequence
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Tectonic slivers form in the overriding plate in regions of oblique subduction. The inner boundaries of the sliver are often poorly defined and can consist of well-defined faults, rotating blocks or diffuse fault systems, which pass through or near the volcanic arc. The Guanacaste Volcanic Arc Sliver (GVAS) as defined by Montero et al., is a segment of the Central American Forearc Sliver, whose inner boundary is the similar to 87-km-long Haciendas-Chiripa fault system (HCFS), which is located similar to 10 km behind the volcanic arc and consists of strike slip faults and pull apart steps. We characterize the current ground motion on this boundary by combining earthquake locations and focal mechanisms of the 2016 Bijagua earthquake sequence, with the surface ground deformation obtained from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images from the ALOS-2 satellite. The coseismic stack of interferograms show similar to 6 cm of displacement towards the line of sight of the satellite between the Cano Negro fault and the Upala fault, indicating uplift or SE horizontal surface displacement. The largest recorded earthquake of the sequence was M-w 5.4, and the observed deformation is one of the smallest earthquakes yet detected by InSAR in the Central American region. Forward and inverse models show the surface deformation can be partially explained by slip on a single fault, but it can be better explained by slip along two faults linked at depth. The best-fitting model consists of 0.33 m of right lateral slip on the Cano Negro fault and 0.35 m of reverse slip on the Upala fault, forming a positive flower structure. As no reverse seismicity was recorded, we infer the slip on the Upala fault occurred aseismically. Observations of the Bijagua earthquake sequence suggests the forearc sliver boundary is a complex and diffuse fault system. There are localized zones of transpression and transtension and areas where there is no surface expression suggesting the fault system is not yet mature. Although aseismic slip is common on subduction interfaces and mature strike-slip faults, this is the first study to document aseismic slip on a continental tectonic sliver boundary fault.

AB  - We developed machine learning models to retrieve surface soil moisture (0-4 cm) from high resolution multispectral imagery, terrain attributes, and local climate covariates. Using a small unmanned aircraft system (UAS) equipped with a multispectral sensor we captured high resolution imagery in part to create a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) as well as quantify relative vegetation photosynthetic status. We tested four different machine learning algorithms. The boosted regression tree algorithm provided the best accuracy model with mean absolute error of 3.8 % volumetric water content. The most important variables for the prediction of soil moisture were precipitation, reflectance in the red wavelengths, potential evapotranspiration, and topographic position indices (TPI). Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of soil water status across heterogeneous terrain may be adequately described and predicted by UAS remote sensing data and machine learning. Our modeling approach and the variable importance and relationships we have assessed in this study should be useful for management and environmental modeling tasks where spatially explicit soil moisture information is important.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications in Urban Environments V held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The study of urban heat islands (UHI) is of great importance in the context of climate change (CC) and global warming. Cities accumulate heat in urban land covers as well as in built infrastructures, representing true islands of heat in relation to their rural (less artificialized) environment. The densest urban spaces as well as the industrial and commercial areas are characterized by accumulating more heat during the day. On the other hand, the areas of lower density, the Urban Sprawl, tend to have a better climatic behaviour. The lower density as well as the greater amount of vegetation in the Urban Sprawl areas reduce the UHI during daylight hours.Nevertheless, the literature on urban climate has highlighted the singular importance of the nighttime UHI. It is during the night that the effects of UHI become more apparent, due to the low cooling capacity of urban construction materials and is during nighttime that temperatures can cause higher health risks, leading to the aggravation of negative impacts on people's health and comfort in extreme events such as heat waves becoming more and more frequent and lasting longer. However, the study of nocturnal UHIs is still poorly developed, due to the structural problems regarding the availability of land surface and air temperature data for night time.This paper aims to develop a model for nocturnal UHI using data from Landsat thermal bands (with spatial resolution of 30 square meters per pixel) and contrasting Landsat's very limited nighttime images with daytime ones. The contrast allows the construction of "cooling" models of the LST based on geographical (longitude, latitude, distance to the sea, DTM, slope, orientation, etc.) and land covers characteristics (density, vegetation and building indexes, impervious surface, and others parameters). Said models will allow evaluating the nighttime LST of the different urban landscapes: historical centers, "ensanches", discontinuous urban fabrics (of different densities), scattered building areas and industrial and commercial areas, trying to clarify the nightly UHI of Urban Sprawl. The case study is the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (636 km2, 3 3 million inhabitants).

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications in Urban Environments V held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Nighttime light imagery of the earth are a useful way to study the urbanization process. Satellite nocturnal images have been used to identify metropolitan areas as well as urban growth. However, the study of the extent and internal structure of urban systems by nighttime lights has had a fundamental limitation to date: the low spatial resolution of satellite sensors. DMSP Operational Linescan System (OLS), with its 2.7 km/pixel footprint, and Suomi National Polar Partnership (SNPP) satellite, with the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor on board, with a spatial resolution of 742 m/pixel, still have considerable limitations for the in-depth study of the internal structure of urban systems. The launch of Luojia 1-01 in June 2018 has increased expectations. Its high-resolution nocturnal images (130 metres/pixel) allows a better in-depth study of the landscape impacted by the urbanization. Nevertheless, the areas resulting from urban sprawl process are characterized by weak night lighting, which makes identification extremely difficult. Breaking the rigid boundary that historically distinguished the urban from the rural, the topological inversion of the landscape produced by urban sprawl, makes difficult to identify the territories impacted by dispersed, fragmented and low density urbanization processes.The identification of the sprawled zones and their segmentation of the agricultural covers as well as the rest of the open spaces is especially complex, given the spatial resolution of Luojia 1-01. In this sense, the consideration of the NDVI, altitude, orientation, slope as well as the information provided by the thermal bands of Landsat8 can help to carry out a finer identification of the different urban landscapes, and specifically of the Urban Sprawl.The aim of this paper is to analyse the capacity of Luojia 1-01 to identify different types of urban landscapes, especially the results of the urban dispersion process known as Urban Sprawl. The case study is Barcelona Metropolitan Area (636 km(2) and 3.2 million inhabitants).

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The consumption of fast food and soft drinks is a risk factor for developing overweight and obesity. This study aimed at assessing if there is association between household socioeconomic level and the consumption of fast food and soft drinks among children.Material and Methods: A cross-sectional assessment of the data from the third round (2009-2010) of the youngest cohort of the Young Lives study in Peru was conducted. Sampling was conducted in three stages: in the first one, the country was divided into equal geographical regions, excluding the 5% of the richest district; in the second stage, 20 sentinel sites were chosen and an area within each sentinel site was selected. Finally, in the third stage, eligible children were selected. Outcomes were the self-reported consumption of fast food and soft drinks (never, sometimes, and always), whereas the exposure was household socioeconomic status (in quintiles). Crude and adjusted models were created between variables of interest using Poisson regression models, with robust variance, to report prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Results: Data of 1901 children, of which 942 (49.6%) were girls, with a mean age of 7.5 (SD: 0.5) was analyzed. A total of 24.1% (95%CI: 22.2%-26.1%) reported always consuming fast food, whilst this number was 22.4% (20.5%-24.3%) for soft drinks. Compared to the lowest socioeconomic quintile, those who were in higher socioeconomic status had more probability of consuming fast food and soft drinks (Chi-squared for trends <0.001). The highest socioeconomic quintile had a greater probability to always consume fast food (PR=1.42; 95%CI: 1.08-1.88) and soft drinks (PR=1.71; 95%CI: 1.24-2.37).Conclusions: This study shows that there is a significant association between the household socioeconomic level and the consumption of soft drinks and fast food.

TI  - Crop Classification Based on Temporal Signatures of Sentinel-1 Observations over Navarre Province, Spain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop classification provides relevant information for crop management, food security assurance and agricultural policy design. The availability of Sentinel-1 image time series, with a very short revisit time and high spatial resolution, has great potential for crop classification in regions with pervasive cloud cover. Dense image time series enable the implementation of supervised crop classification schemes based on the comparison of the time series of the element to classify with the temporal signatures of the considered crops. The main objective of this study is to investigate the performance of a supervised crop classification approach based on crop temporal signatures obtained from Sentinel-1 time series in a challenging case study with a large number of crops and a high heterogeneity in terms of agro-climatic conditions and field sizes. The case study considered a large dataset on the Spanish province of Navarre in the framework of the verification of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies. Navarre presents a large agro-climatic diversity with persistent cloud cover areas, and therefore, the technique was implemented both at the provincial and regional scale. In total, 14 crop classes were considered, including different winter crops, summer crops, permanent crops and fallow. Classification results varied depending on the set of input features considered, obtaining Overall Accuracies higher than 70% when the three (VH, VV and VH/VV) channels were used as the input. Crops exhibiting singularities in their temporal signatures were more easily identified, with barley, rice, corn and wheat achieving F1-scores above 75%. The size of fields severely affected classification performance, with similar to 14% better classification performance for larger fields (>1 ha) in comparison to smaller fields (<0.5 ha). Results improved when agro-climatic diversity was taken into account through regional stratification. It was observed that regions with a higher diversity of crop types, management techniques and a larger proportion of fallow fields obtained lower accuracies. The approach is simple and can be easily implemented operationally to aid CAP inspection procedures or for other purposes.

TI  - Lymphedema secondary to melanoma treatments: diagnosis, evaluation, and treatments
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH & MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Approximately 300,000 new cases of melanoma are annually diagnosed in the world. Advanced stage melanomas require sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), sometimes lymph node dissections (LND). The development rate of lower extremity lymphedema ranges from 7.6% to 35.1% after inguinal SLNB, and from 48.8% to 82.5% after inguinal LND. Development rate of upper extremity lymphedema ranges from 4.4% to 14.6% after axillary LND. Lymphedema management has constantly improved but effective evaluation and surgical management such as supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenular anastomosis (LVA) are becoming common as minimally invasive lymphatic surgery. Diagnosis and new classification using indocyanine green lymphography allowing pre-clinical secondary lymphedema stage management are improving effectiveness of supermicrosurgical LVA and vascularized lymph node transfer. Lymphatic transfer with lymph-interpositional-flap can restore lymph flow after large oncologic excision even without performing lymphatic anastomosis. Since lymphatic reconstructive surgery may affect local to systemic dissemination of remnant tumor cells, careful consideration is required to evaluate indication of surgical treatments.

AB  - The height of the earth's surface can be measured using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images using interferometry (InSAR). The InSAR method uses phase information to produce the height of the earth's surface. The accuracy of the DEM produced by InSAR depends on the shadow, the layover area, and the coherence of two SAR data. This paper proposes a technique for combining DEM derived from the InSAR method from ascending and descending paths using high resolution TerraSAR-X / TanDEM-X. Generating DEM was done by the InSAR method which covers the same test area and came from one pair of ascending TanDEM-X images and one descending pair of TerraSAR-X. The combination of the two DEMs from the ascending and descending path has been done by assessing the weighting factors so that the accuracy of the DEM can be increased. The weighting factors are calculated from the height error map, layover and shadow map. The height error map is calculated from the interferometric coherence with geometrical considerations and the layover and shadow map is calculated using TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X DEM. The images pairs with 33 angles and 37 degrees were used in this study for the InSAR method in urban areas (Jakarta city). The experimental results show a significant reduction in missing pixel counts due to layover, shadow and low coherences after combining.

TI  - Accurate Despeckling and Estimation of Polarimetric Features by Means of a Spatial Decorrelation of the Noise in Complex PolSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we extended a procedure for the spatial decorrelation of fully-developed speckle, originally developed for single-polarization SAR data, to fully-polarimetric SAR data. The spatial correlation of the noise depends on the tapering window in the Fourier domain used by the SAR processor to avoid defocusing of targets caused by Gibbs effects. Since each polarimetric channel is focused independently of the others, the noise-whitening procedure can be performed applying the decorrelation stage to each channel separately. Equivalently, the noise-whitening stage is applied to each element of the scattering matrix before any multilooking operation, either coherent or not, is performed. In order to evaluate the impact of a spatial decorrelation of the noise on the performance of polarimetric despeckling filters, we make use of simulated PolSAR data, having user-defined polarimetric features. We optionally introduce a spatial correlation of the noise in the simulated complex data by means of a 2D separable Hamming window in the Fourier domain. Then, we remove such a correlation by using the whitening procedure and compare the accuracy of both despeckling and polarimetric features estimation for the three following cases: uncorrelated, correlated, and decorrelated images. Simulation results showed a steady improvement of performance scores, most notably the equivalent number of looks (ENL), which increased after decorrelation and closely attained the value of the uncorrelated case. Besides ENL, the benefits of the noise decorrelation hold also for polarimetric features, whose estimation accuracy is diminished by the correlation. Also, the trends of simulations were confirmed by qualitative results of experiments carried out on a true Radarsat-2 image.

AB  - SAR remote sensing has been attractive as an efficient tool to monitor a vast expanse of the ocean due to its flexible operability with wide swath. In this context, many applications have been developed for ocean traffic monitoring based on conventional ship detection techniques. Nowadays, ScanSAR modes usually covers around 500 km of swath with coarse resolution more than 50 m which is hopeless to directly identify each detected ship. Because the swath width of ScanSAR modes is getting wider, it might be useful to know the distribution of ships as soon as possible. In this paper, an identification of a group of ships by ALOS-2 Scan-SAR data would be achieved by using various statistical indicators calculated from the images. The technique is applied to open water around Yamatotai in Japan Sea which is abundant for various fishes including squids and crabs. Each indicator is quantitatively justified.

AB  - The capability to perform Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) from SAR images has great importance for both civilian and military applications. However, this task becomes challenging when the quality and quantity of target information is not sufficient to reliably discriminate the targets. This is particularly important when dealing with marine targets, where features such as scattering intensities and shapes are common to many different targets. This paper investigates the possibility to enhance classification capabilities of marine targets in SAR images by exploiting the micro-motion information. This characterizing source of information, is extracted by applying Doppler sub-apertures and pixel tracking on SAR images containing the target of interest. The proposed approach is validated on real COSMO-SkyMed SAR data demonstrating the effectiveness to discriminate ships through their unique Doppler fingerprint.

TI  - Fire in the ecosystems of northern South America: advances in the ecology of tropical fires in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru
T2  - CALDASIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Tropical ecosystems harbor a large part of the world's biodiversity, yet they are being transformed at unprecedented rates by changes in land use. In Latin America, land cover conversion, and pastures and agricultural areas maintenance are strongly related with the use of fire. The source of fire and its causes are numerous and in the region there is an evident direct and indirect association with human activities. South America has been increasingly affected by fire occurrence; with fire events every year since 2001. The impacts of fires on natural ecosystems are multiple and vary in magnitude but little progress has been made to assess their extent. This article presents a review of current knowledge on tropical fire ecology in three Andean countries of northern South America, it provides an insight on the spatial and temporal patterns of fire, the effects over the ecosystems and post-fire dynamics. Large knowledge gaps about the fire ecology on several ecosystems in this region are evident.

TI  - Alterations in the Seco river bed and losses of agricultural land,province of Tucuman, Argentina
T2  - BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD GEOLOGICA MEXICANA
M3  - Article
AB  - The province of Tucuman, Argentina has a dense fluvial network, with rivers that have shown, over the last 45 years, complex and dynamic behaviors, as a result of high streamflows. In the upper basins, located in the mountainous zone and piedmont, diverse anthropic activities developed in contrasted reliefs and erosive slopes. The increase in rainfall recorded in the region since 1970 has increased both the erosive and depositional processes in the alluvial plain by modifying the design of the channels, with important consequences on the farmlands. In this paper, the Seco river bed is analyzed thoroughly. The Seco river is born on the eastern slope of the Aconquija mountains, runs through the piedmont and the alluvial plain in a west-east direction, and finally discharges into the Sali river, the main river bed of the fluvial network of the province. The main objective of this work is an analysis of meander morphology along 6.28 km of the Seco river for the period 1972 to 2017. The main parameters analyzed were the sinuosity of the channel, and meander cuts by overflow (chute cutoff) and by tangency (neck cutoff). These processes have accelerated the loss of agricultural land by lateral erosion on the river ravines, which are composed of fluvial-alluvial sediments, the parental materials of the productive soils of alluvial plains. To begin our study, the general characteristics of the Seco river basin have been considered, including geology, geomorphology, climate, soils, and anthropic activities. In addition, specific features of the sub-basin that contributes its waters to the meander section were also taken into account: the increase of the flows due to the change toward the use of surrounding soils, the slopes of the field, the geomorphological region and morphometry. Landsat and Sentinel satellite images, as well as the SRTM Digital Elevation Model (DEM), were used for mapping the channel and crops. The resulting maps are basin and sub-basin watershed contribution to the meanders, slopes, elevation curves, and drainage network. The results show that the sinuosity of the channel increased in the period 1972-2002, had a notable decrease in the period 2002-2011 due to the processes of meander cuts, and increased again in the period 2011-2017, together with the migration of the channel towards the southern quadrant. These changes resulted in the loss of 370.68 ha of productive soils, which represents 7.41 hm(3) of sediments removed and transported by the current. The meanders of the Seco river reflect the degradation of its area of contribution, representing the situation of the basins of the Argentine Northwest, in which the increase in the intensity and frequency of the precipitations since 1970 have generated critical conditions, whose effects are more evident in low areas.

TI  - Representation of a Social Group in the Cult of the Saint
T2  - ISTORIYA-ELEKTRONNYI NAUCHNO-OBRAZOVATELNYI ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The representation of the social groups as a product of their worldview finds expression in the institutions, values, norms and strategies of symbolic behavior, for example, in the cult of the saint patron, as his image transmits the ideal collective portrait of a group. The cult of St. Ragnebert (7th century) - laity aristocrat - is very unusual for the early Middle Ages. It is the first known example in history, when a social group creates a cult of "his own" Saint. This group was the Burgundian aristocracy party (optimates) which was in opposition to the royal court in Neustria in the years 660-680 and defended its "old rights" (i. e. "Burgundian particularism"). The Duke of Burgundy' son, Ragnebert, executed by order of the maior domus Ebroyn, was the victim of this political struggle. Since his death was treated as innocent, he received a halo of the Martyr and was canonized on the initiative of the Metropolitan of Lyon, one of the opposition's leaders. That was a specific show of the political will. So the "Burgundian frond" received from her ranks a true Saint, whose image was recorded, legitimized and promoted the group identity, class values and political goals.

TI  - Regional Features of the Temperature Field Synoptic Variability on the Black Sea Surface from Satellite Data
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The aim of the work is to clarify the regional features of synoptic variability of the Black Sea surface temperature, to reveal its intra- and inter-annual changes and to assess the features' relations with the large-scale atmospheric processes.Methods and Results. The satellite-derived data on the sea surface temperature in 1982-2018 from the Copernicus array were used; their temporal resolution was daily average and the spatial one - 0.04 degrees. These data showed that the maximum of temperature synoptic variability was observed in the coastal part of the northwestern shelf from the Dnieper-Bug estuary to the Danube delta, in the Karkinit Bay and in the Kerch Strait. In the deep sea, strong synoptic variability can be observed in the regions of the Eastern cyclonic gyre and the Batumi anticyclone. The greatest contribution of synoptic variability to the total temperature dispersion was observed in the Kerch Strait and to the south of the Kerch Peninsula. The level of multi-year average synoptic variability is lower or comparable with the level of the interannual variability in most of the water area, except for the Kerch Strait, the northwestern and the Bosporus shelves. It is revealed that in the climatic annual cycle the main maximum of synoptic variability is observed in May, a month before the maximum rate of surface water heating is achieved, the second maximum - in October, a month before the maximum rate of water cooling. The minimums are observed in February-March, during the period of maximum cooling of surface waters, and in August, during their maximum heating. Noticeable interannual changes of the level of temperature synoptic variability varying from -0.3 degrees C . to 0.3 degrees C, were revealed.Conclusions. Synoptic variability of the Black Sea surface temperature is characterized by noticeable intra-annual and interannual variations. Its climatic annual cycle is of a semi-annual periodicity due to the processes of water cooling and heating. The maximum increase of the synoptic variability level on the interannual scale is observed after 2003 on the northwestern shelf. Significant correlation with the indices of the North Atlantic, East Atlantic and the East Atlantic-West Russia oscillations was not revealed.

TI  - PERCOLATION MODEL TO CONTROL THE DISTRIBUTION OF FOREST INFECTIONS ON IMAGES FROM SPACE VEHICLES
T2  - SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-KOSMICNA NAUKA I TEHNOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - For Ukraine and many European countries, it is relevant to protect pine forests from catastrophic drying and the death, the danger, which has emerged in recent years as a result of their infection with stem pests, bark beetles (Ips acuminatus, Ips sexdentatus). Research results of various levels are used to find the proper solution, including remote sensing from a spacecraft. Traditional methods of control from the space images allow us to describe the intensity of infection in a single way, namely, to estimate the area of infection clusters from remote sensing data with a sufficiently high spatial resolution. The result of measuring the infected areas significantly depends on the shooting scale, because the infection field is not smooth. The high cost of obtaining the high-precision data hinders significantly the application of space information technology to control the spread of infection. In the case of a scale-invariant distribution of infected clusters, statistical methods and methods of percolation theory can give much more information about the nature of the infection.The list of tasks discussed in this article includes the use of scale-invariant indicators. Such indicators make it possible to determine the intensity of infection from satellite images of medium spatial resolution, which makes a significant contribution to the increase in the economic efficiency of the application of space information technology. The methods of control and analysis of forest infection are considered. They are based on the physical and mathematical theory of percolation, which deals with the distribution of fluid (pests) in heterogeneous environments. The methods of processing and interpretation of space information proposed in the article allow us to draw some important conclusions and, on their basis, to obtain sound recommendations aimed at improving the effectiveness of forest pest control. In conclusion, this approach is illustrated by numerical experiments with real images and validation results of a percolation model of the spread of forest infections.

TI  - RS-based regional crop identification and mapping: A case study of Barwala sub-branch of Western Yamuna Canal in Haryana (India)
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on spatial land use is the main input in strategic and tactical plan-making by all agricultural participants in countries like India with agriculture at the mainstay of the economy. In addition, accurately evaluation of the management of crops in a spatio-temporal context, information on cropping systems is also required, but such information on a regional scale are scarcely available. The spectrum of multiannual patterns of land use on cultivable land, however, remains unknown. The paper thus focuses on the mapping of the cropping systems that are actually practiced in Hisar District of Haryana (India). The objective of this research was to use satellite data and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques to identify the cropping pattern of Barwala sub-branch of Sirsa branch of the Western Yamuna Canal in Haryana. To identify classes of interest, handheld GPS was used to collect ground-truth information. Mask of mixed classes was developed to reclassify an image under the mask. Moreover, appropriate classification of images and application of logical combinations helped in generating cropping pattern maps and statistics. Results revealed that major crops identified in the study area were cotton, rice and pearl-millet in Kharif season, which accounts for about 70% of total cultivated area. In the case of Rabi season, wheat and mustard were observed as the major crops covering approximately 57% of total area. RS technology is currently capable of providing cropping pattern with 90% accuracy. The results of the current study could be useful in the land use and efficient water management in the canal command areas in the water-scarce southern Haryana, India. Some crops like guar, pearl-millet, horticultural crops, etc. were also identified during this period but the major crops that were identified during Kharif season were Rice and Cotton.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Estimation of Mandya district using LANDSAT-8 data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on the estimation of LST over Mandya district (120 degrees 31'N, 760 degrees 53'E), which is a part of the Cauvery river basin in Karnataka, India, using LANDSAT-8 satellite data for 12 meteorological stations. Landsat 8 data is used for experimentation during 21st Jan 2018 and 6th Feb 2018 for LST analysis of identified area. More than half of the land area in the Mandya district is under agricultural use. Fluctuations in LST affects the quality of agricultural production. As a result, proper estimation of LST is very much required for the management of crop growth, development, and yield component. Spectral radiance from band 10 and emissivity of thermal infrared bands was used as input for LST estimation. Surface emissivity was obtained with the help of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Albedo in the Mandya region. ERDAS IMAGINE and ArcGIS software were used for modeling. The obtained data compared with weather station data collected by KSNDMC (Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre). For this analysis, we considered two sets of data taken on different dates during the said period. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient are used as statistical criteria for evaluating the model efficiency. From the comparison, it is found that RMSE and R for the first date are 0.94 degrees C, 0.62, and for the second date, it is 1.26 degrees C, 0.88, respectively. It is observed that LST and weather data do follow the same pattern for the selected 12 meteorological stations.

AB  - The construction of hydropower dams is seen by many countries as developmental projects aimed at improving economic opportunities. However, global issues on environmental awareness have increased attention on the impacts of dams on communities, and as such fresh attention to the downstream dam impacts is overdue and urgently needed. Against this background, hydropower dam projects are gradually seen emerging in Ghana as by their contribution constitutes a key source of energy for the country. The Bui dam, however, was commissioned and fully operational since early 2013 on the Black Volta Basin at the Bui Gorge. The prime objective of this study adopts an integrated approach of remotely sensed data techniques with socioeconomic data in examining the spatial and socioeconomic impacts of Bui dam on downstream communities. Satellite imageries of Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) were used to evaluate the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) dynamics for the periods 2001, 2008, and 2017 over the study area. Five (5) LULC types were delineated from the classified output maps, viz Forest deciduous, Pasturelands, Bare land, Waterbodies, and Farmlands & Settlements. The results of the LULC dynamics from 2001 to 2017 show that there is a continuous and fast pace depletion of Forest deciduous, Bare lands, and Pasturelands LULC types at a rate of 0.60%/year, 0.50%/year, and 1.84%/year, respectively. On the other hand, increasing rates are observed for Farmlands & Settlements, and Waterbodies land use types at a rate of 4.81%/year and 2.21%/year, respectively, over the same observation periods. The overall accuracies are 93.45, 74.47, and 72.84% for 2017, 2008, and 2001 observation periods, respectively. The spatial area and dimension of reservoir formed is approximately 366.95 km at a spatial elevation of 176 m. Also, informal information solicited from questionnaires were conducted. The results showed that Bui dam has both positive and negative impacts in the area and tends to be selective both spatially and socially. However, based on the views of the respondents and field observations suggest that the adverse effects of the dam are far more common and usually outweigh the benefits to the downstream inhabitants. Socioeconomic lives of the people have worsened than when the dam was newly constructed. Feasible suggestions, however, have been spelt out from the research that could substantially alleviate these impacts.

AB  - Immense growth is witnessed in the application of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for precision agriculture in recent years. Though UAS can provide precise high spatial resolution data, large aerial coverage is still practically not feasible due to limited battery, flight time and large size of the data. Contrarily, satellite images cover larger area but provide coarser spatial resolution data compared to UAS imagery. The objective of this research was to combine UAS's ability to provide precise high spatial resolution data with the vast areal coverage provided by satellite data to estimate canopy parameters. Experimental field was divided into 10m x 10m grids to match Sentinel-2 pixel size. High resolution UAS data was collected covering the entire experimental field over which grid-wise canopy parameters were computed such as canopy height and canopy volume. Using artificial neural networks (ANN) based regression model, a relationship was developed between Sentinel-2 pixel values and UAS based canopy parameters with R-2 greater than 0.9. ANN model results were also compared with support vector machine (SVM) regression model results.

TI  - QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF FOREST ECOSYSTEM STRESS CAUSED BY CEMENT PLANT POLLUTION USING IN SITU MEASUREMENTS AND SENTINEL-2 SATELLITE DATA IN A PART OF THE UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic industrial dust decreases productivity and slows down the growth of plants. Quantifying the effects of industrial dust on vegetation and determining the distance over which factories scatter dust are of paramount importance for biodiversity conservation and sustaining ecosystem services. This study aims at quantifying the effect of dust emitted by the Neka cement plant (NCP), Mazandaran province, northern Iran, on the surrounding Hyrcanian forests based on an analysis of the Leaf Area Index (LAI) retrieved from Sentinel-2 imagery. An Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) was used to quantify the concentrations of cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), silicon (Si) and zinc (Zn) in leaves of the dominant Chestnut-leaved Oak (Quercus castaneifolia). A feed-forward neural network algorithm and field measurements were used to retrieve the leaf area index (LAI) from Sentinel-2 data with a RMSE of 0.42 (m(2)/m(2)). MODIS-NDVI and EVI time series spanning 17 years (2000 to 2017) were analysed to ensure the independence of the variation in the condition of the vegetation from drought or other environmental factors. The results indicate that Sentinel-2 data can be used to map degradation due to pollution from the cement plant and quantify the effect of the dust spatially. Dust from the cement plant (dust source) was carried approximately 4700 meters in the direction of the prevailing wind. A significant correlation of 0.849 was recorded between LAI and distance from the NCP. It is concluded that dust from the NCP had adverse ecological effects on the neighbouring forest ecosystems recently designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

AB  - The accuracy of four global digital elevation models (GDEMs) was assessed at five key sites in the European part of Russia. Errors observed in the morphometric parameters were analyzed by comparing GDEMs representing the relief of the selected area with more accurate data (1:10 000 maps) and the remote sensing data. The values and lengths of the slopes were used as the statistical indicators to estimate the accuracy of the models. The results of the comparison show that the slope models SRTM C-SIR and AW3D30 are more consistent with the verification model, while the model of slope lengths ASTER GDEM v.2 is the most accurate one.

AB  - Pakistan is a major tea consumer country and ranked as one of the largest importer of tea worldwide. This research has been conducted over district Mansehra and district Abbottabad in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan where the most favourable conditions for tea cultivation already exist and National Tea Research Institute has done successful experiments to cultivate high quality tea. High tech approach is adopted to meet the objectives of this research by using the remotely sensed data i.e. Aster DEM, Land sat8 Imagery. Results showed that in study area 13.24% (778.3 sq.km.) is highly suitable, 33.44% (1966 sq.km.) is suitable, 30.71% area (1805 sq.km.) is moderately suitable, 16.13% area (948.5 sq.km.) is less suitable, and 6.46% (379.3 sq.km.) is not suitable for tea cultivation. This geomatics based model and approach could be used to identify more areas for tea cultivation to meet country's demand.

AB  - Over recent years, rapid environmental changes in the Arctic and subarctic regions have caused significant alterations in the ecosystem structure and seasonality, including the primary productivity of the Barents Sea. This work aims at improving methodology for studying these features, by estimating chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations in the transitional Barents Sea by remotely sensing its optical properties, in order to better understand the large-scale algal bloom dynamics in the region. The in-situ measurements of chl-a are collected from the year 2016 to 2018 over a wide area of the Barents Sea to cover the spatial and temporal variations in chl-a concentration. Optical images of the Barents Sea are captured by the Multi-Spectral Imager Instrument on Sentinel-2. Using these remotely sensed optical images and the in-situ measurements, we propose a match-up dataset creation method based on the distribution of the remotely sensed reflectance spectra. Different Machine Learning (ML) techniques are assessed to estimate concentration of chl-a using the match-up dataset. Most of these techniques have not been investigated before in the subarctic region such as the Barents Sea. The Ocean Color Net (OCN) regression model proposed in this study has outperformed other ML-based techniques including Support Vector Regression, Gaussian Process Regression, and the globally trained Case-2 Regional/Coast Colour (C2RCC) processing chain model C2RCC-Nets, as well as empirical methods based on spectral band ratios. A wide range of experiments has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed OCN for ocean color remote sensing in the subarctic region. The performance of the OCN is also presented spatially by computing chl-a maps in the Barents Sea.

AB  - Image fusion is a technique that integrates complementary information from multiple remote sensing images such that the fused image is more suitable for processing task and information extraction. Passive sensors are capable of sensing the reflected electromagnetic energy in the visible and infrared region while active sensors provide additional information using microwave region. This broad spectrum provides more information of earth surface as compared to optical data alone. This study compares the land cover classification results of optical imagery (Landsat-8) and fused imagery (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 VV polarized data). The image fusion was then performed using wavelet transformation technique. The data were classified into four classes namely water bodies, built-up area, vegetation cover, and barren land. Google Earth and Landsat imagery were used as a reference image for accuracy assessment. The fused image showed higher accuracy than optical image i.e. Kappa coefficient increased from 0.78 to 0.9 and overall accuracy increased from 89.4% to 92.7%. This study indicates that multi-source information i.e., image fusion can significantly improve the interpretation and accuracy of classification

AB  - The satellite-based Land Surface Temperature (LST) and its anomaly values were observed in the geothermal area of Dieng Volcanic Complex (DVC). Landsat-8 and ASTER product on surface kinetic temperature (AST-08) were selected, based on its spectral and spatial resolution characteristics, as well as its retrieval methods applied for the LST extraction. Statistical analysis was performed on the pixel-integrated temperatures to cross-compare both of the remote sensing-based LST. Thermal Infrared (TIR)-based LST was also correlated with the LST reference from a field measurement. Correlation between the field measurement and satellite-based LST was considered insignificantly weak; while correlation between the satellite-based LST (Landsat-8 with SW and ASTER-based with TES) was significantly strong. The LST registration approaches cause difference on correlation strength. Field-based LST directly measured the ground kinetic temperature of sample points with infrared thermometer; while satellite-based LST sensed the thermal radiation emitted by the represented objects in a pixel area that possibly mixed the LST values. The clusters in response to geothermal features reflected bias result; as the thermal anomalies were less pronounced, observed from both of the satellitebased LST estimation.

AB  - The amount of land built has increased over the years as the population increases. This results in a higher building density, such as in Turikale District, Maros Regency. Each object on the earth's surface has its distinctive temperature, such as the buildings. The heat of the earth's surface on certain location points will be captured by the image as an area that has a different surface temperature. The purpose of this study is to determine the temporal-spatial pattern of building density and surface temperature in Turikale Subdistrict, Maros Regency in 2013 and 2018 and is expected to be useful for Turikale District spatial planning and urban environment. Building density data and surface temperature are obtained from Landsat 8 Path 114 row 063 in 2018 and 2013. The data is processed using the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) algorithm and Land Surface Temperature (LST) using ArcGIS. Furthermore, an analysis of differences in building density patterns with land surface temperature is analyzed spatially and temporally. The results of the study show that the spatial pattern of building density grows to be higher in density each year, especially in densely populated residential areas and near Jalan Daya-Maros, Turikale District. Temporal patterns of land surface temperatures show significant increases between 2013 and 2018.

AB  - The main objective of this research is monitoring of landslide areas by integrating results from interferometric images, and GNSS data from permanent and local geodetic networks. This study is providing reliable information with regard to the hazard geo-processes taking place in the region of the landslide area Thracian Rocks. To accomplish the aforesaid the first step was to create a local archive of about 400 SLC images from ESA operated mission Sentinel-1 starting from the beginning of 2015. In this archive data from ascending and descending satellite orbits were included in order to increase the reliability of the information derived from SAR data. Due to considerable occurrence of vegetation in the studied area, which is recognized as one of the factors increasing the decorrelation during DInSAR processing, the authors processed mainly scenes with minimum availability of leaves on the trees and shrubs - autumn and spring. The geological setting of the landslide region reveals a narrow strip formed by old landslides that have an average width of 400-500 m and steep slopes of 40-50 m at certain locations. From this setting it was established that the landslide bodies have been formed by 3-4 visible linearly oriented steps and landslide packages with different heights creating negative ground forms with permanent or temporary swamps. Besides the ancient landslides a recent active local landslide processes occur forming recent landslides. In the framework of this study a control geodynamic network covering the landslide area located in the surroundings of Thracian Cliffs golf club was established. In it included are 10 points stabilized with metal pipes which are used to monitor deformations in this area. An advantage of the approach should be pointed out the possibility to map areas that are inaccessible by other means.

AB  - The territorial distribution of landslides along the Northern Bulgarian Black Sea coast has been evaluated by analyzing the results of field surveys for 2018 and 2019 based on geological surveys and processing of interferometric images from synthesized aperture radars (SAR). A local image archive of Sentinel-1A / B was created for the period 2015 - 2019 for this region and interferograms were produced every 4 months, 8 months, 1 year and in case of registering an event, led to the activation of landslide processes. A raster map of the concentration of deformations of the Earth's crust was created based on data from the obtained interferograms. Areas with active landslide movements along the Northern Bulgarian Black Sea coast have been identified for monitoring with the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). A geodynamic network of 30 points covering the landslide circus "Dalgiya Yar" and landslide "Thracian Cliffs" was established and the first measurement cycle was carried out.

T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming is affecting terrestrial ecosystems in the Canadian Arctic, potentially altering the carbon balance of the landscape and contributing additional CO(2)to the atmosphere. High spatial resolution remote sensing data can enhance models of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and its component fluxes, gross ecosystem exchange (GEE), and ecosystem respiration (ER) by quantifying vegetation structure and function over time. In this study, we explored the variability of daytime CO(2)exchange rates for three vegetation types along a natural moisture gradient at ecologically distinct mid- and high Arctic sites. We demonstrated that for the two sites studied, there was no statistically significant variation in CO(2)exchange rates for the vegetation types through the peak growing season. Hence, the capacity to model these rates with a limited number of satellite data acquisitions is feasible. Simple bivariate models relating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to CO(2)exchange processes (GEE, ER, and NEE) were developed independent of vegetation type and geographic location and validated using independent data. The spectral models explain between 33 and 94 percent of the variation in CO(2)exchange rates at each site, indicating a high level of functional convergence in ecosystem-level structure and function within Arctic landscapes.

Among them, is the detection of changes on image time series, and in particular, the estimation of levels and superficies of changes. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised framework to detect generic but relevant and reliable changes using pairs of Sentinel-2 images. To illustrate this method, we will present a scenario focusing on the detection of changes in vineyards due to natural hazards such as frost and hail.

T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The questions of the invariant semantics of the symbol and its actualization in the texts of Russian rock poetry are considered. Attention is paid to the studies of the symbol, concept and image of the star in Russian poetry and rock poetry. The author notes that these studies do not present the correlation of individually authored imaginative worldview with the worldview of the subculture reflected in the text. A review of the work of linguistic poetics and anthropocentric linguistics is performed. The definitions of a symbol within the framework of these paradigms are given. It is concluded that the understanding of a symbol as a carrier of the worldview of culture changes the idea of the connection between the signifier and the signified and the "reference point" of the aesthetic. The author proceeds from the fact that the aesthetic image is built on the basis of the invariant semantics of a symbol in the language of subculture. The results of a comparative analysis of the symbolic semantics of the star nomination in the language of Russian rock poetry and other subsystems of the Russian national language, including aesthetically oriented ones, are presented. It is shown that the invariant semantics of the STAR symbol, relevant for Russian rock poetry, lies at the heart of the star's images, which are identical, connected and contrasted with the author's image. It is proved that the actualization of the semantics of the STAR symbol does not depend on the specific author and the text of Russian rock poetry, reproduces general ideas about the world.

These include the choice of a source text, the nature of the language used in the translation, and the treatment of the most distinctive features of the text, including its focus on Rawana, its setting in a Muslim narrative frame, and its use of the worldview of a medieval Malay court. Linguistic issues are discussed through reference to the concept of "units of translation". This practice can also be utilized in an expanded sense to refer to larger textual units such as sentences, paragraphs, chapters, and parts of the whole text. Finally, a few recurring stylistic issues are noted, such as the use of a repetitive vocabulary, the use of kinship terms for non-kin, and a small number of places where there are no adequate English equivalents for particular words. The article concludes by suggesting that the approaches of the philologist and the literary translator are sometimes antagonistic but can be mutually beneficial.

AB  - Productivity of maize (Zea mays L.) is strongly regulated by the availability of water. There are critical stages of crop development, in which water deficit could have a detrimental effect on crop functioning and yield. Facing the challenges related to climate changes and rapidly depleting water resources, it is of utmost importance for agriculture, biologically optimal water status of different crops, at different stages of ontogeny to be determined. In order to achieve this aim, it is necessary a continuous monitoring of crops and assessment of their functioning during each of the growth stages and in different environmental conditions to be conducted. Remote sensing (RS) methods enable valuable information about crop functioning to be obtained. In the present study remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices and orthogonalization of multispectral satellite data are used, in order changes related to phenological dynamics and biomass accumulation to be studied. The suggested methodology facilitates identification of the timing of phenological transitions that are related to maize physiological development. The research evaluates the dynamics of maize phenological development in the environmental conditions of growing season 2019, using multispectral imagery, acquired by Sentinel-2 sensor of the European Space Agency Program for Earth Observation "Copernicus" and daily measured field climatic data.

AB  - This article presents a novel methodology for monitoring and assessment of dynamics of phenological development of crop vegetation, based on orthogonal transformation of multispectral satellite images from Sentinel-2. In this work two indices using the Greenness and Wetness components of the Tasselled Cap Transformation (TCT) model are applied. The essence of the TCT model is the unitary matrix for orthogonal transformation, which is fixed for each individual sensor. The presented methodology implements a model for automated processing of Sentinel-2 images, aimed at obtaining Greenness and Wetness Tasselled Cap indices. The applied indices are defined as Normalized Differential Greenness Index (NDGI) and Normalized Differential Wetness Index (NDWNI). These indices are strongly sensitive to small changes and reflect quantitatively the vegetation dynamics in defined temporal periods. NDGI and NDWNI are especially suitable for determination of timing of different growth stages and for monitoring of the health status of the studied crops during these stages. The manifestation of the indices and their dynamics is closely related to variations of chlorophyll and moisture content, which are observed during the transition from one stage to another.

TI  - Assessing sociodemographic differences in human papillomavirus vaccine impact studies in the United States: a systematic review using narrative synthesis
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: Sociodemographic disparities in the incidence and mortality of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated conditions have been well documented in the pre-HPV vaccine era. It is still unknown if the introduction of routine vaccination has been effective in reducing these prevaccine era inequalities. The purpose of this review was to determine the utilization of sociodemographic variables to assess for disparities in population-level HPV vaccine impact research and to evaluate the current evidence for disparities in the reduction of HPV-associated conditions after vaccine introduction in the United States (US).Study design: A systematic review of the literature from January 2007 through March 2018 was carried out to identify studies evaluating the impact HPV vaccines have had on the rates of HPV infection, genital warts, and cervical dysplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 1+) in the US. An in-depth review was then performed to synthesize these data and to assess the way prior studies have reported and evaluated for potential disparities in the vaccine's impact within various racial, ethnic, and/or socio-economic subgroups of the population.Methods: Vaccine impact studies measure the change in the population-level burden of disease prelicensure versus postlicensure of the vaccine. We systematically searched PubMed/Medline and Embase, combining search terms related to the HPV vaccine, sentinel surveillance, and HPV-associated conditions. Eligible studies were those with population-level, postvaccine introduction data that were conducted in the US. Finally, a cited reference search was conducted for all included articles using the Web of Science platform that accesses three major citation indexes: Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, and Arts and Humanities Citation Index. This allowed us to screen not only the articles that were cited by our final collection of studies but also the articles that used our selected studies as one of their references. The study protocol is registered in PROSPERO (#CRD42018107579).Results: Overall, 23 of the 4139 references retrieved assessed the population-level impact of HPV vaccines between January 1, 2007, and March 29, 2018. Among these, 13 (57%) reported sociodemographic data. Only two articles reported stratified results by sociodemographic factors, thereby allowing assessment for potential disparate impact. One of these studies described differences in the impact of the vaccine by race, ethnicity, and income.Conclusion: Although approximately half of the studies that assessed the impact of the HPV vaccine measured sociodemographic characteristics, few presented results in a way that allowed for the identification of potential differences in impact between the relevant subgroups of the population. Determining to what extent, if any, vaccines are reducing known sociodemographic disparities is an important public health priority and an essential step in developing immunization strategies that are beneficial for all.

AB  - This work presents an easy method for barchan dunes automatic extraction from multispectral satellite data. The proposed method based on unsupervised classifications of commonly used bands for sand dunes mapping in literature. First, the collected data were atmospherically and spatially enhanced. Moreover, each selected band (band ratio or redness index or crust index) were filtered using low-pass (3x3) filter and transformed with original image (non-filtered) by using principal component analysis (PCA). Additionally, the classifications were achieved for each selected band by using three different algorithms (K-means, Expectation Maximization (EM), and IsoData) after data transformation. Eventually, the obtained maps were segmented and compared with natural colour image. The results indicate that unsupervised classification of crust index selected band, which achieved by IsoData algorithm, presents high performance for barchan dunes detection.

AB  - The proliferation of multi-temporal remote sensing imagery, especially through Sentinel 2 satellites, has reinforced efforts towards the processing of multi-spectral and multi-temporal images. In this paper, we present the results of our study on the production of land cover/land use of the Sakarya basin, employing CORINE ground truths. The main contribution of our study is the exploitation of the temporal dimension through 3 dimensional convolutional neural networks, motivated by their capacity to process data across the temporal dimension of the input patch cube. Our experiments spanning 26 classes at a region-wide scale, show that 3D convolutional neural networks possess a strong potential in this regard.

T2  - 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES AND APPLICATIONS TO AIR QUALITY
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th International Conference on Atmospheric Sciences and Applications to Air Quality (ASSAQ)
CL  - Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA
AB  - Land-use and land-cover ( LULC) change has significant effect on local climate variables such as temperature and rainfall as it alters the energy budget, water budget and atmospheric variables. Past studies have shown urban areas can result in high temperature and alter rainfall amounts and intensity. This study therefore looks at spatio-temporal change in land-use/land-cover, and trends in precipitation and temperature for the Klang river basin. The aim of the study is to determine the effects of these changes in land-use on precipitation and temperature trends. Precipitation data was tested using the Mann-Kendall statistics test. Precipitation amount and two precipitation indices (simple day intensity index (SDII) and R95p) for the full year period and both the monsoons and inter-monsoon periods are tested. For temperature, land surface temperature maps of the study area for the years 1999, 2006 and 2017 was created from the thermal band of the images. Remote sensing is used for modelling spatio-temporal changes in LULC of Klang river basin using multi-temporal LandSat dataset (1999, 2006, and 2017). The LULC modelling shows an increase in urban area of 51.5% from 1999-2017, and decrease in natural vegetation 17.6% and cultivated land 35%. The results of precipitation analysis show a mixture of both positive (increasing) and negative (decreasing) trends for stations in the study area, and for temperature there is an increase of 10.1 degrees C in maximum temperature from 1999-2017. The correlation test shows a positive correlation between precipitation and temperature, but the relationship is not significant. The LULC change has significant impact on temperature; however, the increasing temperature has an insignificant positive correlation with rainfall. This could indicate that the change in rainfall is mostly due to other factors.

AB  - The focus of this presentation is on various Electro-Optical and Infrared (EO/IR) noises and Quality Hindrances (QHs) that impact the detection of a slow-moving spatially-unresolved object captured by EO/IR sensor system. We have reserved the term, noises to mean degradation factors due to EO/IR system and QHs to mean degradations due to environmental factors outside EO/IR such as clouds, fixed pattern noise (FPN), etc. The goal is to apply various noises/QHs to a slow-moving spatially-unresolved object and measure/report the degree to which detection of the object is hindered. The measuring is accomplished through statistical methods. The data representative of images containing the object and various noises/QHs are generated with a simulated software that emulates Landsat8 EO/IR sensor system with the atmospheric conditions where a dim (low SNR) and spatially unresolved object moves in wide field of view (WFOV). The object detection and the accuracy prediction model is accomplished using a U-Net neural networks. The current work is the continuation of a previously published work that has used the same neural networks architecture with a relatively high accuracy albeit without considering noise/QHs. The intent of the spiral-up compendium works is to outline a sensitivity (robustness) analysis and their limits thereof.

AB  - The change in the water surface area is essential to be studied as it can affect ecosystem health and function of lakes to meet human needs. The use of remote sensing techniques is to analyze such changes in the Lake Toba is considered effective and efficient ways in terms of time and cost, moreover the application of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as an internet-based data processing platform (cloud computing) that provides various kinds of free satellite image data can simplify the process. In this study, the author aims to estimate the rate of change in the surface water area of Lake Toba in four periods, that are the period of 1990 - 1997, 1998 - 2004, 2005 - 2012, and 2013 - 2018, by using Landsat 5 TM and 8 OLI/TIRS imagery. Cloud masking methods is used to obtain cloud-free images and then using CART method in making land cover maps. After that, calculating the accuracy of CART method by using the confusion matrix to determine the Cohen's Kappa coefficient value. The results of this study show that the highest lake surface water area is in the period of 1990 - 1997 within the area of 1133.88 km(2), and the lowest one is in the periode of 1998 - 2004 within the area of 1119.20 km(2). The correlation of land cover classes with a surface water area of Lake Toba shows that the open land has high correlation value of -0.77.

M3  - Article
AB  - A Snow Model (SM) using a temperature-index method was used to optimize the degree-day factor (DDF) and precipitation gradient (PG) for the different elevation zones of the Panjshir sub-basin for snowmelt runoff modelling. The values derived for DDF and PG were calibrated and validated by comparing observed snow cover area and snow cover area simulated by SM. The Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) was used to simulate daily runoff over the hydrological years 2009-2014 using the optimized values for SRM accuracy. The optimized DDF values were 0.3 to 0.9 (cm degrees C-1 d(-1)) for elevations from 1593 m to 5694 m. Meanwhile the PG was +0.002 m(-1) for elevations 1593-4000 m and 0 m(-1) above 4000 m. The simulated runoff by SRM during the entire data period correlated very well with a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient NS = 0.93 utilizing both observed and simulated snow cover area. This method not only evaluates the characteristics of snowfall and snowmelt in different elevation zones to obtain the DDF and PG, but can also estimate the snowmelt runoff.

AB  - The objective of this study is to prepare a final lineament map of three parts of the Semanggol Formation and its adjacent areas, located in northern Peninsular Malaysia. Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI, digital elevation model (DEM) and drainage pattern were used to trace lineament. These data were digitally processed to enhance the visibility of data and derive to twenty-four images. Only negative lineaments with length more than 2 km were traced by using manual lineament extraction method. Based on the results, there are differences in the number of lineaments and total length in each data, caused the lineaments to have to compare each other. The lineaments identified from all data were integrated and evaluated to produce a final lineament map. A total of 645 lineaments were identified with a total length of 2264.42 km and a maximum length of 26.84 km. The trend of the lineaments was correlated with faults in the published geological map, especially in the Bok Bak Fault. This method proved that lineaments could be traced more accurately with the utilisation of various remote sensing data.

Therefore, global data sets are often used for local or regional scale assessments. Here we validate eight different global scale DEM based on differential GNSS ground measurements acquired in the Lowveld savanna of Kruger National Park, South Africa. The global scale DEM include the three TanDEM-X DEM (similar to 12 m, similar to 30 m, similar to 90 m posting), the two SRTM DEM (similar to 30 m, similar to 90 m posting), the ASTER GDEM Vers. 3, the ALOS AW3D30 DEM (similar to 30 m posting) as well as the MERIT DEM (similar to 90 m posting).

T2  - RELIGIONS OF SOUTH ASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bhagavata Purana (BhP) is a popular sacred Sanskrit text characterized by its devotion for Krsna and the many narratives concerning him and his incarnations. These narratives have an edifying quality. A great number of them bring their point across through the use of humour. Though the comic tradition of India has been covered by scholars, such studies primarily discuss the performing arts. I argue that there is a strong presence of humour in the BhP, and that this humour communicates a playful attitude which has a prominent place in the overall religiosity of the BhP, thus communicating a worldview I term the co(s)mic vision. This study contributes to the discussion on the ludic dimensions of religious traditions and indicates how religious discourse is established through the entertaining and edifying effects of humour. Narrative is used as an entertaining alternative to religious instruction as exhortation, theological assertion, or propositional excursuses.

AB  - The article focuses on a relevant issue of the cognitive discourse study of mental integration of the identity and opposition relations in synonym-antonym complexes (hereinafter referred to as SACs). SACs are lexical sets that have not been considered in lexicology previously. The results of the research are presented in the Great Explanatory Ideographic Dictionary of SACs, a new format in lexicography whose usage also makes the research in question relevant. The title of the article reflects the approaches applied in studying antonymy. The subject matter of the article is joint analysis of antonymy and synonymy considered from different angles, i. e. denotative and ideographic, cognitive discourse, derivational and semantic, and structural and semantic. The purpose of the research is to work out a system of principles of lexicographic description of antonymy and their realization in the new ideographic dictionary. The source of the research material is the electronic database of the Laboratory of Computer Lexicography. For the purpose of the research, the author relies on a number of linguistic methods. As a result of the research, the author singles out some principles for studying and lexicographizing SACs, i. e. 1) the study of antonymy in the context of synonymy and in its interaction with it; 2) the interpretation of SACs as a completely new lexical set characterized by a specific structural and sematic organization; 3) singling out types of SACs; 4) the detection of regular derivational and grammatical variations of the basic antonymic oppositions in the structure of SACs; 5) the study of the mechanism underlying the realization of mental integration of the identity and opposition relations as the key factor in the formation of SACs; 6) singling out the main models for the realization of mental integration in the structure of SACs belonging to different denotative spheres; 7) the analysis of the place of SACs in the denotative and ideographic space of the Russian language; 8) detecting the nucleus and periphery of the linguistic synonymic and antonymic worldview in the Russian language and semantic distances in the structure of its semantic space. The results of the research may be used both for theoretical studies, i. e. in fundamental research in cognitive semantics, the theory of lexical sets, theoretic lexicography, and applied practically as lexicographic material in teaching practice both in schools and universities.

TI  - LINGUOPSYCHOLOGY BASED ON THE METHODS OF COGNITIVE STUDIES: THE LEXICOGRAPHIC ASPECT
T2  - IZVESTIYA URALSKOGO FEDERALNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-GUMANITARNYE NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on linguopsychology, a new interdisciplinary branch of linguistics which shares the subject matter with psychology and relies on the methods of cognitive studies. The author describes the stages of its establishment, examining the specifics of studying emotions, the role of their categorisation, and how the corresponding research results could be reflected in ideographic dictionaries. The aim of the research is to reveal the patterns underlying the categorisation of emotions based on cognitive technologies used in linguopsychology when interpreting emotions-related vocabulary to describe its systemic organisation with reference to the principle of multiple paradigms and reflecting research results in the form of ideographic dictionaries. For the purposes of the research, the author employs a number of methods of linguistic and linguo-cognitive analysis, carrying out a theoretical analysis of linguopsychology as a separate subject area; empirically, the study of emotive vocabulary relies on structural and semantic, denotative and ideographic, paradigmatic, componential, definitional, and conceptual and cognitive discourse analyses. The results of the research are presented according to lexicographic parameters. At the final stage of the research, the author categorises the emotive vocabulary according to a number of aspects (singling out around 21 000 words) and compiles a new ideographic dictionary An Alphabet of Emotions: A Thesaurus of Emotive Vocabulary. In the dictionary, referring to cognitive technologies and strategies, the vocabulary is divided into 39 thematic groups reflecting the basic emotion of the Russian person, and 312 subgroups denoting their variations. Employing linguistic methods and referring to the principle of multiple paradigms and a complex of research aspects, the author provides the first ever multicategory classification of emotive vocabulary which is reflected in the global structure of the new dictionary, with denotative ideographic groups at the top (Inspiration (Rus. BOXHOBeHe), Sorrow (Rus Gamma ope), Joy (RuspaocTb), etc.) which fall into subgroups taking into account some regular parameters employed for the interpretation of emotions, i.e. emotional state, attitude, formation of emotions, influence, outer expression, characterisation, quality, and individual as a bearer of emotions. The materials of the publication may be useful both to linguists and to specialists in the psychology of emotions. Additionally, the results of the research may be used for further studies in different fields, i.e. linguopsychology, linguistic cognitive studies, and lexicography as well as in courses focusing on the examination of the inner world of an individual.

TI  - LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUES: INFLUENCE OF THE ROMAN LAW ON RUSSIAN CONSTITUTIONIALISM
T2  - PRAVOPRIMENENIE-LAW ENFORCEMENT REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The subject. Modern law enforcement is considered in harmony with the spiritual and moral foundations of legal culture through the use of ideas and approaches of Roman law.The purpose. An attempt has been made to assess the influence of Roman Law on Russian constitutionalism and modern law enforcement on the basis of the spiritual and moral traditions of Russian legal culture.The methodology. Methods of dialectical logic, analysis and synthesis, comparative-historical, formal-legal methods were used. The main method is comparison of foundations of Roman law with the basic principles of Russian constitutionalism.The main results and scope of their application. The problem of influence of Roman law on Russian constitutionalism and, in general, on the basis of modern Russian law enforcement is raised. If universalism and individualism should be believed as the foundations of classical Roman law, then the basis of Russian law is community and social solidarity. In Russia collective property and joint work as well as ancestral structure in the form of a rural community reached the modern times, while in ancient Rome their disappearance was the basis of the formation of Roman law. National peculiarities of the Russian legal and political systems are determined by cultural-historical (civilizational) circumstances, especially by the natural and climatic factors. It was in the communal world of Russia that the idea of Christian equality has formed the basis of the model of life, while in Western Europe the community has followed the path of individualization of the individual and differentiation of elites and masses according to the criteria of social success. The absolute belief in law as a phenomenon of social planning and a tool for compromise between different parts of society, inherited from Roman law, formed the Romano-German and Anglo-Saxon worldview, but it did not take root in Russian legal culture. Modern Russian constitutionalism, while poorly considering the Roman-Byzantine origins of national Russian law, is wrong in its denial of the national-cultural and historical adaptation of European legal institutions and principles.Conclusions. One of the important results of the study is the conclusion that the social value of Roman law in Russian Constitutionalism includes the moral mission of Roman law and a high assessment of the normative value of the heritage of Roman law. The value depravity of the current Constitution of the Russian Federation can be eliminated, its defects can and should be corrected on the basis of the Roman law tradition, but this should be done only by adequately assessing the own experience of law enforcement, the thousand-year statelegal and spiritual development of the Russian civilization.

TI  - Field and remote observations to determine the environmental impact of agrarian reform in the Brazilian Midwest
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil's Midwest Is composed of four biomes, the Cerrado (Brazilian savannah), predominant in the region; the Pantanal, the largest irrigated plain on the planet; the Amazon biome; and the Atlantic Forest. The Wiidwest is the largest producer of grains and livestock in Brazil, activities that have a negative impact on environmental preservation. Agrarian reform redistributes land and reinforces small family farming, which many authors consider as favorable to environmental protection. The objective of this study is to characterize the impact of agrariam reform on environmental. preservation and agriculture on each biome of the Brazilian Midwest. Fifty-four settlements were surveyed using direct observation and Landsat images available for the year 2014. QGIS software 2.8 Wien was applied to calculate NDYI and NDWI vegetation indices to classify areas of agriculture, pasture, and environmental preservation. Pasture and savannah land occupy the largest areas in all biomes, with the main human activity based on livestock. Most settlements in the Midwest lead to small-scale activities such as dairy farming and polyculture, practices that differ from large-scale farming based on monoculture, and are more favorable to environmental. protection.

T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Midwest region of Brazil has a high concentration of land and is the primary producer of grains and livestock in the country, activities with a negative impact on environment. Agrarian reform allows redistribution of land and reinforces family agriculture, which is considered to be favorable to environmental protection. The aim of this study was to use field and remote observations to verify the evolution of environmental preservation and land use in rural settlements in the Midwest region of Brazil. 54 settlements distributed in the region were analyzed. We used images from Landsat 5 satellite obtained by the Thematic Mapper sensor in 2004 and images from Landsat 8 satellite from 2014. The NDVI and NDWI vegetation indexes were used to classify urban, agricultural, pasture, savannah and forest areas. Forests declined in all states, however Mato Grosso, the only one with Amazonian forest, where settlements presented lowest compliance with environmental legislation. The evolution indicates the transformation of forest areas into savannah. Settlers predominantly engage in dairy farming, which requires large areas of land and thus exerts significant pressure on the environment. Productive areas are poorly exploited, and better technical assistance could have a significant impact on environmental protection.

TI  - Remote sensing and GIS techniques for reconstructing the military fort system on the Roman boundary (Tunisian section) and identifying archaeological sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern Tunisia is one of the most significant areas of historical and archaeological interest as, since the Roman period, it has played a key role as a land bridge controlling the passage from the Saharan plain to plateaus and to the north of the mountain range between Chebika and Metlaoui. Because of the difficult geography, the investigation of ancient sites in this region is not easy and, therefore, satellite-based investigation can play an important role in the detection and documentation of archaeological sites. In this study, we combined high-resolution remote sensing (RS) imagery with in situ investigations to assess the suspected archaeological sites detected using satellite data and historical documentation. The suspected sites were confirmed according to the geometric features of the sites as they appeared in the remotely sensed imagery these sites had not been detected during earlier field investigations. In particular, we aimed to use 1-m spatial resolution WorldView-2 (WV2) imagery of the Wadi El-MelahValley (WMV) in Gafsa (also named Capsa). The satellite data were processed using statistical analysis and unsupervised classification.WV2 satellite imagery of WMV, Southwestern Tunisia, was processed within ArcGIS 10.2 to identify spatial features linked to the sites. The study outlines three different feature-extraction methods (GIS-based, unsupervised classification-based and statistical analysis-based). The satellite-based analysis and archaeological records were evaluated by RS and GIS prospecting in the area of the field survey to confirm the new discoveries. The results of remotely sensed data combined with field survey enabled us to reconstruct the military defense system consisting of is a linear defensive structure (limes) and forts related to the Imperial Roman period. Taken together, the results of our investigations provide new insights into some important sections of the Roman limes in the southern part of the empire. Other concealed remains are still to be found and explored.

TI  - MOTORSPORT EVENT ATTENDEES: WHO ARE THEY, WHAT IS THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL WORLDVIEW, AND HOW DOES IT RELATE TO TRIP SPENDING?
T2  - EVENT MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between economics and sustainability within the event industry is becoming increasingly important. Events with a reputation of not being sustainable (i.e., motorsport events) are chronically underserved in the literature. This research incorporated the revised New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) as a theoretical foundation to assess sustainability attitudes of motor racing event attendees at a series of major racing events in Monterey County, California (USA). The NEP assessment created the basis for examining relationships between sustainability attitudes and motorsport event patrons' characteristics including demographic information, tourist patrons' total trip spending, and per-day spending. Interestingly, patrons attending these traditionally nonenvironmentally sustainable events were found to have similar NEP scores to other event and nonevent research. Sustainability attitudes were not significantly different based on demographic variables, including age and income. However, an inverse relationship was found between environmental attitudes and spending. Tourist patrons with a less sustainable environmental worldview spent more per day and more per trip than those with a more sustainable environmental worldview. These surprising results provide a basis for industry and academic discourse within event management, sustainability, and marketing.

T2  - ARCHAEOLOGY ETHNOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY OF EURASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study, based on ethnographic, linguistic, and folk materials, describes and interprets Buryat ideas of birds. The analysis of lexical data reveals the principal groups of birds according to the Buryat folk classification. The bat's status is indistinct, since bats are not subordinate to the kings of the animal world. Diagnostic criteria underlying the classification of birds are outlined. The main criterion was whether a bird was beneficial or harmful. Ornithomorphic images in Buryat mythology, folklore, and ritual are described. Cult birds and bird totems are listed, and relics of local bird cults (those relating to swan, goose, duck, pigeon, and eagle) are revealed. Birds with positive connotations are the swan, crane, swallow, pigeon, eagle, and eagle-owl. Those with negative connotation are the kite, raven, crow, quail, cuckoo, and hoopoe). The attitude toward ducks, hawks, magpies, and jackdaws is ambivalent. Certain birds (ducks and ravens) were related to cosmogonic ideas; others (swan, goose, eagle, etc.) were endowed with a werewolf capability. The raven, the cuckoo, and the hoopoe symbolized natural cycles, whereas the magpie and the quail were associated with the soul. The role of bird images in the mytho-ritual practices is discussed. The Buryat mythological ideas reflected not only specific ethnic views of certain birds, but also universal ones.

T2  - ACTUALIDADES PEDAGOGICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article we present the concept of Bien Vivir or Buen Vivir / Sumac Kawsay, its origins and divergences. Buen Vivir appears as the constitutional principle of the new plurinational constitutions of Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela, proposing a community paradigm and collective constructions of life form. It is also presented as a way of thinking that is based on the Andean worldview, going against the process of colonization and subalternization of the historical subjects in Latin America, proposing other social practices, epistemologies, different forms of relationship with nature and contrary visions of the logic of neoliberal capitalism. We point to the need for a "decolonial" pedagogical proposal, in the perspective of Buen Vivir that denounces the new forms of slavery that act on the consciences and seek an epistemic reunion, ours, of the subalternized peoples, aiming at the rescue of a full life, in harmony with Mother Earth (Pachamama).

AB  - Autonomous multi-robot systems, where a team of robots shares information to perform tasks that are beyond an individual robot's abilities, hold great promise for a number of applications, such as planetary exploration missions. Each robot in a multi-robot system that uses the shared-world coordination paradigm autonomously schedules which robot should perform a given task, and when, using its worldview-the robot's internal representation of its belief about both its own state, and other robots' states. A key problem for operators is that robots' worldviews can fall out of sync (often due to weak communication links), leading to desynchronization of the robots' scheduling decisions and inconsistent emergent behavior (e.g., tasks not performed, or performed by multiple robots). Operators face the time-consuming and difficult task of making sense of the robots' scheduling decisions, detecting de-synchronizations, and pinpointing the cause by comparing every robot's worldview. To address these challenges, we introduce MOSAIC Viewer, a visual analytics system that helps operators (i) make sense of the robots' schedules and (ii) detect and conduct a root cause analysis of the robots' desynchronized worldviews. Over a year-long partnership with roboticists at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, we conduct a formative study to identify the necessary system design requirements and a qualitative evaluation with 12 roboticists. We find that MOSAIC Viewer is faster- and easier-to-use than the users' current approaches, and it allows them to stitch low-level details to formulate a high-level understanding of the robots' schedules and detect and pinpoint the cause of the desynchronized worldviews.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background Methods for identifying local lymph node metastasis in malignant melanoma include sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and lymph node dissection (LND). In particular, SLNB has been widely used in recent years. This study aimed to retrospectively confirm the adequacy of the current indication criteria for SLNB by applying those criteria to a mixed group of patients who previously received SLNB and LND.Methods This study included 77 patients with malignant melanoma of the extremities and trunk who were monitored for >24 months. The patients were classified according to whether the current indication criteria for SLNB were applicable. The sentinel lymph nodes were evaluated for each group. Patients for whom the indication criteria for SLNB and LND were applicable were analyzed according to whether SLNB or LND was performed. Finally, the outpatient records of these patients were reviewed to evaluate recurrence, metastasis, and prognosis.Results Of the 77 patients, SLNB was indicated according to the current criteria in 60 cases. Among the 60 patients for whom SLNB was indicated, 35 survived the follow-up period disease-free, 21 died during the follow-up period, and four experienced metastasis. The 17 patients for whom SLNB was not indicated had no recurrence or metastasis.Conclusions Patients for whom SLNB was not indicated had no recurrence or metastasis. In cases where SLNB is indicated, the possibility of metastasis and recurrence may be high even if SLNB is negative or LND is performed, so more aggressive treatment and careful follow-up are crucial.

AB  - The national satellite operation network, which supports multiple satellites, was designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) in 2017. The network was designed independently from the control network and the information network to enhance physical security. Planning is underway to establish a bidirectional data interface between networks. The data transmission system allows data flow only to the physical layer and the data link layer; hence, only one file can be transferred at any one time. This means that when large amounts of data are being transmitted, no other data can be sent simultaneously in urgent situations. Thus, this paper discusses the design of flexible packets for the transmission of data between networks in an environment where physical security has been enhanced through network separation and based on this, presents a method for transmitting data effectively.

T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the development of the translation manner of Fyodor Sologub. The study of the poet's archive makes it possible to highlight a number of preparatory materials for Sologub's translations from Paul Verlaine, in particular, interlinear translations. Sologub's experiments with interlinear translations, which in his case represent a hybrid genre (interlinear translations that include a large number of different dictionary variants of words) are of great importance for the theory, history, and practice of literary translation. Using specific examples, the essay demonstrates that Sologub worked not just with the original text, traditional interlinear translation, and written out words. He employed his "expanded" interlinear translation where he could freely navigate, choose and rearrange words, try their "sound" while seeking to keep their meaning. The authors argue that Sologub's translating method consisted in selecting Russian words on the basis of the interlinear translation that not only conveyed the original but also made it possible to create a new lexical, grammatical, metric, phonetic, and emotional unity close to the translator's worldview mindset and aesthetic views.

We used temperature indicators of seawater for the summer season of 2017 when a sharp decrease by more than 2 degrees C in average daily temperature occurred. Space images were obtained from the specialized centres of Ocean Color NASA, Earth Science Data Systems NASA and SATIN. Remote sensing data were processed using SeaDAS and ArcGIS programs. Ground data were obtained from the resources of the Unified State System of Information about the Situation in the World Ocean (ESIMO). An ArcGIS database was created and maps compiled.Results. The first upwelling occurred on 9-17 June 2020. The minimum water temperature in the Makhachkala area was 14 degrees C with an increase in salinity to 12 parts per thousand over an area of 1,500 sq.km. An increase in the content of dissolved oxygen of up to 9.70 mg/l and pH 8.64 was recorded. A second upwelling of medium intensity occurred from 19 June-July 1 with a minimum temperature of 17.9 degrees C. The decrease in temperature was 2.8 degrees C with an increase in salinity by 1 parts per thousand. The surface area was 454 sq.km. A third case of upwelling was recorded from 26 August-September 1 and was characterised by a decrease in water temperature of 7.4 degrees C (near the coast, 17.1 degrees C). The average salinity increase was 0.32% while the O-2 concentration was 8 mg/l over an area of 500 sq.km.Conclusion. Due to its large size, the Caspian Sea is characterised by spatial inhomogeneity of oceanological parameters, which can be recorded based on the results of processing satellite images and their verification using ground data. In the western part of the sea the upwelling is periodic and of different scales.

TI  - Flaviviral disease mosquito vector surveillance in Incheon Metropolitan City and the Hwaseong area, Gyeonggi-Do, Republic of Korea, in 2015
T2  - ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to global climate change, the global resurgence of vector-borne infectious diseases and their potential to inflict widespread casualties among human populations has emerged as a pivotal burden on public health systems. In this study, the prevalence of flaviviral diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, and their target vector diversity, abundance, and distribution was investigated to enable the mapping of hotspots for these diseases. For the surveillance of the vector mosquitoes carrying flaviviruses during April to November 2015, female mosquitoes were collected to study whether they carried pathogens from abroad at seven locations in Incheon Metropolitan City (Incheon) as a typical urban area and Hwaseong-si (= city, Hwaseong) of Gyeonggi-do (= province) as a rural area. A total of 15 species belonging to seven genera (29,102 female mosquitoes) were collected with black-light and BG-Sentinel (TM) traps at a collection rate of 260 per trap/night from whole collection locations. The most collected mosquito species in Incheon were Aedes vexans nipponii (species ratio (SR), 29.9%) and the Culex pipiens complex (SR, 28.8%), followed by Anopheles sinensis s.l. (SR, 27.9%) and Ochlerotatus koreicus (SR, 7.1%). From the results of viral RNA detection, five flaviviruses were found in 20,981 individuals (excluding An. sinensis; 696 pools) in the Cx. pipiens complex and Ae. vexans nipponii. Three Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)-positive pools were from the Cx. pipiens complex, a Chaoyang virus pool was found from Ae. vexans nipponii, and the remaining unidentified flavivirus pool was from Cx. pipiens. The three JEV-positive pools were phylogenetically grouped as genotype V. The results of our study demonstrate that enhanced monitoring and long-term surveillance of these vector viruses are of great public health importance.

AB  - Being an important geological information source, geochemical data is widely used in mineral exploration, environmental protection, pollution monitoring, etc. However, geochemical data with extensive coverage and fine resolution has become inaccessible, especially in some unreachable and remote areas. Remote sensing data with fast and efficient ability to collect geology related geo-information has long been employed in many of geological studies. Joint utilization of geochemical and remote sensing data, as well as other sources of geo-data can consequently assist in geological applications such as mineral exploration. In recent decades, methodology to integrate remote sensing and geochemical data have significantly improved. During the integration, geochemical data are often interpolated or resampled to finer resolution for match that of remote sensing images but without notable improvement in geo-information quality contained with. This study proposed a new integration method that uses the AlexNet convolution neural network to interpolate geochemical data with ASTER images. The interpolated geochemical data presents not only with a higher spatial resolution, but also with geological information from remote sensing images.

TI  - Monitoring Water Transparency in Shallow and Eutrophic Lake Waters Based on GOCI Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water transparency represented by the Secchi disk depth (Z(sd)) plays an important role in understanding water ecology environment variations, especially for optically complex and shallow lake waters. In this study, using in situ measured remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d), and Z(sd) data collected in Lake Taihu (China), a regional algorithm for estimating K-d from R-rs was designed, and the semi-analytical model proposed by Lee et al. (2015) (hereafter called Lee_2015 model) was refined using a linear scaling correction for remote sensing of Z(sd). The results showed that a good agreement between the derived K-d and in situ measured data (mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 26% for K-d(490); MAPE < 5% for K-d at 443, 555, and 660 nm). The in situ R-rs-derived Z(sd) results using the refined Lee_2015 model compared well with the in situ measured Z(sd) (R-2 = 0.72 and MAPE = 36%), which was an obvious improvement over the Lee_2015 model in our study region. Subsequently, the refined Lee_2015 model was applied to the geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) observations between 2012 and 2018 to yield the spatial and temporal variations of water transparency in the Lake Taihu waters. The long-term mean distribution of Z(sd) revealed that water transparency values in the northeastern Lake Taihu were generally higher than those in the southwest part. Monthly climatological Z(sd) patterns suggested that the Z(sd) distributions had large temporal variability, and distinct monthly patterns of Z(sd) existed in different subregions of Lake Taihu. The significant interannual variations of Z(sd) in Lake Taihu are probably affected by a combination of the water column stability mainly caused by wind, water temperature, human activity, and riverine discharge. The present study can provide a new approach for quantifying water visibility and serve for water-color remote sensing of optically complex and highly turbid waters.

AB  - In recent years, Low-Light-Level (LLL) remote-sensing camera has become a novel subject for the development of aerospace optical remote-sensing payloads. LLL remote sensing camera works in ultra-low light conditions, the image signal is very weak and requires image intensified technology to achieve. In order to make better use of LLL remote sensing data, it is necessary to establish the quantitative relationship between the amount of radiation received by the camera and the digital signal output to process the image. That's radiation calibration technology. Therefore, the radiation calibration of the LLL remote sensing camera is particularly important. In this article, first the requirements for calibration of LLL remote sensing cameras are analyzed in theory. After that, a radiation calibration scheme of the LLL remote sensing camera is put forward. Finally, the radiation calibration test is carried out, and the calibration data are analyzed. The results show that the calibration scheme of LLL remote sensing camera is reasonable and feasible.

AB  - Studies on the use of Remote Sensing to highlight ore-controlling geological structures were performed. The research findings were obtained using a remote sensing database created from Landsat and ASTER data. As a result of this work, space-structural schemes of individual regions of Kazakhstan were built, and the main ore-controlling factors were determined. Besides, the areas for the detection of endogenous mineralization were identified accordingly. The selected digital satellite imageries provide a given research scale and have the maximum spectral resolution; therefore, they covered the research area in all possible spectral ranges. In space-structural diagrams, the lineament morphology represents the faults, areas of increased fracture, geological boundaries, litter elements, dam bodies, and other elements of a geological nature. Under conditions of a weakly dissected relief, the multidirectional gradient methods and various filtering methods proved to be useful for distinguishing linear structures. When identifying ring and arc structures within the study area, the following functions were used: the boundaries of arcs and rings between blocks with different textures of space materials, boundaries of landscape heterogeneity, the morphology of arcs and rings. According to the scale, ring structures are conventionally divided into second-order and small structures. Structures with radius from 3 to 50 km belong to second-order ring structures, and small structures with a radius less than 3 km belong to small structures. Stratified complexes in the studied areas are divided into loose and lithified. Neogene-Quaternary proluvial, alluvial-proluvial, alluvial, aeolian and undifferentiated sediments are classified as loose. The lithified layered complexes fold into folds with a predominance of the northwestern strike. When identifying bodies of intrusive rocks, spectral libraries, texture features of satellite images, and the experience of the authors were used.

AB  - The global coverage of Sentinel-2 provides widespread opportunities for accurately mapping and monitoring key crops in emerging countries, like in the case of Nepal's rice production. While previous studies based on other satellites show some important spatial and temporal limitations, the use of operational Sentinel-2 data still remains unexplored in this regard. As a result, this work investigates the viability of using the Sentinel-2 instrument for a precise rice crop classification in Nepal. Initially, we define a dataset made of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data from the Terai region of Nepal. Then, we conduct several classification experiments to provide empirical evidences about the suitability of different classification models when identifying rice crops in developing countries, where only limited ground-truth data could be available. The experiments reveal the suitability of using Sentinel-2 for accurately mapping rice crops in Nepal with a CNN-based classification model.

AB  - As Dong-Ju Yoon (1917-1945) is one of the most beloved poet in Korea., interest in his life and poetry has steadily increased over time. As a part of a program of research to explore the theological world represented in Dong-Ju Yoon’s poetry, this paper attempts to study the most important theological aspects of his worldview, that is, his concept of God as represented in his poetry. Due to the limitations of the paper, it cannot deal with all his poems, but tries to analyze the main aspects of God as manifested in his poems.For Yoon, God is the One who speaks, and who reveals even through nature. And God is the One who predestines all things in the world in God’s own eternal decrees, because God is the principle of all things and also that of all human life. And this God is the One who wants to be in relation with humans and calls us. Thus no matter how hard and difficult our situation is, God still speaks and reveals Godself. Even if it may sound vague or unclear to us, God does so. Since God created all things in the cosmos and further predestined everything in God’s own eternal decrees, God is the source of new power and hope for us. Thus whatever situation we are in, we should not giveup, despair, or resign ourselves to our fate.This understanding of God is represented in Dong-Ju Yoon’s poetry. In the future, further research needs to address how this concept of God relates to Jesus Christ as manifested in his poetry, or to the Holy Spirit symbolized by the wind in his poetry. It is expected that this work would be able to fully grasp his concept of God within his own theological world, and thus it could help to understand his poetry more deeply and abundantly.

AB  - Goguryeo attended the royal court of Song dynasty accompanied by the envoy of Sushen(肅愼) in 459. This article aims at understanding the Goguryeo’s background and purpose of this attendance at the time of 459. It is also an attempt to discover the meaning of the negotiations between Goguryeo and Song dynasty from a new perspective.Sushen traditionally considered as the symbol of tribute from outlander barbarians(遠夷), which pay Hushi(楛矢, bush clover arrow) and Shinu(石砮, stone arrowhead) as a tribute influenced by the virtue of an emperor of saint virtues(聖德天子) when he emerges and governs Zhongyuan(中原, central plain). However, the tribute of Suksin to the Zhongyuan dynasty, which was suspended for a while after 236, is reaffirmed; Sushen is the same ethnic group as Yilou(挹婁) at this point. The symbol of Sushen's tribute was emphasized in connection with securing the legitimacy of the state under the circumstances that several dynasties coexist. Naturally, the perception that Yilou considered to be Sushen was widespread. Furthermore, it seems that Goguryeo shared this perception as the term “Sushen" is confirmed in Gwanggaeto Stele and Samguk sagi(三國史記, History of the Three Kingdoms). Sushen, that Goguryeo accompanied in 459, is also considered as the group related to this perception.Goguryeo was accompanied by Sushen, the symbol of outlander barbarians’ tribute, as a result of the coincidence of interests between Song dynasty and Goguryeo in 459. Emperor Xiaowu(孝武帝), who acceded to the throne at a time of crisis of failure in northern expedition and rebellion, needed to restore internal order and external status. Emperor Xiaowu attempted to restore domestic and foreign order by establishing worldview centered on Jiankang(建康) while proceeding designation of Wanggi(王畿), production of Oro(五輅), and establishment of Myeongdang(明堂). In 459, a series of things began to start in earnest. The attendance of Sushen at the royal court is related to the establishment of Jiankang-centered worldview of Song dynasty.Accompanying Sushen was also effective in two ways for Goguryeo. The first is the reaffirmation of the influence on the powers inside the domains(域內) and was prevent unrest in the northwest. As is generally known, Goguryeo had its own worldview since the 5th century. However, the breakaway movement of Silla and Buyeo, which were the part of this worldview, was captured in the middle of the 5th century. It is estimated that Goguryeo mobilized Sushen to emphasize the influence of the state while minimizing the aftermath of the breakaway. The second is that it was a diplomatic strategy that utilized the tension between Zhongyuan dynasties. Sushen’s tribute was an important measure of ensuring the legitimacy of each dynasty under the situation where disparate dynasties coexisting in the North and South. At that time, Goguryeo made use of Sushen to provoke Beiwei(北魏), which was Hojok(胡族) but longed to become a true ruler of the Zhongyuan; also, it was intended to be used as a mean to enhance the status of Goguryeo in East Asia.

AB  - Land-use changes are the main issue which affects the availability of water resources. Water supply is the leading ecosystem service, directly influence the sustainable development of the social economy and ecological systems. This study model the effects of land-use changes in respect of water yield, using Soil water assessment tools (SWAT) model in Sg. Layang catchment, Johor, Malaysia. Changes in Land-use for the period of 2000-2005, 2005-2010 and 2000-2010 obtained through post-classification comparison of Landsat 7 ETM+ data acquired in 2000, 2005 and 2010 using maximum likelihood classifier. The results indicate a rise in water yield, as a result of forest decline as well as an increase in agricultural activities and urbanization. The changes in the forest are found directly proportional to water yield (R-2 > 0.85, p < 0.001). It is therefore concluded that the satellite multi-temporal land use changes within the catchment are paramount for monitoring the corresponding water yield in the area. These land use changes to water yield are crucial to assist authorities to create a balance between environmental protection and urban development for sustainable management of water resources.

TI  - Histopathological variation in the demyelinating sentinel lesion of primary central nervous system lymphoma.
T2  - Surgical neurology international
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is one of the least common malignant brain tumors. It is usually diagnosed initially as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In rare cases, however, a demyelinating lesion referred to as a "sentinel lesion" precedes the actual diagnosis, which usually depicts two distinct patterns of inflammatory cells during histological analysis. This case report describes a unique histological finding and describes the recognized variations in sentinel lesion histopathology.CASE DESCRIPTION: A 78-year-old female patient was found to have multiple white matter lesions of various degrees of enhancement on post-contrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. A stereotactic biopsy of a heterogeneous lesion in the left occipital lobe was performed, which revealed demyelination along with lymphocytic infiltration, reactive astrocytosis, abundant T cells, and foamy macrophages. There was no evidence of monoclonality, rapid regression of all lesions occurred, and the patient was thus treated for tumefactive demyelination. Three months later, all of the residual lesions had enlarged and were homogeneously enhancing. An endoscopic-guided biopsy of the right periventricular lesion showed diffuse atypical lymphoid cells.CONCLUSION: The sentinel lesion of PCNSL expresses a variable histological pattern of inflammatory cells. This case demonstrates a unique and rare picture of mixed perivascular and parenchymal infiltration of inflammatory cells, highlighting the importance of repeated biopsies and/or radiological examinations to obtain an accurate diagnosis.

T2  - Medical journal, Armed Forces India
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is shown to be the commonest complication in critically ill children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification and definition are now used universally. We undertook prospective observational study to study the etiology and maximum stage of AKI as defined by KDIGO and its complications and outcomes.METHODS: All children admitted to the PICU were included in the study. The diagnosis of sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was made according to the standard international guidelines. The patients were followed up till discharge/death. All children were screened for AKI at admission and subsequently using serum creatinine measured by modified Jaffe's method and urine output measurement.RESULTS: A total of 197 children were admitted to the PICU. 38 (19.28%) developed AKI, and 6 (15.78%) developed stage III AKI. Malignancies, serious neurological and renal disorders, and postsurgery complications accounted for most of the cases with AKI. Six were admitted with primary renal condition. Sepsis with or without MODS was seen in 12 patients with AKI and in 8 without AKI. Twenty-one children with AKI and 3 children without AKI were exposed to nephrotoxic drugs. Twenty-three children with AKI required inotropic support. The average length of stay (ALOS) of children with AKI in the PICU was 9.86 days, whereas ALOS of children without AKI was 6.23 days. Eighteen children with AKI (47.36%) and 36 (21.38%) with no AKI died.CONCLUSIONS: AKI in children in the PICUs of referral hospitals in the armed forces have varied etiologies and presentations. These children require early identification and management with close monitoring to prevent long-term renal morbidity and mortality.

TI  - A Review of Landsat False Color Composite Images for Lithological Mapping of Pre-Cambrian to Recent Rocks: A Case Study of Pail/Padhrar Area in Punjab Province, Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - This research is based to review the efficacy of Landsat thematic mapper (TM) on different band combinations for mapping of different geological formations ranging in age from Pre-Cambrian to most recent rocks. These band combinations include 742, 247, 564, 456, 567 and 765. Out of these, the most suitable false color composite combination is assessed for differentiation of lithology. To differentiate formations, the Landsat TM image is processed in Erdas imagine software and accordingly different lithological formations are identified on the basis of their tonal variations. Findings of the research show that 742 and 247 are the most suitable false color composite for sedimentary rocks of lower eocene (Nammal and Sakaser Formations), middle and lower Miocen (Murree and Kamlial Formations) and Pre-Cambrian (Salt Range Formation) lithological formations. The 564 and 456 FCC combinations have complexities in the identification of different lithologies; however, 456 FCC combination identified Paleocene rocks of Makarwal group (Patala Formation) and Pre-Cambrian (Salt Range Formation). The other two combinations 567 and 765 differentiate only middle Pliocene (Chinji and Nagri Formations), whereas lower eocene (Chorgali Formation) reflects fluctuating tonal behavior. The other lithologies are unidentifiable in these two combinations. Findings of the research are the base for the utilization of Landsat TM data in identification of similar lithologies in the salt range as well as in other areas having sedimentary rocks.

TI  - The tradition of foraging in Kalmyk and Tuvan folklore
T2  - NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is devoted to foraging as a type of economy specific for certain peoples of Central Asia. Ancestors of Tuvans and Oirats followed the "forest" type of economy, and their descendants must have preserved some of the foraging traditions. The authors aim to analyze the Kalmyk and Tuvan folklore for surviving traditions of foraging as an ancient type of Central Asian economy. The article also describes foraging-related details of traditional worldview. The study focuses on folklore texts of various genres, largely on fairy tales and epic. The ethnographic materials which contain descriptions of foraging are quite abundant.The study helped the authors arrive at a conclusion that although the folklore texts show only a few traces of foraging, some do indeed survive. Tuvans have preserved more of them, while Kalmyks both changed their climatic zone (from taiga to the steppe) and migrated far away from their ancestral lands, from Central Asia to the Lower Volga. This is the factor which must have removed most of the mentions of the old type of economy.Tuvan folklore features some of the archaic traditions of foraging which the texts link to primitive society and the cultural heroes of the folklore traditions. Foraging is usually associated with female characters, and gathering plants for men was a reproachable activity, allowed only under special circumstances. Later foraging became typical for the poorest part of the population.Kalmyk folklore texts feature a plot of a staying in archaic conditions in the original world, with its typical features, such as the scarcity of food, the 'wagon of grass, the reprobate state, or lack of social recognition. Characters had to cross the border between the original world and the social world in order to take up cattle breeding to achieve welfare and happiness.In the folklore texts containing information on primeval hunting and foraging, welfare is linked to the domestication of animals, which reveals the influence of the values of Kalmyk and Tuvan culture.

TI  - Financial and Clinical Impact of Transfer Patients at Major Teaching Hospitals
T2  - ACADEMIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The authors examined the "hub-and-spoke" health care system in the United States for patients transferred from one hospital ("spoke") to a major teaching hospital ("hub") and assessed the financial and clinical impact of this system on major teaching hospitals. Method The authors surveyed Council of Teaching Hospitals and Health Systems members to collect detailed financial and clinical data from fiscal year 2015 for transfer cases and nontransfer cases (cases directly admitted to the teaching hospital). Data included computed margins (the difference between revenue received and direct and indirect facility costs as estimated by the hospitals) as well as case severity, average length of stay (ALOS), time of admission, surgical or medical status, and other situational variables for All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRGs). The authors used an ordinary least-squares regression model with fixed effects to analyze the data. Results Twenty-six hospitals provided data. The average difference between transfer and nontransfer cases was a 2.18 day longer ALOS and a $1,716 lower computed margin, for a case in the same APR-DRG and hospital (P < .001 for both outcomes). Transfer cases had a 19% higher case severity of illness rating and were disproportionately represented among complex APR-DRGs. Transfer patients were 14% more likely to be Medicaid beneficiaries. Conclusions Compared with nontransfer cases, transfer cases at major teaching hospitals were more complex and resulted in greater resource utilization, affecting the financial margins on which teaching hospitals rely to support their multipart mission.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the paper is to discuss the phenomenon of students. clip thinking, its roots and ways of handling the problem in a higher education establishment. The research reflects concerns of domestic and foreign scholars and educational professionals about the students having the mosaic worldview devoid of logical reasoning rather than the integral picture of the world.Methodology: The methodological basis of the study is the data of the general and special scientific methodology. Dialectics has determined the reasoning. The philosophical principle of the universal connection of objects and phenomena of objective reality, the principle of determinism and systematicity are taken as a basis as well.Result: The research has sparked the students. interest in the problem of clip thinking under study, the reasons for its occurrence, and ways to handle it. Although most students have a clear idea of the term "clip thinking", and, therefore, succeed in analysing the reasons for its development, few of them are able to practise what they intuitively (and correctly) regard as appropriate. As seen from the research, all the students involved in the experiment need a closer communication with the university professors and a greater engagement in the academic and extra-curricular activities in order to develop integral thinking, imagination, memory, oratorical skills and many others essential for future professionals.Application: The research can be useful to university and school professionals, scholars and students.

AB  - To further improve the classification accuracy of remote sensing time series data, in this paper, we propose a Bi-directional Long-Term and Short-Term Memory (denoted as BI-LSTM) based model for vegetation mapping and monitoring. The proposed model is applied to multi-temporal publicly available Sentinel-2A dataset with vegetation as the main theme. Experimental results have shown that the proposed approach has good performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods in term of accuracy, precision and recall. Moreover, it can efficiently use both past and future input features using the BI-LSTM component.

AB  - Seawater as the main raw material for making salt has the required chemical elements and impurities. One of the elements that are needed such as chloride (Cl) and the impurity is sulfate (SO4). In remote sensing the element of chloride can be analyzed through satellite imagery by first estimating the salinity which is salts in sea water where there is chloride. Whereas sulphate can also be analyzed through satellite imagery using the estimation model of the results of previous studies. From the two data, seawater is mapped in the south and north side of Madura Island to recommend better sea water based on chloride content and sulfate. The results of the mapping obtained that the waters of the island of Madura better side than the waters of the North side. Nevertheless waters of the north side is still quite good so it is still possible serve the manufacture of salt.

AB  - Posidonia oceanica is an endemic seagrass species in the Mediterranean. Even though this species has been put under protection, P. oceanica is currently listed as threatened. Therefore, in order to conserve this species, high resolution, accurate and temporal distribution maps are needed to be produced. In this study, it is aimed to create seagrass distribution maps with machine learning algorithms namely as random forests and support vector machines using WorldView-2 imagery. In-situ data has been collected via underwater video and scuba diving for classification training and testing. Atmospheric, radiometric and water column corrections are applied for preprocessing of the optical satellite image. The light penetration in the water is limited by depth. Therefore, we have limited our study area based on maximum depth of 20 meters. The classification accuracies and Cohen's kappa coefficients are calculated as 94% and 0.89 for random forests, 71% and 0.61 for support vector machines, respectively. According to the results, it can be clearly said that random forests method is superior to support vector machines for seagrass mapping in our study area. The proposed framework in this study enables to rapidly produce seagrass distribution maps which can be used to monitor temporal change for a sustainable ecosystem.

TI  - Risk factors for failure of bilateral sentinel lymph node mapping in early-stage cervical cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to determine clinical, tumoral and surgical factors associated with successful bilateral sentinel lymph node mapping (SBM) in early-stage cervical cancer.Methods: We performed an ancillary work on the data of two prospective trials on SLN biopsy for FIGO IA-IIA cervical cancer (SENTICOL I & II). Patients having Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for earlystage cervical cancer were included between 2005 and 2012 from 28 French oncologic centers. SLN was detected by a combined labeling technique (blue and isotopic).Results: 405 patients were included for analysis: SLNs were identified on at least one side of the pelvis in 381 patients (94.1%) and bilaterally in 326 patients (80.5%). The mean age was 45.4 years [22-85 years]. Most patients had IB1 pathologic FIGO 2018 stage (81.3%) and squamous cell carcinoma (71%). Surgeries were mainly performed by minimally invasive approach (368 patients - 90.9%). By multivariate analysis, lower SBM rate was significantly associated with Age >= 70 years (ORa = 0.02, 95%CI = [0.001-0.28], p = 0.004), tumor size larger than 20 mm (ORa = 0.46,95%Cl = [0.21-0.99], p = 0.048) and Body-mass index higher than 30 kg/m 2 (ORa = 0.28, 95%Cl = [0.12-0.65], p = 0.003). SBM rate was significantly higher in high skills centers (>5patients/year) (ORa = 8.05, 95%Cl = [2.06-31.50], p = 0.003) and in SENTICOL II (2009-2012) compared to SENTICOL I (2005-2007) (ORa = 2.6, 95%Cl = [1.23-5.51], p = 0.01).Conclusions: In early-stage cervical cancer, bilateral SLN detection rates is lower in patients aged more than 70years, patients with BMI>30 kg/m(2) and larger tumor >20 mm whereas stronger experience of SLN biopsy technique improves bilateral SLN detection.

M3  - Article
AB  - We determined the optimal imaging time for axillary lymph node (LN) visualization following Tc-99m Tilmanocept in breast cancer patients to establish imaging guidelines that can allow for a reliable and efficient yet high yield study prior to surgery. Retrospective analysis in 651 patients who underwent lymphoscintigraphy, comparing LN visualization on immediate, 15-minute, and 90-minute delayed imaging after injection of Tc-99m Tilmanocept. Statistical analysis was performed using McNemar's test, kappa coefficient, and Pearson Chi-square test. Five hundred and six patients had either immediate or immediate and 90-minute delayed imaging. Of these patients, 203 (40.1%) had both immediate and 90-minute delayed images. Of these 203 patients, 54 (26.6%) had >= 1 lymph node(s) identified immediately and 196 (96.6%) had >= 1 lymph node(s) identified at 90 minutes (P<0.0001). A kappa coefficient of .0256 was observed (95% CI:.0058-.0453). One hundred and forty-five additional patients had 15-minute delayed imaging. Of these patients, 117 (80.7%) had >= 1 lymph node(s) identified, which was significantly fewer compared to the number of patients with >= 1 lymph node(s) detected at 90 minutes (P<0.0001). Ninety-minute delayed imaging is optimal for identifying sentinel lymph node(s) following Tc-99m Tilmanocept injection in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Does socioeconomic status moderate the political divide on climate change? The roles of education, income, and individualism
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research documents that U.S. conservatives, and conservative white males in particular, tend to dismiss the threat of climate change more than others in the U.S. public. Other research indicates that higher education and income can each exacerbate the dismissive tendencies of the political Right. Bridging these lines of research, the present study examines the extent to which higher education and/or income moderate the ideological divide and the "conservative white male effect" on several climate change opinions, and whether these effects are mediated by an individualistic worldview (e.g., valuing individual liberty and limited government). Using nationally representative survey data of U.S. adults from 2008 to 2017 (N = 20,024), we find that across all beliefs, risk perceptions, and policy preferences examined, the ideological divide strengthens with both higher education and higher income. However, educational attainment plays a stronger role than income in polarizing the views of conservative white males. Further analyses support the hypothesis that differences in individualism partially explain the increased political polarization among more educated and higher-income adults, as well as greater dismissiveness among conservative white males relative to other demographic groups. These results highlight key moderators of opinion polarization, as well as ideological differences among conservatives, that are often overlooked in public discourse about climate change. Implications for climate change education and communication across demographic groups are considered.

AB  - Land transformation is one of the most significant human changes on the Earth's surface processes. Therefore,land use land cover time series are a key input for environmental monitoring, natural resources management, territorial planning enforcement at national scale. We here capitalize from the MapBiomas initiative to characterize land use land cover (LULC) change in the Gran Chaco between 2010 and 2017. Specifically we sought to a) quantify annual changes in the main LULC classes; b) identify the main LULC transitions and c) relate these transitions to current land use policies. Within the MapBiomas project, Landsat based annual maps depicting natural woody vegetation, natural herbaceous vegetation, dispersed natural vegetation, cropland, pastures, bare areas and water. We used Random Forest machine learning algorithms trained by samples produced by visual interpretation of high resolution images, Annual overall accuracy ranged from 0,73 to 0,74. Our results showed that, between 2010 and 2017, agriculture and pasture lands increased ca. 3.7 Mha while natural forestry decreased by 2.3 Mha. Transitions from forests to agriculture accounted for 1.14% of the overall deforestation while 86% was associated to pastures and natural herbaceous vegetation, In Argentina, forest loss occurred primarily (39%) on areas non considered by the territorial planning Law, followed by medium (33%), high (1.9%) and low (9%) conservation priority classes, These results illustrate the potential contribution of remote sensing to characterize complex human environmental interactions occurring over extended areas and timeframes.

AB  - This paper presents a novel machine learning approach backed by ensembling machine learning algorithms to build landslide susceptibility maps. The results reveal that this approach outperforms prior machine learning-based approaches in terms of precision, recall, and F-score for landslide susceptibility modeling. In this research, three ensemble machine learning algorithms were tested for their applicability in landslide prediction domain, namely, random forest, rotation forest, and XGBoost. A comparison between these ensemble models and the machine learning algorithms used in previous researches was also performed. In order to evaluate the model's ability to generalize results, two different study areas were used in this study, which are Ratnapura district in Sri Lanka and Glenmalure in Ireland. Several landslide conditioning features including land use, landform, vegetation index, elevation, overburden, aspect, curvature, catchment area, drainage density, distance to water streams, soil, bedrock condition, lithology and rainfall prepared by surveying, remote sensing, and deriving from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were utilized in building the spatial database. Importantly, this study introduces new landslide conditioning factors like overburden and water catchment areas which have good importance values. Further, research applies dynamic factors like rainfall and vegetation index for susceptibility map building, by making use of remote sensing data which is updated periodically. The study emphasizes the capability of ensemble approaches in generalizing results well for both study areas which inherit completely different environmental properties, and its ability to provide a scalable map building mechanism. Also, useful insights and guidelines are also provided for fellow researchers who are interested in building susceptibility maps using machine learning approaches.

AB  - We evaluated the effect that integrating annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) along different 12-month periods has on temporal models of productivity (ANPP as a linear function of annual precipitation). We studied Argentinean Patagonia, which encompasses a variety of climates and biomes. Using MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to estimate green biomass, we assessed the date of maximum annual NDVI for 2000-2016. One quarter of Patagonia (West/South region) exhibited a well-defined seasonality, with maximum NDVI during spring-summer, whereas the rest (Central/East region) showed a much less well-defined maximum NDVI, generally during fall. Then we calculated temporal models for each pixel, considering both annual and seasonal precipitation (PPT), in two ways: (i) centered models, integrating NDVI for a period centered at the actual growing season, that is, July-June for West/South region and January-December for Central/East region, and (ii) displaced models, switching the NDVI integration period. Our results indicate that, with the centered models, 84% of the Central/East region exhibited significant temporal models, but only 52% of the West/South region did. For the displaced models, 60% (40%) of pixels of Central/East (West/South) region changed their best predictor of ANPP. In general, the best predictor changed from current-year PPT to current-plus-previous-year PPT or from current-year fall to previous-year fall. Our results suggest that more attention must be paid in choosing the integration period for annual ANPP. This is more than a formal matter since the putative best predictor of ANPP can dramatically change depending on the assumed phenology.

AB  - Wildfires worldwide are becoming more frequent but are they also becoming more severe? Here we used remotely sensed burn-severity data from wildfires in Victoria, southeastern Australia to address that question. We selected 162 wildfires of more than 1000 ha that occurred over the past 30 years across a wide range of forest types. Spectral indices derived from Landsat pre- and post- fire imagery were used to map fire severity. Our results show a significant increase in the absolute and proportional area burnt by high-severity fire over the last three decades. This study demonstrates that wildfires in the temperate forests of southern Australia are becoming more severe. Such change in fire regimes may have critical consequences for the sustainability and resilience of the studied forests.

AB  - The societal benefits of satellite ocean colour include aiding the management of the marine ecosystem, helping understand the role of the ocean ecosystem in climate change, aquaculture, fisheries, coastal zone water quality, and the mapping and monitoring of harmful algal blooms. Ocean colour is also designated as an essential climate variable by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). However, in order to have confidence in earth observation data, measurements made at the surface of the Earth, with the intention of providing verification or validation of satellite mounted sensor measurements, should be trustworthy and of the same high quality as those taken with the satellite sensors themselves. In order to be trustworthy, in situ validation measurements should include an unbroken chain of SI traceable calibrations and comparisons and full uncertainty budgets for each of the in situ sensors used. This metrological traceability is beginning to be demanded by the space agencies for satellite validation measurements and, for ocean colour, should follow the guidelines and protocols of the ESA Fiducial Reference Measurements for Satellite Ocean Colour (FRM4SOC) project (www.frm4soc.org). Until now, this has not been the case for most measurements used for validation, including those taken in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean. Subsequently, the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR), in cooperation with the Laboratory of Optical Metrology (LOM), has started to follow the FRM direction by ensuring that the radiometers of its optical suite underwent SI- traceable absolute radiometric calibration. This included an estimate of the radiometry calibration uncertainty budget and was performed at the marine optical laboratory of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre prior to their deployment on the recent PERLE- 2 oceanographic cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean (Feb- Mar 2019). As well as irradiance and radiance sensors, the HCMR optical suite also houses instruments for measuring inherent optical properties (IOP) of the water column. Therefore, this paper presents the in-water radiometry matchups from PERLE-2 with Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) measurements, and investigates their validation potential. It also presents the PERLE-2 cruise profile chlorophyll and backscatter measurements that aid this effort through characterizing the light scattering and absorbing constituents that contribute to the signal detected by satellite ocean colour sensors during validation matchups.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an important physical parameter for several hydrological and agricultural applications, weather and climate predictions, as well as early warning of natural hazards such as flood and drought. It varies significantly in space and time, and it is a challenge to map its variations accurately at the regional and local scales. The aim of the present study is a comparison and validation of four models such as NDWI, SIWSI, TOTRAM and OPTRAM for SM mapping before and after flash-flood storm in arid land. The used methodology exploits two pairs of images acquired with Landsat-OLI/TIRS sensors over the study area before and after flood. The first pair was acquired two weeks before the flash flood, and the second one was collected eight days after the flood. These images were radiometrically and atmospherically corrected, as well topographically rectified using SRTM DEM. For validation purposes, before and after storm, two independent SM products were used. Both, they were derived from data acquired simultaneously with those recorded by Landsat-OLI/TIRS. The first is derived from SMOS data, and the second is compiled from rainfall data (SM-RFE) delivered by NOAA climate prediction center RFE (Rainfall Estimator) for Africa. The results revealed that TOTRAM and NDWI models converge towards the same conclusions describing accurately the drastic change of SM before and after flash-flood highlighting the impact of inundation and the mud accumulation over the study area. Their results validation against those of SMOS and SM-RFE products shows a significant agreement (R 2 of 0.95). However, in addition to its simplicity and to its easy implementation, the NDWI show a great potential for SM content estimation independently of LST using only optical data such as Landsat-OLI or Sentinel-MSI.

TI  - Sentinel-MSI and Landsat-OLI Data Quality Characterization for High Temporal Frequency Monitoring of Soil Salinity Dynamic in an Arid Landscape
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the Sentinel-MSI and Landsat-OLI are designed to be similar, they have different spectral, spatial and radiometric resolutions. In addition, relative spectral response profiles characterizing the filters responsivities of the both instruments are not identical between the homologous bands. This paper analyse the difference between the reflectance in the homologous spectral bands of MSI and OLI sensors, VNIR and SWIR, for high temporal frequency monitoring of soil salinity dynamic in an arid landscapes. In addition, their conversion in term of Soil Salinity and Sodicity Index (SSSI) and in term of Semi-Empirical Predictive Model (SEPM) for soil salinity mapping were compared. To achieve these, analyses were performed on simulated data and on two pairs of images (MSI and OLI) acquired over the same area in July 2015 and August 2017 with one day difference between each pair. The results obtained demonstrate that the statistical fits between SMI and OLI simulated reflectance over a wide range of soil samples with different salinity degrees reveals an excellent linear relationship (R-2 of 0.99) for all bands, as well as for SSSI and SEPM. The Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) values are null between the NIR and SWIR homologous bands, and are insignificant for the other bands. Moreover, the SSSI show an RMSD of 0.0007 and the SEPM express an excellent RMSD around 0.5 dS.m(-1) reflecting a relative error between 0.001 and 0.05 for non-saline and extreme salinity classes, respectively. Likewise, the two used pairs of images exhibited very significant fits (R-2 >= 0.93) for spectral band reflectance's, as well for SSSI and SEPM, yielding a RMSD values less than 0.029 for bands and less than 0.004 for SSSI. While, for SEPM, the RMSD fluctuate between 0.12 and 2.65 dS.m(-1), respectively, of non-saline and extreme salinity classes. Accordingly, we can conclude that the MSI and OLI sensors can be used jointly to monitor accurately the soil salinity and it's dynamic in time and space in arid landscape, provided that rigorous preprocessing issues must be addressed before.

AB  - Machine learning models based on satellite data have been actively researched to serve as a proxy for the prediction of socio-economic development indicators. Such models have however rarely been tested for transferability over time, i.e. whether models learned on data for a certain year are able to make accurate predictions on data for another year. Using a dataset from the Indian census at two time points, for the years 2001 and 2011, we evaluate the temporal transferability of a simple machine learning model at sub-national scales of districts and propose a generic method to improve its performance. This method can be especially relevant when training datasets are small to train a robust prediction model. Then, we go further to build an aggregate development index at the district-level, on the lines of the Human Development Index (HDI) and demonstrate high accuracy in predicting the index based on satellite data for different years. This can be used to build applications to guide data-driven policy making at fine spatial and temporal scales, without the need to conduct frequent expensive censuses and surveys on the ground.

In order to meet the precise identification for ship types, 101 SAR data and the Automatic Identification System (AIS) were used to build a SAR ship database. The database contains 5288 ship samples with different polarizations, incidence angle and resolutions, including more than 20 kinds of ship type such as cargo, container, oil tankers, and fishing boats. Furthermore, the influence of different polarization, incidence angle and heading on ship geometry parameters was analyzed. Moreover, a random forest (RF) classifier was used to carry out the ship type recognition experiment, and the classification accuracy reached more than 60%.

TI  - Utilizing Vegetation and Environmental New Micro Spacecraft (VENμS) Data to Estimate Live Fuel Moisture Content in Israel's Mediterranean Ecosystems
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing fire activity in Mediterranean ecosystems necessitates the development of new methods to quantify fire risk. Fire risk is strongly affected by live fuel moisture content (LFMC) in plants. Unfortunately, LFMC is time-consuming to measure in-situ. Remote sensing is a promising alternative to field sampling of LFMC, but existing approaches utilize sensors with high spatial resolution but infrequent revisit times, or frequent acquisition at coarse spatial grains. We developed and evaluated LFMC models for Israel's Mediterranean ecosystems using Vegetation and Environmental New Micro Spacecraft (VEN mu S), a satellite which was developed specifically for monitoring Mediterranean vegetation. We combined vegetation indices derived from VEN mu S with ancillary data to build statistical models of LFMC in six study sites located along a steep rainfall gradient. Out of the five vegetation indices we tested, only red-edge position was a significant predictor of LFMC, though its effect depended on tree cover. A model including red-edge position, tree cover, year-day, and slope-aspect explained 32.5% of the variation in LFMC. The moderate predictive power of this model was higher than expected given that VEN mu S does not have the shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands which are typically used to detect water content in plants. A comparison with six vegetation indices derived from Sentinel 2 data revealed that VEN mu S' data explained considerably more variation in LFMC, even though some Sentinel 2 VI's are based on SWIR bands. Our results suggest that VEN mu S data, combined with ancillary data, may provide a rough estimate of LFMC in Israel's Mediterranean regions and as such might be suitable for preliminary monitoring purposes.

AB  - In this paper, we analyzed the performance of wind vector field recovery from the wind lidar measurements. Wind lidar (LIDAR - Light Identification Detection And Ranging) remotely measures the wind radial speed by using the Doppler principle. Algorithms of the wind vector reconstruction using different versions of the least squares method are considered. In particular, the versions of weighted least squares (WLS) are considered, as well as the use of data spikes filtering procedures in the source data. The weights were calculated inversely with the local approximation error. As the initial data, the data of real measurements obtained in various wind conditions were used. The situations of a stationary wind field, a wind field with speed gusts, a wind field with fluctuations in direction, a wind field of variable speed and direction are considered. Lidar data were obtained for a region with a low-hilly terrain; therefore, even in the case of a stationary in time, the wind field was characterized by spatial heterogeneity. The questions of the use of regularization methods are considered. The analysis of the influence of the size of the averaging region on the quality of the recovery process was carried out.

T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In flood hazard assessment, little attention has been given to the seasonal observation of freshwater inundation using Sentinel-1 Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) images in the tropics. To assess these spatial variations, this study examined the inundation magnitudes and reflectance of riparian flora in the raining seasons (February-April and September-November) and dry-periods (May-August and December-January). The inundation areas were determined using an object-oriented classification algorithm, whilst the merits concerning the lake, riparian vegetation and shoreline were well-defined using backscatter-coefficient values. Findings indicated that the SAR images are practical to monitor inundation coverages and discern lake basin specific features such as highland areas, shoreline, water and riparian-vegetation. Seasonally, inundated sizes were comparatively higher in February (902 sq. km) and October (700 sq.km). Backscatter values of inundated parts varied from -16 dB to -19 dB, whereas those of riparian vegetation were higher in the months of May and August. This study hence displays a clear-cut correlation between riparian-vegetation, hydrology and climate variables.

TI  - Climate control of sea-ice edge phytoplankton blooms in the Hudson Bay system
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hudson Bay System (HBS), the world's largest inland sea, has experienced disproportionate atmospheric warming and sea-ice decline relative to the whole Arctic Ocean during the last few decades. The establishment of almost continuous positive atmospheric air temperature anomalies since the late 1990s impacted its primary productivity and, consequently, the marine ecosystem. Here, four decades of archived satellite ocean color were analyzed together with sea-ice and climatic conditions to better understand the response of the HBS to climate forcing concerning phytoplankton dynamics. Using satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentration [Chla], we examined the spatiotemporal variability of phytoplankton concentration with a focus on its phenology throughout the marginal ice zone. In recent years, phytoplankton phenology was dominated by two peaks of [Chla] during the ice-free period. The first peak occurs during the spring-to-summer transition and the second one happens in the fall, contrasting with the single bloom observed earlier (1978-1983). The ice-edge bloom, that is, the peak in [Chla] immediately found after the sea-ice retreat, showed substantial spatial and interannual variability. During the spring-to-summer transition, early sea-ice retreat resulted in ice-edge bloom intensification. In the northwest polynya, a marine wildlife hot spot, the correlation between climate indices, that is, the North Atlantic Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation (NAO/AO), and [Chla] indicated that the bloom responds to large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns in the North Hemisphere. The intensification of westerly winds caused by the strong polar vortex during positive NAO/AO phases favors the formation of the polynya, where ice production and export, brine rejection, and nutrient replenishment are more efficient. As a result, the winter climate preconditions the upper layer of the HBS for the subsequent development of ice-edge blooms. In the context of a decline in the NAO/AO strength related to Arctic warming, primary productivity is likely to decrease in the HBS and the northwest polynya in particular.

AB  - A dense time series of Synthetic Aperture Radar acquisitions at 6-day intervals between July), 2017 to January 2019 collected with the C-band constellation Sentinel 1A and 1B is used to study salt crust evolution in an highland salar. Microwave response of halite crystal aggregates is linked to surface roughness of the salt crusts by means of a surface scattering model which in eludes multiple scattering at second order in media with complex permittivity such as brine-soil mixtures, The time series enabled to estimate co-polarised vertical-vertical backscattering coefficient variations as large as 8.8 dB on a 4-month period which implied a height standard deviation increase from 0,5 to 4.5 mm as modeled by the surface scattering model. Backscattering coefficient variations between 0.8 to 2 dB per month are found for three (Efferent crusts, which demonstrated different growth rates of the crystals, Crystal growth rate might be driven by the kind of water input (rainfall or snow in Andean salars), probably due to the negative effect of water droplets on impinging halite crystal surface in comparison to snow. Results showed that cross-polarised backscattering coefficient is sensitive to snow accumulation and appeared to be sensitive to subsurface conditions.

T2  - OPEN THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenomenologies of religious experience have been developed by Max Scheler and via Alfred Schutz's frameworks of "multiple realities" and "finite provinces of meaning." For both, religious experience resists the pragmatic imperatives of the mechanistic worldview or world of working. Schutz's paradigm begins with a distinctive noetic religious epoche opening the religious province, in contrast with Scheler's start with spheres of being (especially the absolute sphere) furnishing the noematic context for religious acts. Scheler's religious act resembles the religious epoche but his eidetic analysis highlights the act's distinctiveness, irreducibility to non-religious acts, and immunity to psychological reductionism. Correlating the religious act with his value theory (the absolute sphere), Scheler better withstands the subordination of religion to the pragmatic imperatives and the absolute to lesser values than does a Schutzian ranking of purposes in the province's form of spontaneity. Scheler's absolute personal being, whose revelation one must respectfully wait, supports the Schutzian relaxed tension of consciousness. Respectfulness of persons, the social/communal/critical dimensions of religious experience, religion's need for critique from theoretical provinces of meaning, and the wariness of idolatrously substituting one's own finite goods for the absolute can all mitigate the religious imperialism and violence to which absolute commitments can lead.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to estimate the correlation between wheat height and the Interferometric SAR coherence. This study will serve as a validation test to our previous work [1]. In this paper, we are testing the robustness of the use of the InSAR coherence as a parameter for wheat and barley growth monitoring in a special context humid to semi-arid climate and intensive agriculture. For experimental validation, the height of wheat crops was determined through the different phenological stage. In the same period of field campaign, twelve sentinel-1 images were acquired over the Lebna watershed. From these images interferometric coherence pairs were extracted and compared to the height variation of wheat and barley. Results showed a high correlation between height and interferometric coherence for the sites where the vegetation is dense (r=0.9). But when the soil component is important the correlation is weak (r=0.5).

AB  - Landslides are one of the major emergency situations that lead to huge damage and human victims. A monitoring system to reduce the effects of landslides is mandatory under these circumstances. In this paper, we propose an automatic landslide detection algorithm based on the use of multispectral remote sensing data. The compressed representation of the spatial and spectral data is obtained using the encoder part of a Convolutional Autoencoder architecture, whereas the separation of the landslide area is achieved through a K-Means unsupervised clustering algorithm. The data used for experiments was collected for areas in Romania severely affected by landslides, for a period of approximately 2-3 months before and after the event. Satellite images can be acquired from the Earth Explorer platform and Google Earth Engine.

AB  - The machine learning algorithms are an essential tool to measure the impact that severe weather has on the environment. Addressing the land cover changes generated by extreme natural phenomena, in this paper, we present the ability of the bag-of-words (BoW) framework for change detection in remote sensing images. Regarding this, we used Sentinel-2 images related to two case studies: the massive bushfires from Kangaroo Island, on January 2020, and 2019 Midwestern U.S floods. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methodology can achieve promising performance for both fires and floods scenarios.

AB  - The article has a memorial character. It provides a brief overview of the contribution of M. D. Yasnov to the development of modern poetry for children and highlights his role as an organizer of poetic space. The study notes the characteristic techniques of language game in children's verses, which draw the child's attention to sounds and letters, word composition, role of function words and homonymy. The predominance of classical poetry meter is combined with the richness of the subject sphere of his poetry and unexpected intonation patterns, the richness of the emotional palette and genre diversity. The authors outline the parameters of the poetic world of childhood in the books ofYasnov, the gradual expansion of the child's outlook from their home, yard and school to the open world of nature and society. With equal attention, Yasnov portrays large and small objects, from outer space to a blade of grass, reproduces the children's mythological worldview, where everything turns out to be interconnected. The establishment of cultural tics between different national literatures is facilitated by the translation activities ofYasnov. The Petersburg poet Yasnov inherits the tradition of acmeism with its pathos of dialogue with the world culture. The authors make a conclusion about the unity of Yasnov's poetic system in its different areas translations, poems for children, and "adult" poems. The conclusion is illustrated by the poems from the book "Ambidexter", supplemented with an analysis of the poem "U shveynoy mashinki ni dnya peredyshki..." [A sewing machine has not a day ofrespite...], which allows one to see the significance of the theme of historical memory in Yasnov's work. The material presented is not only a tribute to the memory of the remarkable poet; it is of interest to practical teachers of Russian literature.

AB  - Periodic vegetation patterns (PVP) arise from the interplay between forces that drive the growth and mortality of plants. Inter-plant competition for resources, in particular water, can lead to the formation of PVP. Arid and semi-arid ecosystems may be under threat due to changing precipitation dynamics driven by macroscopic changes in climate. These regions display some noteable examples of PVP, for example the "tiger bush" patterns found in West Africa. The morphology of the periodic pattern has been suggested to be linked to the resilience of the ecosystem. Using remote sensing techniques, vegetation patterns in these regions can be studied, and an analysis of the resilience of the ecosystem can be performed. The `pyveg` package implements functionality to download and process data from Google Earth Engine (GEE), and to subsequently perform a resilience analysis on the adquired data. PVP images are quantified using network centrality metrics. The results of the analysis can be used to search for typical early warning signals of an ecological collapse. Google Earth Engine Editor scripts are also provided to help researchers discover locations of ecosystems which may be in decline. `pyveg` is being developed as part of a research project looking for evidence of early warning signals of ecosystem collapse using remote sensing data. `pyveg` allows such research to be carried out at scale, and hence can be an important tool in understanding changing arid and semi-arid ecosystem dynamics. {"references": ["Bury, T.

TI  - Soil erosion assessment using revised universal soil loss equation model and geo-spatial technology: A case study of upper Tuirial river basin, Mizoram, India
T2  - AIMS GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is one of the major environmental problems in northeast India, and identifying areas prone to severe erosion loss is therefore very crucial for sustainable management of different land uses. Tuirial river basin, where shifting cultivation is a major land use, is prone to severe soil erosion and land degradation, linked to its fragile geo-morpho-pedological characteristics. Though several models are available to estimate soil erosion the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) is more appropriate and practical model that can be applied at a local or regional level. The objective of the study was to estimate annual soil loss in the upper Tuirial river basin by using RUSLE where various parameters such as rainfall erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), slope length (L), slope steepness factor (S), crop management factor (C) and practice management factor (P) were taken into consideration. Land use land cover (LULC) derived from Satellite data of Sentinel 2A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were integrated into the model. Our results revealed that the river basin has an average annual soil loss of 115.4 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), and annual sediments loss to the tune of 6.161 million Mg yr(-1) from the basin. About one-fourth (24.78%) of the total basin could be classed as very high to very severe soil erosion prone area that need immediate conservation measures. Besides, the erosional activities were perceived directly proportional with the slope values in the basin. However, regardless of the rugged mountainous terrain of the basin, the unscientific practice of shifting cultivation, associated with high intensity of rainfall is the principal cause of soil erosion. The results of the study is expected to contribute to adaptation of appropriate soil and water conservation measures in the basin area, and similar studies may also be extended to other unexplored areas for proper watershed management in state of Mizoram.

AB  - Man is not the only living creature on our planet. In order to remain man in the highest sense of the word, he must build his relations on the basis of the principle of humanism, not only with his own kind, but also with all living beings. Bioethics is essentially a kind of a model of a person's relationship with all living things in this world. However, while the worldview principle of anthropocentrism dominates the world, the principles of bioethics cannot be fully realised. Such an attitude not only violates the principle of co-evolution, but inevitably destroys the spiritual world of man. The aim of this article is to explicate bioethics as humanism which gives the relationship between humans and animals an axiological character in which the life of an animal is considered of value. The work emphasises the relevance of replacing the principle of anthropocentrism with the principle of biocentrism, which implies a humane attitude to everything living in the world. The principles of bioethics are more consistent with the principle of harmonious coexistence of man and nature, the implementation of the proper attitude of man to living beings, located below him on the evolutionary ladder. The process of personality education should involve not only the acquisition of knowledge, the assimilation of moral norms of behaviour regarding people, but also the formation of their practical readiness and the need for a humane attitude to animals. An important task of mankind is conservation of biological diversity on our planet.

AB  - After earthquakes, international and national organizations must overcome many challenges in rescue operations. Among these, the knowledge of the territory and of the roads is fundamental for international aid. The maps that volunteers make are a valuable asset, showing the roads in the area affected by the seismic events, a knowledge which is necessary to bring rescue. This was very helpful during many earthquakes as in Haiti (on 2010-01-12) and in Nepal (on 2015-04-25) to support the humanitarian organizations. Many volunteers can contribute remotely to mapping little known or inaccessible regions with crowdsourcing actions, by tracing maps from satellite imagery or aerial photographs even if staying far from the affected site.This research, still in progress, aims at experiencing quickly obtaining roads through the so-called Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA), by extracting it from satellite data, semi-automatically or automatically, with a segmentation that starts from concepts of Mathematical Morphology. We compared it with a classification in ENVI and, using an algorithm in GIS, we verified the goodness of the method.The good results obtained encourage further research on fast techniques for map integration for humanitarian emergencies moreover the results were implemented on open street map.

T2  - REVISTA VORTEX-VORTEX MUSIC JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Following Bourdieu (2000), I assume that the understanding of the symbolical forms of artistic representation depends on the understanding of the "worldview" of the social group to which the artist belongs and from which he creates his works. This perspective, when applied to the studies dedicated to the German musical poetics of the Sixteenth, Seventeenth and Eighteenth centuries, justifies the recovery of the theological-political fundaments of this tradition and the elaboration of its understanding. Besides that, it demands the reestablishment of the structural homologies between them and the creative principles of the music, evidencing the religious and political nature of the musical act, compromised with the maintenance of the social order, the construction of the common good and God's design. In addition to composing and performing, this act implied a commitment to making musical discourse intelligible to the public and accessible to future generations of composers, as material for imitation.

TI  - Landsat-8 TIRS Thermal Radiometric Calibration Status
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) has been acquiring two-band thermal infrared images of the Earth's surface since 2013. The calibration of the two-band system has been monitored using the on-board calibrator and validated with vicarious calibration performed by NASA/JPL and RIT since launch. Soon after launch, it was discovered that the instrument had a significant stray light effect that was affecting the radiometric calibration. The stray light was corrected in the processing system in 2017. Since then, it has become apparent that there was an additional radiometric error, based on the vicarious calibration results.With a failure within the primary electronic system and subsequent switch to the redundant electronic system, the TIRS instrument effectively has two separate calibration regimes. The vicarious calibration found a statistically significant calibration error, primarily a constant over time, in Band 11 on the primary electronics (Feb 11, 2013 through March 5, 2015) of about -0.6K at 300K. The calibration error in Band 10 was smaller though still statistically significant at about 0.2K at 300K.On the redundant side (March 5, 2015 to present), the calibration error is more signal dependent than time dependent. Both bands are affected, with Band 10 having an error between 1K and -0.4K (between 273-320K) and Band 11 having an error between 0.8K and -1.44K (between 273-320K).This calibration error will be corrected within the USGS Landsat Product Generation System with the release of Landsat Collection-2 products.The Collection-2 release also includes a correction to the relative radiometric calibration of TIRS data. Striping as a result of poor detector-to-detector normalization has been increasing in the imagery since launch. The TIRS relative radiometric calibration will be updated based on internal calibrator data to remove the stripes on a quarterly basis. The visible stripes are generally at 0.1-0.2% level, though there are some detectors in each band that have changed by 1% or more. The Collection-2 release will result in much more uniform TIRS images.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping alone compared to more extensive lymphadenectomy in patients with uterine serous carcinoma
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The objective of our study was to assess survival among patients with uterine serous carcinoma (USC) undergoing sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping alone versus patients undergoing systematic lymphadenectomy (LND).Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients undergoing primary surgical treatment for newly diagnosed USC at our institution from 1/1/1996-12/31/2017. Patients were assigned to either SLN mapping alone (SLN cohort) or systematic LND without SLN mapping (LND cohort). Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method, compared using Logrank test.Results: 245 patients were available for analysis: 79 (32.2%) underwent SLN, 166 (67.7%) LND. 132 (79.5%) in the LND cohort had paraaortic LND (PALND) versus none in the SLN cohort. Median age: 66 and 68 years in the SLN and LND cohorts, respectively (p>0.05). Proportion of stage I/II disease: 67.1% (n = 53) and 64.5% (n = 107) in the SLN and LND cohorts, respectively (p>0.05). Median follow-up: 23 (range, 1 -96) and 66 months (range, 4-265) in the SLN and LND cohorts, respectively (p < 0.001). Two-year OS in stage I/II disease (n = 160, 60.1%): 96.6% (SE +/- 3.4) and 89.6% (SE +/- 2.2) in the SLN and LND cohorts, respectively (p = 0.8). Two-year OS in stage III disease (n = 77): 73.6% (SE +/- 10.2) and 77.3% (SE +/- 5.8) in the SLN and LND cohorts, respectively (p = 0.8).Conclusions: SLN mapping alone and systematic LND yielded similar survival outcomes in stage I-III USC. In our practice, the SLN algorithm has replaced systematic LND as the primary staging modality in this setting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGICAL METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Infections, autoimmunity and cancer play a role as determinants of etiology in Hepatitis C virus (HCV) related mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC). Several factors of risk have been suggested as markers of pathogenesis and progression of HCV-related MC into B cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (B-NHL). Here, we evaluated IgG subclass distribution, free light chains (FLCs) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a new combination of biomarkers.Methods: We measured IgG1-4 subclasses, FLCs and VEGF levels in sera 53 from HCV-related MC, in comparison with 40 sera from HCV negative patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 30 from healthy blood donors (HBD).Results: IgG3 levels were significantly higher in HCV-MC patients with a decrement of IgG2 and IgG4; FLC levels significantly increased in both MC and RA patients' groups; serological VEGF was higher in HCV-MC patients than in HBD in correlation with k and lambda levels.Conclusion: Our results suggest that a specific IgG subclasses pattern together with raised levels of FLCs and VEGF could represent the biomarker "signature" of an inflammation multistage of acquired immune system.

TI  - Analysis of Land Use Changed in Ponorogo Based on Landsat 8 Imaginary using NDVI Classification
T2  - 8TH ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE 2019

CP  - 8th Engineering International Conference (EIC)
CL  - Univ Negeri Semarang, Engn Fac, Semarang, INDONESIA
AB  - Land use is a form of human intervention inland to meet the needs of both material needs and spiritual needs. Land use analysis is important for agricultural planning, urbanization and environmental studies. Remote-sensing data and GIS are an appropriate tool for the assessment of the global land-use change and environmental monitoring because of its spatial and temporal coverage capabilities. The change detection and assessment of land use using geospatial information allow the user to monitor land user over the large area and over a period of time. This study aims to classify land use in Ponorogo using Landsat 8 imagery. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is used for the mapping of changes in the land cover. In this study the NDVI based classification has indicated about significant change in land use between year 2015 and 2017. The major change has been found in areas with dense vegetation such as forest, farm, where about 4.22% of areas have been degraded between year 2015 and 2017.

TI  - Isostatic constraint for 2D nonlinear gravity inversion on rifted margins
T2  - GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed a nonlinear gravity inversion for simultaneously estimating the basement and Moho geometries, as well as the depth of the reference Moho along a profile crossing a passive rifted margin. To obtain stable solutions, we impose smoothness on basement and Moho, force them to be close to previously estimated depths along the profile and also impose local isostatic equilibrium. Different from previous methods, we evaluate the information of local isostatic equilibrium by imposing smoothness on the lithostatic stress exerted at depth. Our method delimits regions that deviate and those that can be considered in local isostatic equilibrium by varying the weight of the isostatic constraint along the profile. It also allows controlling the degree of equilibrium along the profile, so that the interpreter can obtain a set of candidate models that fit the observed data and exhibit different degrees of isostatic equilibrium. Our method also differs from earlier studies because it attempts to use isostasy for exploring (but not necessarily reducing) the inherent ambiguity of gravity methods. Tests with synthetic data illustrate the effect of our isostatic constraint on the estimated basement and Moho reliefs, especially at regions with pronounced crustal thinning, which are typical of passive volcanic margins. Results obtained by inverting satellite data over the Pelotas Basin, a passive volcanic margin in southern Brazil, agree with previous interpretations obtained independently by combining gravity, magnetic, and seismic data available to the petroleum industry. These results indicate that combined with a priori information, simple isostatic assumptions can be very useful for interpreting gravity data on passive rifted margins.

AB  - An archive of cloud amount in the Mediterranean-Black Sea region in 1984-2009 has been formed using satellite data from the Meteosat satellites. The procedures for decoding satellite images and automatical identifying of the cloud amount from single-channel satellite shots made by the Meteosat satellite in the infrared range were used. The procedure based on the analysis of the time series of radiation temperature at fixed "points" on the earth has shown an advantage over the results obtained using the simple threshold filter. To assess the uniformity and quality of the data of the generated archive, annual and monthly mean cloud amounts were compared with the satellite data archives of the ISCCP and ground-based observations of SYNOP. For a qualitative comparison of all the archives, annual mean values of the cloud amount, standard deviations and correlation coefficients between them were calculated. Correlation coefficients for monthly mean cloud numbers between the archives were 0.71-0.95 at the level of 99% confidence, and standard deviations in winter over the sea were 0.7 and over the land up to 0.9. The cloud amount error was determined by the gradations (score) and was performed for two satellite archives and the archive of ground-based observations. The errors that arise when assessing the quality of the cloud data from satellite and ground-based observations depend on the features of their detection, observation, and the processing techniques. The obtained data array showed that the zone of the maximum cloud amount over the Black Sea in winter indicates the active stage of the Black Sea depression, with its typical stationary atmospheric front. The results of the Fourier analysis showed the presence of a quasi-two-year harmonic, with the largest amplitude of oscillations occurring in winter and spring, and the smallest in summer.

CP  - SPIE Future Sensing Technologies Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - In recent years, unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) are frequently used in many different applications of photogrammetry such as building damage monitoring, archaeological mapping and vegetation monitoring. In this paper, a new vertical take-off and landing fixed-wing UAS is proposed to robust photogrammetry missions, called SAMA-VTOL. In this study, the capability of SAMA-VTOL is investigated for generating orthophoto. The major stages are including designing, building and experimental scenario. First, a brief description of design and build is introduced. Next, an experiment was done to generate accurate orthophoto with minimum ground control points requirements. The processing step, which includes automatic aerial triangulation with camera calibration and model generation. In this regard, the Pix4Dmapper software was used to orientate the images, produce point clouds, creating digital surface model and generating orthophoto mosaic. Experimental results based on the test area covering 26.3 hectares indicate that our SAMA-VTOL performs well in the orthophoto mosaic task.

AB  - Accurate near-surface soil moisture (theta; similar to 5 cm) estimation is one of the most crucial challenges in agricultural management and hydrological studies. This study aims to map theta at high spatiotemporal resolution (17 m grid size, satellite overpass of 6 days) in a small-scale agroforestry experimental site (similar to 30 ha) in southern Italy. The observation period is from November 2018 until March 2019. We employed an ensemble machine-learning method based on Random Forest (RF) to map theta. This RF method is based on three input data types: i) Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements, ii) terrain features, and iii) supporting values of sparse point-scale theta simulated in HYDRUS-1D. We propose two different approaches to obtain supporting theta simulations via inverse modeling in HYDRUS-1D. The first approach is based on theta simulated in HYDRUS-1D, which was calibrated on soil moisture data monitored at two soil depths of 15 cm and 30 cm over 20 positions belonging to the SoilNet wireless sensor network installed in the experimental site. The second approach is based on the downscaling of field-scale theta simulated in HYDRUS-1D which was calibrated on Cosmic-Ray Neutron Probe (CRNP) data. The field-scale theta was downscaled in order to obtain sparse point-scale supporting theta over the same 20 positions by using the physical-empirical Equilibrium Moisture from Topography (EMT) model. The CRNP-based approach performed similarly to the one based on SoilNet data. Therefore, this study highlights the enormous potential for modeling reliable theta maps by integrating soft data such as S1 SAR-based measurements, topographic information, and CRNP data, having the advantage of being non-invasive and easy to maintain.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to present an approach for mapping irrigated areas at plot scale using the Sentinel-1 radar time series. Over a study site located in Catalonia region of north Spain, a dense temporal series of Si backscattering coefficients were first obtained at plot scale and grid scale (10km x 10km). The S1 time series at plot and grid scales were conjointly used to remove the ambiguity between rainfall events and irrigation events. The principal component analysis (PCA) and the wavelet transformation were applied to the SAR temporal series. Then, to classify irrigated/non-irrigated plots the random forest (RF) classifier was employed using the obtained principal components (PC) and the wavelet coefficients (WT). A convolutional neural network was also tested using the prepared Si temporal series. The result of the classification reaches 90.7% and 89.1% using the PC and the WT in a random forest classifier respectively. The accuracy of the classification reaches 94.1% using the CNN.

TI  - A patient- and assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial of axillary reverse mapping (ARM) in patients with early breast cancer
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in breast cancer patients is infamous for its accompanying morbidity. Selective preservation of upper extremity lymphatic drainage and accompanying lymph nodes crossing the axillary basin - currently resected during a standard ALND - has been proposed as a valuable surgical refinement.Methods: Peroperative Axillary Reversed Mapping (ARM) was used for selective preservation of upper extremity lymphatic drainage. A multicentre patient- and assessor-blinded randomized study was performed in clinical node negative, sentinel node positive early breast cancer patients. Patients were randomized to undergo either standard-ALND or ARM-ALND. Primary outcome was the presence of surgery-related lymphedema at six, 12 and 24 months post-operatively. Secondary outcomes included patient reported and objective signs and symptoms of lymphedema, pain, paraesthesia, numbness, loss of shoulder mobility, quality of life and axillary recurrence risk.Results: No significant differences were found between both groups using the water displacement method with respect to measured lymphedema. ARM-ALND resulted in less reported complaints of lymphedema at six, 12 and 24 months postoperatively (p <0.05). No axillary recurrence was found in both groups.Conclusions: In contrast to results of volumetric measurement, patient reported outcomes support selective sparing of the upper extremity lymphatic drainage using ARM as valuable surgical refinement in case of ALND in clinically node negative, sentinel node positive early breast cancer. If completion ALND in clinically node negative, sentinel node positive early breast cancer is considered, selective sparing of upper extremity axillary lymphatics by implementing ARM should be carried out in order to reduce morbidity.

AB  - Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) is a technique by which the lymphatic drainage system of the upper extremities is mapped, so that the lymph channels and glands can be preserved during axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). This can lead to less postoperative morbidity, such as lymphoedema. A randomised multicentre study showed that there are statistically significantly fewer post-operative symptoms if the lymph channels and glands of the upper extremities are spared with this technique. Despite the declining indication for an ALND, ARM can have added value for the patients who do have to undergo ALND.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and reliable greenhouse mapping using remotely sensed data and image classification methods has a significant role since it can comprehensively improve the urban and rural planning, and sustainable natural resource and agricultural management. This research is mainly focused on the determination of greenhouses from SPOT-7 and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) images by using an object-based image classification method with three different classifiers which are k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) in the selected test region. First, the image acquired by using multi-resolution segmentation. Second, spectral features, textural features, and remote sensing indices were obtained for each image object. Third, different classifiers were employed to classify greenhouses. Then, classification accuracy assessment analysis was conducted to test the agreement between the classified data and field collected data using the confusion matrix. The results highlighted that the KNN and RF classifier have a slightly higher overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa statistics for SPOT-7 image with the 91.43% and 0.88. Furthermore, the KNN classifier for Sentinel-2 MSI image has the highest OA and Kappa statistics of 88.38% and 0.83. The achieved results underlined the potential of Sentinel-2 MSI and SPOT-7 data for object-based greenhouse mapping using different machine learning classifiers in the Mediterranean Region.

AB  - This study evaluated the relationship between mapping accuracy and computing time when detecting burned areas from Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter coefficient images processed at different pixel spacing (i.e., 20, 30, 40 and 50 m). The analysis was carried out in six study areas distributed worldwide. An existing burned area algorithm, based on Sentinel-1 Cband post- to pre-fire backscatter coefficient differences and the Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detector was used to detect and map burned areas. Marginal differences in accuracy were observed when varying the spatial spacing with slightly more accurate products being obtained at higher spacing as speckle was reduced. However, the computing time was considerably higher when processing at the lowest spacing (20 m) in comparison to the remaining pixel spacing tested. The results suggest that detecting burned areas at 30 to 50 m pixel spacing from Cband backscatter provides significant advantages over large areas (i.e., continental to global scales) while also improving the detection accuracy.

TI  - SOIL-TRANSMITTED HELMINTHIASIS MORBIDITY CONTROLLED IN SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN IN ABRA, THE PHILIPPINES
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aimed to determine the prevalence and intensity of soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) in Lagayan and San Juan municipalities in Abra Province, the Philippines. School-age children (SAC) from selected barangays (villages) were examined for parasitic infections using Kato-Katz technique following sentinel surveillance methodology. Barangay-level data on 2019 preventive chemotherapy coverage in SAC and 2018 sanitary toilet coverage, as well as municipality-level stunting and underweight prevalence in 2018 were obtained from the Department of Health. A total of 487 SAC were examined. Overall prevalence of any STH was 2.7%, with 2.0% in Lagayan and 3.4% in San Juan; all cases with just light intensity. Prevalence of ascariasis and trichuriasis were 1.4% and 2.1%, respectively, with no hookworm infection found. STH morbidity in SAC may have been controlled in the two municipalities. Once STH morbidity control in pre-SAC and SAC has been validated, the province may be a suitable pilot area for moving towards STH transmission interruption, which will require improving water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and utilizing more sensitive and specific diagnostics. Abra may also serve as a model for other provinces and regions on how STH morbidity in SAC may be controlled.

TI  - Axillary nodal irradiation practice in the sentinel lymph node biopsy era: Comparison of the contemporary available 3D and IMRT techniques
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Our study aimed to compare regional node coverage and doses to the organ at risk (OAR) using conventional technique (CT) vs "AMAROS" (AT) vs intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques in patients receiving regional nodal irradiation (RNI) for breast cancer (BC).Methods: We included 30 consecutive patients with BC who received RNI including axillary nodes. Two independent and blinded dosimetric RNI plans were generated for all patients. For target volume coverage, we analyzed the V95%, the D95%, the mean and the minimal dose within the nodal station. For hotspots within nodal target volume, we used the V105%, the V108% and the maximal doses. For OAR, lung V20, mean lung and heart doses, the maximal dose to the brachial plexus and the axillary-lateral thoracic vessel junction region were compared between the three techniques.Results: Target volume coverage and hotspots: Mean V95% in stations I, II, Ill and IV were 35.8% and 75% respectively with CV, 22.59 and 59.9% respectively with AT technique and 45.58 and 99.6% respectively with IMRT with statistically significant differences (p < 0.001). Mean V105% (cc) in axillary and supraclavicular stations were 21.3 and 6.4 respectively with CV, 1,2 and 0.02 respectively with AT technique and 0.5 and 0.4 respectively with IMRT with statistically significant differences (p < 0.001). OARs: OARs: The mean ipsilateral lung V20 was 16.9%, 16.4 and 13.3% with CT, AT and IMRT respectively. The mean heart dose (Gy) was 0.3, 0.2 and 0.2 with CT, AT and IMRT respectively. The maximal dose to the plexus brachial (Gy) was 50.3, 46.3 and 47.3 with CT, AT and IMRT respectively. The maximal dose to the axillary-lateral thoracic vessel junction (Gy) was 52.3, 47.3 and 47.6 with CT, AT and IMRT respectively. The differences were statistically significant for all OAR (p < 0.001).Conclusion: AT is a valuable technique for RNI including axilla in patients with limited sentinel lymph node biopsy involvement without additional axillary lymph node dissection since it decreases hotspots in the target volume and lowers the radiation exposure of the OAR. For more advanced tumors or patients who did not respond to primary systemic therapy, CT or IMRT should be considered because of their better coverage of the potentially residual nodal disease. IMRT combines several advantages of offering high conformal plans, limited hotspots and protection of main OAR. The clinical impact of these dosimetric differences need to be addressed.Advances in knowledge: This study is to our knowledge the first to compare conventional three-dimensional and IMRT techniques for regional nodal irradiation for each nodal station in breast cancer in a context of increasing utilization of axillary irradiation.

AB  - Renewable energy sources (RES) are characterized by high variability and limited predictability, mostly due to their dependence on meteorological factors. This variability presents technical and financial challenges for RES integration into grids and electricity markets. To address these challenges, it is important to accurately predict the future amount of energy production. In this paper we propose a spot statistical forecasting model for very short-term horizons (from a few minutes up to six hours ahead). This model is based on a combination of heterogeneous inputs with a conditioned learning approach. Spatio-temporal inputs (measurements from geographically distributed PV sites and satellite images) are used to enhance short-term predictability, while a weather analog approach enables adaptability to changes in meteorological conditions by considering the most relevant past observations. The performance evaluations are carried out on a case study featuring nine PV plants located in France, over a one-year period.

AB  - Management of regional lymph nodes in patients with melanoma has evolved significantly in recent years. The value of nodal intervention, long utilized for its perceived therapeutic benefit, has now shifted to that of a critical prognostic procedure used to guide clinical decision making. This review focuses on the three landmark, randomized controlled trials evaluating the role of surgery for regional lymph nodes in melanoma: Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial I (MSLT-I), German Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group-Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial (DeCOG-SLT), and Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial II (MSLT-II).

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data are widely used to monitor deformation phenomena impacting the Earth's surface (e.g. landslides, glacier motions, subsidence, and volcano deformations) and infrastructures (e.g. bridges, dams, buildings). The analysis is generally performed using the Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) technique that exploits the phase information of SAR data. However, this technique suffers for lack of coherence among the considered stack of images, and it can only be adopted to monitor slow deformation phenomena. In the field of geohazards monitoring and glacier melting, the Offset Tracking technique has been also widely investigated. This approach is based on the amplitude information only but it reaches worse accuracy compared to DInSAR. To overcome the limitations of DInSAR and Offset Tracking, in the last decade, a new technique called Imaging Geodesy has been investigated exploiting the amplitude information and the precise orbit of the modern SAR platforms (i.e. TerraSAR-X, COSMO-SkyMed). In this study, an investigation of using COSMO-SkyMed data for Earth surface monitoring was performed. The developed approach was applied to a set of imagery acquired over the Corvara (Northern Italy) area, which is affected by a fast landslide with yearly displacements up to meters. Specifically, two well identifiable and stable human-made Amplitude Persistent Scatterers (APSs) were considered to estimate the residual errors of COSMO-SkyMed sensor during the acquisition period between 2010 and 2015. Then, the same methodology was applied to estimate the displacement of a Corner Reflector (CR) located in the landslide area. Finally, the results were compared to the available GPS reference trend showing a good agreement.

AB  - The article deals with the features of verbal and non-verbal creativity of Conservatory students. The study used: methods for diagnosing verbal creativity (adapted version of The S. Mednik RAT test), methods for diagnosing nonverbal creativity (short version of the Torrens test), and the "picture of the world" method. The purpose of the study was to study the features of verbal and non-verbal creativity and the image of the world of students, as well as to study their relationships. Three groups of students: low, moderate, and high level of creativity, which describes the inherent types of the world picture, the features of the development of the creativity indices. It was shown that there are significant differences in the development of verbal creativity in the originality index for students with medium and low, medium and high, low and high levels of nonverbal creativity, and in the uniqueness index for students with high and low levels of nonverbal creativity. It was found that for students with a low level of creativity, the landscape picture of the world is more pronounced, and for students with a high level of nonverbal creativity, the abstract picture of the world is more pronounced. Some significant relationships between creativity and the features of the students ' worldview are highlighted.

AB  - Earth remote sensing data obtained by various sensors are usually different in spatial and spectral resolution and in the registration time as well. Changes in observation conditions lead to brightness distortions, some of which are compensated by atmospheric correction. Unfortunately, the distortions in the composition of the scene (scene distortions) cannot be compensated using atmospheric correction and require fusion methods to be applied. The existing super-resolution methods for remote sensing data are based on the assumption that there are no scene distortions in the analyzed images. In this article, we propose an algorithm for combining Earth remote sensing data with an increase in the spectral and spatial resolution taking into account scene distortions. We found that the use of a larger dataset including images with scene distortions reduces root mean square error of 2-4% on average if the dataset contains a small number of images without scene distortions (from 2 to 6). With the larger number of images without scene distortions, the error value decreases by 1%. If all the images in the input dataset contain scene distortions, the proposed algorithm achieves super-resolution restoration of the scene image as well.

AB  - Super-resolution remote sensing data fusion aims to compose the output image with the higher spatial and spectral resolution from the lower resolution input ones captured for the same territory. The images used for fusion are usually multi-temporal. However, existing multi-temporal image fusion methods exploit only cloud-free images that might be difficult to obtain for some territories where the weather conditions are moderately cloudy during the observation period. In this paper, the clouds and their shadows are considered as scene distortions i.e. significant local changes in brightness caused by some opaque objects or their shadows partially overlapping the scene at the moment of image registration. Here, we propose a multi-temporal remote sensing data fusion method adapted to the dataset containing images partially occupied by scene distortions. The method is based on gradient descent optimization procedure with scene distortion elimination in each iteration. The experiments with the modeled data revealed that our method provides spatial and spectral super-resolution even for datasets including images with scene distortions. In comparison with the scene-distortion free case, the proposed method reduces a root mean square error of the resulting image from 2 to 4% on average in the case of the mixed data sets with few undistorted images (from two to six). The overall research has shown that in the case of lack of the data without scene distortions, additional partially distorted images can be used to obtain better fusion results.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability of Coastal Retreat Rates at Western Yamal Peninsula, Russia, based on Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The work aims at estimating coastal retreat at Western Yamal from 1972 to 2016, when significant climate change occurred in the Arctic. One fourth of the Kara Sea coasts are collapsing cliffs composed of permafrost, i.e. thermoabrasional coasts. Although these coasts are bounded by sea ice for most of the year, they retreat with rates comparable to those of temperate latitudes, but only during the short ice-free period. Permafrost cliffs are not only eroded by waves; they also get destroyed by melting of the ground ice bounding the sediments (thermo-denudation). Arctic coasts are sensitive to climate change, as rising summer air temperatures lead to deeper thawing of frozen sediments, and longer ice-free periods extend the time of the wave impact on the coast. At Western Yamal, in the area of Kharasavey gas condensate field, the average long-term coastal retreat rate is 1.3 m/yr (1972-2016) for 5.9 km of the coastline, reaching mean annual rates of 3 m/yr in some areas. The greatest retreat rates are typical for coastal segments composed of permafrost with high ice content. Based on the analysis of multitemporal aerial and space images, the coastal retreat rates for four time periods between 1972 and 2016 were estimated. The retreat rates were brought into context with data on sediment composition and type (grain size, ice content, presence of massive ice), reconstructed evolution of hydrometeorological parameters and the history of economic development of Kharasavey area. Unlike other Kara Sea sites of coastal dynamics' monitoring, the strongest coastal retreat rates at Kharasavey were observed earlier in 1977-1988, when the hydrometeorological stress was low, implying vulnerability of the coasts to significant anthropogenic impact at the beginning of the gas field development.

TI  - Simulation-Based Feasibility Analysis of Ship Detection Using GNSS-R Delay-Doppler Maps
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we carry out a simulation analysis of ship detection via Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) delay-Doppler map (DDM). The GNSS-R DDM simulator used here is a modified version of an algorithm conceived for the generation of GNSS-R DDMs of the sea surface. The new algorithm is based on an analytical model for the radar cross section of ships and is able to properly account for the presence of ship targets within the scene. The proposed GNSS-R DDM simulator is, then, exploited for assessing the viability of GNSS-R in ship detection applications at low incidence angles, where the adopted scattering models provide accurate results. The aim of the implemented simulation setup is to analyze what are the preferable conditions for ship detection using standard GNSS-R signal processing chain receiver and compare typical forward left-hand circularly polarized GNSS-R systems with nonstandard backward right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) GNSS-R. The simulation study is two fold: first, detection performance is evaluated at spaceborne and airborne altitudes for both polarization channels under favorable detection conditions. Then, visibility of ship targets is assessed in terms of their location within the DDM. Simulation results show that ship detection is problematic when using satellite data, whereas interesting results are achieved at airborne altitudes, provided that the aircraft is approximately between the GNSS satellite and the target, and that appropriate RHCP polarization is probed. In such configurations, signal-to-noise-ratios larger than 10 dB are obtained with airborne receivers collecting the RHCP signal.

AB  - We use high resolution satellite Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data to study surface deformation at Kilauea Volcano from January to September 2015. This period includes an episode of heightened activity in May 2015, which we refer to as 'the May 2015 event'. The data set consists of 25 descending and 15 ascending acquisitions of the Sentinel-la satellite in Interferometric Wide swath mode. We identify at least two stages of surface deformation and volcanic activity during the May 2015 event which we attribute to the movement of magma and pressure changes in response to a magma supply and withdrawal imbalance in the shallow plumbing system. In particular, we model the deformation sources attributed to the Halema'uma'u Reservoir (HMMR) and Southern Caldera Reservoir (SCR). The SCR was best described by inflation of a spheroidal source at 2.8 (2.65-3.07) km depth below the Southern caldera region. The HMMR source was modelled by a point source deflation located East of the Halema'uma'u crater at 1.5 (0.95-2.62) km depth.

AB  - Mapping agriculture with high accuracy is important to generate reliable information about crop production. Pixel-based methods still present problems with noise and usually require post-processing approaches to reach satisfactory results. Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) enable the detection of homogeneous objects in remote sensing images based on spectral similarity. However, traditional OBIA does not consider the multi-temporal characteristics of land cover or land use, such as agriculture. The objective of this study is to evaluate a phenological object-based approach with dense Landsat image time series for mapping agriculture in different level of detail in the Brazilian Cerrado. We derived pixel-wise EVI fitted time series with 8-day temporal resolution and applied multi-resolution segmentation using all image bands to incorporate the influence of space and time. Then we generated phenological metrics and applied OBIA of agricultural lands in Brazil using a hierarchical classification scheme. The overall accuracies for each hierarchical level were around 90%, and the spatial consistency of the generated maps is promising.

The core and more innovative algorithm of the methodology is based on PCNNs (Pulse Couple Neural Networks), which perform the change detection task, while a standard Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) topology is considered to identify the type of changes occurred. The paper aims at providing a complete automatic processing chain usable also for extended areas. In fact, the PCNNs, being unsupervised networks, are inherently automatic. On the other hand, MLPs, which are supervised networks, are assumed to be learned off-line and plugged into the workflow without further training. The experimental results, which have been obtained over various urban areas in the city of Rome, are encouraging and confirm the validity of the considered approach.

AB  - In this work, a remote sensing unmixing-based method is used for detecting and mapping kaolinite deposits in the Algerian Central Hoggar. The used approach, related to linear spectral unmixing techniques, is based on a partial multiplicative nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm. This one aims to unmix the considered remote sensing data by exploiting some known kaolinite spectra. Experiments are conducted on real Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER) data that cover the considered study area to evaluate the potential of the used approach. The obtained results are mainly confirmed and validated by field investigations.

AB  - At present, estimating surface solar radiation by exploiting satellite data is a very promising method. Indeed, satellite observations provide an alternative means to derive solar radiation due to their spatially continuous observations for large areas.In the present work, we propose a method to estimate solar radiation at earth's ground using Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data. This method will eventually allow us to create a space maps of the solar radiation distribution received on ground. The chosen study area is Oran (35 degrees 42'23 '' N, 0 degrees 34'43 '' W) in Algeria.

AB  - In this work, new low resolutions algorithms to detect changes in multiresolution remote sensing data are proposed. Using the linear spectral unmixing concept, by means of nonnegative matrix factorization, these algorithms allow providing 2D variables with the same low spatial and spectral resolutions in order to detect changes in the considered data. The first algorithm is a gradient-based one, whereas the second algorithm uses multiplicative update rules. Obtained simulation results, using synthetic data, show the high ability of the designed algorithms to reveal changes occurred between multiresolution optical data.

T2  - THERANOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph node (LN) dissection followed by histological analysis is the current standard for diagnosis of LN metastasis but the method suffers from patient morbidity and low sensitivity of detection. Ultra-pH sensitive (UPS) nanoparticles show remarkable accuracy in the delineation of primary tumor margins for precision cancer surgery. Herein we investigate the effectiveness of UPS nanoparticles to detect cancer-involved LNs.Methods: We synthesized a series of indocyanine green (ICG) conjugated UPS nanoparticles with distinct pK(a) (UPS5.3, UPS6.1, and UPS6.9). Systemically administered UPS-ICG nanoparticles in the 4T1.2-BALB/cj mouse model were imaged with real-time, near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) to guide removal of LNs. Ex vivo imaging of gross tissue enabled quantification of fluorescence intensity. Histological analysis was used as the gold standard diagnostic test.Results: Macrophage uptake of UPS nanoparticles elevates the background signal in benign LNs. However, cancer foci within LNs show distinctive clustering of UPS-ICG fluorescence. UPS5.3 achieves accurate detection of metastatic LNs as shown by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96 +/- 0.03. UPS6.1 and UPS6.9 offer decreased discriminatory power at ROC AUC of 0.73 +/- 0.1 and 0.88 +/- 0.07, respectively.Conclusions: All UPS compositions show cancer-specific discrimination of metastatic LNs over benign LNs with the best outcomes from UPS5.3. Detection of micro-metastatic LNs (cancer foci < 2 mm) remains a challenge. This study provides information on the detection of LN status for image-guided resection of metastatic LNs.

T2  - GULLY EROSION STUDIES FROM INDIA AND SURROUNDING REGIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Gullies are widened rills and are a manifestation of soil erosion. Adverse impact of natural agents and anthropogenic exploitation brings about significant changes in surface soil and degrades its quality subsequently leading to erosion. Siddheswari basin is a soil erosion-prone region heavily cross-cut by gullies. For this study area, SWAT model has been selected. SWAT is a physically based model used for sediment yield analysis and hydrology modelling. SWAT model uses information derived from remotely sensed data like climate, soil, land use/land cover and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). For SWAT modelling, the entire basin was subdivided into five sub-basins. The outcome results show that maximum sediment yield took place in the year 2011 which was 851.521 t/ha and the following year simultaneously showed a high rate of precipitation and runoff (7207.619 mm). Predicted average annual soil loss and gully erosion susceptibility map of Siddheswari river basin has been classified into three categories according to the intensity of soil loss. Under limited availability of input data, SWAT paired with GIS proves to be an effective tool for simulation and quantitative analysis. The obtained results will be useful for planning of mitigation measures and soil and water conservation and management.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, the attention is concentrated exactly on cosmism and its variations, and also on its role and place in the system of philosophical knowledge which is proposed to be studied in the establishments of higher education. The questions for discussion about the role and place of cosmism in the content of higher education are put forward: Is it necessary for students to study cosmism? Should this knowledge be given in courses? How should it be given for apprehension? Philosophical knowledge is stated to be used as an instrument to form worldview orientations of the future man being able to secure the survival of civilization and mankind. Firstly, the ideas of cosmism help regard the human being as a component of the Cosmos, determine his role and place in the evolutionary processes of the Universe, discover the influence of cosmic forces upon him and the human civilization. Secondly, the ideas of cosmism in the structure of philosophical knowledge carry out humanistic and cultural functions: they complete building the world picture (as scientific, as universal) in the student's consciousness.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the impact of the legislative framework of the Russian Empire on the evolution of the hunting industry of the indigenous peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East of Russia. Traditional trades of the Siberian natives (hunting of taiga ungulates and fur animals, game, extraction of marine animals, fishing) not only were and are the basis of their system of activity, but also are strongly connected with features of their mentality, with a complex of beliefs, cults and rituals, ethics and many other layers of Outlook. Therefore, the external foreign cultural and ethnic influence in the form of introduction of European, Slavic and Russian laws on regulation of hunting terms and production volumes of commercial animals into the traditional economic system has had a significant transformative effect. The impact of European culture in the form of legislative acts on the indigenous peoples of the Northern regions in the field of crafts depends on the mentality of the contacting ethnic group, its social organization, the level of development of military Affairs, economic and cultural type, the degree of consolidation, the presence or absence of civil authorities, the nature of interaction with the Russian authorities, and other ethno-cultural characteristics. Some aspects of this impact led not only to the emergence of new types of hunting weapons among the natives, equipment, equipment, but also to the emergence of industrial hunting that was not peculiar to them before, led to a change in the ancient hunting worldview, manifested in fishing technologies in the form of ecophobic components.

TI  - Flooding Extent Mapping for Synthetic Aperture Radar Time Series Using River Gauge Observations
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The flooding extent area in a river valley is related to river gauge observations such as discharge and water elevations. The higher the water elevations, or discharge, the larger the flooding area. Flooding extent maps are often derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images using thresholding methods. The thresholding methods vary in complexity and number of required parameters. We proposed a simple thresholding method that takes advantage of the correlation between the river gauge and the flooding area. To show the applicability of the method, we used a 2014-2018 time series of 161 Sentinel 1 SAR images acquired over a wetland floodplain located in Northeast Poland. We validated the method by extracting local water line elevations from a high-resolution digital elevation model for three river gauges, which resulted in a root-mean-square error of 0.16 m, a bias of 0.07 m, and a correlation of 0.86 for the best scenario. The scenario analysis showed that the most important factor affecting the method's accuracy was a proper delineation of the zone in which the flooding extent area was calculated. This was because other water sources, uncorrelated with river flow, were present in the floodplain as open water. Additionally, higher accuracy was obtained for the VV than VH polarization. The discharge can be used instead of water elevations as a river gauge variable, but this results in more bias in the water extent estimates.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Change detection (CD) benefits of the capability of deep-learning (DL) methods of exploiting complex temporal behaviors in a large amount of data. Unsupervised CD DL methods are preferred since they do not require labeled data. Unsupervised CD methods use autoencoders (AE) or convolutional AE (CAE) for CD. However, features provided by the CAE hidden layers tend to degrade the geometrical information during the encoding. To mitigate this effect, we propose an unsupervised CD exploiting a multilayer CAE trained by a hierarchical loss function. This loss function guarantees a better trade-off between noise reduction and preservation of geometrical details at each hidden layer of the CAE. On the contrary to standard CAE, the proposed novel loss function considers input/output specular pairs of multiple hidden layers. These layers are analyzed by considering encoder/decoder pairs that work at corresponding geometrical resolution and show similar spatial-context information. Single-layer loss functions are defined by comparing the specular corresponding encoder and decoder pairs then aggregated to design a multilayer loss function. The proposed hierarchical loss function allows for a layer-by-layer control of the training and improvement of the reconstruction quality of the hidden layers that better preserves the geometrical details while reducing noise. The CD is performed by processing bi-temporal remote sensing images with the CAE. A detail-preserving multi-scale CD process exploits the most informative features for bi-temporal images to compute the change map. Preliminary experimental results conducted on a couple of Landsat-8 multitemporal images acquired before and after a fire near Granada, Spain of July 8th, 2015, provided promising results.

T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXVI
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVI
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Standard deep-learning (DL) architectures do not optimize the use of the spatial and spectral information in the multi-spectral images but often consider only one of the two components. Two-stream DL architectures split and process them separately. However, the fusing of the output of the two streams is a challenging task. 3D-CNN processes spatial and spectral information together at the cost of a large number of parameters. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel DL data structure that re-organizes the spectral and spatial information in remote-sensing (RS) images and process them together. Representing a RS image I as a data cube, we handle the spatial and spectral information by reducing the spectral bands from N to M, where M can drop out to one. The spectral information is projected in the spatial dimensions and re-organized in 2-dimensional B blocks. The proposed approach analyzes the spectral information of each block by using 2-dimensional convolutional kernels of appropriate size and stride. The output represents the relationship between the spectral bands of the input image and preserves the spatial relationship between its neighboring pixels. The spatial relationships are analyzed by processing the output of the previous layer with standard 2D-CNNs. Experiments by using images acquired by Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data and the labels of the LUCAS database released in 2018 provide promising results.

AB  - This study explores the potential of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery for annual grass biomass mapping in savannas To this end, three wet season image mosaics based on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 were created for 2016, 2017 and 2018 over Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. For the purpose of calibration and validation, use was made of in situ fuel biomass values measured as part of the yearly veld condition assessment (VCA) in KNP. The satellite and reference data were fed into a random forests machine learning approach to make park-wide predictions of grass biomass and to assess the performance of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 predictors (i.e., surface reflectance and the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI). Examples of the data sets used and biomass maps produced are provided together with the obtained error statistics. The latter suggest that wet season NDVI mosaics from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data enable the creation of fairly reliable, annual maps of fuel biomass for KNP. These new biomass estimates represent a slight improvement over recent mapping efforts based on Sentinel-1 data [1].

TI  - Sand-spit Evolution and Inlet Dynamics derived from Space-borne Optical Imagery: Is the Senegal-river Inlet Closing?
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - With the majority of the world' population living in urbanised coastal zones, regional-scale coastal monitoring is a paramount tool to assess the risk exposure of local areas. At St. Louis, Senegal the coast experienced a recent acceleration in coastal erosion. Additionally, the sand-spit South of St. Louis is highly dynamic with one of the largest migration rates worldwide. In this study we showcase the use of satellite imagery to assess the morphological change of the St. Louis inlet position over more than 3 decades. The Senegal river inlet was artificially opened in 2003 Northward of its natural position. The effect of this opening is measured through local shoreline erosion and use of satellite data to predict the next closure of the Senegal-river inlet. Since the artificial breach coastal erosion at the fishmarket of St. Louis was measured, while the sand-spit initially accreted. Southerly sand-spit migration rates that varied from 475 m per year (before an artificial breach in 2003) to 590 m per year after the breach. With these migration rates and assuming limited changes in, for example, river run-off and wave environment, the inlet will close again around 2050 and 2055.

AB  - State-of-the-art deep learning (DL) algorithms for automatic target recognition (ATR) typically rely on transfer learning from networks pre-trained on RGB imagery. In this work, we investigate the benefits of using additional spectral information contained in multispectral satellite imagery, with the targeted development of a suite of ATR algorithms to detect and segment illicit coca fields in Colombia. In support of this effort, the team curated a custom multispectral dataset of coca fields in WorldView-3 imagery, starting with Sentinel-2 annotations provided by expert image analysts. We present baseline land cover classification results using traditional methods, and compare these results to detection metrics obtained with Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN. The DL algorithms are run on classic RGB imagery and false color imagery, which exploits the near-infrared image content. Mean average precision metrics indicate that the standard RGB imagery outperforms false-color imagery. Deep learning-based semantic segmentation algorithms are also investigated, with a comparison between training on RGB and false color imagery. Finally, we include a discussion of ongoing research to modify state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks to accept multispectral inputs of more than three channels, while still benefitting from pretrained RGB weights.

T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Analysing data of the Young Lives Study in Peru, we aimed at assessing the association between daily food frequency and body mass index (BMI) changes between 2006 and 2016. Design Secondary analysis of a prospective ongoing cohort study. Setting 20 sentinel sites in Peru. Participants Children enrolled in the younger cohort of the Young Lives Study. We used information from the second (2006-2007), third (2009-2010), fourth (2013-2014) and fifth (2016-2017) rounds of the younger cohort in Peru. Primary and secondary outcomes BMI as well as BMI-for-age z-score, both as numerical variables. Results Data from 1948 children, mean age 4.3 (SD: 0.3) years and 966 (49.6%) women were included at baseline. In multivariable model, lower food consumption frequency was associated with increased BMI and BMI-for-age z-scores: children reporting <4 times of food consumption per day had a greater increase in BMI (beta=0.39; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.62) and BMI-for-age z-score (beta=0.07; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.13) compared with those reporting 5 per day. Results were consistent for those reporting exactly eating 4 times per day (beta for BMI=0.16; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.30 and beta for BMI-for-age z-score=0.05; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.09). Conclusions Children who eat <5 times per day, gain more BMI compared with those who eat >= 5 times. Parents should receive information to secure adequate nutrition for their children, both in terms of quality and quantity.

TI  - Mapping Retrogressive Thaw Slumps Using Single-Pass TanDEM-X Observations
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vast areas of the Arctic host ice-rich permafrost, which is becoming increasingly vulnerable to terrain-altering thermokarst in a warming climate. Among the most rapid and dramatic changes are retrogressive thaw slumps. These slumps evolve by a retreat of the slump headwall during the summer months, making them detectable by comparing digital elevation models over time using the volumetric change as an indicator. Here, we present and assess a method to detect and monitor thaw slumps using time series of elevation models applied on two contrasting study areas in Northern Canada. Our two-step method is tailored to single-pass InSAR observations from the TanDEM-X satellite pair, which have been acquired since 2011. For each acquisition, we derive a digital elevation model and uncertainty estimates. In the first step, we difference digital elevation models and detect the significant elevation changes using a blob-detection algorithm. In the second step, we classify the detections into those due to thaw slumps and other causes using a simple thresholding method (accuracy: 78%), a random forest classifier (87%), and a support vector machine (86%). When our method is applied to other areas, the classifiers should be trained with data from part of the study area or with data obtained from similar areas in terms of topography, vegetation, and thaw slump characteristics to achieve the best performance. The obtained locations of thaw slumps can be used as a starting point to extract important slump properties, such as the headwall height and the volumetric change, which are currently not available on regional scales.

TI  - Inversion of satellite gravimetric data from Reconcavo-Tucano-Jatoba Basin System
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Density differences among subsurface rocks cause variations in the gravitational field of Earth, which is known as gravity anomaly. Interpretation of these gravity anomalies allows assessment of the probable depth and shape of the causative body. For several decades, gravity data were acquired on the surface, but after the scientific and technological advances of the last decades, geopotential models were developed, including gravitational observations on a global scale through space satellite missions. This paper investigated the Moho structure in the region of Reconcavo-Tucano-Jatoba rift-basin system based on the information of the terrestrial gravity field from the EIGEN-6C4 geopotential model. The frequency domain inversion technique was applied, which is known as the Parker-Oldenburg iterative method. Bouguer anomaly data were used in the inversion procedure to determine the thickness and geometry of the crust in the region. Data inversion considered a two-layer model with constant density contrast, in which the entire signal was related to Moho topography. In addition, data inversion was carried out to determine the basement depths. The program proved to be efficient and able to manage large data sets. The results, both of the crust thickness and the sedimentary package, validated the geodynamic evolution understanding of the basin system.

AB  - Crowdsourcing is developing as a conveyed critical thinking and business creation in recent years. The expression "crowdsourcing" was authored by Jeff Howe in 2006. From that point forward, a great deal of work in Crowdsourcing has concentrated on various parts of publicly supporting, for example, computational procedures and performance analysis. Declarative crowdsourcing frameworks help diminish the complexities and conceal them from users and manages the weight of the crowd. Crowdsourcing has been a critical perspective with regards to locate a specific information in a database. Crowdsourcing gives an amazing platform to execute inquiries that require progressively human talents, insight and investigation rather than simply counterfeit canny computers, which use picture acknowledgment, information filtration and tagging. Crowd optimization realizes how to adjust among cost and latency and accordingly query optimization targets are increasingly effective. CROWDOPT for upgrading three sorts of questions: selectionquires, join quiries and complex quires. In this paper, we give the outline of the survey of Crowdsourcing worldview which are arranged by the Crowdsourcing operators and datasets. In view of this study we sketch the vital components that essential to be estimated to improve Crowdsourced data management.

M3  - Article
AB  - The relevant satellite data after procuring from National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA) was analysed using ERDAS Imagine version 8.6 and IDRISI version 2. Based on supervised classification and land use patterns, the mosquitogenic conditions have been verified in the study area by using satellite imagery (PAN, LISS-III and WIFS) as well as by paying a visit to the field. On the basis of mosquito breeding in various habitats, it concludes that the river beds, rain water collection, pools, flooded agricultural fields, canals, ponds, marshy areas have been found to be the potent breeding habitats of mosquitoes. The survey work conducted during the year 2004 and 2005 reveals occurrence of 15 species of Anopheles (An. aconitus, An. annularis, An. culicifacies, An. fluviatilis, An. gigas, An. jeyporiensis, An. lindesctyi, An. maculatus, An. nigerrimus, An. splendidus, An. stephensi, An. subpictus, An. theobaldi, An. vagus and An. varuna), besides Aedes sp., Culex sp., Armigeres sp. and Uranotaenia sp. in three study belts namely, Kalsi-Vikasnagar, Sahaspur-Selaqui and RaipurDoi wala belt in district Dehradun. Considering, the population of Anophelines as harboured in all the three different belts, it was maximum at RaipurDoi wala belt followed by Sahaspur-Selaqui and Kalsi-Vikasnagar belts in succession. At KalsiVikasnagar and RaipurDoi wala belt, 12 species of Anopheles were found as adults. However, the immature density was recorded more in Kalsi-Vikasnagar belt (11) than RaipurDoi wala belt (9). In Sahaspur-Selaqui belt, 11 species of adult Anopheles and only 9 species of immature forms were recorded.

AB  - Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications are becoming increasingly popular among users in various IoT domains, such as Wearable IoT, Smart Cities, Smart Home, and Smart Industry. With a range of IoT devices, cyber attack surface has hugely expanded from traditional user workstations to small autonomous devices connected to the Internet. In today's connected world, every user owns multiple connected smart devices which seamlessly connect to their organization's network. Therefore, secure and fine-grained access control policies need to be implemented at the organizational level to defend against such attacks. In this paper, we propose an Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) approach to defend against cyber attacks in the context of an organization environment which are launched through compromised IoT devices owned by various legitimate users. For example, a wearable IoT device of an employee of an organization which can connect to the organization's network and compromise the whole network and lack of secure access control mechanism will enable IoT Warfare in the future. Therefore, secure and fine-grained ABAC access control mechanisms and policies need to be employed for access control and authorization requirements of IoT devices.

AB  - In this paper, a general iterative thresholding algorithm (ITA) for solving L-q-norm (0 < q <= 1) regularization problem is proposed to achieve the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image feature enhancement. Compared with the reconstructed images by matched filtering (MF) based method, the proposed method recovered images have lower sidelobes, reduced noise and clutter, which improves the image quality effectively. Experiments based on Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR complex image data are used to validate the proposed method.

TI  - Retrieving Soil and Vegetation Temperatures From Dual-Angle and Multipixel Satellite Observations
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface component temperatures (LSCTs), i.e., the temperatures of soil and vegetation, are important parameters in many applications, such as estimating evapotranspiration and monitoring droughts. However, the multiangle algorithm is affected due to different spatial resolution between nadir and oblique views. Therefore, we propose a combined retrieval algorithm that uses dual-angle and multipixel observations together. The sea and land surface temperature radiometer onboard ESA's Sentinel-3 satellite allows for quasi-synchronous dual-angle observations, from which LSCTs can be retrieved using dual-angle and multipixel algorithms. The better performance of the combined algorithm is demonstrated using a sensitivity analysis based on a synthetic dataset. The spatial errors in the oblique view due to different spatial resolution can reach 4.5 K and have a large effect on the multiangle algorithm. The introduction of multipixel information in a window can reduce the effect of such spatial errors, and the retrieval results of LSCTs can be further improved by using multiangle information for a pixel. In the validation, the proposed combined algorithm performed better, with LSCT root mean squared errors of 3.09 K and 1.91 K for soil and vegetation at a grass site, respectively, and corresponding values of 3.71 K and 3.42 K at a sparse forest site, respectively. Considering that the temperature differences between components can reach 20 K, the results confirm that, in addition to a pixel-average LST, the combined retrieval algorithm can provide information on LSCTs. This article demonstrates the potential of utilizing additional information sources for better LSCT results, which makes the presented combined strategy a promising option for deriving large-scale LSCT products.

TI  - CONCEPTUAL CENTERS OF METAPHORICS OF MONTENEGRIN POETRY
T2  - LINGUA MONTENEGRINA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article proposes an analysis of metaphorical structures that create conceptual associative and figurative centers in the texts of Montenegrin poets translated into Ukrainian. The conceptual centers of metaphors "Person and Nation", "Person and the Universe", "Person and the Microcosm of its Soul", "Philosophy of Worldview" are singled out and characterized. The stylistic functions of anthropomorphic (including sociomorphic), natural morphological, artifact metaphors are traced. The expressiveness of sociomorphic metaphors related to the religious and mythological perception of the world has been noted. The lexico-grammatical features of metaphor were noted: the activity of genitive, verb, adjective metaphorical structures, as well as the predominance of complicated metaphorical complexes over two-three-membered metaphorical compounds. The role of comparative inversions, metaphorical identifications of tokens semantics compared in microcontexts were traced. Special attention was paid to the role of word-symbols in the creation of associative-semantic duality of verbal images.The research notes the linguo-cultural significance of the Ukrainian translation in Montenegrin poetic works, as the material reveals the relationship of "universal and national", "own and foreign", "common and different" in verbal pictures of natural landscape, philosophical understanding of life. Asnon-original works were analyzed, but their translations, the attention to the national-cultural component in the associative-figurative structure of the metaphor of Montenegrin poetry was taken into account. The language of Montenegrin poetry reflects the peculiarities of the history, mentality, character of the nations of Montenegro, who had to defend their statehood and independence in difficult conditions.The analysis emphasizes the differentiation of traditional metaphorical structures, which are inherent in the language of Ukrainian poetry. Occasionally, individual-author metaphorical models and originality of the metaphorical language of thinking of Montenegrin poets were also noted.

CP  - Mediterranean and Middle-East Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (M2GARSS)
CL  - Tunis, TUNISIA
AB  - The resolution of watershed management problems, including the construction of dams, the prediction of the consequences of floods, requires a thorough knowledge of runoff in low and low-flow conditions. In this perspective, the modeling of frequency runoff in watersheds becomes necessary. The R-f from a generating storm in a watershed depends on the type of soil, land cover, vegetation cover and rainfall. Among the many methods available to estimate it, the method SCS-CN is the most popular, and potentially compatible with remote sensing inputs. In this work, these inputs have been generated in a GIS environment using mapping data and Landsat-8 satellite images; the model has been applied to estimate the Rf daily maximum and the annual mean for the 10, 20, 50 and 100 year return periods in the Wadi Seboulla watershed, which is located in the North East of Algeria. The evolution of the quantity of estimated frequency runoff at the spatial scale does not depend solely on the quantity of recorded or estimated precipitation, but also on the dynamic of the land cover over time that changes CN inducing the modification of the results at the spatiotemporal scale.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a combination technique of thermal infrared images captured by infrared camera and satellite thermal images retrieved from Landsat-8 OLI TIRS to identify the contribution of vertical and horizontal surface materials in two hot-humid street canyons with similar sky view factor and street orientation. The infrared camera captures surface temperature images of vertical and inclined surfaces of the street canyons. The images at horizontal scale are derived based on six land cover indices - i.e., Land Surface Temperature (LST), surface albedo, thermal emissivity, Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Different Built Area Index (NDBI), Normalized Different Water Index (NDWI) - using an image processing technique conducted in ArcGIS. This study used two micro weather stations to measure microclimate conditions depicting the Canopy Layer Heat Island (CLHI) of the canyons at the same time. Despite the capability of the combined technique to identify the contribution of surface materials to the LST, different radiative and thermal properties of the surface materials insignificantly modified the CLHI.

AB  - In this work, temporal series of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are used to estimate water elevations. The proposed method is based on a Sub-Pixel Offset Tracking (technique) to retrieve the displacement of the double-bounce scattering effect of man made structures located in the proximity of the water surface. The experimental setup is focused on the cases of the Mosul dam in Iraq and the Missouri river in Kansas city. The proposed approach is applied to real data from the COSMO-SkyMed program. Results validated with in-situ and satellite radar altimeter measurements prove the effectiveness of the proposed method in measuring the water levels.

TI  - Monitoring of Critical Infrastructures by Micromotion Estimation: The Mosul Dam Destabilization
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we propose a new procedure to monitor critical infrastructures. The proposed approach is applied to COSMO-SkyMed data, with the aim to monitor the destabilization of the Mosul dam. Such a dam represents the largest hydraulic facility of Iraq and is located on the Tigris river. The destructive potential of the wave that would be generated, in the event of the dam destruction, could have serious consequences. If the concern for human lives comes first, the concern for cultural heritage protection is not negligible, since several archaeological sites are located around the Mosul dam. The proposed procedure is an in-depth modal assessment based on the micromotion estimation, through a Doppler subapertures tracking and a multichromatic analysis. The method is based initially on the persistent scatterers interferometry that is also discussed for completeness and validation. The modal analysis has detected the presence of several areas of resonance that could mean the presence of cracks, and the results have shown that the dam is still in a strong destabilization. Moreover, the dam appears to be divided into two parts: the northern part is accelerating rapidly while the southern part is decelerating and a main crack in this north south junction is found. The estimated velocities through the PS-InSAR technique show a good agreement with the GNSS in situ measurements, resulting in a very high correlation coefficient and showing how the proposed procedure works efficiently.

AB  - Flood is one of the major disasters that prevail in the northeastern India. Mapping of spatial inundation patterns during flood events is regarded for environmental management and disaster monitoring. This study emphasized on the assessment and flood inundation mapping of sub-watershed of Imphal River Basin of Manipur. Multispectral datasets from Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 and Digital Elevation Models (DEM) from ASTER and Cartosat with 30 and 10 m resolutions, respectively, are used for producing flood inundation maps. Hydrologic Engineering Center's River analysis system (HEC-RAS) and RAS mapper are used in this study to generate flood inundation map. The study involved the assessment of flood map derived from multi-resolution two-dimensional hydrodynamic model approach. The result from the study provides the required assessment of impacts of flood events in the study area and will help the policy-makers to take an effective decision-making for mitigation and preventive measure of the region.

TI  - ESTIMATING IRRIGATION WATER USE FOR DATE PALM USING REMOTE SENSING OVER AN OASIS IN ARID REGION
T2  - IRAQI JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Date palm needs sufficient water of acceptable quality to reach its potential yield. The present study conducted in Al-Hassa Oasis located in the Eastern Region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia aiming to estimate the daily, monthly and annual actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for date palm using Landsat-8 satellite data during 2017/2018. Also, an attempted was made to compare between the computed ETa and the actual water applied in the field. The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) supported by climate data was used to calculate the ETa. The SEBAL model outputs were validated using the FAO Penman-Monteith method coupled with field observation and measurements. The results showed that the highest daily ETa value observed during the summer season was 9 mm.day(-1), and the lowest value was 2 mm.day(-1) in winter. The mean monthly water applied in the farms was 15% higher than that suggested by SEBAL during the peak summertime. The annual ETa varied between 800 and 1,400 mm.year(-1), while the annual irrigation requirement for date palm was in the range of 11000 - 13000 m(3).ha(-1). The validation measure showed a significant agreement level between the SEBAL model and the FAO Penman-Monteith method with RMSE of 0.84 mm.day(-1). The study concludes that the ETa calculated from the satellite data and the SEBAL model is useful for guiding the daily operation of date palm water management at the farm scale. Also, this information is essential for water planners and policymakers to formulate strategies and make decisions for managing water resources over large agricultural areas.

AB  - A model is a simplified representation of the complex natural world. The groundwater model provides a quantitative framework for synthesizing field information and for conceptualizing hydrogeological purposes. The present study aims to utilize remotely sensed data, Geographical Information System (GIS), and limited flow modeling to identify the groundwater recharge management practices carried out in the Junewani watershed of the Nagpur district. In this study, Modflow-NWT, in conjunction with spatial analyses, is used for modeling Groundwater flow in Junewani Watershed located at 78.90 degrees E and 21.03 degrees N in Nagpur District, Maharashtra. Since minimal data on flow parameters are available and aquifer systems are also heterogeneous, water level data observed from dug wells has also been used to generate the groundwater flow directions. The study area consists of 1st, 2nd and 3rd order streams and is covered with Black cotton soil and Vesicular Basalt underneath. Watershed boundary conditions, elevation details, drainage patterns, layer properties, permeability values, average rainfall, etc. are given as input for the model. The initial input data has been procured from GSDA Nagpur and through field observations. This study discusses the micro watershed groundwater modeling carried out mainly in a spatial environment supported by results of limited flow modelling, but the results and insights from this study will help in better understanding the GW flow regime after the recharge decisions were taken and the recharge practices were operated. It has been observed that recharge practices in surface dams and desilting have been beneficial at some places, while groundwater has decreased at other places. Thus it helps in decision making regarding the development of GW recharge and utilization.

TI  - ABOUT RAISING AN ETHICAL ATTITUDE TO ANIMALS.
T2  - Vestnik Orenburgskogo Gosudarstvennogo Universiteta
M3  - Article
AB  - In the conditions of modern society, the conflict between man and the environment is growing more and more actively. The anthropocentric view of nature dominates, according to which man is the master of nature, having unlimited power and opportunities, and the issues of ethical, humane treatment of animals and respect for their rights are not seriously considered. One of the reasons for this situation is the lack of appropriate education of the younger generation. A new discipline - bioethics-was introduced in the 3rd generation of the Federal state educational standard. It contains a significant educational potential for the formation of the younger generation of civic activity and responsibility towards the environment. I conducted a theoretical study. The following is installed. Today's environmental education is formal and consumer-oriented. Active sympathy, compassion, and charity are still passed off as an anachronism. Today is dominated by an anthropocentric view of the surrounding nature. This approach to education fosters cruelty and irresponsibility among young people. In my opinion, the education of an ethical attitude to animals, the formation of a biocentric worldview for future teachers at the University is of particular importance. The faculty of natural geography of the Russian state University named after S. A. Yesenin and the Department of pedagogy and management in education have a huge educational potential. The University organized and launched a social student project "Assistance to the Ryazan charity society for support of homeless animals "Best Friends". The entire project is based solely on voluntary donations in the form of money, food, medicines, etc.for the needs of homeless animals. Social networks contribute to the development of animal volunteering. Modern young people can support animals. By engaging in zoo-volunteer activities, a person becomes kinder and wiser. He has a bare, open heart. He feels more acutely the pain and grief of the person in need of help. Thus, today it is extremely important to teach the younger generation respect for any form of life - for animals, for the environment. A person should live according to ethical laws in the modern world on the basis that a kind, humane attitude to living beings is a moral duty of a spiritually rich, developed person.

T2  - RECENT TRENDS IN WAVE MECHANICS AND VIBRATIONS, WMVC 2018
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th National Conference on Wave Mechanics and Vibrations (WMVC)
CL  - INDIA
AB  - The theory of Vegetative Radiative Transfer Equation (VRTE) in canopy scattering medium is the major mathematical tool enabling researchers to investigate and analyze mathematically essential ingredients to understand how to use remote sensing data for the canopy vegetative medium. VRTE involves geometry functions or G-functions associated with leaf normal distribution functions and a major constituent of the important Area Scattering Phase functions (ASPF) which governs the scattering pattern in any vegetative scattering medium. Almost all these functions are mathematically defined on the basis of Leaf Normal Distribution Function (LNDF), probability of distribution of normals to a particular leaf with respect to a particular direction, say, zenith direction. The VRTE started its evolution on the basis of four experimentally designed LNDF model with specific normalization conditions. In this article, we have presented various new models based on previous field survey but not reported in Biswas (JQSRT 108:197-219, 2007, [1]) and linear combinations of basic four models of LNDF with somewhat detailed mathematical sketch of these important mathematical functions and computer-generated simulations relevant for the realistic problems in these fields of study.

AB  - Monitoring the large number of active fires and their consequences in such an extensive area such as the Brazilian territory is an important task. Machine Learning techniques are a promising approach to contribute to this area, but the challenge is the building of rich example datasets, whose previous examples are unavailable in many areas. Our aim in this article is to move towards the development of an approach to detect burned areas in regions for which there is no previously validated samples. We deal with that by presenting some experiments to classify burned areas through Machine Learning techniques that combine remote sensing data from nearby areas and it can distinguish between burned and non burned polygons with good results.

AB  - Near-infrared fluorescence image-guided surgery relies on an interdisciplinary community to develop near-infrared fluorescent markers and near-infrared sensitive cameras capable of mapping relevant structures during surgical procedures. As biochemists pursue a new generation of near-infrared fluorophores aimed at surgical oncology and other applications, optoelectronic engineers developing near-infrared imagers have been slow to adopt architectural improvements that will enhance outcomes in existing operations and to document optoelectronic characteristics that are needed to predict endpoints for new procedures. Here we present a single-chip snapshot multispectral imaging system that integrates arrays of bandpass optical filters and six-transistor backside-illuminated pixels to provide RGB-NIR images with low read noise (3.47 e(-)) and high dynamic range (81 dB). This imaging system is being used in clinical studies for sentinel lymph node mapping during breast cancer surgery.

AB  - This work evaluates three machine learning methods with respect to their ability of learning the functional relationship between dual-polarimetric (dual-pol) input data and quadpolarimetric (quad-pol) output parameters. We chose to study and compare the learning strength of a Neural Network (NN) approach, two kernel-methods, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). Overlapping quad-pol Radarsat-2 (RS2) and dual-pol ScanSAR Sentinel-1 (S1) sea ice Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) scenes, with 20 minutes time difference, were used for establishing the relationship between the dual-pol input data and corresponding quad-pol output parameters. We then used the learned relationship to predict quad-pol parameters for the overlapping S1 dual-pol scene, and show the results of the three machine learning methods, visually, by showing images of the predicted polarimetric features, and quantitively, by computing statistical performance measures. The results indicate that all three methods have strong learning capacity, however, the computed statistical measures and the visual comparisons suggest the best performance for the GPR model.

TI  - New and Existing Signal Quality Monitoring Metrics Tested Against Simulations and Time Synchronized Signal Generator Attacks

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 33rd International Technical Meeting of the Satellite-Division-of-The-Institute-of-Navigation (ION GNSS)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - In this work we present the behavior of new and existing Signal Quality Monitoring (SQM) metrics under the influence of signal generator spoofing. Signal generator spoofing is the generation and emission of artificial authentic GNSS-signals, which tries to imitate the real satellite signals as good as possible to induce a wrong time and/or position output. The artificial signals must have a higher amplitude at the target position than the authentic signals to be tracked from the receiver. One at our institute investigated field of application, is GNSS based mobile networks, which are vulnerable to spoofing [1].SQM metrics generally investigate the shape change of the correlation function (CF), which can occur due to multipath, spoofing or satellite payload hardware errors. We investigated synchronized attacks with the purchasable LOKI-Jamming and Spoofing generator from IGASPIN GmbH [2] and with MATLAB based simulations. Synchronized means that the spoofing signal synchronizes the code phase, the Doppler and the navigation data to the real satellite signal, fitting the incoming authentic signal at the target receiver location. The location of the target has to be estimated as good as possible to get the best results. Since synchronized attacks nowadays cannot be detected or mitigated by typical COTS (commercial of the shelf) receivers and many but not all receivers also acquire and track unsynchronized spoofing signals, spoofing protection in the receiver is needed. One way is to look for anti-spoofing-parameters in the receiver, including SQM-methods. The LOKI-Spoofer is able to perform a synchronized spoofing attack to real satellite signals and by now Galileo E1B/C and GPS L1 C/A signals can be spoofed. We implemented a new metric for spoofing detection for Galileo E1B and GPS L1 C/A signals in our software receiver MuSNAT [3], which we call Threshold Fluctuation Metric (TFM). It is a slight modification of the fluctuation metric in [4]. We compared the results of the proposed metric with the results for the well-known metrics Single Sided Ratio metric, the Double-Delta metric and the Delta metric and tested the metrics against the signal generator attacks and MATLAB based simulated spoofing attacks. Furthermore, the paper presents also a fully synchronized position spoofing attack with three well known receiver.For the simulations the TFM showed better results when the C/N-0 was changing significantly. In this case the Double-Delta, the Single Sided Ratio and the Delta metric gave false alarms. Also during the spoofing attack, the new metric showed a more continuous detection rate and can therefore be considered as more reliable and stable. For a certain speed range with low speeds and a not too high spoofer gain the TFM could also detect the movement of the spoofer without a start delay to the target. We therefore recommend to use the TFM instead of the other investigated metrics.The LOKI spoofer experiments were made over cable. Since the delay can only be set in 100 ns steps, we could not test a perfect alignment of the code phase from the spoofer signal to the authentic signal. The smallest achievable code delay was about 15 m, where the TFM and the Single Sided Ratio metric could detect the attack in contrary to the Delta and Double-Delta metric. The position could be successfully shifted away for all investigated receivers (Septentrio PolaRx5TR, U-Blox M8T and IFEN SX3). Even with RAIM (Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring) mode on, the Septentrio PolaRx5TR receiver could be spoofed. The anti-spoofing flag of the U-Blox M8T did not detect the spoofing attack.In order to distinguish a spoofing attack from normal multipath for the TFM we analyzed the results of many satellites, since multipath in contrast to spoofing transmission from one spot generally does not affect all satellites in the same way. This paper also shows how multipath affects the TFM on real signals captured with a roof antenna. The TFM can also be used for multipath detection. At the beginning of the LOKI spoofing attack, the TFM of all satellites were affected at the same time, which lead to a spoofing alert in our receiver.

Multi-year (MY) ridges are more hazardous barriers to navigation than first year (FY) ridges and they are more likely to survive the summer melt season, but little effort has been made to identify FY and MY ridges from remote sensing data. This paper describes an analytical method to model electromagnetic scattering from ridges around the VHF range (100-500 MHz) when ridges are modeled as a rough surface over stratified media. Models considering the macroscopic properties of FY and MY ridges relevant to VHF scatter are presented. Simulations show that FY and MY ridges have different scattering characteristics, making it possible to separate the two ice types. Future work will consider how variability in ice ridge characteristics and changes during the ice season affect the separability of FY and MY ridges based on their scattering characteristics.

AB  - We report on a numerical study of diurnal cycle in the atmospheric boundary layer above a meandering river. The topography and the river shape are taken from the satellite data near Krasnoyarsk (Russia). Convective patterns developing during the early morning and the daytime lead to the formation of horizontal circulation and the jet-like flow across the river at the point of maximum curvature of the meander. This effect may play an important role in the transport of atmospheric pollutants in urban environment. During the flow evolution, formation of some coherent large-scale vertices is observed. The observed pattern can appear in many similar conditions in nature.

AB  - In the current context of globalization, it's becoming increasingly necessary to understand the importance of multilingualism. But this can only be achieved through an adequate understanding of language and its intrinsic function. At the same time, the preservation of the national specific is achieved primarily through language, which is the foundation of national identity.Although the language policy of the European Union explicitly promotes multilingualism, however, some contemporary researchers point to the existence of a current growing trend of the linguistic uniformity phenomenon, this phenomenon being analyzed from multiple perspectives. Thus, it has been pointed out that there is an increasing tendency of "bilingualism" manifesting in Europe, more precisely: "globalized" English and national or regional language, English becoming, unofficially, the "global language" of the European Union. In fact, this phenomenon was also noticed within the Council of Europe and the European Parliament, institutions that elaborated official documents aimed at promoting multilingualism. But these recommendations have been limited to words only, and today the phenomenon of this linguistic uniformity tends to be accentuated, even speakers of languages that were once considered of international circulation (French, German, Spanish, etc.) tend, in some circumstances, to give up their language in favor of the English language. Also, we can find in some areas or situations (for example, in scientific manifestations or scientific publications) the phenomenon of linguistic uniformity, by excluding all other languages of international circulation and promoting the English language alone.Situated within this framework, my paper aims to analyze some aspects of the phenomenon of linguistic uniformity, targeting the conditions, areas and situations in which it manifests itself, but also the possible consequences determined by the replacement of the national language with the English language, especially in areas where elites carry out their work. Thus, the linguistic cleavage between social categories and the devaluation of national languages by the loss of the state of cultural languages, the axiological hierarchy of languages through the criterion of communicative efficiency and, thus, undermining the principle of value equality of languages, which can even determine the phenomenon of "linguistic suicide" (concept referring to the situations in which parents, who speak a minority language, deliberately choose not to teach their children this language, but the dominant language from a social and economic point of view) are just a few possible consequences of the phenomenon of linguistic uniformity.Considering these issues, I am proposing to highlight in my paper some solutions for the promotion of multilingualism and also to discuss the importance of multilingualism which, as a free choice of speakers, is based on a deep understanding of language as an "internal, spiritual necessity", in Humboldt's terms, rather than an understanding of language as an external, communicative necessity. Therefore, I will also argue that the two major paradigms that have emerged in linguistics over time (on one hand, the structural, quasigeneralized paradigm of perceiving language as a "communication tool", and on the other hand, the Humboldtian paradigm of perceiving language as a "worldview") can have direct implications on the option of multilingualism or, on the contrary, linguistic uniformity. That is why, I believe that the role of linguists, the role of teachers of any language and any literature is to raise awareness about perceiving language not as a simple communication tool (a perspective that could generate even that phenomenon of renunciation to their own mother tongue in favor of a language that ensures greater communicative efficiency, a phenomenon recently referred to by linguists as "linguistic suicide"), but first of all, as a foundation of national identity, as a unique spiritual value, determining the "worldview" of a linguistic community.

AB  - During the summer of 2019-2020, the state of Rio Grande do Sul was affected by a severe low flow, forcing 365 municipalities (three-quarters of those of the state) to declare an emergency. The objective of the study was to analyze a set of images, showing the hydromorphological forms of sedimentation in the area of confluence of the Ibicui with Uruguay, visible due to the low water level. Satellite images from different periods have been used to show the hydrological dynamics that have arisen in the region. The analysis of the images allowed us to consider that the landscape dynamics of the selected area, influenced by its flat topography, is under the strong dependence of meteorological events, associated with the variability of the subtropical climate in the south of Brazil.

AB  - Information systems and their management are the main tools in all aspects of human life. Computer science is an integral part of 21st-century farming. The interaction of computer technology and nature is important in the agricultural industry. One of the main tools in data collection, management, and analysis is a satellite. Satellite images are used in analyzing crop health, detecting crop losses, and managing fields from data collected over an observed period of time. This study used high-resolution satellite imagery to obtain field data and identify the type of crops by using R software computing. These studies may help farmers to monitor their losses, and administrative authorities to prevent possible falsification of crop losses. Therefore, a year-long crop growth analysis was conducted in the Amur Region, Russia, on the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Soybean agricultural field. Two types of crops were identified in the field using computer technology based on analyzed data. The results of the analyzes will be used in the subsequent determination of crops in the agricultural development program of the Amur Region.

AB  - Following the Revolution of Dignity, Ukrainian identity found itself in a crisis - between the abandoned Sovietness and the new Ukrainianess. This paper looks at the worldview apparent in the mass media and the attendant solutions to overcome the identity crisis as presented to Ukrainians today. On the example of the TV series entitled The Last Muscovite (Ostatnii Moskal'), the study seeks to explain how the ideological discourse defines individuals representing particular identities (conservative: characteristic of Western and increasingly also Central Ukraine, modernist: typical of Eastern Ukraine, and liberal: most often represented by the central part of the country) and what strategies it offers in terms of mutual perception and relations between these identities.

T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The study defines the tendency of modern poetry to gravitate towards enumeration and registers as an attempt to "restore" the cumulative figurative language, which has not a conditionally poetic, but mythologically real status. From the standpoint of historical poetics, such a language is interpreted as a series of outwardly heterogeneous, but semantically identical phenomena, rooted in the archaic consciousness. The specifics of the worldview in the lyrics of L. Aronzon and J. Brodsky, namely, a complex of motifs represented with the help of cumulative structures, is the subject of study. The study asserts that, having a stable "semantic halo" (extensive assimilation of reality as a set of equivalent elements), accumulation performs a wide range of tasks, forming bundles with different, if not opposite, motifs ("unity and magnificence" of the world - Aronzon; discreteness of being and its overcoming - Brodsky). A detailed analysis of both authors' poems allows to identify both invariant (historically determined) and variative (individual creative) features of the cumulative figurative language.

T2  - VIZANTIISKII VREMENNIK
M3  - Article
AB  - This work investigates the role of book culture, the state and evolution of schools, and the state of education in the Eastern Mediterranean of the early Byzantine time (4th-7th centuries) in the context of the cultural continuity between antiquity and the Middle Ages, using examples of Constantinople, Athens and Alexandria. The process of Christianization of the late-antique society led to the formation of a new cultural situation and, in general, to the early Byzantine cultural synthesis. Throughout the entire period, there was an immense amount of litterati - people of book knowledge, who actively produced numerous works. Christianization coincides with the invention of codex, that changed the situation with the circulation of books. In addition to the internal history of book knowledge, schools, libraries, general observations are made on the specifics of the situation in each of these centers. Constantinople as a new city formed the educational environment and was full of intellectuals standing under the influence of the state power. Athens became the last bastion of philosophy connected with the religious practices of paganism, what finally became the reason for the closure of the Athenian Academy. Alexandria as the crossroads of ideas gradually came to the fore as a center of thought and knowledge. There are more tolerant and compromise relations in it among the main forces and due to the lack of unity in the main participants of the historical process (Monophysites and Chalcedonians among Christians; moderate and radical neoplatonic philosophers; large number of other sciences and schools). An important aspect of the cultural processes in Early Byzantium was the Hellenization of the public law sphere and growing marginalization of the Latin language. High standards of literacy, book culture, and school system continued until Byzantium entered the Dark Ages.

TI  - A Remote Sensing-Based Application of Bayesian Networks for Epithermal Gold Potential Mapping in Ahar-Arasbaran Area, NW Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping hydrothermal alteration minerals using multispectral remote sensing satellite imagery provides vital information for the exploration of porphyry and epithermal ore mineralizations. The Ahar-Arasbaran region, NW Iran, contains a variety of porphyry, skarn and epithermal ore deposits. Gold mineralization occurs in the form of epithermal veins and veinlets, which is associated with hydrothermal alteration zones. Thus, the identification of hydrothermal alteration zones is one of the key indicators for targeting new prospective zones of epithermal gold mineralization in the Ahar-Arasbaran region. In this study, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (Landsat-7 ETM+), Landsat-8 and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) multispectral remote sensing datasets were processed to detect hydrothermal alteration zones associated with epithermal gold mineralization in the Ahar-Arasbaran region. Band ratio techniques and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied on Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 data to map hydrothermal alteration zones. Advanced argillic, argillic-phyllic, propylitic and hydrous silica alteration zones were detected and discriminated by implementing band ratio, relative absorption band depth (RBD) and selective PCA to ASTER data. Subsequently, the Bayesian network classifier was used to synthesize the thematic layers of hydrothermal alteration zones. A mineral potential map was generated by the Bayesian network classifier, which shows several new prospective zones of epithermal gold mineralization in the Ahar-Arasbaran region. Besides, comprehensive field surveying and laboratory analysis were conducted to verify the remote sensing results and mineral potential map produced by the Bayesian network classifier. A good rate of agreement with field and laboratory data is achieved for remote sensing results and consequential mineral potential map. It is recommended that the Bayesian network classifier can be broadly used as a valuable model for fusing multi-sensor remote sensing results to generate mineral potential map for reconnaissance stages of epithermal gold exploration in the Ahar-Arasbaran region and other analogous metallogenic provinces around the world.

AB  - Accurate flood mapping at global scale can support disaster relief and recovery efforts. Improving flood relief efforts with more accurate data is of great importance due to expected increases in the frequency and magnitude of flood events due to climate change. To assist efforts to operationalize deep learning algorithms for flood mapping at global scale, we introduce Sen1Floods11, a surface water data set including raw Sentinel-1 imagery and classified permanent water and flood water. This dataset consists of 4,831 512x512 chips covering 120,406 km(2) and spans all 14 biomes, 357 ecoregions, and 6 continents of the world across 11 flood events. We used Sen1Floods11 to train, validate, and test fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) to segment permanent and flood water. We compare results of classifying permanent, flood, and total surface water from training a FCNN model on four subsets of this data: i) 446 hand labeled chips of surface water from flood events; ii) 814 chips of publicly available permanent water data labels from Landsat (JRC surface water dataset); iii) 4,385 chips of surface water classified from Sentinel-2 images from flood events and iv) 4,385 chips of surface water classified from Sentinel-1 imagery from flood events. We compare these four models to a common remote sensing approach of thresholding radar backscatter to identify surface water. Results show the FCNN model trained on classifications of Sentinel-2 flood events performs best to identify flood and total surface water, while backscatter thresholding yielded the best result to identify permanent water classes only. Our results suggest deep learning models for flood detection of radar data can outperform threshold based remote sensing algorithms, and perform better with training labels that include flood water specifically, not just permanent surface water. We also find that FCNN models trained on plentiful automatically generated labels from optical remote sensing algorithms per- form better than models trained on scarce hand labeled data. Future research to operationalize computer vision approaches to mapping flood and surface water could build new models from Sen1Floods11 and expand this dataset to include additional sensors and flood events. We provide Sen1Floods11, as well as our training and evaluation code at: https://github.com/cloudtostreet/Sen1Floods11.

AB  - Brazil is one of the largest exporters of cattle meat production. Most of this production is under pasture areas, with different levels of livestock and field management. Remotely sensed images could be interesting tools to detect distinct temporal and spatial patterns of these systems. In this context, classification algorithms have been proposed to use information from satellite images to map different land covers. The Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) is an algorithm that has the advantage of working well with datasets with enough amounts of temporal information and seasonality patterns. In the present work, the TWDTW was performed to classify pasture managements in farms located in Western region of Sao Paulo State in Brazil for the years 2017 and 2018, as a primary study. It was used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series images from Moderate Resolution Imagine Spectroradiometer MODIS sensor (products MOD13Q1 and MYD13Q) with 250 meters of spatial resolution. In classifications for the years 2017 and 2018, it was observed a predominance of traditional pasture. Total areas of degraded and traditional pasture were very similar between 2017 and 2018. The year of 2017 showed higher spatial distribution of intensified pastures than year 2018. The classification achieved satisfying results with complete accuracy in validation. The information collected from field visits were important to analyse general aspects of the results. Therefore, in this pilot study TWDTW algorithm demonstrated to have potential in differentiating classes of pasture management. Next steps will be to explore the possibilities to classify pasture systems in large areas.

AB  - Purpose. The aim of the work is to develop, construct and test the experimental model for the ground-to-space monitoring of anthropogenic impacts on the Crimean coast using satellite and surface data. The system is intended to obtain significant parameters of marine environment required for revealing the anthropogenic impact sources, developing feasible recommendations on sustainable nature management and decreasing the anthropogenic load on marine ecosystems.Methods and Results. The paper represents description of the monitoring structure and the equipment focused on the ground segment of the system applied in the Marine Hydrophysical Institute of RAS, as well as the example of its implementation in monitoring the Crimean coastal water areas. Discussed is the concept of the ground-to-space monitoring of anthropogenic impacts on the coastal water areas which constitutes a foundation of the proposed system. The ground sub-satellite segment of the monitoring system intended for collecting, processing and storing the information obtained from the contact sensors is described. Special attention is paid to the workstation permitting to perform operational analysis of the obtained data. The experience of successful application of the monitoring system is represented. Arrangement of the field studies is described. Main results obtained from testing the monitoring system are briefly reviewed. Comprehensive analysis of subsatellite data and multi-spectral satellite images is shown by the example of detecting the emergency break at the main wastewater line in Sevastopol.Conclusions. The system of ground-to-space monitoring of the anthropogenic impacts on the Crimea coastal zone was developed, implemented and tested. The system functioning in 2015-2016 demonstrated its high efficiency in operational and complex analysis of direct and satellite data, especially in revealing emergency situations related to wastewater discharges to the sea.

AB  - This article will focus on the exchange of Joseontongsinsa and the Sorai school in the early 18th century, I would like to compare the communication between the representatives of Sorai school, Ohgyu Sorai and Dazai Shundai, and their writings on the perception of cultural exchanges, the Joseon Dynasty, and the recognition of the same culture. The two are teacher and disciple, but they stand out in contrast to the above issues. In particular, the main analysis subject was the “Hangwanchanghwago” which was written by Dazai Shundai in 1719, and intended to examine his exchanges and perceptions in detail.Dazai Shundai had high expectations for exchanges with Joseontongsinsa and was very active, including careful preparation in advance. In addition, the contents of the writings had a very open and friendly perception. He emphasized the sense of identity as an intellectual in the world of same culture and emphasized the importance of genuine heart exchange. He was proud of Japanese culture and insisted that it could be central flower(中華), but he honestly acknowledged the relative superiority of Joseon and wanted true exchange based on the recognition of the same culture.Shundai strongly criticized the attitudes of the Sorai schools who expressed their strong sense of competition with Joseontongsinsa in poetry exchange and conversation with a brush. In comparison with the trends of Japanese Confucian scholars who interacted with Joseontongsinsa, Neo-Confucian scholars respected the Confucianism of Joseon and were generally friendly. On the contrary, the Soraimuns dismissed the theory of Joseon as well as had a sense of competition in the poetry exchange with Joseontongsinsa. Not only they recognized friendly cultural exchange as a battle ground, but they also criticized Joseon's Confucianism and poetics. In particular, the competitive perception of Sorai's negative consciousness based on Japan-centric worldview had a profound effect on the descendants of Sorai school.As discussed in this article, the followings are briefly summarized the differences between Sorai and Shundai in Joseontongsinsa, cultural exchange, perception of Joseon, and the recognition of the same culture.First, Sorai had a strong consciousness regarding Joseontongsinsa as a tribute envoy, but Shundai was very critical. Second, in the competitive consciousness of seeing poetry exchange and conversation with a brush as a battle through poetry, Sorai was strong enough to be called a theory, but Shundai had no such consciousness and was very critical. Third, compared to Sorai's passive stance on the recognition of the same culture, Shundai stressed with a very positive attitude. Fourth, The two have little difference in self-awareness. Unlike traditional Japan-centric worldview based on dignity by military force and the Tenno of divine lineage, the basis of central flower is based on the development of Confucianism under the civilization policy of Tokugawa Shogunate.  The two agree in that. This is a very important fact. Based on this, Shundai leads to cultural relativism that can be central flower (which can be used internationally). In this respect, it is in line with that of Korean Confucian scholars. It can be said that it leads to the recognition of the same culture of sharing the same Confucian culture.

AB  - Songsa Ki-uman(1846~1916) was a famous scholar during the Japanese colonial period and a leader of patriotic soldier. He made great efforts to preserve “the seeds of studying Confucianism(儒學 種子)”. He even trained such talents and sent them to Myeonam(勉菴) Choi-ikhyon(崔益鉉). He even took the lead in patriotic activities.He named a Ja(字) to the disciples who followed him. Sometimes he wrote their Jasa(字辭) in the form of verse or prose. They were of course based on the Confucian scriptures and contained a Confucian worldview. Furthermore, as many as 33 pieces were left in the 『Songsajip(松沙集)』. The Songsa was to establish a solidarity between the relation of teacher and student through the wide spread of the Jasa(字辭).In addition, Songsa who left 600 Myogalmyong(墓碣銘) did not segmented grade of Myoju(墓主)'s social class or status. Not only that, he also created a number of works featuring women or people who died young. It emphasized the Confucian tradition of continuing the family by receiving the son-in-law and the filial duty of raising the father-in-law instead of the husband. It contains the contents of continuing the Confucian seeds in the Confucian values.As examined above, the Ja and Myogal-myeong left by Songsa were, in a word, a wide use of literature that established a Confucian bond. It can be pointed out that this is one of the means for the conservation of ‘the seeds of studying Confucianism’ and the succession of the spirit of studying Confucianism.

AB  - The mapping of vegetation and Land Cover (LC) is important for research and for public policy planning but, in Brazil, although diverse maps exist there are few studies comparing them. The semiarid region of the Caatinga, in northeastern Brazil is an area long neglected by scientific research and its vegetation is diverse and relatively rich despite years of human occupation and very little preservation effort. In this study we make a comparison between the main maps made for the Caatinga from four different sources: IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), TCN (Third National Communication), ProBio (Project for Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Biodiversity) and MapBiomas. We also test these maps against well-known Land Cover maps from ESA and NASA: ESA's GlobCover and Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Land Cover, and NASA's MODIS MCD12Q1, This was done on a sample area where many of the Caatinga's vegetation physiognomies can be found, using well-established Difference metrics and the new SPAtial EFficiency (SPAEF) algorithm as they present complementary viewpoints to test the correspondence of mapped classes as well as that of their spatial patterns, Our results show considerable disagreement between the maps tested and their class semantics, with IBGE's and ProBio's being the most similar among all national maps and Mapliiomas' the most closely related to global LC maps, The nature of the observed disagreement between these maps shows they diverge not only in the application of their classification systems, but also in their mapped spatial pattern, signaling the need for a better classification system and a better map of vegetation and land cover for the region,

TI  - Saving the World through Ethnography
T2  - JOURNAL OF WORLD CHRISTIANITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking cue from Ruth Benedict's dictum, "the purpose of anthropology is to make the world safe for human differences," the article will highlight how ethnographic accounts of Christian practices allow for the recognition and appreciation of difference within sameness. Ethnographic studies of community and ritual demonstrate that difference is internal to religious faiths as they migrate from community to community both within the same geographical region and also across the globe. By employing ethnographic studies (focusing on Anderson Jeremiah's work, "Community and Worldview among Paraiyars of South India" in particular) of Dalit Christians in South India, the article argues that ethnography offers itself as a soteriological category that could save not only Christian theology but also that which-by enabling theologies to self-critically reflect on their proclivity to hegemonic imaginations-saves the world.

TI  - Monitoring cyanobacteria occurrence in freshwater reservoirs using semi-analytical algorithms and orbital remote sensing
T2  - MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms pose a serious threat to the multiple uses of inland waters because of their adverse effects on the environment and human health. Monitoring cyanobacteria concentrations using traditional methods can be expensive and impractical. Recently, alternative efforts using remote sensing techniques have been successful. In particular, semi-analytical modelling approaches have been used to successfully predict chlorophyll (Chl)-a concentrations from remote sensing reflectance. The aims of this study were to test the performance of different semi-analytical algorithms in the estimation of Chl-a concentrations and the applicability of Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) imagery, and its atmospheric correction algorithms, in the estimation of Chl-a concentrations. For our dataset, phycocyanin concentration was strongly correlated with Chl-a concentration and the inversion model of inland waters (IIMIW) semi-analytical algorithm was the best performing model, achieving a root mean square error of 4.6 mg m(-3) in the prediction of Chl-a. When applying the IIMIW model to MSI data, the use of top-of-atmosphere reflectance performed better than the atmospheric correction algorithm tested. Overall, the results were satisfactory, demonstrating that even without an adequate atmospheric correction pipeline, the monitoring of cyanobacteria can be successfully achieved by applying a semi-analytical bio-optical model to MSI data.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications XI held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Monitoring of the Earth land covers is one of the most important areas in applying remote sensing data. In-situ measurements are necessary to confirm the performance of remote sensing devices through evaluation of data quality. These measurements are performed in established space test sites and serve as datasets presented in open database for referencing remotely sensed data to ground-truth spectral ones, for enhancement of data accuracy and for verification of information extraction techniques. This paper describes the creation of standard experimental data set as a part of a project financed by Bulgarian National Science Fund. This local thematic spectral library is going to allow direct comparability of data from various sources including from available spectral databases. The deliverables are summarized in chapters including information about the used spectrometers and the methodology of measurements; the description of studied land covers in the points of measurements; the additional information such as GPS coordinates and atmospheric conditions for the monitored land covers in appropriated format. It should be noted that the spectral measurements are made with different instruments with proper calibration sources. The final result is creating of a thematic spectral library in local scale as an open access database. For user friendly access to the library without specific programs, simple text versions of the spectral data, their visualizations, and text files in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) format with the metadata and the additional information is used. The authors intended to propose the possibility for exploiting the spectral data from specialists working in different areas following the procedures for accessing the thematic spectral database and downloading the spectral data. This work is supported by "National Science Fund" in Bulgaria under Contract number KP-06-M27/2.

AB  - The data developed by the MapBiomas Amazon initiative (http://amazonia mapbiomas.org/) led by the Amazon Geo-referenced Socio-environmental Information Network's (RAISG) is of unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution for the Andes region. It's comprised by a series of annual maps for the years 2000 to 2017 that allow to monitor the extent of transformation in this region using a single regional methodological approach. Several variables were included to solve Andes-specific methodological challenges and they represent adaptations of RAISG's Amazonian methodology to the Andean region. Among such, is the use of the novel NDFIb index (Turpo, 2018), an adaptation of the NDFI index that aims at mapping Andean Wetlands. Glaciers identification was aided by the fractional abundance of snow (Turpo, 2018), as well as small water bodies identification with McFeeters (1996) NDWI water index. This experience unfolds promising accessibility to novel land cover and land use regional reconstructions and comparisons possible only by the use of large-scale cloud-computing data processing tools, open source technology, spatially and temporally comprehensive remote sensing data, along with RAISG's standardized protocols and frameworks.

TI  - Irradiation of regional lymph node areas in breast cancer - Dose evaluation according to the Z0011, AMAROS, EORTC 10981-22023 and MA-20 field design
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to estimate the dose distribution from randomized trials (MA.20, EORTC 22922-10925 (EORTC), AMAROS and the Z0011 trial) on lymph node (LN) irradiation on a large LN atlas.Methods: 580 F-18-FDG-PET/CT positive LN metastases of 235 patients were transferred rigidly and non-rigidly to three "template CTs" (standard, obese and slender patient). Further, the LN clinical target volumes (CTVs) were contoured according to the ESTRO-guidelines. Treatment plans were designed (each for the left and right side) for all patients based on the study protocols of the MA.20, EORTC, AMAROS and Z0011 trial. Subsequently, the dose distribution in the ESTRO-CTVs and in the 580 LNs were assessed.Results: Our results reveal variable dose coverage (26.8 +/- 17.3 Gy-53.0 +/- 1.8 Gy) in the targeted LN areas (ESTRO-CTV and LN) in dependence of the treatment planning design and the patients' body shape. None of the treatment plan designs provided full dose coverage to the lymphatic drainage system. High tangent irradiation resulted in a similar dose distribution in L I and II compared to the AMAROS field design.Conclusion: Inclusion of the entire lymphatic system may not be necessary for all patients to reproduce the oncologic benefit shown in the randomized LN-irradiation trials. Inclusion of axillary level II and extension of the supraclavicular CTV can be considered in selected high-risk patients, based on dose recalculation of the MA.20 trial. Further, our results amplify earlier assumptions that irradiation may have accounted for the good results after SLND alone in the Z0011 trial. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Super-Resolution for Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Fusion Accounting for Seasonal Spectral Variability
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image fusion combines data from different heterogeneous sources to obtain more precise information about an underlying scene. Hyperspectral-multispectral (HS-MS) image fusion is currently attracting great interest in remote sensing since it allows the generation of high spatial resolution HS images and circumventing the main limitation of this imaging modality. Existing HS-MS fusion algorithms, however, neglect the spectral variability often existing between images acquired at different time instants. This time difference causes variations in spectral signatures of the underlying constituent materials due to the different acquisition and seasonal conditions. This paper introduces a novel HS-MS image fusion strategy that combines an unmixing-based formulation with an explicit parametric model for typical spectral variability between the two images. Simulations with synthetic and real data show that the proposed strategy leads to a significant performance improvement under spectral variability and state-of-the-art performance otherwise.

M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to evaluate the current status of handling and learning from sentinel events (SEs) in Dutch academic hospitals and to develop a basis for the first steps in a joint and transparent approach to improve learning from SEs.DesignSurvey by the Netherlands Federation of University Medical Centres (NFU) as part of the project 'Quality-based Governance'.Participants and settingAll eight Dutch University Medical Centres (UMCs).ResultsThree methods are used to identify the root cause of SEs: the Systematic Incident Reconstruction and Evaluation, Prevention and Recovery Information System for Monitoring and Analysis or TRIPOD method. Experts with different backgrounds are involved in the analysis of SEs. UMCs have different policies regarding the selection of recommendations for implementation. Some UMCs implement all recommendations formulated by the analysis team and in some UMCs the head of the involved department selects recommendations for implementation. No predetermined criteria have been established for this selection. Most UMCs confirm that similar SEs reoccur, which might be due to the quality of the analysis of the SEs or the quality of the recommendations.ConclusionThere is a large variety in handling SEs in Dutch academic hospitals and standards for the selection of recommendations are lacking. A next step to decrease the number of (similar) SEs lies in a joint and transparent approach to objectively assess recommendations and further define strategies for successful implementation. Selecting high-quality recommendations for implementation has the potential to lead to a decrease in the number of (similar) SEs and increase in the quality and safety of Dutch healthcare.

AB  - Considering the significant position of soil organic matter (SOM) in soil quality and maintenance, and its role in the functioning of soil physicochemical and biological processes, it is essential to monitor frequently the SOM status and its dynamics. It is a time-consuming and expensive task if we depend exclusively on chemical analysis, particularly in a semi-arid irrigated zone and with intensive agricultural activities and a very fragmented landscape. It is the Sidi Bennour region, which is situated in Doukkala Irrigated Perimeter in Morocco. Data from satellites could be a good alternative to conventional methods and fill this void with low costs. There has been a great deal of interest in satellite image prediction models, especially with free and abundant availability of satellite data. This work intends to predict SOM using Decision Trees (DT), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The soil samples (369 points) were collected at 0-30 cm of depth and the laboratory analysis was carried out. A multispectral Landsat-8 image was acquired and then calibrated. An image pansharpening processing was applied to produce a PAN image with 15m of resolution from 30m image resolution (MS). The obtained results indicate that the ANN model outperformed the other predictive models for both images (MS and PAN) with R-2 = 0.6553 and R-2 = 0.6985, respectively. The statistical RMSE of predictive models was 0.2153 and 0.2014, and MAE was 0.1682 and 0.1573 for both images, MS and PAN respectively. For this predictive model, the image pansharpening could increase the prediction accuracy of R-2 by 4.32% and reduce the RMSE by 1.39%.

AB  - Water supply for the arid irrigated plains in Morocco depends largely on the upper mountainous basins where significant amounts of precipitation fall as snow. In the Oum Er-Rbia River Basin (OER), snow covers the highest elevations from November to April. Despite the importance of this component in the hydrological cycle, snowmelt contribution to streamflow is still poorly understood and no monitoring stations exist in this zone. Therefore, studying the spatiotemporal change of snow cover through satellite observations to investigate its influence on the hydrological response of this scarce region is thus required to better manage water resources. This chapter explores basic characteristics of snow cover area (SCA) in the upstream area of the OER River (Tillouguite sub-basin) using MODIS daily snow cover products (MOD10A1). Correspondence between streamflow, accumulated air temperature and SCA changes during the winter and spring periods was examined from 2001 to 2009 at a weekly time step. The result shows an inverse linear relation between the maximum SCA and the mean normalized stream flow values, and a significant relation between the relative streamflow and cumulated temperature, especially during spring melt season depending on the length of the melt period. These primary results could be used to develop simplified predictable models for spring discharge in ungauged watershed using remote sensing and accumulated air temperature.

This paper introduces the HELIOSAT method applied to derive Gill from satellite images and shows the adaptation to apply the method for Landsat8 images. To analyse the results provided by the implemented methodology a validation against measurements has been made.

AB  - Radar and optical data have shown great potential for monitoring soil and canopy parameters. In this context, Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) time series were used to retrieve different parameters using models and different algorithms. The main objective of this study is to analyze the potential a synergetic use of radar and optical data for the estimation of soil moisture, irrigation detection and soil texture over agricultural areas for sustainable management of water and soil resources.First, the radar signal is simulated using a semi empirical backscattering model over bare soil and vegetation cover. The Water Cloud Model parameterized with NDVI for vegetation contribution allows a good estimation of soil moisture by inversion techniques. Soil moisture time series were then developed for the spatialization of irrigation and soil texture. In this study, both products have shown good agreement with in situ measurements.

AB  - Soil texture estimation is important in several applications. However, field sampling or laboratory analyzes are very expensive and not very representative. Besides, existing soil maps are neither exhaustive nor sufficiently precise for modeling and meeting needs at field scale.This study aimed to explore the potential of Sentinel satellites to predict topsoil texture, and more precisely to produce clay content map at fine spatial resolution. With its components and its porosity, soil texture is directly linked to soil moisture. In this context and with the arrival of Sentinel constellation, data are acquired with high spatial and temporal resolution. And soil moisture is retrieved from a synergetic use of Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data between July and early December 2017, over a semi-arid area in central Tunisia. Relationship between soil moisture and clay content is studied and used to produce texture map.Classification algorithm based on random forest (RF) is used for the mapping of clay content classes. The results showed the potential of S-1 and S-2 products to predict soil texture.

AB  - The ubiquitous presence of superstitious beliefs calls for an in-depth study of their cognitive foundations from a cross-cultural perspective. Potential drivers of human behaviour, superstitions are viewed in this paper as cultural constructs resulting from the complex nature of human experience and cognitive activity. This research aims to present unfounded beliefs as a cognitive phenomenon and to identify underlying conceptual mechanisms. With the use of a complex methodology including observation, hermeneutic and conceptual analysis, several most popular superstitious signs and beliefs in three cultures - Russian, English and French - are scrutinized in a bid to obtain a better understanding of the preferences different cultures demonstrate in selecting a focus in the conceptual framework of a superstition. The paper shows how choosing a different focal point is reflected in the interpretation of a superstition, consequently resulting in a different behavioural pattern. It is argued that adding a linguistic dimension to the research of superstitions makes it possible to demonstrate the role systemic linguistic differences play in creating a culture-specific superstitious worldview. Common and specific models of verbal and non-verbal superstitious behaviors are part of any national culture, and this "linguistic-behavioral" cluster can be classified as a cultural idiom whose exploration will be beneficial for practical purposes in foreign language teaching and will open new avenues in cross-cultural studies.

TI  - Assessment of potential of intraregional conflicts by developing a transferability index for inter-basin water transfers, and their impacts on the water resources
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid population growth, rising water demands, inefficient management, and various distributions of water are the major causes of increased pressure on water resources and the consequent increased water-based conflicts especially in arid and semi-arid regions in Iran being a case in point. Iran is the second largest country in the Middle East. The country-wide average annual precipitation is about 250 mm, which is about one third of the world's average. Therefore, Iran is one of the driest countries in the world. The water supply for human activities in Iran's provinces has become an increasingly complex task. One of the conventional methods to supply water to these regions is through inter-basin water transfers, from water-endowed regions to water-scarce regions. For such projects, it is necessary but also difficult and expensive to estimate the total water storage of every province with traditional methods. This study employs the GRACE satellite data for 2002-2016 are used and develops a method to assess the linkage between water scarcity and conflicts in Iran's provinces. In addition, a transferability index is formulated based on population and conveyable water parameters demonstrating the conditions of the provinces in inter-basin water transfer for reaching equitable compromises. This index leads to an evaluation of the possibility of conflicts arising from inter-basin water transfer projects in Iran. This work's results show that the Bushehr region has a significant amount of conveyable water and low population and hence is suitable to be one of the water-exporting provinces in the inter-basin water projects. The results of this work also demonstrate that the western provinces are likely to experience serious depletion of water resources, and conflicts may arise in the western and central basins due to the changes in water quantity exacerbated by the inter-basin transfer projects.

AB  - The script allows performingSpectral indices andSpectral decomposition analysis on Google Earth Engine satellite image collections. The script was developed using Google Colaboratory and does not need any desktop installation. ThisPythonscriptcodewasdevelopedbydr.F.BrandoliniandG.Domingo-Ribastoaccompanythepaper: "BrandoliniF.,Domingo-RibasG.,ZerboniA.andTurnerS."AGoogleEarthEngine/enabledPythonapproachtoimproveidentificationofanthropogenicpalaeo-landscapefeatures",submittedtoOpenResearchEurope. The necessity of sustainable development for landscapes has emerged as an important theme in recent decades. Current approaches take a holistic approach to landscape heritage and promote an interdisciplinary dialogue to facilitate complementary landscape management strategies. With the socio-economic values of the 'natural and 'cultural landscape heritage increasingly recognised worldwide, remote sensing tools are being used more and more to facilitate the recording and management of landscape heritage. Satellite remote sensing technologies have enabled significant improvements in landscape research. The advent of the cloud-based platform of Google Earth Engine has allowed the rapid exploration and processing of satellite imagery such as the Landsat and Copernicus Sentinel datasets. In this paper, the use of Sentinel-2 satellite data in the identification of palaeo-riverscape features has been assessed in the Po Plain, selected because it is characterized by human exploitation since the Mid-Holocene. A multi-temporal approach has been adopted to investigate the potential of satellite imagery to detect buried hydrological features along with Spectral Index and Spectral Decomposition analysis. This research represents one of the first applications of the GEE Python API in landscape studies. The complete FOSS-cloud protocol proposed here consists of a Python code script developed in Google Colab which could be simply adapted and replicated in different areas of the world. Material and Methods The Sentinel 2 (S2) satellite data were accessed through the Python [1] module geemap [2] in Colab [3], a serverless Jupyter notebook computational environmentfor interactive development [4]. The native GEE Python API has relatively limited functionality for visualizing results but the geemap Python module was createdspecifically to fill this gap. Finally, the python code developed enables the analysis of the S2 filtered image collection through Spectral Index (SI) andSpectral Decomposition (SD) techniques. Each image was exported in Geo.TIFF format in QGIS [4] where the Min/Max values were adjusted with the CumulativeCount Cut tool. Finally, the figures presented in this paper were generated in the QGIS Layout Editor. The Python modules rasterio [5] and matplotlib [6]were used respectively to create individual plots for each band of the raster and histograms of their values.

AB  - People are motivated to protect their worldviews. One way to protect one's worldviews is through prejudice toward worldview-dissimilar groups and individuals. The traditional hypothesis predicts that people with more traditional and conservative worldviews will be more likely to protect their worldviews with prejudice than people with more liberal and progressive worldviews, whereas the worldview conflict hypothesis predicts that people with both traditional and liberal worldviews will be protect their worldviews through prejudice. We review evidence across both political and religious domains, as well as evidence using disgust sensitivity, Big Five personality traits, and cognitive ability as measures of individual differences historically associated with prejudice. We discuss four core findings that are consistent with the worldview conflict hypothesis: (1) The link between worldview conflict and prejudice is consistent across worldviews. (2) The link between worldview conflict and prejudice is found across various expressions of prejudice. (3) The link between worldview conflict and prejudice is found in multiple countries. (4) Openness, low disgust sensitivity, and cognitive ability-traits and individual differences historically associated with less prejudice-may in fact also show evidence of worldview conflict. We discuss how worldview conflict may be rooted in value dissimilarity, identity, and uncertainty management, as well as potential routes for reducing worldview conflict.

M3  - Article
AB  - Permanent Preservation Areas (APPs) are spaces specially protected by law, through the Brazilian Forest Code (CFB). These spaces, despite being environmentally fragile, play important ecosystem functions, especially the protection of water resources. However, the irregular use of APPs in rural and urban environments is becoming increasingly common, as in the case of the Metropolitan Region of Goiania (RMG), Goias. Given this problem, this article provides an assessment of the situation of PPAs that understand RMG, from the use of remote sensing data and geographic information systems, as strategic tools for decision making processes and management of these spaces. The cartographic products (maps of use and occupation, APPs and conflict of use in APPs) allowed to identify the predominance of cultivated pastures in almost 45% of all mapped APPs (river, springs, lakes and lagoons). In the current scenario, the non-compliance with what is foreseen in the BFC is perceived in all member municipalities of this region, with degradation percentages greater than 40% of APPs. Therefore, attention is drawn mainly to the consequences of this process of de -characterization of protected areas on the quality and quantity of water resources in the research area, which has been experiencing water shortage since 2017, to the point that in 2018 and 2019, the government of Goias declared a state of water crisis in the RMG. In this sense, it is increasingly urgent a noter position of the Government to regularize these spaces, given the irregular occupation mainly by the use of pastures.

AB  - Large-scale fires that develop without control can cause material damage, interruption of production processes, loss of human life and impact on the environment. This investigation has been carried out with the objective of analyzing the data obtained through the geographic information systems with the forest fires of the Costa-Sierra Occidental Region. The methodology was divided into three processes. Firstly, is the detection of heat points with satellite images AVHRR and MODIS. Secondly, comes the characterization of the site where the heat points are located, their publication, and distribution of the information and lastly relate it to the atmospheric systems present at the time of the fire. Comparing the records of fires from 2015 to 2018, it was noted that 2015 had the lowest number of fires, while in 2018 the fires were mainly affecting the pine-oak forest, followed by the medium semi-evergreen seasonal forest.

T2  - ANALES DE GEOGRAFIA DE LA UNIVERSIDAD COMPLUTENSE
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of the eco-environmental vulnerability allows to identify land cover patterns and to establish risk areas. This research aims to assess the eco-environmental vulnerability of the Sauce Grande river basin (Argentina) from the delimitation of the land cover obtained from two matrices: one resulting from a spatial simulation model (optimal scenario), and another, derived from fieldwork (in situ scenario). The methodology included the analyses of climatic, geomorphologic, topographic, hydric and edaphic data in order to design a modeling land cover map. The in situ land cover map was the result of the obtention of spectral signatures and the digital processing of Landsat images. As a result, we identified five areas with different levels of eco-environmental vulnerability. The most common level was low (27.7 %), following by high (22.5 %). These analyses permitted to design sustainable management strategies orientated to reduce negative environmental impacts and motivate the permanence of local and regional economic activities.

TI  - The Use of Multisource Optical Sensors to Study Phytoplankton Spatio-Temporal Variation in a Shallow Turbid Lake
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake water quality monitoring has the potential to be improved through integrating detailed spatial information from new generation remote sensing satellites with high frequency observations from in situ optical sensors (WISPstation). We applied this approach for Lake Trasimeno with the aim of increasing knowledge of phytoplankton dynamics at different temporal and spatial scales. High frequency chlorophyll-a data from the WISPstation was modeled using non-parametric multiplicative regression. The 'day of year' was the most important factor, reflecting the seasonal progression of a phytoplankton bloom from July to September. In addition, weather factors such as the east-west wind component were also significant in predicting phytoplankton seasonal and diurnal patterns. Sentinel 3-OLCI and Sentinel 2-MSI satellites delivered 42 images in 2018 that successfully mapped the spatial and seasonal change in chlorophyll-a. The potential influence of localized inflows in contributing to increased chlorophyll-a in mid-summer was visualized. The satellite data also allowed an estimation of quality status at a much finer scale than traditional manual methods. Good correspondence was found with manually collected field data but more significantly, the greatly increased spatial and temporal resolution provided by satellite and WISPstation sensors clearly offers an unprecedented resource in the research and management of aquatic resources.

AB  - Spatial changes, temporal variability and trends of the coastal position were studied from Landsat 8 OLI satellite images, where coastlines were taken at the satellite revisit dates with a RTK-GNSS in situ. Also, the characteristics of the surface sediments in the direct sub-environments of the beaches were analyzed. Eleven cross-sections of the shore were established to quantify sedimentary patterns and observed coastal variation over time. Preliminary results indicate RMS values less than 5 m, between the in situ measured shorelines and those extracted from SHOREX -Shoreline extractionalgorithm. The cyclical and short-term changes registered in the selected beaches for this analysis allowed to analyze the width variability of different beach segments, suggesting a differential behavior through the coastal axis. This represents a correct approach to systematic and efficient revision of the chilean Central Coast.

TI  - Competitive Versus Cooperative Approaches to River Repair
T2  - FINDING THE VOICE OF THE RIVER: BEYOND RESTORATION AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Contemporary approaches to river repair are economically driven. A competitive (Medean) worldview separates humans from nature, managing rivers as resource and service providers using top-down, command and control practices. In contrast, a cooperative, collaborative, more-than-human (Gaian) approach to living with rivers sees humans as part of nature, conceptualizing the Earth System as a living and emergent superorganism. Bottom-up inclusionary approaches to engagement, participation and governance are framed as holistic and ongoing commitments to place-based, catchment-specific endeavours. Contrasting approaches to conservation planning, restoration activities and co-governance and co-management arrangements are engendered through these alternative framings. Recent river rights legislation offers an intriguing prospect to reframe societal relations to rivers.

AB  - This work examines the impact of image acquisition time on rice paddy remote sensing data in Yanco, NSW, Australia. The normalized difference red edge (NDRE) is an important vegetation index for rice paddy N status. Models of midseason N uptake were extracted using physical samples and NDRE data taken at multiple times of day from a UAV with multi-spectral camera. The best prediction error was 15.8 kg/ha. With a model extracted at 13:00 on 1 January, model predictions from 27 December to 11 January, at image times from 11:00 to 16:00, N uptake prediction errors were less than 28.5 kg/ha. Predictions from images acquired at times very different from the one used to extract the model are more erroneous.

TI  - Land Cover Classification of Nine Perennial Crops Using Sentinel-1 and-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover mapping of intensive cropping areas facilitates an enhanced regional response to biosecurity threats and to natural disasters such as drought and flooding. Such maps also provide information for natural resource planning and analysis of the temporal and spatial trends in crop distribution and gross production. In this work, 10 meter resolution land cover maps were generated over a 6200 km(2) area of the Riverina region in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, with a focus on locating the most important perennial crops in the region. The maps discriminated between 12 classes, including nine perennial crop classes. A satellite image time series (SITS) of freely available Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery was used. A segmentation technique grouped spectrally similar adjacent pixels together, to enable object-based image analysis (OBIA). K-means unsupervised clustering was used to filter training points and classify some map areas, which improved supervised classification of the remaining areas. The support vector machine (SVM) supervised classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel gave the best results among several algorithms trialled. The accuracies of maps generated using several combinations of the multispectral and radar bands were compared to assess the relative value of each combination. An object-based post classification refinement step was developed, enabling optimization of the tradeoff between producers' accuracy and users' accuracy. Accuracy was assessed against randomly sampled segments, and the final map achieved an overall count-based accuracy of 84.8% and area-weighted accuracy of 90.9%. Producers' accuracies for the perennial crop classes ranged from 78 to 100%, and users' accuracies ranged from 63 to 100%. This work develops methods to generate detailed and large-scale maps that accurately discriminate between many perennial crops and can be updated frequently.

TI  - Small-Scale Livestock Production in Nepal Is Directly Associated with Children's Increased Intakes of Eggs and Dairy, But Not Meat
T2  - NUTRIENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Animal source foods (ASF) provide nutrients essential to child growth and development yet remain infrequently consumed in rural Nepal. Agriculture and nutrition programs aim to increase ASF intake among children through small-scale animal husbandry projects. The relationship between livestock ownership and children's consumption of ASF, however, is not well established. This study examined associations between livestock ownership and the frequency with which Nepali children consume eggs, dairy, and meat. We analyzed longitudinal 7-day food frequency data from sentinel surveillance sites of the Policy and Science of Health, Agriculture and Nutrition (PoSHAN) study. Data consisted of surveys from 485 Nepali farming households conducted twice per year for two years (a total of 1449 surveys). We used negative binomial regression analysis to examine the association between the number of cattle, poultry, and meat animals (small livestock) owned and children's weekly dairy, egg, and meat intakes, respectively, adjusting for household expenditure on each food type, mother's education level, caste/ethnicity, agroecological region, season, and child age and sex. We calculated predicted marginal values based on model estimates. Children consumed dairy 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-2.0), 2.3 (1.7-3.0) and 3.0 (2.1-4.2) more times per week in households owning 1, 2-4 and >4 cattle, respectively, compared to children in households without cattle. Children consumed eggs 2.8 (2.1-3.7) more times per week in households owning 1 or 2 chickens compared to children in households without chickens. Child intake of meat was higher only in households owning more than seven meat animals. Children's intakes of dairy, eggs, and meat rose with household expenditure on these foods. Small-scale animal production may be an effective strategy for increasing children's consumption of eggs and dairy, but not meat. Increasing household ability to access ASF via purchasing appears to be an important approach for raising children's intakes of all three food types.

TI  - Simulation of spatial variability in crop leaf area index and yield using agroecosystem modeling and geophysics-based quantitative soil information
T2  - VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroecosystem models that simulate crop growth as a function of weather conditions and soil characteristics are among the most promising tools for improving crop yield and achieving more sustainable agricultural production systems. This study aims at using spatially distributed crop growth simulations to investigate how field-scale patterns in soil properties obtained using geophysical mapping affect the spatial variability of soil water content dynamics and growth of crops at the square kilometer scale. For this, a geophysics-based soil map was intersected with land use information. Soil hydraulic parameters were calculated using pedotransfer functions. Simulations of soil water content dynamics performed with the agroecosystem model AgroC were compared with soil water content measured at two locations, resulting in RMSE of 0.032 and of 0.056 cm(3) cm(-3), respectively. The AgroC model was then used to simulate the growth of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), silage maize (Zea mays L.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and winter rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) in the 1- by 1-km study area. It was found that the simulated leaf area index (LAI) was affected by the magnitude of simulated water stress, which was a function of both the crop type and soil characteristics. Simulated LAI was generally consistent with the observed LAI calculated from normalized difference vegetation index (LAI(NDVI)) obtained from RapidEye satellite data. Finally, maps of simulated agricultural yield were produced for four crops, and it was found that simulated yield matched well with actual harvest data and literature values. Therefore, it was concluded that the information obtained from geophysics-based soil mapping was valuable for practical agricultural applications.

AB  - This work proposes a solution to identify the number of sources of radiation, as well as their respective intensities and locations based on data acquired by Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and affordable radiological sensors, such as Geiger-Muller counters (GMC). An optimization algorithm is required to minimize the estimation error in terms of location, intensity and number of sources of radiation given all the intensity measurements acquired in different locations, taking into account the sensors' models, background radiation intensity values and noise. Experimental results were achieved in a laboratory with controlled sources of radiation. The solution was also tested with real data gathered by a GMC connected to a mobile phone with a software application developed by the authors to synchronize the sensor readings with GPS data. The sensor and the mobile phone are attached to a quadcopter flying over the scenario with sources of radiation.

TI  - Monitoring of post-fire forest scars in Serbia based on satellite Sentinel-2 data
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to improving long-term post-fire environment assessment. It proposes a method for monitoring fire impact using Sentinel-2 satellite data by combining spectral and textural features of land cover types inside a post-fire study sites. Specific objectives were to 1) test stability of the burnt area index for Sentinel-2 (BAIS2) for identification of burn in study sites, 2) investigate the optimal feature combination for mapping land covers inside study sites, and 3) assess and analyse dynamic in land covers of study sites. BAIS2 was shown independent on date acquisition of satellite images to distinguish forest burn from other land covers over the analysed May-September vegetation period. Texture of study site improved the classification results. The most accurate classification method for identification of study sites land covers (with 0.84 Kappa coefficient and 0.86 overall accuracy) was based on combination of Sentinel-2 bands, BAIS2, and texture by Fourier transform. Analysis of vegetation recovery within the study sites demonstrated different recovery rates. Natural regeneration of pine was not observed, during three to six years of observations following fire events. The proposed method and findings can support planning of forest management measures needed to effectively restore forest cover.

CP  - 8th IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - There has been a substantial growth in remotely sensed hyperspectral satellite imagery. These data offer opportunities to understand phenomena and inform decision making. The nature of these collections introduces challenges stemming from their volumes, variety, and spatiotemporal resolutions. The crux of this study is to facilitate effective training of deep learning models over satellite data collections. We describe our novel embeddings (multidimensional latent space representations) based approach to effectively support model training, refinement, and inferences. We rigorously explore several aspects relating to embeddings, including their dimensionality, single vs multiple bands, and preservation of inter-band metrics. We also incorporate support for transfer learning over spatiotemporal scopes to address issues relating to cold start and alleviate resource pressure. Our methodology addresses disk, network. CPU/GPU, and accuracy implications of several aspects relating to model construction. Our empirical benchmarks assess the suitability of our methodology using the MOMS and Sentinel-2 satellite data. We demonstrate that our methodology reduces storage requirements by more than 10,000x and reduces model construction times by 75%.

TI  - Recycling Stories: Mantras, Communication, and Organizational Materialization
T2  - ORGANIZATION STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Religious non-governmental organizations (RNGOs) are becoming powerful organizational actors, but how are these organizations enacted through the communicative practices of their members? To address this question, this article offers a conceptual framework for investigating how the terse retelling of an inspirational organizational story, encapsulated in a mantra, contributes to materializing a Buddhist NGO's ethos and worldview. The value of this framework is subsequently demonstrated through an in-depth naturalistic case study of a mantra's constitutive force in the enactment of a large international Buddhist NGO that is increasingly focused on environmental protection. By showing how a mantra acts as a textualization, substantiation, and invocation device in mass, social media, and face-to-face communication, this study makes important contributions to the literature on the intersection between religion and organization as well as the communicative constitution of organizations.

AB  - Based on the working mechanism and characteristics of spaceborne hyperspectral Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, the computer and software were used as data acquisition and processing tools in this paper to study and simulate the various processes in photoelectric information processing of spectrometer. Analytical models including functional modules such as interference signal generation, effective signal detection, spectral data inversion and instrument error correction was established, then a visualization software system was developed. Finally, the accuracy of the model was calculated and optimized with experiments, the verification results show that this resolving system can process the interference data with high spectral resolution non- destructively, significantly improve the smoothness of the restored spectrum without distortion, and the measured spectral resolution of an instrument is better than 0.03cm(-1). This digital model could provide useful support for the design and parameter optimization of the aerospace Fourier transform infrared spectrometer.

TI  - Fluorescence background quenching as a means to increase Signal to Background ratio - a proof of concept during Nerve Imaging
T2  - THERANOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Adequate signal to background ratios are critical for the implementation of fluorescence-guided surgery technologies. While local tracer administrations help to reduce the chance of systemic side effects, reduced spatial migration and non-specific tracer diffusion can impair the discrimination between the tissue of interest and the background. To combat background signals associated with local tracer administration, we explored a pretargeting concept aimed at quenching non-specific fluorescence signals. The efficacy of this concept was evaluated in an in vivo neuronal tracing set-up.Methods: Neuronal tracing was achieved using a wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) lectin. functionalized with an azide-containing Cy5 dye (N-3-Cy5-WGA). A Cy7 quencher dye (Cy7-DBCO) was subsequently used to yield Cy7-Cy5-WGA, a compound wherein the Cy5 emission is quenched by Forster resonance energy transfer to Cy7. The photophysical properties of N-3-Cy5-WGA and Cy7-Cy5-WGA were evaluated together with deactivation kinetics in situ, in vitro (Schwannoma cell culture), ex vivo (muscle tissue from mice; used for dose optimization), and in vivo (nervus ischiadicus in THY-1 YFP mice).Results: In situ, conjugation of Cy7-DBCO to N-3-Cy5-WGA resulted in >90% reduction of the Cy5 fluorescence signal intensity at 30 minutes after addition of the quencher. In cells, pretargeting with the N-3-Cy5-WGA lectin yielded membranous staining, which could efficiently be deactivated by Cy7-DBCO over the course of 30 minutes (91% Cy5 signal decrease). In ex vivo muscle tissue, administration of Cy7-DBCO at the site where N-3-Cy5-WGA was injected induced 80-90% quenching of the Cy5-related signal after 10-20 minutes, while the Cy7-related signal remained stable over time. In vivo, Cy7-DBCO effectively quenched the non-specific background signal up to 73% within 5 minutes, resulting in a 50% increase in the signal-to-background ratio between the nerve and injection site.Conclusion: The presented pretargeted fluorescence-quenching technology allowed fast and effective reduction of the background signal at the injection site, while preserving in vivo nerve visualization. While this proof-of-principle study was focused on imaging of nerves using a fluorescent WGA-lectin, the same concept could in the future also apply to applications such as sentinel node imaging.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) tomographic techniques enable the reconstruction of the scene scattering structure along the vertical direction and can provide the temporal evolution of a cloud of reliable points located in the 3D space. The use of Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test approaches have been shown to be effective in selecting reliable multiple scatterers. Recently regularized tomographic methods have been proposed for increasing the density of the recovered scatterers in urban environments. This paper discusses the differences between these two approaches and performs a comparison of reconstruction results obtained from a stack of TerraSAR-X images, in a region of interest located in the city of Paris, France.

TI  - Diversity in health professional education scholarship: a document analysis of international author representation in leading journals
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The global distribution of health professionals and associated training programmes is wide but prior study has demonstrated reported scholarship of teaching and learning arises from predominantly Western perspectives.Design We conducted a document analysis to examine authorship of recent publications to explore current international representation.Data sources The table of contents of seven high-impact English-language health professional education journals between 2008 and 2018 was extracted from Embase.Eligibility criteria The journals were selected according to highest aggregate ranking across specific scientific impact indices and stating health professional education in scope; only original research and review articles from these publications were included for analysis.Data extraction and synthesis The table of contents was extracted and eligible publications screened by independent reviewers who further characterised the geographic affiliations of the publishing research teams and study settings (if applicable).Results A total 12018 titles were screened and 7793 (64.8%) articles included. Most were collaborations (7048, 90.4%) conducted by authors from single geographic regions (5851, 86%). Single-region teams were most often formed from countries in North America (56%), Northern Europe (14%) or Western Europe (10%). Overall lead authorship from Asian, African or South American regions was less than 15%, 5% and 1%, respectively. Geographic representation varied somewhat by journal, but not across time.Conclusions Diversity in health professional education scholarship, as marked by nation of authors' professional affiliations, remains low. Under-representation of published research outside Global North regions limits dissemination of novel ideas resulting in unidirectional flow of experiences and a concentrated worldview of teaching and learning.

T2  - GEOGRAPHIA POLONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study documents the spatio-temporal land use and land cover dynamics of Yangoupokpi Lokchao Wildlife Sanctuary (YLWLS) in Manipur, India. Landsat imageries at three points of time spanning 38 years (1978, 2000 and 2016) were taken into account. Supervised image classification techniques were employed. Fragstats software was used to derive five landscape metrics, namely, class area (CA), number of patches (NP), largest patch index (LPI), percentage of landscape (PLAND) and mean patch size (MPS), to quantitatively assess the level of landscape fragmentation in the YLWLS. Dense and moderately dense forests decreased markedly during 1978-2000 from 46.5% to 40% and 38% to 28% of the total geographical area, respectively. However, between 2000 and 2016, the sanctuary managed to gain 840 ha of dense forest through various afforestation activities. The overall change in YLWLS during 1978-2016 indicates a substantial transition of dense and moderately dense forests.

AB  - Recently, the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) have agreed to carry out a joint study for an Earth Observation scientific mission in the infrared spectral range (MWIR-LWIR). A mission of this type is considered of high priority by the NASA's "Decadal Survey" plan, as well as being one of the priorities of the future Sentinel of the Copernicus program. Furthermore, an MWIR-LWIR system with spatial resolutions better than 90 m (target 50 m) could represent a formidable integration of the observational capacity of the ASI PRISMA and SHALOM missions, as it would allow observing the entire wavelength range from Visible to thermal IR and consequently expanding the spectrum of scientific applications of the national satellite system. INGV in 2018-2019 in the frame of ASI contract has carried out a review of scientific and technical requirements for a new EO "Thermal Mission" which my support a large number of applications.

TI  - Utilizing ecological niche modelling to predict habitat suitability of eastern equine encephalitis in Florida
T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a virus found predominantly east of the Mississippi River in the United States that can be fatal to both equines and humans. The disease has previously been most prolific in states like Florida, but there has been an increase in the prevalence in other states further up north on the east coast of the United States in recent years. The purpose of this research is to use the ecological niche modelling program Maxent to model EEEV habitat suitability probability. This research utilized data of fatality incidence in equine hosts, versus sentinel chicken infection data, the spatial data traditionally utilized for mapping EEEV. This research produced a map of habitat suitability, which expanded on previous risk models by utilizing additional environmental factors. It confirmed areas of higher probability identified by previous models but identified more narrow areas of higher probability as well. This model adds to the literature applying ecological modelling techniques to spatial epidemiology. It highlights spaces that represent the culmination of environmental factors for the transmission of EEEV. Considering these environmental factors identified can assist in identifying places where there is a higher risk of EEEV as new cases begin to appear.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to study the place and role of cattle in traditional life, family and tribal rituals of Khakass people. To achieve this goal, the following tasks were solved: identification of its economic value and role in the worldview and ritual practices of the people.The chronological scope of works covers the late XIX - mid XX centuries. The choice of these temporal boundaries caused primarily by the state of the database sources on the research topic. The main sources are the historical-ethnographic and folklore materials. The work based on complex, system and historical approach to the study of the past. Research methodology based on historical-ethnographic methods - scientific descriptions of concrete historical and relic.In the analysis we can draw the following conclusions: 1) in the traditional economy of Khakass people an important place was given to the cattle; 2) Special attention was paid to the breeding of cattle. He was distinguished by its functionality. From this type of pets in the greatest number received the bulk of meat and dairy products, skin, etc. used for manufacturing clothes and various household needs; 3) High utilitarian value of cows / bulls contributed to the fact that in everyday life of the Khakass people, they acted as the common settlement funds, as well as the most important subject of trade, including barter; 4) the presence of cattle and its quantitative composition was the basis of material well-being and stability of people's lives. All this was a marker of social status and of his family, and often a key identification factor; 5) High practical and symbolic importance of these pets is reflected in the folklore and in the religious-mythological views of the Khakass people. Animals were identified a special role in rituals, due to the life cycle of man: birth, marriage and death. In rituals in addition to its direct purpose, such as the main source of meat and dairy products, considerable importance was attached to their iconic status. Cows and bulls, as prestigious gifts were the key subject of such processes for child birth, wedding ceremonies and funerals. The way these animals became an integral part of the ritual texts associated with the life cycles of man. In family and tribal rites special symbolic value endowed and private part of their body - the head, sternum, sacrum. Great sacred significance was attached to the cow's milk. In the religious-mythological consciousness of the Khakass people cattle is often perceived as a vehicle for the soul of the deceased.Summing up the above it can be stated that in the traditional culture of Khakass people considered pets and their images took an important place and has carried out various socio-normative and ritual functions.

TI  - Fat fractions from high-resolution 3D radial Dixon MRI for predicting metastatic axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To assess diagnostic performance of fat fractions (FF) from high-resolution 3D radial Dixon MRI for differentiating metastatic and non-metastatic axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients.Method: High-resolution 3D radial Dixon MRI was prospectively performed on 1.5 T in 70 biopsy-verified breast cancer patients. 35 patients were available for analysis with histopathologic and imaging data. FF images were calculated as fat / in-phase. Two radiologists measured lymph node FF and assessed morphological features in one ipsilateral and one contralateral lymph node in consensus. Diagnostic performance of lymph node FF and morphological criteria were compared using histopathology as reference.Results: 22 patients had metastatic axillary lymph nodes. Mean lymph node FF were 0.20 +/- 0.073, 0.31 +/- 0.079, and 0.34 +/- 0.15 (metastatic, non-metastatic ipsi- and non-metastatic contralateral lymph nodes, respectively). Metastatic lymph node FF were significantly lower than non-metastatic ipsi- (p < 0.001) and contralateral lymph nodes (p < 0.001). Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for lymph node FF was 0.80 compared to 0.76 for morphological criteria (p = 0.29). Lymph node FF yielded sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.69, positive predictive value (PPV) 0.83, and negative predictive value (NPV) 0.82, while morphological criteria yielded sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.62, PPV 0.80, and NPV 0.80 (p = 0.71). Combining lymph node FF and morphological criteria increased diagnostic performance with sensitivity 1.00, specificity 0.67, PPV 0.86, NPV 1.00, and AUC 0.83.Conclusions: Lymph node FF from high-resolution 3D Dixon images are a promising quantitative indicator of metastases in axillary lymph nodes.

TI  - Epidemic Influenza Seasons from 2008 to 2018 in Poland: A Focused Review of Virological Characteristics
T2  - TRENDS IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The objective of this review was to elaborate on changes in the virological characteristics of influenza seasons in Poland in the past decade. The elaboration was based on the international influenza surveillance system consisting of Sentinel and non-Sentinel programs, recently adopted by Poland, in which professionals engaged in health care had reported tens of thousands of cases of acute upper airway infections. The reporting was followed by the provision of biological specimens collected from patients with suspected influenza and influenza-like infection, in which the causative contagion was then verified with molecular methods. The peak incidence of influenza infections has regularly been in January-March each epidemic season. The number of tested specimens ranged from 2066 to 8367 per season from 2008/2009 to 2017/2018. Type A virus predominated in nine out of the ten seasons and type B virus of the Yamagata lineage in the 2017/2018 season. Concerning the influenza-like infection, respiratory syncytial virus predominated in all the seasons. There was a sharp increase in the proportion of laboratory confirmations of influenza infection from season to season in relation to the number of specimens examined, from 3.2% to 42.4% over the decade. The number of confirmations, enabling a prompt commencement of antiviral treatment, related to the number of specimens collected from patients and on the virological situation in a given season. Yet influenza remains a health scourge, with a dismally low yearly vaccination rate, which recently reaches just about 3.5% of the general population in Poland.

M3  - Article
AB  - Informed by an understanding that the quest for autonomy can serve as a compass of Brazil's foreign policy, this paper undertakes an extensive interpretative analysis of the concept in relation to the agency/structure debate. Our aim is to use these theoretical tools to analyse Brazil's international action during the 21st century, paying special attention to Bolsonaro's administration. This article argues that we are witnessing a dual break in autonomy: an essentially structural break related to the underlying trends currently redesigning the international world as we know it, and another more agential break, resulting from president Bolsonaro's particular worldview.

TI  - Satellite Derived Shorelines at an Exposed Meso-tidal Beach
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline position data offer extremely valuable information for understanding coastal dynamism and beach changes. This research applies SHOREX system for defining the shoreline position from free mid-resolution Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite imagery. This system allows an automatic definition of Satellite Derived Shorelines (SDS) over large regions and periods. Accuracy and utility of the resulting SDS have been previously assessed with positive results at low energy, microtidal, Mediterranean beaches. This work assesses SDS extracted using SHOREX at a mesotidal and moderate to highly (during storms) energetic environment, namely at Faro Beach, a barrier beach located in Ria Formosa (Algarve, South Portugal). Accuracy was defined for 14 SDS derived from S2 and 10 from L8 by measuring the differences in position with respect to the shoreline inferred from profiles obtained on close dates (or simultaneously) to imagery acquisition. For non-simultaneous datasets, the water level was estimated for the time of the satellite images acquisition using oceanographic data and run-up formulations. The measured and estimated shoreline positions were then compared with the extracted SDS. The overall accuracy is good, with errors about 5 m RMSE, supporting the application of the used methodology to define shoreline dynamics and evolution at challenging environments, as mesotidal exposed and dynamic beaches.

TI  - MORPHOMETRIC INDICATORS AS SUPPORT FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF GULLIES IN HYDROGRAPHIC SUB-BASINS IN THE CACEQUI MUNICIPALITY, RS
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The morphometric indicators directly extracted from erosive incisions are essential for the classification of different forms of gullies, especially in areas that have an environmental fragility linked to erosive and tectonic processes, such as the case of sub-basins located in the central sector of the municipality of Cacequi, southwest of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. In order to classify the gullies regarding their form, statistical analyses were performed to define the morphometric indexes to be used, such as structural lineaments, area measurements, perimeter, length, width, volume, depth and Circulation Index of each incision. For the extraction of these indexes, WorldView-2 satellite images with 0.5m resolution and the Digital Elevation Model of the AlosPalsar platform were used, with a resolution of 0.5 meter, using the Geographic Information Systems for data processing, which made it possible to organize a large database containing all the information. All this process favored the analysis, giving satisfactory support to the understanding of the behavior of erosive features, relief and lithology in the regional context, thus evidencing the main forms of gullies: Linear, Bulbiform, Branched, Mixed Irregular, Rectangular and Irregular Rectangular. The gullies were grouped into three sets due to the similarity of the morphometric data: in the first are the Linear and Bulbiform forms, with smaller values of area, depth and volume; in the second, the Branched and Irregular Mixed forms that have the largest areas, perimeters, altimetric amplitudes and depths. In the third set are the Rectangular and Irregular Rectangular forms with intermediate values of these indexes. Based on morphometric indexes, fieldwork and gully form, it was possible to suggest a scenario of evolution of the erosion process for the study area. The gullying process supposedly starts by the Linear form, until it reaches the Rectangular form, considered the most advanced stage. The Mixed Irregular form could result from the evolution of a Linear or Bulbiform and evolve into a Rectangular Irregular with increasing Circularity Index. The Rectangular form, considered stabilized, could reactivate and evolve into Irregular Rectangular and Mixed Irregular forms.

AB  - Developing countries, like Indonesia, encounter difficulties in agriculture development due to the decrease in available dry lands. They are left with no choice other than to make use of problematic soils for wetland agricultural activities. South Kalimantan is one of such areas in Indonesia with a large region of swamplands and has a history of utilizing wetlands for agricultural purposes. There is an urgent need for the evaluation and quantification of the base map for wetland development. Remote sensing data have been applied to the study of wetland in many countries because it is economical compared to the conventional mapping technique. Currently many satellite datasets, both optic and microwave ranges, are available for public use. The objective of this study is to map the wetland and swampland that are suitable for agriculture activities in South Kalimantan using remote sensing data. In particular we used the SRTM and ALOS PALSAR images which are radar data that can detect elevation and wet areas. This research first used DEM SRTM 30 m to obtain the baseline of wetlands or alluvium areas. Afterwards, ALOS PALSAR Mosaic data was used in combination with the random forest method to estimate areas suitable for agriculture. Results showed that the baseline area of wetlands in South Kalimantan is 999,768 ha. Swamplands suitable for agriculture are about 669,185 ha or 67% of the wetland. This method can be readily applied to other areas in the tropical regions as a cost-efficient method for wetland mapping.

TI  - Estimating the Urban Fractional Vegetation Cover Using an Object-Based Mixture Analysis Method and Sentinel-2 MSI Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and efficient identification of the urban vegetation abundance is of great importance for urban planning and management. A lot of efforts have been made to estimate the urban fractional vegetation cover (FVC) using multispectral images by the pixel-based mixture analysis method. However, urban FVC maps comprising various meaningful landscapes have wider applications. Compared with other moderate spatial resolution multispectral imagery (e.g., SPOT, Landsat 8), the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) imagery has higher resolution, larger coverage, and shorter revisit time. So it may provide higher accuracy for urban FVC mapping. This article derives an accurate object-based urban FVC map for Changsha city, China, from the 10-m resolution Sentinel-2 data acquired in 2017. For producing the urban FVC maps, the mixture analysis methods were applied on segmental image objects instead of pixels. The results demonstrate that the object-based mixture analysis method achieved a higher FVC estimation accuracy than the pixel-based mixture analysis did, and it effectively removed the "salt and pepper" phenomena. The object-based linear model fully constrained least squares and achieved the best estimation accuracy (R-2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.0956). The red-edge band reflectance information of the MSI imagery can improve the accuracy of the FVC maps, but not significantly. The object-based urban FVC maps would be a good alternative to the traditional pixel-based maps.

TI  - Hybrid Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Algorithm for Assessing Trophic States of a Tropical Brazilian Reservoir Based on MSI/Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remote sensing for monitoring trophic states of inland waters relies on the calibration of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) bio-optical algorithms. One of the main limiting factors of calibrating those algorithms is that they cannot accurately cope with the wide chl-a concentration ranges in optically complex waters subject to different trophic states. Thus, this study proposes an optical hybrid chl-a algorithm (OHA), which is a combined framework of algorithms for specific chl-a concentration ranges. The study area is Ibitinga Reservoir characterized by high spatiotemporal variability of chl-a concentrations (3-1000 mg/m(3)). We took the following steps to address this issue: (1) we defined optical classes of specific chl-a concentration ranges using Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM); (2) we calibrated/validated chl-a bio-optical algorithms for each trophic class using simulated Sentinel-2 MSI (Multispectral Instrument) bands; (3) and we applied a decision tree classifier in MSI/Sentinel-2 image to detect the optical classes and to switch to the suitable algorithm for the given class. The results showed that three optical classes represent different ranges of chl-a concentration: class 1 varies 2.89-22.83 mg/m(3), class 2 varies 19.51-87.63 mg/m(3), and class 3 varies 75.89-938.97 mg/m(3). The best algorithms for trophic classes 1, 2, and 3 are the 3-band (R-2 = 0.78; MAPE - Mean Absolute Percentage Error = 34.36%), slope (R-2 = 0.93; MAPE = 23.35%), and 2-band (R-2 = 0.98; MAPE = 20.12%), respectively. The decision tree classifier showed an accuracy of 95% for detecting SAM's optical trophic classes. The overall performance of OHA was satisfactory (R-2 = 0.98; MAPE = 26.33%) using in situ data but reduced in the Sentinel-2 image (R-2 = 0.42; MAPE = 28.32%) due to the temporal gap between matchups and the variability in reservoir hydrodynamics. In summary, OHA proved to be a viable method for estimating chl-a concentration in Ibitinga Reservoir and the extension of this framework allowed a more precise chl-a estimate in eutrophic inland waters.

TI  - Surgical Trends in Breast Cancer in Turkey: An Increase in Breast-Conserving Surgery
T2  - JCO GLOBAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSEBreast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women, and there is a great variability in surgical practice for treating that cancer in different countries. The aims of this study were to analyze the effect of guidelines from the Turkish Federation of Breast Diseases Societies on academic institutions that have breast centers and to evaluate surgical practice in Turkey in 2018.PATIENTS AND METHODSBetween January and March 2019, a survey was sent to breast surgeons who were working in breast centers in academic institutions. The sampling frame included 24 academic institutions with breast centers in 18 cities in Turkey to evaluate interdisciplinary differences among breast centers and seven regions in Turkey regarding patients' choices, surgical approaches, and academic institutions.RESULTSAll surgeons responded to the survey, and all 4,381 patients were included. Most of the surgeons (73.9%) were working in a breast center. Multidisciplinary tumor boards were performed in 87% of the breast centers. The average time between clinical evaluation and initiation of treatment was 29 days; the longest time was in Southeast Anatolia (66 days). Only 6% of patients had ductal carcinoma in situ. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was available in every region across the country and was performed in 64.5% of the patients. In 2018, the overall breast-conserving surgery rate was 57.3% in Turkey, and it varied from 72.2% in the Black Sea region to 33.5% in Central Anatolia (P < .001). Oncoplastic breast surgery options were available at all breast centers. However, 25% of the breast centers from the Black Sea region and half the breast centers from Eastern Anatolia and the Mediterranean region did not perform this type of surgery.CONCLUSIONIncreasing rates of nonpalpable breast cancer and decreasing rates of locoregional recurrences favored breast-conserving surgery, especially in developed countries. Guidelines from the Turkish Federation of Breast Diseases Societies resulted in more comprehensive breast centers and improved breast health in Turkey.

TI  - UNSUPERVISED METHODOLOGY TO IN-SEASON MAPPING OF SUMMER CROPS IN URUGUAY WITH MODIS EVI'S TEMPORAL SERIES AND MACHINE LEARNING

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - This paper resents a new methodology for mapping summer crops in Uruguay, during the season, based on time -series analysis of the EVI vegetation index derived from the MODIS sensor. Time-series were processed with the k-means unsupervised machine learning algorithm. For this algorithm, the ideal number of clusters was estimated using the elbow method. Once the clusters were obtained, for each one, the average phenological signature was adjusted using a nonlinear smoothing spline regression technique. Additionally, using the derivative analysis, the key points of the curve were estimated (minimum, maximum and inflection points). When analyzing the average signature of each cluster, those whose signature follows the seasonal pattern of an agricultural crop (similar to a Gaussian function) were selected to generate a binary map of crops/non-crops. The estimated crop area is 2,336,525 hectares, higher than the official statistics of 1,667,400 hectares for the 2014-15 season. This overestimation can be explained by the resolution of the MODIS pixel (250 meters), where each has a different degree of purity; and commission errors. The methodology was validated with 5,317 ground truth points, with a general accuracy of 95.8%, kappa index of 85.6, production and user accuracy of 85.1% and 91.3% for crops/non-crops.

TI  - Comparison Between Larval Survey Index and Positive Ovitrap Index in the Evaluation of Populations of <i>Aedes</i> (<i>Stegomyia</i>) <i>aegypti</i> (Linnaeus, 1762) North of Parana, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSIGHTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) is one of the world's most widely distributed mosquitoes and is the vector of the dengue virus, one of the most important reemerging diseases. Besides dengue, A. aegypti can also transmit urban yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika virus, making it of great medical importance. Thus, it is of extreme importance to find reliable methods to evaluate the presence of A. aegypti in urban areas. In Brazil, rapid index surveys of Aedes aegypti by means of larval survey (LIRAa) is the official method to estimate the Breteau (BI) and property infestation (PII) indexes, which indicates how many infested containers with larvae of A. aegypti were found by the total number of properties surveyed and the proportion of houses infested, respectively. As the LIRAa requires access to private residences and trained personal to find breeding sites and do not reveal the mosquito's presence when in low density, it has not demonstrated efficacy in determining the presence of A. aegypti. To evaluate an alternative method, the LIRAa method was compared with an oviposition trap, made with hay infusion and a hardboard pallet, to evaluate the BI and the PII. The 2 methods were carried out simultaneously through 4 surveys, sampling 60 homes per survey. To evaluate the best configuration of ovitraps for surveillance of A. aegypti, the ovitraps were installed in intradomicile and peridomicile areas, with 1 to 5 traps per residence and with 1 to 3 pallets per trap, and these different configurations were compared using the positive ovitrap index (POI) and egg density index (EDI). The ovitraps showed greater sensitivity for detecting the presence of A. aegypti, with a BI of 72.5% and PII of 54.2%, whereas the LIRAa revealed only 2.1% for the BI and 1.3% for the PII. Therefore, the use of sentinel traps can provide information in a more rapid and precise manner. As there were no differences in the ovitraps distributions patterns, the ovitraps can be installed in the peridomicile area, with 2 traps per surveillance point and 1 pallet per trap, making their installation easier and more cost-efficient, facilitating the work of health agents in future surveillances complementing LIRAa's actions for efficient monitoring.

TI  - NATIONALIZING VIOLENCE IN A COLLAPSING EMPIRE: A VIEW FROM THE STEPPE
T2  - AB IMPERIO-STUDIES OF NEW IMPERIAL HISTORY AND NATIONALISM IN THE POST-SOVIET SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ian Campbell argues that the large-scale resettlement of peasants from Russia's European provinces to the Kazakh steppe as part of the Stolypin reforms was clearly a policy of settler colonialism and national Russification of the region. Its immediate result, however, was producing a socially and economically mixed society. This hybrid and dynamic arrangement was radically disrupted by genocidal violence unleashed by the imperial authorities against the Kazakhs, in response to the 1916 uprising in the steppe. The combination of the failed state with a readily available nationalizing worldview structured the indiscriminative application of force as intentionally genocidal, to the effect of differentiating the entangled Turgai society into clearly bound national compounds.

AB  - In the mid-seventeenth century, as the first full atlas of East Asia became available on the European book market, a dramatic shift took place in textual and visual representations of the Far East. The atlas, titled "Novus Atlas Sinensis" (1655), was the product of a cooperation between Joan Blaeu, who headed one of Europe's foremost commercial publishing houses, and Martino Martini, a prominent Jesuit missionary to China. This study shows how the Martini-Blaeu atlas thoroughly challenged the worldview of late Renaissance audiences by tracing and reconstructing a series of displacements that facilitated its production process.

AB  - Land use planning is central for a sustainable development processes and should be structured in harmony with geo-environmental constrains. In this study, land use change detection was determined in Denizli residential area between the years 1984 and 2018. In the analyses, Landsat-5TM and Landsat-8 OLI images were used for 1984 and 2018, respectively. The geometric, radiometric calibration and atmospheric corrections were applied to the satellite images in preprocessing stage. Land use change detection was performed using supervised classification -Spectral Angle Mapper- method. Accuracy of the classifications was evaluated by the kappa index, which was 0.80 for 1984 and 0.87 for 2018 image. According to the results, between 1984 and 2018 there was an increase of 155% and 96% in built up and forest areas, while 52% and 40% decrease were observed in agriculture and bare land, respectively. It was also determined that the majority of the settlement areas increased in regions close to active fault zones. Accordingly, the built up areas within the 500 m buffer zone to the active faults were increased by 240% from 1984 to 2018.

T2  - BULLETIN OF THE MINERAL RESEARCH AND EXPLORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A strong shaking with Mw 7.3 occurred on 12th November 2017 around the Sarpol-e Zahab town in the border area between Iran and Iraq. It has a number of foreshocks and aftershocks increasing the total deformation, cumulatively. In this study, we have investigated how earth surface deformed after such a strong earthquake and its scatters. Because, the deformation inspection are indispensable for the safety of citizens and infrastructures. The best way for monitoring of surface deformation in such a big event is the SAR technique. This system can work effectively during night and day under different weather conditions. The Interferometric SAR (InSAR) allows accurate measurements of surface deformation in mm resolution. There are several methods for the application of SAR techniques and one of them is Differential InSAR (DInSAR) indicating an uplift and subsidence around epicentral area precisely. We preferred to use it for sensitive vertical displacement in the target area. The seismological data from the observatory centers indicate that the recent earthquake sourced from the NW-SE trending, northeast dipping High Zagros Reverse Fault Zone. According to the results, epicentral area has been exposed a vertical displacement with 90 cm uplift and -41 cm subsidence in the northeastern and southwestern block of the fault, respectively.

AB  - Indonesia a megadiverse country which has the largest area of forest with the richest biodiversity in the world. Unfortunately, the forest-loss in this country is quite big, especially in Kalimantan and Sumatera. Therefore, a robust method for deforestation method has to be developed to monitor deforestation to minimize the forest-loss in this country. In this paper, we proposed a method for deforestation detection called Multitemporal Deforestation Detection (MDD). The basic idea of this method is to utilize the difference of reflectance values on the target image and original image. Band selection was used to select bands in developing the algorithm. To improve the accuracy of the results, NDVI and dNBR were combined to the algorithm. As a result, the MDD can detect deforestation from forest to heterogeneous land cover such as open land, land clearing for plantation, urban, road and small road, and burnt area accurately. The advantage of the MDD is that it does not interfere cloud and cloud shadow on the original image. As it is an automatic algorithm, it can support in detecting deforestation for a big dataset.

AB  - Zooplankton aggregation, hydrographic and remote sensing data were employed to relate the spatial dynamics of neustonic communities with chlorophyll a (Chi a) and suspended organic matter ( SOM) at a spatial mesoscale (10 to 1000 kin) in the southern Chilean fjords system along Magellan Strait, Chile (CIMAR 16: October/November 2010 and CIMAR 25; September/October 2019) in order to identify oceanographic process producing aggregation of neuston. Preliminary evidence of CIMAR 25 shows significant concentrations of Chl a and SOM around Dawson Island (DI), Magellan Strait. During CIMAR 16 important aggregation of specific neustonic taxa (copepodites of Microsetella rosea, larvae of the polychaete Polygordius sp and cyphonautes of the bryozoan Membranipora isabelleana) was observed around Dl, Magellan Strait. Satelital images in the area of CIMAR 16 provide evidence of important aggregation of chlorophyll a/SOM around Dl. CIMAR Cimar 25 showed that the Chl a and SOM aggregation around Di is recurrent and could to explain the high concentration of neuston around this island to spite of mesotrophic conditions. Remote sensing in this study area provides a tool to understanding oceanographic and topographic factors that potentially regulate the abundance and spatial distribution of surface zooplankton to spatial meso-scale along Magellan Strait.

TI  - Northern Dene Constellations as Worldview Projections with Case Studies from the Ahtna, Gwich'in, and Sahtuot'ine
T2  - ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The sky is routinely overlooked in Northern Dene ethnology as a meaningful domain of linguistic and cultural knowledge. However, a decade of comparative ethnological research in Alaska and Canada has shown that Dene stellar knowledge is largely tied to sacred and covert knowledge systems. In this paper, we describe an Ahtna, Gwich'in, and Sahtuot'me constellation identified as the incarnated spirit of an ancient Traveler-Transformer figure who circled the world in Distant Time. Although this Traveler is widely known in mythology, his enigmatic transformation to the sky embodies a specialized domain of knowledge rooted in the traditional beliefs and practices of medicine people. This "Traveler" constellation is not only a world custodian and archetype of an idealized medicine person, but it is also a teacher, ally, gamekeeper, and the embodiment of the world. We identify variations of this constellation throughout the Northern Dene region.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series analysis of Sentinel-1 SAR imagery made available by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) is described. Advantage is taken of a recent modification of a sequential complex Wishart-based algorithm which is applicable to the dual polarization intensity data archived on the GEE. Both the algorithm and a software interface to the GEE Python API for convenient data exploration and analysis are presented; the latter can be run from a platform independent Docker container and the source code is available on GitHub. Application examples are given involving the monitoring of anthropogenic activity (shipping, uranium mining, deforestation) and disaster assessment (flash floods). These highlight the advantages of the good temporal resolution resulting from cloud cover independence, short revisit times and near real time data availability.

TI  - Uncertainty of Vegetation Green-Up Date Estimated from Vegetation Indices Due to Snowmelt at Northern Middle and High Latitudes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation green-up date (GUD), an important phenological characteristic, is usually estimated from time-series of satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data at regional and global scales. However, GUD estimates in seasonally snow-covered areas suffer from the effect of spring snowmelt on the NDVI signal, hampering our realistic understanding of phenological responses to climate change. Recently, two snow-free vegetation indices were developed for GUD detection: the normalized difference phenology index (NDPI) and normalized difference greenness index (NDGI). Both were found to improve GUD detection in the presence of spring snowmelt. However, these indices were tested at several field phenological camera sites and carbon flux sites, and a detailed evaluation on their performances at the large spatial scale is still lacking, which limits their applications globally. In this study, we employed NDVI, NDPI, and NDGI to estimate GUD at northern middle and high latitudes (north of 40 degrees N) and quantified the snowmelt-induced uncertainty of GUD estimations from the three vegetation indices (VIs) by considering the changes in VI values caused by snowmelt. Results showed that compared with NDVI, both NDPI and NDGI improve the accuracy of GUD estimation with smaller GUD uncertainty in the areas below 55 degrees N, but at higher latitudes (55 degrees N-70 degrees N), all three indices exhibit substantially larger GUD uncertainty. Furthermore, selecting which vegetation index to use for GUD estimation depends on vegetation types. All three indices performed much better for deciduous forests, and NDPI performed especially well (5.1 days for GUD uncertainty). In the arid and semi-arid grasslands, GUD estimations from NDGI are more reliable (i.e., smaller uncertainty) than NDP-based GUD (e.g., GUD uncertainty values for NDGI vs. NDPI are 4.3 d vs. 7.2 d in Mongolia grassland and 6.7 d vs. 9.8 d in Central Asia grassland), whereas in American prairie, NDPI performs slightly better than NDGI (GUD uncertainty for NDPI vs. NDGI is 3.8 d vs. 4.7 d). In central and western Europe, reliable GUD estimations from NDPI and NDGI were acquired only in those years without snowfall before green-up. This study provides important insights into the application of, and uncertainty in, snow-free vegetation indices for GUD estimation at large spatial scales, particularly in areas with seasonal snow cover.

TI  - Expansion of Urban Impervious Surfaces in Xining City Based on GEE and Landsat Time Series Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion is often studied in large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, while scant attention is paid to smaller cities such as Xining. However, Xining is the largest city on the Tibetan Plateau, and an important city in China's "Belt and Road Initiative". As its economy and society develops, Xining will play an increasingly important role in connecting the central and western regions. In order to quantify the impacts of rapid urbanization, it is extremely important to collect data on the time and space variations of impervious surfaces. As such, we collected Landsat long-term sequence data about Xining City from 1987-2019 using the random forest method, and then optimized the feature parameters to obtain the dataset. Our results demonstrated that the overall accuracy of land use classification in Xining city is 83.4% and that the urban impervious surface accuracy is 89.5%. Additionally, the overall accuracy improved by 2.4% after optimizing the characteristic parameters, while the urban impervious surface accuracy is 92.8%. In 27 of the 33 years we studied, the classification accuracy of impervious surfaces exceeded 90%. After correcting for the temporal consistency check, the accuracy of impervious surfaces improved by 2% compared to the original sequence. We analyzed the change of impervious surfaces in Xining based on the results of the final dataset and found that the impervious surface area of Xining increased from 55 km(2) in 1987 to 334 km(2) in 2019. Xining is a typical semi-open river valley city which shares spatial and temporal characteristics with other urban centers. The spatial and temporal characteristics of the expansion of urban spaces in the main urban area of Xining are obvious and are primarily spread around the central area toward tree branch shaped road, which help other cities located in river valleys better understand how urbanization progresses.

TI  - Vegetation Response to Urban Landscape Spatial Pattern Change in the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has destroyed and fragmented large amounts of natural habitats, resulting in serious consequences for urban ecosystems over past decades, especially in the rapidly urbanizing areas of developing countries. The Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration, which has experienced the fastest socioeconomic development in China, was selected as the study area. To explore the relationship between urbanization and vegetation dynamics at the agglomeration scale, the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban expansion and vegetation variation of the study area were evaluated by landscape spatial analysis, regression analysis, and trend analysis. The results show that the urbanization level of the study area exhibited a continuous upward trend, with Shanghai as the regional core city, and the level of urbanization gradually decreased from the center towards the periphery of the urban agglomeration. The overall urban expansion presented obvious landscape spatial heterogeneity characteristics and the emergence of new cities and towns enhanced landscape connectedness and created a more aggregated urban agglomeration. Noticeable spatiotemporal differences of vegetation variation were observed from 2004 to 2013. Areas with relatively low vegetation coverage showed a steady growth trend, while those with higher vegetation coverage reported a significant decreasing trend. The spatial heterogeneity analysis of the vegetation trend demonstrated that vegetation degradation was a dominant and inevitable process across the study area. However, some parts of the urban sprawl area, especially at the periphery of the metropolis, may experience a greening trend rather than a browning trend, indicating that urbanization does not necessarily lead to large-scale vegetation degradation. Although urbanization poses a negative impact on vegetation and physical environments, urbanization has not yet reduced a large area of vegetation at the regional level.

TI  - Vegetation phenology dynamics across ecoregions of Iberian Peninsula from MODIS NDVI times series: 2001-2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XXII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXII held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Vegetation phenology, the study of the timing of biological cycles of plants and their relation with environmental factors, is considered an important ecological indicator of climate change. Different ecological processes, such as water and carbon cycles, energy fluxes or species interactions, can be altered by changes in the phenological patterns of plants. Furthermore, these changes could also have important consequences on economy (e. g. agriculture, forestry). Iberian Peninsula is one of the regions with the greatest diversity of ecosystems in European continent. It is therefore an excellent natural laboratory for monitoring vegetation dynamics. The goal of this study was to monitor the vegetation phenology dynamics across ecoregions of the Iberian Peninsula for the period between 2001 and 2017. 782 8-day composites of NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) images were produced from the surface reflectance product MOD09Q1 at a spatial resolution of 250 meters. A Savitzky-Golay filter was applied to smooth the NDVI time series and a threshold-based method was used to extract three phenometrics: the start of the growing season (SOS), the end of growing season (EOS) and the length of the growing season (LOS). Results of this research showed how both SOS and EOS are significantly different between the northern and southern ecoregions. Cantabrian mixed forests and Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests presented the latest SOS and EOS. Iberian conifer forests, Northwest Iberian montane forests and Northeastern Spain and Southern France Mediterranean forests showed the highest internal variability in the phenological dates, which may be related with the behaviour of different land covers (e. g., phenology of natural vegetation vs. crop phenology) and the altitude effects on climatic conditions (e. g. increases in precipitation, decrease of the temperature). Phenological patterns of the Iberian ecoregions could contribute to improve the understanding of the potential environmental effects of climate change.

TI  - Soil Water Content Diachronic Mapping: An FFT Frequency Analysis of a Temperature-Vegetation Index
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the indirect estimation approaches of soil water content in the upper layer of the soil, the "triangle method" is one of the most common that relies on the simple relationship between the optical and thermal features sensed via Earth Observation. These features are controlled by water content at the surface and within the root zone but also by meteorological forcing including air temperature and humidity, as well as solar radiation. Night- and day-time MODIS composites of land-surface temperature (LST) allowed applying a version of the triangle method that takes into account the temporal admittance of the soil. In this study, it has been applied to a long time-series of pair images to analyze the seasonal influence of the meteorological forcing on a triangle method index (or temperature-vegetation index, TVX), as well as to discuss extra challenges of the diachronic approach including seasonality effects and the variability of environmental forcing. The Imera Meridionale basin (Sicily, Italy) has been chosen to analyze the method over a time-series of 12 years. The analysis reveals that, under these specific environmental and climatic conditions (strong seasonality and rainfall out of phase with vegetation growth), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LST pairs move circularly in time within the optical vs. thermal feature space. Concordantly, the boundaries of the triangle move during the seasons. Results showed a strong correlation between TVX and rainfall normalized amplitudes of the power spectra (r(2) 0.8) over the range of frequencies of the main harmonics.

TI  - Detection of spatio-temporal changes of vegetation in coastal areas subjected to soil erosion issue
T2  - AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal soil erosion can be recognized as the most alarming environmental issue since, causing shoreline retreat, reduces the area available for plant habitat survival, highly influencing their health status, and, consequently, limiting their ability in beach front properties protection. A deep knowledge of vegetation changes is required to identify the proper strategy to be adopted to face soil erosion problems in coastal areas. Therefore, the current paper is aimed to quantitatively examine the spatio-temporal changes suffered by the vegetation in the coastline of Siponto in Apulia Region (Southern Italy) covering a time period of about forty years. LANDSAT images from 1975, 2006, 2011 and 2018 were collected, atmospherically corrected and, finally, processed to generate binary classification maps of vegetation by applying the Composite Vegetation Index, a novel index based on the interpolation of Red, Green and Near-Infrared bands, suitable for catching both cellular and metabolic features of vegetation. Then, the generated binary classification maps were compared using the Vegetation Index Differencing technique, a post-classification change detection technique. The results showed an increase in vegetation extension cover and density overall the entire examined period. That phenomenon appeared more and more prominent between 1975 and 2006, where an increment of vegetated areas extension of about 88% were registered. Combining of the novel vegetation index, developed ad-hoc in the current research, and Vegetation Index Differencing approach shows promising results in vegetation classification and comparison over the time. Indeed, the method allows the fast vegetation extraction, great processing time saver. Nevertheless, spatial resolution of Landsat Images limits the classification of small and low-density vegetated areas. Therefore, future work should plan to test the proposed approach at a more detailed scale.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 20th International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) data includes most of the information suitable for tackling many environmental issues. Remote sensing is largely recognized as the most significant method to extract them through the application of various techniques. They can be extracted through the application of many techniques. Among the several classification approaches, the index-based method has been recognized as the best one to gather LU/LC information from different images sources. The present work is intended to assess its performance exploiting the great potentialities of Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-processing environment introduced by Google to storage and handle a large number of information. Twelve atmospherically corrected Landsat satellite images were collected on the experimental site of Siponto, in Southern Italy. Once the clouds masking procedure was completed, a large number of indices were implemented and compared in GEE platform to detect sparse and dense vegetation, water, bare soils and built-up areas. Among the tested algorithms, only NDBaI2, CVI, WI2015, SwiRed and STRed indices showed satisfying performance. Although NDBaI2 was able to extract all the main LU/LC categories with a high Overall Accuracy (OA) (82.59%), the other mentioned indices presented a higher accuracy than the first one but are able to identify just few classes. An interesting performance is shown by the STRed index since it has a very high OA and can extract mining areas, water and green zones. GEE appeared the best solution to manage the geospatial big data.

AB  - Timely and accurate maps of land cover changes are crucial for understanding the evolution of Earth's features and, consequently, the relationships between individual and collective needs. Therefore, this information is extremely important to develop future planning strategies and tackle environmental issues. This paper aims to exploit the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to examine land cover changes over a period of about fiftheen years in the pilot site of Siponto, an historical municipality in Puglia, Southern Italy. Six atmospherically corrected Landsat data, two for each selected mission (5, 7 and 8), were collected: the former was acquired in fall and the latter in spring. Land cover information was automatically extracted from each image through the implementation of an innovative Landsat Images Classifications algorithm (LICA) based on spectral indices analysis. Six classes (water, built-up, mining areas, bare soil, dense and sparse vegetation) were detected from each image, with an average overall accuracy higher than 85%. Land cover changes were assessed comparing classification maps of the same season, showing bare soil areas as the most altered ones, having been converted into arable lands in consideration of the adavantageous geomorphological features of the investigated site. This is also confirmed by the historical events experienced by the area.

AB  - To determine the biological and physical mechanisms between Lange glacier and its pro-glacier marine system located in Almirantazgo bay, King George Island, Antarctica, specific variables were determined through remote sensing approaches shown in this work. These preliminary results will allow relating the dynamics of both systems, the glacier, and the marine ecosystem. The information for the estimation of surface flux velocity of the glacier was derived through Radar satellite images (Sentinel-1) by means of offset tracking, the bathymetry was derived from a Multi-beam Echo Sounder, and the Digital Elevation Modell was obtained by means of a Remotely Piloted Aircraft; Finally, the biological parameters were derived from MODIS and OLCI images for the analysis of satellite data to have a first insight to the characteristics of the marine system. This information will help to build the first frame needed to study through remote sensing approaches, the mechanisms that govern the interface among "Lang Glacier" and the "Almirantazgo Bay" at King George Island, Antarctica.

Several image processing techniques were applied to satellite images for Li exploration in the region, including machine learning classifiers. However, these algorithms identified several zones as Li-pegmatites false positives. Taking this into account, the following objectives were delineated: (i) validate the training areas used in previous studies and collect field data for training area refinement; (ii) assess the reason for the false positives previously obtained through field surveys. For that, various outcropping lithologies (Li-pegmatite, metasediments, granite) were sampled for laboratory spectral analysis. The spectral signature of Li-pegmatite was compared with the remaining outcropping lithologies. Also, the spectral signature of the sampled false positive areas was confronted with the spectra of Li-minerals. It was possible to conclude that these two classes present similar water/hydroxide and Al-OH-related features. The sampled granitic and metasedimentary rocks also presented water and/or hydroxide absorption features that can lead to some spectral confusion. However, Li- pegmatites can be discriminated from the remaining lithologies either in the training areas and the false positive areas due to the absence of iron-related absorption features and to the distinct reflectance magnitudes.

AB  - Satellite-based mineral exploration will be increasingly relevant in the future to achieve more conscious exploration models. Therefore, new applications to high-demand mineral commodities such as lithium (Li) are emerging. Previous applications to the study area of Fregeneda (Spain) - Almendra (Portugal) showed a high number of false positives despite their ability to identify Li pegmatites. So, the objective of the present work is to improve the classification results using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). For that, the same Sentinel-2A images were used and a three-layer feedforward network was computed using the backpropagation method. The ANN created was able to identify all the open-pit mines exploiting Li pegmatites in the area. However, the high number of Li false positives persisted. Future applications may include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve these results.

AB  - Raw-materials like lithium (Li) are crucial to the current global decarbonization, but Li-exploration presents some technical challenges. Therefore, new solutions for Li-exploration are needed. Consequently, the aim of this study is to present a unique multi-scale remote sensing approach for Li-pegmatite exploration integrated within the LIGHTS project, considering as study area the Bajoca mine (Portugal). Satellite data allowed the identification of the spectral signatures of Li-pegmatites at a district scale, while drone-borne hyperspectral measurements provided data at the target scale. Handheld spectroscopy and in situ hyperspectral scans of the mine walls were carried out to validate the satellite and drone data. Hyperspectral field and laboratory scans also aim to collect information at the mineral scale, to distinguish different lithological materials, and to identify the Li-rich areas. In the future, machine learning algorithms will deliver an automated integration of all acquired data.

TI  - Identifying urban vegetation stress factors based on open access remote sensing imagery and field observations
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Healthy vegetation in cities provides ecosystem services, which contribute to the overall well-being of urban populations, especially in times of climate change and increasing urbanization. More specifically, vegetation monitoring is needed in the context of intensifying and mitigating factors of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Therefore, fast and low-cost, but reliable approaches are needed for monitoring the status of urban greening. A satellite-based monitoring scheme based on freely available data could ensure the provision of key urban ecosystem services, and guide both policy maker and practitioners. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of urbanization and urban green management on vegetation status of park trees during summer season in Bucharest, the capital city of Romania, using remote sensing. This city is known to be affected by air pollution and the UHI effect. Further, it is an example of a city with limited green spaces compared to other European cities. Hence, spatial data on vegetation status and potential impacts as a basis for management schemes are required to maintain a healthy urban green infrastructure. Vegetation indices related to chlorophyll, senescence, greenness and water stress were calculated from Sentinel-2 imagery as response variables to vegetation stress. Vegetation status was then predicted for each park using spatial environment factors (e.g. presence of irrigation systems) in a mixed model approach to account for heterogeneity among parks. The most important predictors of vegetation stress were irrigation systems, land surface temperature, distance to a lake and proximity to roads. However, the effect of these predictors on the vegetation status differed among parks. Therefore, a mixed effect model approach is suggested to quantify the effects of urbanization on green spaces in cities, and there is a high potential to use freely available satellite data for a spaceborne-monitoring service of urban green infrastructure.

AB  - Chlorophyll is the basic pigment for photosynthesis. Vegetation senescence can be accelerated if this process is hampered by external factors. Remote sensing tools contribute to vegetation stress detection. Previous studies correlated chlorophyll values with vegetation indices and red-edge shoulder position. This paper explored the applicability of multi- and hyperspectral satellite images and in-situ spectrometry data for identifying healthy and stressed vegetation in four parks within Bucharest, the capital city of Romania. It integrated data from Sentinel-2 MSI, EO-1 Hyperion and STS-VIS spectrometer from Ocean Optics. Overview of vegetation health is delivered by spaceborne sensors, using vegetation index values. MTVI indicates that vegetation in Unirii Park is the most affected, whilst Herastrau Park and Tei Park are better managed. Furthermore, red-edge position analysis using leaf reflectance of three species (ash tree, linden tree, pine) confirmed the findings from satellite images. All analysed species Unirii Park and Pacii Park showed signs of high stress, resulting in a red shift of the red-edge position. Ash tree in Herastrau Park is rather healthy. All species in Tei Park seemed to record a normal senescence rhythm.

AB  - Since 2018, the Terrestrial Hydrology Experiment in Mexico (THExMEX-18) is being part of SMAP algorithm validation through soil moisture (SM), crop measurements, and biomass samples that were collected over a rainfed agricultural region of Huamantla, Tlaxcala. As a second part of this experiment, THExMEX-19 was carried out in whole crop season from March to December 2019.In order to help to validate to SMAP algorithm applying NASA's protocols, both joint efforts of National Polytechnic Institute and Center for Remote Sensing of the University of Florida have obtained these results in 2018 and 2019. In-Situ soil moisture measurements are compared with the enhanced soil moisture SMAP level 2 passive observation (SMAP L2_SM_P & SMAP L2_SM_P_E) and soil moisture SMAP level 2 and Sentinel-1 passive observation (SMAP L2 SM SP). SMAP mission meets the requirement of SM retrievals with an unbiased root-mean-square difference (ubRMSD) < 0.04 (m(3) m(-3)) compared to in-situ measurements over agricultural fields. The L-band passive SM retrievals and in-situ measurements were evaluated in terms of four statistical metrics: root-mean-square difference (RMSD), bias, ubRMSD, and correlation coefficient (r).

AB  - The study area was surrounding Corrego do Feijao Mine, located in the city of Brumadinho/MG, Brazil. From this proposal, we present the analysis of the effect of disruption of one of the tailings dams of the Corrego do Feijao Mine, which took place in January 2019, under the responsibility of Vale S.A. The rupture culminated in mud flow. A study and characterization of the area was made, to understand the flow of the waters, and consequently, the mud. In addition, it was possible to obtain information on the land use of the area before and after the break using remote sensing (Sentinel-2A) supervised image classification. Through a spatial and temporal analysis, it was estimated that the mud reached a total of 2.48 km(2), being the class of robust vegetation the most affected by the disaster in numerical terms. The typology of anthropic areas, despite being the smallest area hit by mud, was the one that suffered the greatest impact. The importance of an analysis of the elements that belong in the area of study and how they behave, in order to avoid and mitigate situations of vulnerability is considered very important. Finally, it is emphasized the relevance of a spatial planning studies that considers the integrated planning between the juxtaposition of human activities, social and spatial relations and their various impacts on the landscape.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy for robotic-assisted endometrial cancer staging: further improvement of perioperative outcomes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives It is unclear if sentinel lymph node biopsy is associated with improved surgical outcomes compared with lymphadenectomy in patients with endometrial cancer. In this study we aimed to compare peri-operative surgical outcomes and treatment-related morbidity in patients who underwent robotic-assisted sentinel lymph node biopsy versus systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy or hysterectomy alone for apparent early-stage endometrial cancer. Methods Records were reviewed of consecutive patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages I-III endometrial cancer undergoing robotic-assisted staging from January 1, 2009, through June 30, 2016. For the purpose of this analysis we focused on the actual patients who had sentinel node biopsy only (ie, excluding those who had an associated lymphadenectomy either for failed mapping or during the learning curve). We also excluded patients who had para-aortic lymph node dissection from the lymphadenectomy group. Perioperative and 30-day surgical outcomes were compared between patients who underwent sentinel lymph node assessment and those who had pelvic lymphadenectomy or hysterectomy alone, respectively. Inverse probability of treatment weighting derived from propensity scores was used to minimize allocation bias in the comparison of outcomes between groups. Results A total of 621 patients were analyzed: 188 (30.3%) with sentinel lymph node biopsy, 198 (31.9%) with pelvic lymphadenectomy, and 235 (37.8%) with hysterectomy alone. Inverse probability of treatment weights analysis balanced for baseline characteristics (age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, Charlson co-morbidity index, parity, prior cesarean section, and previous abdominal operation) showed no significant differences in intra-operative and post-operative complications, re-admissions, and re-operations between the groups. Compared with pelvic lymphadenectomy, the sentinel lymph node biopsy group had a shorter mean operative time (138.0 vs 222.8 min, p<0.001) and less median blood loss (50 vs 100 mL, p<0.001). Sentinel lymph node biopsy also was not associated with worse morbidity compared with hysterectomy alone. Conclusions Introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy reduces operative times and improves peri-operative surgical outcomes of robotic-assisted staging for apparent early-stage endometrial cancer without worsening the morbidity of hysterectomy alone.

AB  - The Hepatitis C Virus is the main cause of chronic liver diseases. The acute stage of infection is usually asymptomatic, and persistence in most of the infected individuals leads to chronic hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, and, finally, hepatocellular carcinoma. In order to avoid the chronic or advanced stages of this disease, when HCV is detected, cells activate the immune response mediated by interferon. Interferon is released by the infected hepatocytes and surrounding sentinel cells. Interferon activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and stimulates several ISG genes. Recently, it has been reported that only seven of them show a significant anti-HCV response. The aim of this study was to investigate, from a mathematical-modeling point of view, whether ISG over-expression leads the system to an irreversible clearance state. A mathematical model for the molecular machinery involved in cells infected with hepatitis C and the immune response was used to reproduce viral dynamics. The model considers seven ISG proteins. Our results suggest that the ISG proteins play an essential role in the hepatitis dynamics, and there is a possibility of produce the clearance state. Their robustness is evaluated.

AB  - Aortoesophageal fistulas are uncommon, dreadful vascular events, most frequently found in the setting of thoracic aorta aneurysms. Patients usually present with thoracic pain, dysphagia and sentinel hematemesis - the Chiari triad - followed by life threatening hematemesis. Emergent open surgery with debridement of necrotic tissue and in situ aortic graft repair is currently the best strategy. However, in patients which cannot withstand surgery, endovascular repair is currently gaining acceptance as a palliative treatment or as a bridge to surgery. We present a case of a 55-year-old female with a past of heavy alcohol abuse and a previously unknown massive aortic aneurysm, who presented to the emergency department complai- ning of acute dysphagia and epigastric pain. An abdominal ultrasound revealed left pleural effusion and suspected clots in the pleural space. A thoracic CTA was promptly done, where a spontaneous ruptured aortic aneurysm with aortoesophageal fistula was discovered. The team, fearing open surgery due to poor cardiac function, opted for a thoracic endovascular aortic repair. The aortoesophageal fistula dissected the esophageal wall in all of its thickness without rupture into the lumen. This was complicated with esophageal ischemia, aneurysmal sac infection and mediastinitis. Because the patient was in shock, in order to help control the infection, an esophageal prosthesis was placed, followed by proximal esophagostomy, distal esophageal closure and gastrostomy. Six months after initial presentation, the patient died at the emergency room, shortly after reentering with massive hematemesis and hypovolemic shock of undetermined origin.

AB  - High-Andean wetlands from northern Chile are considered worldwide biodiverrsity hot spots, however, they are subdued to high anthropic pressure. The monitoring of state variables, such as vegetation, allows to know the ecosystem's global condition, which could he assessed by the analysis of spectral vegetation indices. The main goal of this paper was to detect changes in the high Andean wetland vegetation, with remote sensing tools, to focalize surveillance efforts and the use of resources from environmental agencies. NDVI time series were constructed spanning from 1986 to 2019 based on Landsat data, which were analyzed based on the vegetation change detection using BFAST Monitor method. Detected changes were categorized to highlight certain types of changes that were considered more relevant. Wetlands were separated in two rankings (A and B) based on detected changes and territorial context. From 5,622 wetlands, 81 were categorized into group A and 510 into group B. One affected wetland was used as study case to assess the method's efficiency, being able to detect changes and assign a relative importance to the case. It is shown that the proposed method has the capacity to detect vegetation degradation processes in high-Andean wetlands and could improve in the efficiency and effectiveness of the environmental agencies control labors over these ecosystems.

AB  - The Rio de la Plata estuary has low diversity and abundance of zoobenthos due to its high turbidity and environmental variability. To determine the influence of sediment dredging on the composition, abundance and size of macroinvertebrates, we studied a beach in the north coast of the estuary, where a trench and a pipe were built underwater. The water variables and the sediment grain size did not differ between before and during dredging. Erodona mactroides was the dominant species, followed by the aliens Corbicula fluminea and Limnoperna fortunei and by the native Nephtys fluviatilis. The density of E. mactroides was higher and the height of the shell was lower before than during dredging. Invaders increased during dredging, when N. fluviatilis decreased substantially. Dredging can affect the benthos and the entire coastal ecosystem through the contribution of thicker sediments and E. mactroides can be a sentinel species of the coastal environment.

TI  - Insar Maps of Land Subsidence and Sea Level Scenarios to Quantify the Flood Inundation Risk in Coastal Cities: The Case of Singapore
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global mean sea level rise associated with global warming has a major impact on coastal areas and represents one of the significant natural hazards. The Asia-Pacific region, which has the highest concentration of human population in the world, represents one of the larger areas on Earth being threatened by the rise of sea level. Recent studies indicate a global sea level of 3.2 mm/yr as measured from 20 years of satellite altimetry. The combined effect of sea level rise and local land subsidence, can be overwhelming for coastal areas. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry technique is used to process a time series of TerraSAR-X images and estimate the land subsidence in the urban area of Singapore. Interferometric SAR (InSAR) measurements are merged to the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 sea-level rise scenarios to identify projected inundated areas and provide a map of flood vulnerability. Subsiding rates larger than 5 mm/year are found near the shore on the low flat land, associated to areas recently reclaimed or built. The projected flooded map of Singapore are provided for different sea-level rise scenarios. In this study, we show that local land subsidence can increase the flood vulnerability caused by sea level rise by 2100 projections. This can represent an increase of 25% in the flood area in the central area of Singapore for the RCP4.5 scenario.

AB  - This text aims to point out the focus of local and international regulation on traditional knowledge, which focuses mainly on knowledge associated with biological resources, leaving aside those that do not fall into this category. This poses a challenge for the holders of such knowledge, and the intellectual property system, a challenge regarding building a particular and sufficient system that legally shields such intangibles and their holders. To this end, the current state of the art (normative, conceptual and jurisprudential) will be presented, and then we will observe some protection systems over these intangibles, the Colombian experience, the difficulties derived from the diverse worldview of the holders of this knowledge versus regulation in force, ending with what we believe should contain a particular regulatory system for this knowledge.

CL  - Santiago, CHILE
AB  - Black Carbon (BC) is indicated as the main atmospheric pollutant that obscures snow surfaces and absorbs solar energy, which accelerates the melting of ice/snow and produces glacier retreat. The case of Chile is of particular interest because it has most part of the Andean cryosphere, which has responded strongly to climate change through a retreat of their glaciers, having implications in the availability of freshwater for the inhabitants and economic activities. In this work, the aim was to investigate and quantify for the first time the impact that BC could have on the differences observed in the glacial retreat in the study area, decoupling this impact of the climatic and glaciological factors, through which it has not been possible to explain the difference in glacier behavior in the zone. In this case, two glaciers with comparable characteristics from the Central Andes of Chile were studied: Olivares Alpha Glacier (OAG) and Bello Glacier (BG). The spatio-temporal evolution (2004-2014) was studied using remote sensing images (Landsat). This information was analyzed together with measured data of BC concentrations in air and snow for the year 2014. Results showed important differences in glacier retreat, -27.6% for OAG vs. -5.1% for BG (2004-2014), together with a significantly higher impact of BC in OAG than BG. Regarding the sources of the measured BC, considering that both glaciers are at a similar distance from Santiago, it can he considered that there is another source influencing OAG, which could he the mountain mining activities, considering the small distance existing between this glacier and the mines.

TI  - Towards Early Warning for Damages to Cultural Heritage Sites: The Case of Palmyra
T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR ARCHAEOLOGY AND CULTURAL LANDSCAPES: BEST PRACTICES AND PERSPECTIVES ACROSS EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The intentional damage to local cultural heritage sites carried out in recent months by the Islamic State has received wide coverage from the media worldwide, raising the awareness for the need of prompt, safe, non-invasive damage detection and assessment surveys. Earth observation data represents the only reliable, non-invasive information source in areas which are not accessible due to conflicts or natural disasters. In order to provide a fast response, automated image processing techniques are needed to speed up the analysis. This chapter shows a comprehensive case of study for damage detection and monitoring in time through a series of satellite images acquired over the city of Palmyra, Syria, which suffered huge losses related to its cultural heritage in a time span longer than a year. Maps highlighting potential damages are derived from robust change detection techniques, based on changes in the textural features characterizing pre-and post-disaster satellite data. Such information could help experts at timely assessing the damages to cultural heritage sites of interest, and a chronological study of the different damages can be produced if a satellite image time series is available on the site of interest. Furthermore, the idea of marking sensitive areas characterized by different criticality is introduced: early damage detection routines could thus be restricted to the most important or threatened sites or expanded to larger areas or surrounding urbanizations. For this purpose, a pair of images acquired on the city of Sirwah, Yemen, are analysed, and the change detection results are discussed in this frame.

AB  - In this manuscript, we discuss the importance of using accurate weather forecasts based on remote sensing observations for improving the accuracy of electric distribution grid power outage prediction. Weather variable accuracy is critical to limit the significant power outage modeling errors arising from the strong non-linearities in the relationships between hydrometeorological variables and power outages. We consolidate recent findings related to the most important variables for outage prediction, and to the propagation of their uncertainties in the University of Connecticut Outage Prediction Model (UConn-OPM). UConn-OPM is an operational machine learning-based framework predicting power outage in electric distribution networks. Combining remote sensing datasets with weather analysis used for OPM training, and post-storm verification, would directly contribute to improving the OPM prediction accuracy.

AB  - This paper examines the current state of the field wherein theoretical issues of ecology are still in need of concentration. Ecological texts are reconsidered from a religious worldview by extracting eco-friendly notions within religion and discourse is also essential in the practical field. As a case study on this matter, this paper aims to describe various aspects of ecological theory in Daesoon Jinrihoe, a new religious movement in Korea.In short, in its view of the natural world, Daesoon Jinrihoe values that all things originated from the Supreme God who presides over them, and the two are organically interrelated. Hence, the principle of nature is cherished. Especially as the Later World draws near, the fundamental basis of nature is slated to undergo change, and this also features heavily in Daesoon Jinrihoe’s view of the natural world. Furthermore, the Supreme God reforms nature, and human beings live lives in conformity and resonance with that reformed nature. Above all else, the doctrines of haewon sangsaeng (the resolution of grievances for mutual beneficence) and boeun sangsaeng (the reciprocation of favors for mutual beneficence) are advocated in Daesoon Jinrihoe. Each supports its own form of ecological discourse, and together, they can be called Sangsaeng Ecological Theory (the Ecological Theory of Mutual Beneficence). Specific discussions of Daesoon Jinrihoe and ecology should be considered in light of this finding.

AB  - Multi-temporal techniques of differential interferometry are providing accurate performance in many thematic applications of soil displacements monitoring. In this context, the analysis of the soil movements that happen after flooding events is crucial for the natural hazard management task. In this paper, we are considering the parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS) technique using Sentinel-1 dataset in order to produce a multi-temporal study of the soil displacement that happened in 2018 after flooding in Tunisia. Moreover, we are performing a qualitative comparison between the generated mean velocity map of the displacement and the lithofacies map that describes the geomorphological characteristics of the soil in the study area. The achieved results of two test sites in the north of Tunisia show an effective connection between the mapped areas of displacement using P-SBAS and the regions that are declared by the ground-truth map as prone to post-flood movement.

AB  - Preliminary steps of mineral exploration have always included drilling and other destructive and expensive exploration techniques to quantify ore-deposits underground. This study examines how we can access information on the sub-surface geology by looking at the surface vegetation. We have targeted gold-mineralization along the Hyde-Macraes Shear Zone as a development site, which is located in the Otago Schist belt in southern New Zealand. Deep rooted plants, of the Pinus radiata species, were sampled on the field to quantify the element concentrations focusing on the pathfinder elements such as As and Fe in the host rock, in conjunction with airborne and laboratory based hyperspectral remote sensing data. In order to predict the elemental concentration from hyperspectral data Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) was executed.

T2  - HYBRID MACHINE INTELLIGENCE FOR MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Segmentation is considered as one of the challenging and important processes in the field of digital image processing, and there are numerous applications likemedical image analysis and satellite data processing where the digital image processing can beneficial. Various algorithms have been developed by many researchers to analyze different medical images like MRI and X-rays. Nuclear image analysis and interpretation also a promising research topic in medical image analysis. For example, positron emission tomography (PET) image can be used to accurately localize disease to help doctors in providing the right treatment and saving valuable time. In recent years, there is a significant advancement in the biomedical imaging domain with the increasing accessibility of computational power as well as automated systems; medical image analysis has become one of the most interesting research areas. Microscopic image analysis is also valuable in the domain ofmedical imaging as well as medicine. For example, different cell determination, identification, and counting are an important and almost unavoidable step that assists to diagnose some precise diseases. Many computer vision and digital image analysis instances require a basic segmentation phase to find different objects or separate the test image into distinct segments, which can be treated homogeneous depending upon a given property, such as color and texture. Region growing and fuzzy C-Means are two efficient and popular segmentation techniques. In this chapter, we have proposed a hybrid scheme for image segmentation using fuzzy C-Means clustering, region growing method, and thresholding. The fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering is used as a preprocessing step. It helps to process the image more accurately in further stages. To eliminate the noise sensitivity property of fuzzy C-Means (FCM), we have used the PFCM, i.e., penalized FCM clustering algorithm. In this work, to find the appropriate region, we have used the region growing segmentation technique coupled with the thresholding. In the proposed work, a similarity feature depending on pixel intensity is used. The threshold value can be calculated using different techniques, such as iterative approach, Otsu's technique, local thresholding, and manual selection, to determine the optimal threshold. The results are obtained and derived by applying the proposed method on different images obtained from publicly available benchmark datasets of human brain MRI images. Experimental results indicated that the PFCM supported hybrid model is far more superior in segmenting medical images than traditional image segmentation methods.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Mangroves and Estuarine Communities in Central Queensland, Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Great Barrier Reef catchments are under pressure from the effects of climate change, landscape modifications, and hydrology alterations. With the use of remote sensing datasets covering large areas, conventional methods of change detection can expose broad transitions, whereas workflows that excerpt data for time-series trends divulge more subtle transformations of land cover modification. Here, we combine both these approaches to investigate change and trends in a large estuarine region of Central Queensland, Australia, that encompasses a national park and is adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage site. Nine information classes were compiled in a maximum likelihood post classification change analysis in 2004-2017. Mangroves decreased (1146 hectares), as was the case with estuarine wetland (1495 hectares), and saltmarsh grass (1546 hectares). The overall classification accuracies and Kappa coefficient for 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2015, and 2017 land cover maps were 85%, 88%, 88%, 89%, 81%, and 92%, respectively. The cumulative area of open forest, estuarine wetland, and saltmarsh grass (1628 hectares) was converted to pasture in a thematic change analysis showing the "from-to" change. We generated linear regression relationships to examine trends in pixel values across the time series. Our findings from a trend analysis showed a decreasing trend (p value range = 0.001-0.099) in the vegetation extent of open forest, fringing mangroves, estuarine wetlands, saltmarsh grass, and grazing areas, but this was inconsistent across the study site. Similar to reports from tropical regions elsewhere, saltmarsh grass is poorly represented in the national park. A severe tropical cyclone preceding the capture of the 2017 Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image was likely the main driver for reduced areas of shoreline and stream vegetation. Our research contributes to the body of knowledge on coastal ecosystem dynamics to enable planning to achieve more effective conservation outcomes.

TI  - Openness to Christianity among Chinese Graduate Students Who Attended a U.S. Christian University: A Grounded Theory Study
T2  - CHRISTIAN HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 300,000 Chinese students attend U.S. universities annually (USDHS, 2018), many of whom reportedly "Leave China, Study in America, Find Jesus" (Zhang, 2016). However, research on this phenomenon of worldview change is thin, especially as related to the experiences of atheist or nonreligious Chinese graduate students attending Christian institutions. This grounded theory study investigated the central research question: "What factors influence Chinese graduate students' openness to Christianity while attending a Christian university in the United States?" Twenty-five Chinese graduate students from various majors were interviewed regarding their experiences attending an anonymous member institution of the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities (CCCU). Among the 25 participants, 20 entered the university self-identifying as nonreligious or atheist; three entered self-identifying as Christians who had attended an unofficial or official church in China. One participant reported having had limited involvement in Christianity in China; another reported significant previous involvement in Daoism. The major finding of the study is that Chinese graduate students who attended a Christian university experienced increased openness to Christianity yet with competing influences-contributors increasing openness to Christianity and other contributors that reportedly decreased openness to Christianity. This article focuses solely on the contributors that increased openness, organized by the researcher in three domains-the Theoretical-Curricular, Relational-Cultural, and Supernatural Dimensions. Ten contributors to openness were identified: (a) Worldview Courses Analyzing Arguments For/Against God's Existence, studying the work of atheist Richard Dawkins (2008) alongside Christian apologists J. P. Moreland (2007) and W. L Craig (2010); (b) Faith Integration Requirements; (c) Intellectual Freedom; (d) The Bible; (e) Faculty and Classmates' Influence; (f) Church Relationships; (g) Family Support; (h) American Culture; (i) Direct Experience With the Supernatural; and (j) Experimental Prayer.

AB  - Fernandina is the westernmost and the most active volcano in the Galapagos archipelago. It is a basaltic shield volcano with a summit caldera of dimension 5 x 6.5 km. Recently, the volcano erupted on January 12, 2020, preceded by a seismic shock of magnitude 4.7 at a depth of 5 km. The subsequent seismic activities have led to the formation of a circumferential fissure below the La Cumbre crater's eastern rim, at an elevation of 1.3-1.4 km. The lava flow has occurred down the flank to the sea through this fissure. This volcanic episode has continued up to 9 hours. The InSAR time series method is a multi-temporal InSAR technique used to detect slowly occurring deformations with a millimeter level of precision using a stack of SAR interferograms. In this paper, the Differential InSAR has been used to analyze Fernandina volcano's surface deformation due to this recent eruption. The interferograms of the volcano before, during, and after the eruption have been analyzed in detail using the freely available Sentinel 1 C- band datasets from 2019 December 17 to 2020 February 09. The integration of all these analyses gives an insight into the underground magma conduit system, the correlation between the magmatic and seismic activities, surface deformations, and the lava flow channels, which have been discussed in detail in this paper.

TI  - Evaluation of diagnostic accuracy and impact of preoperative positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the management of early operable breast cancers
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Our aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of staging positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in early breast cancers (EBCs) and to assess its impact on disease management. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed preoperative PET/CT scans of patients from January 2015 to December 2018 with Stage I/II, clinically T1-T2 N0-N1 breast cancers. The diagnostic performance of PET/CT for nodal (N) and distant metastases (M), its correlation with patient/tumor-specific factors, and its impact on disease management were analyzed using histopathology/clinical follow-up as standards of reference. Results: Of 158 patients evaluated, 14% of patients were Stage I (T1N0), 60% were Stage IIA (T1N1, T2N0), and 26% were Stage IIB (T2N1). Sensitivity, specificity, and the diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT for axillary staging were 76%, 97%, and 84% and for distant metastasis evaluation were 100%, 98%, and 99%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT for axillary staging was lower for low-grade, T1 tumors, postmenopausal group, and luminal A pathological subtype (77%, 84%, 81%, and 73%, respectively) compared to high-grade, T2 tumors, premenopausal group, and nonluminal A subtype (88%, 88%, 94%, and 87%, respectively). Distant metastases were detected on PET/CT in overall 16% (n = 25) of the patients (9% in Stage IIA and 27% in Stage IIB). PET/CT also incidentally identified clinically occult internal mammary nodes in 5% (n = 8) and organ-confined synchronous second malignancies in 5% (n = 8) of the patients. Conclusion: Preoperative PET/CT should be considered in all EBCs> 2 cm as it upstages the disease and alters management in about 24% of these patients. Given its high specificity for axillary staging PET/CT, patients with PET-positive axilla can be subjected to axillary dissection and those with PET-negative axilla to sentinel lymph node biopsy. The yield and diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT is less for low-grade tumors <2 cm and with luminal A subtype.

TI  - Use of Filaria Test Strips (FTS) in Identification of Filaria Endemicity in Non Filaria Endemic Districts of Uttar Pradesh, India
T2  - Journal of Communicable Diseases
M3  - Article
AB  - Uttar Pradesh is the largest state of India and is comprised of 75 revenue districts. 51 districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh are endemic for LF and are under Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (ELF). In order to ensure elimination of the disease from the people, the Mass Drug Administration (MDA) was observed in these 51 districts since 2004 by ensuring administration of drug DEC alone once in a year according to the age excluding children >2years, pregnant women & seriously ill persons. Thereafter, 400 mg albendazole to >2 years age group was added with DEC since 2008. 24 districts of Western Uttar Pradesh are non endemic for filariasis. The state in coordination with WHO has conducted filaria antigenemia tests in these 24 non filaria endemic districts with the help of Filaria Test Strips (FTS) and the drive is termed as Mini-transmission assessment survey (Mini-TAS). 300 persons were examined with Filaria Test Strip (FTS) from each of the 04 sentinel sites of each district. On the basis of test reports, all 24 non endemic districts reported >2 % filaria antigenemia and the state claimed to declare the districts as filaria endemic districts/ areas. The possibilities of the claim to establish non filaria endemic districts to filaria endemic districts have been explored & discussed in detail in this paper. The critical examination of the data does not support to assign any non endemic area to endemic area. On the basis of conducting direct filaria antigenemia tests alone and the term used as mini-transmission assessment survey ('Mini-TAS') will be a misnomer, consequently misleading to the ELF programme in the country.

AB  - Culture is the rule and norm of human life, the value and identity of invisible people. Culture is not visible to the eye, but every man-made thing has a culture. When we look at something, we try to see who made it, how it was made, and what it was intended for. After then, we read worldview from the things, and give them the value. The study aims to explore the religious and cultural identity of the Djenne Village in the Malian Republic, with the center of the Grand Mosque of Djenne.Djenne is a village in the delta between the Bani River, a tributary of the Niger River. Djenne is a granary district with fertile land, so this place is a suitable area for people to live in. Also, through the tributaries of the Niger River, it was able to spread Islam quickly as well as achieve economic development through trade. Djenne has emerged as the center of Islamic learning as a result of the rapid growth of Islam, and is revered as an area comparable to that of the Holy Land in Africa. Residents here are keen to keep faith in the Islamic faith, which has been handed down from ancestors, and are proud that their place is a major place in the Muslim world.Djenne building, built according to Mali’s traditional architecture style, has ornaments influenced by traditional religion, but sculptures and windows followed Moroccan architecture. Among these buil-dings, the Djenne Grand Mosque is the best example of Mali’s architecture. The Djenne Grand Mosque, built by the community of residents, is not just a city landmark, but a center of all lives and spirits for Muslims.Because Islam of Djenne at present combined with the region’s unique indigenous faith, they are now indivisible. This situation is the same not only in Djenne but also in other parts of Africa that believe in Islam. In this point, it is necessary to make a more accurate and detailed observation and record of Djenne’s Islamic culture centered around the Djenne Grand Mosque. For the mission for Muslim in Africa with Djenne, we must continue our efforts to get to know Africa with perseverance.

AB  - The Republic of Mali in Western Africa is a country located south of the Sahara Desert. The Mali is a community of various races, including the Bambara, the Bozo, the Dogon, etc. On the other hand, many ethnic groups in Mali have moved to Burkina Faso and Niger due to frequent bloody wars caused by ethnic conflicts.The Mali is a country that flourished greatly around the Mali dynasty and is also a place with place with many primitive religions as blooming a culture of homogeneity of tribal societies. As you can see the indigenous belief based on Shamanism all over the African continent, the Mali also emphasizes its relationship with the Divine Spirit through statues. Each tribe in the Mali has a tradition of divination, sorcery, fortune telling along with ancestor worship. This society has a common practice of polygamy and forms a paternal or clan-oriented community.Among the religious rituals of the Dogon people, statue is a representative example of ancestor worship, having their own value system and worldview in the meaning and symbol of the statues. Through the examination of 10 representative statues of the Dogon people, this study was able to confirm their mental world and value system, and confirm that the statues symbolically represent the norms, order and faith of their society. The statues of the Dogons show various meanings and symbols, especially the communication system between God and person and between person and person. This communication system is a cultural phenomenon that effectively shows the society, economy, politics, and culture associated with human life, while at the same time showings that religious forms and actions are systematic. However, a comprehensive interpretation of the statues of the Dogon people recognizes the need to approach them a variety of ways rather than in a simple approach, given that they form a theory of unique symbolic systems of the Dogon people and reveal the complementarity between the synchronic and diachronic system of knowledge.

M3  - Article
AB  - As reported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the world has been greening over the last two decades, with the highest greening occurring in China and India. The increasing vegetation will increase plant tissue accumulation and water storage capacity, and all of these variations will cause mass change. In this study, we found that the mass change related to greening in Southern China could be confirmed by Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations. The mean mass change rate detected by GRACE is 6.7 +/- 0.8 mm/yr in equivalent water height during 2003-2016 in our study region. This is consistent with the sum of vegetation tissue, soil water and groundwater change calculated using multi-source data. The vegetation accumulation is approximately 3.8 +/- 1.3 mm/yr, which is the major contribution to region mass change. We also found that the change of water storage capacity related to vegetation can be detected by GRACE.

AB  - Rice is the most important food source for many countries, which especially for Asia, includes Taiwan. Monitoring rice field distribution can effectively manage food security. This study proposed a feature-based decision approach to detect the mapping of rice cultivation using the time-series Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data provided by Sentinel-1A. Instead of using the maximum and minimum backscatter of SAR data, as most studies in the literature, this study established a rice growth model based on complete time series data in the rice growth period. From the developed model, a feature related to rice growth time, that is, the time interval (TI) between vegetative growth and maturity stages was introduced. The proposed feature was first compared with the feature of backscatter difference (BD) between the maximum and minimum value of SAR data. The experimental results show that the proposed feature can achieve better rice detection accuracy. Then, a decision method based on the combination of TI and BD features was proposed for rice planting mapping. In the study, Yunlin and Changhua counties in central Taiwan were used as experimental areas. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve more than 90% overall accuracy in rice detection for VH polarization. Furthermore, comparing with the traditional method that uses growth height feature, BD, the proposed method can improve the overall accuracy of rice detection about 5%.

TI  - Methodology Development for Calibration Assessment Using Quasi-Deep Convective Clouds With Application to Aqua MODIS TEB
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep convective clouds (DCC) are identified by using a combination of brightness temperature (BT) and visible reflectance thresholds. Moreover, it is common practice to use daytime DCC measurements for the calibration assessment of reflective solar and longwave infrared bands. The DCC cold core is suitable for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal emissive bands (TEB) calibration assessment; more specifically, for the offset effect in the quadratic calibration function. However, the reflected solar radiance in the daytime DCC measurements affects the midwave infrared bands. Thus, an assessment over low-BT measurements is not applicable to these bands. Because of this, a quasi-DCC (qDCC) technique is developed for the midwave infrared bands calibration assessment. The feasibility of using nighttime DCC measurements is demonstrated by comparing the DCC and daytime qDCC techniques. A DCC normalization method is also developed to remove the DCC fluctuation impact and enhance the assessment accuracy. The DCC measurements' distribution is asymmetrical for all TEB, and their BT ranges fluctuate around 20 K. An empirical model is developed and applied to normalize the measurements over DCC to a reference temperature. After the normalization, the DCC and qDCC measurements' distributions are close to symmetrical and Gaussian in shape. These improvements are applied to the Aqua MODIS instrument. The calibration stability, noise performance, and consistency are evaluated for all Aqua MODIS TEB. Lastly, the Aqua MODIS formatter reset effect on the calibration offset bias between two mirror sides is analyzed, and a calibration coefficient correction is proposed for future calibration improvements.

AB  - A technique to use deep convective clouds (DCC) and quasi-DCC (qDCC) for the calibration assessment of the thermal emissive bands (TEB) on remote sensing instruments has proven feasible. The Terra and Aqua MODIS and S-NPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS TEB calibration uses a nonlinear algorithm whose nonlinear coefficients rely on on-orbit blackbody (BB) warm-up and cool-down (WUCD) activities for updates. However, the limited BB temperature range affects the calibration's uncertainty. The DCC core, one of the coldest Earth scenes, is suitable for MODIS calibration assessments; more specifically, for the evaluation of the offset effect in its TEB quadratic calibration function. Moreover, nighttime qDCC measurements provide the advantage of removing solar reflectance effects, thus enhancing the assessment's accuracy for the midwave infrared TEB. In this paper, the qDCC method is applied to the Terra MODIS and VIIRS TEB. Their stabilities are assessed using long-term DCC and qDCC trending measurements over the instruments' entire missions. The measurements from bands with an approximately 11-mu m wavelength are used to identify the DCC pixels. MODIS band 31 (similar to 11 mu m) has demonstrated stable performance and accurate calibration for both instruments throughout their respective missions. MODIS band 31 can therefore be used as a reference for the other TEB. Furthermore, it also allows for a Terra and Aqua MODIS TEB cross-comparison. The assessment results, along with the calibration uncertainty and Level 1B product impact modeling, can be quite helpful for calibration improvements.

TI  - MODIS TEB calibration algorithm improvements for future L1B collection

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Terra and Aqua MODIS have provided continuous global observations for scientific applications for more than 20 and 18 years, respectively. The radiometric calibration of the MODIS thermal emissive bands (TEB) is based on a quadratic approximation of the instrument response. The calibration coefficients look-up tables (LUTs) are updated using the response of the MODIS on-board blackbody (BB) with the response background subtracted by space view. The quarterly on-board BB warm-up and cool-down activity temperature ranges from 270 K to 315 K, and the derived offset has a relatively large uncertainty. Electronic cross-talk, an artifact that affects both instrument calibration and Earth view (EV) radiance retrievals, is corrected based on lunar observations. Calibration assessments using EV observations (e.g. ocean, desert, Antarctic Dome Concordia, and deep convective clouds) provide useful information to evaluate the impact of the Terra safe mode (February 2016) and Aqua MODIS formatter reset (January 2018) events on both MODIS instruments. This study focuses on the TEB radiometric calibration algorithm improvements for future collections based on calibration assessments using EV measurements and analytical modeling. Measurement stability and consistency over specific Earth scenes with a wide temperature range, as well as their brightness temperature (BT) dependency, are used for bias estimations in the calibration coefficients. Calibration coefficients are derived and updated after adjusting the current fitting algorithm. Thereafter, using the test LUTs, their impact on the Level 1B (L1B) data for different EV scenes is analyzed.

AB  - Land cover composition and change are important aspects for many scientific research and socioeconomic assessments. The multi-date land cover change detection is generally more difficult and time-consuming to select enough training samples when considering multi-date image labels at the same location. To improve the accuracy for multi-date change detection, this study proposed a new algorithm framework, combining self-learning and relearning algorithm. Wuhan was selected as the experimental area, and Landsat images in 2005 and 2016 were used to extract six main types of change classes. Firstly, PCM (primitive co-occurrence matrix) and the minimum class certainty are used to ensure the high confidence of selected candidate set samples, and then the most informative samples are identified for classification from the candidate samples. To save computing costs, we adopt clustering method to reduce the self-relearning samples. Based on our experimental results, the self-relearning algorithm increases the final classification accuracy by approximately 2.5% (from 92.64% to 95.09%) in the case of using few initial training samples, providing a feasible solution for the multi-date change detection.

TI  - A Comprehensive Evaluation of 4-Parameter Diurnal Temperature Cycle Models with In Situ and MODIS LST over Alpine Meadows in the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Diurnal variation of land surface temperature (LST) is essential for land surface energy and water balance at regional or global scale. Diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model with least parameters and high accuracy is the key issue in estimating the spatial-temporal variation of DTC. The alpine meadow is the main land cover in the Tibetan Plateau (TP). However, few studies have been reported on the performance of different DTC models over alpine meadows in the TP. Four semi-empirical types of DTC models were used to generate nine 4-parameter (4-para) models by fixing some of free parameters. The performance of the nine 4-para DTC models were evaluated with four in situ and MODIS observations. All models except GOT09-dT-t(s) (dT means the temperature residual between T-0 and T (t ->infinity); t(s) means the time when free attenuation begins) had higher correlation with in situ data (R-2 > 0.9), while the INA08-t(s) model performed best with NSE of 0.99 and RMSE of 2.04 K at all sites. The GOT09-t(s)-tau (tau is the total optical thickness), VAN06-t(s)-omega(1) (omega(1) means the half-width of the cosine term in the morning), and GOT01-t(s) models had better performance, followed by GOT09-dT-tau, GOT01-dT, and VAN06-t(s)-omega(2) (omega(2) means the half-width of the cosine term in the afternoon) models. All models had higher accuracy in summer than in other seasons, while poorer performance was produced in winter. The INA08-t(s) model showed best performance among all seasons. Models with fixing t(s) could produce higher accuracy results than that with fixing dT. The comparison of INA08-ts model driven by in situ and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data indicated that the simulation accuracy mainly depended on the accuracy of MODIS LST. The daily maximum temperature generated by the nine models had high accuracy when compared with in situ data. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the INA08-dT and GOT09-dT-t(s) models were more sensitive to parameter dT, while all models were insensitive to parameter t(s), and all models had weak relationship with parameters omega and tau. This study provides a reference for exploring suitable DTC model in the TP.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node detection using fluorescein and blue light-emitting diodes in patients with breast carcinoma: A single-center prospective study
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is an essential procedure for lymph node staging in patients with breast carcinoma. Technetium-99m-labelled nanocolloid (Tc-99m) is the most accurate and widely used lymphatic mapping agent; however, there are concerns pertaining to the associated exposure to radiation. Studies focusing on new agents are required. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of SLN detection using fluorescein and blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in breast carcinoma patients.Methods: In this prospective study, a total of 61 patients with breast carcinoma, requiring SLN biopsy, were enrolled. Both fluorescein and Tc-99m were intradermally injected into the areola of the affected breast of each patient. SLNs stained with fluorescein were detected using blue LED light first, and then, any remaining SLNs were detected using a gamma detection probe. The detection rate was analyzed, and the presence of complications was investigated.Results: SLNs dyed with fluorescein using blue LED light were visualized in 57 of 61 patients (93.4%). None of the patients experienced complications related to the use of fluorescein or blue LED light.Conclusions: The detection of SLNs using fluorescein and blue LED light was feasible and safe in patients with breast carcinoma. This technique involves the use of visible light, allowing for SLNs to be viewed with the naked eye, and is quantifiable, easy to use, and economical.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper aims to propose a core attitude or worldview of Kim Jong-sam's poetry writing namely "ethical ethics-lessness" as an inner logic that can resolve the conflicting interpretation of Kim Jong-sam.Recognizing that the existing language always distorts the object, Kim Jong-sam's purism seeks to create a new language and meaning by watching only the inner image through a kind of ‘methodical solipsism or ethics-lessness’ that disconnects the relations with the object and others. This reflect his yearning for a new relationship between the subject and the object, where there is no room for distortion. In the end, it can be considered that ethical aspiration underlies the ‘methodical ethics-lessness’.This ‘methodical ethics-lessness’ of Kim Jong-sam further leads to doubts about inner sense, especially the sentiment of compassion. However, it seems reasonable to conclude that his doubt is not merely cynicism that wipes out the inner side and compassion, but more like a sincere attitude of maintaining 'ethical ethics-lessness' with the persistent agony between 'impossibility of compassion' and 'impossibility of 'impossibility of compassion''.From this point of view, this paper re-reads some of Kim’s poems of the 52 Poets Anthology, "The Gardener", "Sound", and "Zone" in detail. In conclusion this paper argued as follows: 1) The ‘ethical ethics-lessness’ was useful as a consistent internal logic that could resolve the conflicting interpretation of Kim Jong-sam. 2) ‘Ethical ethics-lessness’ paves a new path for multi-faceted ways of understanding Kim Jong-sam. 3) Lastly, in the lightof ‘ethical ethics-lessness’, constructive comparisons and analysis regrading the process of the generation of poetic effects could also be carried out.

AB  - Satellite based observations can provide detailed knowledge in this regard on a long timescale covering a large spatial area. In this study Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data based on MODIS (Terra and Aqua), MISR satellite along with MERRA reanalysis product was analyzed to find out changes in the trend of AOD on urban area of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar city from 2000 to 2018. The results strongly suggest that on this region there has been increased in AOD over the past years even though it shows a decrease during certain time period. The seasonal analysis of these cities show that the AOD is maximum in the months of summer and is minimum in the months of winter. Ahmedabad comparatively to Gandhinagar can be said a fairly polluted city. These results in general agree with the recently reported global increase in pollution"global warming" and also the trend in some of the anthropogenic emissions.

AB  - Purpose. The approach represented in the article is applied to analysis of satellite scanner optical images of high spatial resolution for identifying and quantitative determining the characteristics of the submesoscale dynamic processes in the ocean upper layer.Methods and Results. The Envisat AATSR and MERIS SAR-images are used as the satellite data, which permit to determine the ocean surface temperature and surface brightness in the visible range, respectively. Variations in the sea surface glitter contrasts are associated with modulations of the sea surface roughness (rms slope of short waves) on the currents. It is shown that the surface roughness contrasts correlate with the spatial inhomogeneities of the ocean surface temperature, tracing submesoscale processes in the ocean (spiral eddies, filaments, local shears of currents). The described model of formation of surface manifestations is based on interaction between the Ekman current and the main flow vorticity.Conclusions. Possibility of detecting and quantitative assessing the intense current gradients in the vicinity of sub-mesoscale fronts is shown. These gradients are manifested in the optical satellite images through the ocean surface roughness modulations. The proposed approach makes it possible to study and to assess quantitatively the dynamic processes taking place in the vicinity of the submesoscale fronts. These processes, in their turn, affect the exchange of momentum, heat and gases between the ocean and the atmosphere. The prospects of applying the sub-mesoscale variability defined from the satellite measurements, to development of the models and the systems for the ocean global observations and monitoring are discussed.

AB  - This article considers the application of two dense coregistration algorithms to the estimation of ice flow. These algorithms estimate displacements at each pixel of the image and can be applied to pairs of radar, optical and radar/optical images. This flexibility combined with the dense estimation should improve both spatial and temporal resolutions of glacier displacement maps. Several tests are carried out on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images on Totten glacier in Antarctica. We assess the reliability of the considered algorithms by applying them to real and emulated pairs of images based on displacement fields previously estimated in the literature.

TI  - Writing Back Through Travel: A Study of <i>The Travels of Mirza Abu Taleb Khan</i>
T2  - RUPKATHA JOURNAL ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mirza Abu Taleb Khan who travelled to England from 1799-1802 is one of the early Indians who participated in what Michael Fisher calls 'counterflows to colonialism' and recorded his experience in the form of a travelogue. Taleb's Travels foregrounds how a colonized subject from the periphery tries to understand and negotiate with the metropolitan centre that attempted to dominate and control the Other. It is pertinent to explore the cultural dialogue initiated by a 'contact zone' formed through the travel of an Indian. The oriental traveller who was both the gazer and the gazed, came up with a highly complex gaze that created a version of what Mary Louise Pratt calls 'autoethnography' and a space for 'transculturation'. Taleb's entry in print culture through writing a travelogue seems highly significant because he tried to write back a genre called travel writing that played an integral part in the consolidation of empire by mapping the cultural topography as well as the flora and fauna of the Other. The travel of the 'Persian Prince in London' problematized an important binary created by colonial discourse-- Britain's mobility as opposed to the stasis of the Other. Though Taleb accepted some of the binaries created by the Orientalist discourse, there are areas where he refused to accept the superiority of the British culture. First published in 1810, The Travels of Mirza Abu Taleb Khan in Asia, Africa and Europe during the years 1799-1803 brings out the dialectic of the acceptance and rejection of the dominant metropolitan culture. He admired the science and technology of Britain, their education system and law. He also sharply criticized the British as proud, insolent, intolerant, non-religious, luxurious and lazy and his criticism of British culture provides a strong sense of postcolonial resistance. He debunked the empirical codes of European travel writing by positing the worldview of the Other through the form of 'safarnama'. This paper attempts to critically locate Taleb's text as an 'authoethnographic expression' and the problematic position of an Indian traveller who can question empire and also serve the interest of empire by teaching oriental languages to the colonial masters.

AB  - Crop lodging assessment is essential for evaluating yield damage and informing crop management decisions forsustainable agricultural production. While a few studies have demonstrated the potential of optical and SAR datafor crop lodging assessment, large-scale crop lodging assessment has been hampered by the unavailability ofdense satellite time series data. The unprecedented availability of free Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data mayprovide a basis for operational detection and monitoring of crop lodging. In this context, this study aims tounderstand the effect of lodging on backscatter/coherence and spectral reflectance derived from Sentinel-1 andSentinel-2 data and to detect lodging incidence in wheat using time-series analysis. Crop biophysical parameterswere measured in the field for both healthy and lodged plots from March to June 2018 in a study site in Ferrara,Italy, and the corresponding Sentinel images were downloaded and processed. The lodged plots were furthercategorised into different lodging severity classes (moderate, severe and very severe). Temporal profiles ofbackscatter, coherence, reflectance and continuum removed spectra were studied for healthy and lodging severityclasses throughout the stem elongation to ripening growth stages. The Kruskal Wallis and posthoc Tukeytests were used to test for significant differences between different classes. Our results for Sentinel-2 showed thatred edge (740 nm) and NIR (865 nm) bands could best distinguish healthy from lodged wheat (particularlyhealthy and very severe). For Sentinel-1, the analysis revealed the potential of VH backscatter and the complementarityof VV and VH/VV backscatter in distinguishing a maximum number of classes. Our findings demonstratethe potential of Sentinel data for near real-time detection of the incidence and severity of lodging inwheat. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that has contributed to this application.

AB  - Crop lodging - the bending of crop stems from their upright position or the failure of root-soil anchorage systems - is a major yield-reducing factor in wheat and causes deterioration of grain quality. The severity of lodging can be measured by a lodging score (LS)- an index calculated from the crop angle of inclination (CAI) and crop lodged area (LA). LS is difficult and time consuming to measure manually meaning that information on lodging occurrence and severity is limited and sparse. Remote sensing-based estimates of LS can provide more timely, synoptic and reliable information on crop lodging across vast areas. This information could improve estimates of crop yield losses, inform insurance loss adjusters and influence management decisions for subsequent seasons.This research - conducted in the 600 ha wheat sown area in the Bonifiche Ferraresi farm, located in Jolanda di Savoia, Ferrara, Italy - evaluated the performance of RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 data to discriminate and classify lodging severity based on field measured LS. We measured temporal crop status characteristics related to lodging (e.g. lodged area, CAI, crop height) and collected relevant meteorological data (wind speed and rainfall) throughout May-June 2018. These field measurements were used to distinguish healthy (He) wheat from lodged wheat with different degrees of lodging severity (moderate, severe and very severe). We acquired multi-incidence angle (FQ8-27° and FQ21-41°) RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 (40°) images and derived multiple metrics from them to discriminate and classify lodging severity. As a part of our data exploration, we performed a correlation analysis between the image-based metrics and LS. Next, a multi-temporal discriminant analysis approach, including a partial least squares (PLS-DA) method, was developed to classify lodging severities. We used the area under the curve-receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC) and confusion matrices to evaluate the accuracy of the PLS-DA classification models.Results show that (1) volume scattering components were highly correlated with LS at low incidence angles while double and surface scattering was more prevalent at high incidence angles; (2) lodging severity was best classified using low incidence angle R-FQ8 data (overall accuracy 72%) and (3) the Sentinel-1 data-based classification model was able to correctly identify 60% of the lodging severity cases in the study site. The results from this first study on classifying lodging severity using satellite-based SAR platforms suggests that SAR-based metrics can capture a substantial proportion of the observed variation in lodging severity, which is important in the context of operational crop lodging assessment in particular, and sustainable agriculture in general.

M3  - Article
AB  - Lodging - the bending of crop stems - reduces the quantity and quality of cereal crop yields. Early quantification of crop lodging is important to prevent further losses and to facilitate harvesting operations. Crop angle of inclination (CAI) is a quantitative measure of the lodging stage and a component of lodging severity/score. CAI is an important structural parameter for lodged crops and very few studies have investigated its estimation using satellite-based remote sensing. In this study, the performance of Sentinel-1 and multi-incidence angle (FQ8-27 degrees and FQ21-41 degrees) RADARSAT-2 data were investigated for estimating CAI. Temporal crop biophysical/structural parameters (CAI and crop height) and meteorological data (rainfall and wind speed) were collected throughout May 1-June 30, 2018 in a very large commercial farm located in Jolanda di Savoia, Ferrara, Italy. Field data were grouped into different crop lodging stages (non-lodged/healthy (H), moderate lodging (ML), severe lodging (SL) and very severe lodging (VSL)) based on CAI. Quantitative relationships were established between field-measured CAI values and the RS-derived metrics for Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 timeseries using support vector regression (SVR) models. The RADARSAT-2 FQ8 model performed most robustly with a R-CV(2) (cross-validated R-2) of 0.87 and a RMSECV(cross-validated RMSE) of 8.89 degrees while the performance of the Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 FQ21 models were comparable with an RMSECV of 11.35 degrees and 11.63 degrees respectively. Low incidence angle data were particularly sensitive to high CAI values (VSL) while high incidence angle data were useful for predicting lower CAI (ML and SL). While the RADARSAT-2 FQ-8 model outperformed the other two, the Sentinel-1 model still explained 78% of the CAI variability in the study site, which is important in the context of operational crop lodging stage assessment. This is the first study to demonstrate the utility of SAR remote sensing data for estimating CAI as a measure of the lodging stage and a component of lodging severity.

AB  - The advancement in the satellite technology has made it possible to easily and frequently obtain the satellite images of most of the regions on the Earth. The satellite data contains the abundant amount of information which can be very useful for variety of societal applications. However, manual identification of the land cover in a particular area is a very challenging and time-consuming task. In this manuscript, an attempt has been made to better extract the landcover types from Sentinel-2A imagery using the popular classifiers such as random forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree (CART). The manuscript also validates the results obtained by the used models by computing the performance metrics. The analysis reveals that random forest classifier outperforms the rest of the classification methods in terms of better accuracy of 95.67%. This automated approach can be applied to large sets of data, reducing the need for manual labeling.

AB  - Stubble burning during October and November, results in the extensive formation of smoke cloud over the Punjab region, and maybe one of the main reasons behind the increase in air pollution levels in these areas. The manual detection and estimation are tedious, lengthy and unpractical, so several researchers have been using remote sensing and GIS technique to estimate stubble burn areas and forest fires. Thus, in the present study, an attempt has been made to detect and estimate the stubble burn area. Landsat 8 OLI images are used to detect the stubble burn area for the year 2014-18 for Patiala and Ludhiana, which are major rice producing districts of Punjab. Normalize Burn Ratio (NBR) index have been used to determine the burned area in an image using a statistical threshold technique (2s approach). The results have been validated using available as well as collected Ground Control Points (GCPs) and accuracy assessment has been conducted by generating an error matrix. It has been estimated that the stubble burn area was reduced by 32% and 40% during the study period for Patiala and Ludhiana regions, respectively. The monthly variation for various pollutants (RSPM, NOx, and SO2) during the study period has also been studied and analyzed. The distinct increase in pollutant levels has been observed during each stubble burning period. The results also indicate that the amount of emitted RSPM and NOx was higher than the emitted SO2 during stubble burning. The wind rose diagrams have also been plotted.

AB  - In the last few decades, urbanization activities have promoted the emergence of megacities, megalopolis, urban clusters or large urban aggregations, but only a few studies have analyzed them using remote sensing data in both the spatial and the temporal domains, In this paper, combining SAR and multispectral sensors with different resolutions, a novel approach, improved by means of a hierarchical clustering technique, is proposed. Urban changes are mapped in the form of multiple spatio-temporal patterns, visualized by change vectors exploiting the combination of SAR and nighttime light data.

It is desirable to monitor and recognize these changes by utilizing temporal and spatial information in an automatic way. In this paper, time-series segmentation and unsupervised classification are combined to mine and recognize segments of temporal change patterns. Our preliminary results show that the proposed approach is effective and reduces the negative consequences due to information inflation.

Firstly, based on ETM+ data interpretation structure, the band operation results of SPOT6 data are used to indirectly reflect the structure informat ion, and the high resolution WorldView3 data is integrated to construct the interpretation analysis. Finally, the interpretation structure information is revised based on field validation. The results show t hat multi-source remote sensing data have the characteristics of high resolution, accuracy and high efficiency in geological structure interpretation.

AB  - Cloud cover, cloud properties, and the change in cloud cover over time are important variables to quantify in planning for ground-space bidirectional high bandwidth optical communication systems. As operators of optical communication systems will endeavor to function when skies have optically thin cloud cover, a climatological study that includes cloud physics in the dataset (i.e., cloud emissivity and cloud optical depth) will provide beneficial guidance. As a first step in undertaking such an investigation, we have initiated a study of the Australian continent with the aim of identifying any significant decadal trends in cloud climatology over a 40-year period. The database, covering PATMOS-x AVHRR cloud data from 1979 to 2018, includes sampling of the climatology at four times during the diurnal cycle so that selection of operating conditions can be further analyzed. Examples of the spatial and temporal variability of satellite-derived cloud fractional amounts over Australia will be presented along with an approach to analyzing and interpreting this information in aid of the decision-making process to optimize clear-sky optical ground station positioning. When used in conjunction with the average monthly cloud amount, monthly specific decadal time-specific anomalies can highlight when and where minimum levels of cloud cover occur.

AB  - Forest management and inventories need to derive forest species information. Generally, this is done by a fastidious manual photointerpretation and an in-field validation. Remote sensing methods allow producing forest mapping at a large extent. This paper focuses on the contribution of Sentinel-2 multispectral time series for mapping fine forest species in order to improve forest inventories. First, a S2 monodate classification is studied with the seasonal effect. Secondly S2 time series were used, with different attribute combinations integrating the NDVI. Results showed a high accuracy improvement with S2 time series (up to +0.14),Two classifiers were tested; support vector machines and Random forests. Kappa reached 0.72 with a high per-class precision ranging between 0.77 and 0.97 for tree species while providing a low precision on maquis areas.

T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Acacia mearnsii De Wild. was introduced into the El Kala region (far north-east of Algeria) during reforestation programmes in the 1970s, in plantations with 20% eucalyptus. In the last few decades, increasingly invasive patches of this Australian acacia species have been observed in the same parts of the country. Tools such as a Geographic Information System (GIS) with up-to-date satellite data need to be used in order to better understand this invasion and identify potentially high-risk ecosystems. This study therefore used mapping tools to investigate the distribution of invasions by this species. Two approaches were applied, one based on data collected in the field and the other on remote sensing techniques, using the supervised classification method across a Landsat 8 image. The results from the two methods show that the species has invaded four sites with a total area of about 3,200 ha. The areas affected are occupied almost entirely by eucalyptus and cork oak forests (respectively 65.0% and 17.9% of the total). Classification across the satellite image could only show heavily invaded areas, whereas the field survey method made it possible to map the entire distribution of the invasion. However, when superimposed, the two maps were largely identical (0.90 <= R <= 1). To conclude, the use of satellite data coupled with field survey data reduced the constraints arising from Landsat image resolution while also demonstrating the importance of methods based on fieldwork.

TI  - THE CONCEPT OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES IN THE CHUVASH LITERATURE AND IN THE POEM "NARSPI" BY K. IVANOV

AB  - In this paper, the images of the sun and the moon, which are the prototype of the spiritual world in Chuvash mythopoetic literature, are considered. The reflection of the concept of these heavenly bodies in classical Chuvash literature is also studied. The main attention is paid to the study of the sun role in K. Ivanov's poem "Narspi", where this concept acts as an image of the Almighty.In Chuvash literary studies, many works are devoted to the study of literary traditions and artistic images originating from ancient times. The purpose of this study is to consider the concept of the sun and the moon in the context of the Turkic artistic tradition. This topic is relevant, as the study of deep connections of different peoples. mythopoetic literature helps to understand better both the work of individual authors and artistic trends in literature as a whole.One of the Turkic literary traditions is the cult of the sun and the moon, which is associated with the folklore aesthetic views of these peoples. Cultivation of these images is observed in the literature of the Turkic peoples from the earliest period. The cult of the sun and the moon image was preserved in Chuvash literature.The Chuvash have many myths where the sun and the moon were originally inseparable. Then they were separated by fate. In the myths of the moon and the sun, the animalistic worldview of the Chuvash ancestors is observed. These heavenly bodies are certain substances that are set to serve humanity. In the traditional culture of the people, they are perceived as living beings with human qualities: kindness, mercy, modesty, fatigue, etc. In Chuvash literature, the unity of the sun and the moon personify warmth and light.The ancient Chuvash revered the sun and believed that it was impossible to speak badly of it, because it sees and hears everything. It was also a symbol of justice and prosperity in their lives. In folklore, the sun is deified. Although the moon, being its younger brother, does not play the role of a deity, but it is also a benefactor and helper of people living on earth.Undoubtedly, the cult of the sun and the moon, having arisen at the dawn of mankind with the advent of the first religious beliefs, penetrated into the Turkic environment. The veneration of these heavenly bodies was being cultivated by the Chuvash ancestors for several centuries and, of course, a transformation took place. However, this tradition has been preserved in Chuvash folk literature, and the veneration of the sun and the moon was later reflected in classical Chuvash literature.In the poem "Narspi" by K.V. Ivanov the sun is a kind of unique substance, which acts as a higher power, evaluating the events taking place in the poem. The sun in the poem is not just a symbol-epithet, but one of the acting heroes, which sometimes replaces the image of the narrator, condemns the actions of some heroes, sympathizes with others, and evaluates the third ones.Mention of the sun image is present at the very beginning of the work and at its end. The work begins with a description of the origin of life in the spring and ends with the death of the main character. One circle of human life closes. But time and the universe are eternal. The constancy of traditions, the natural world is transmitted through the image of the sun, which will move along its trajectory further. Thus, we have revealed that the Chuvash poet K.V. Ivanov turned to the cult images of the sun and the moon, developing them to poetic symbols.

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization, marked by massive land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) and explosive population growth, has a significant impact on human activities. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of LUCC in the Zhoushan Archipelago, dynamic monitoring and analysis of LUCC was performed using seven Landsat images from 1984 to 2016. The observations and results obtained in this study include the following: the forest of Zhoushan Island was well protected and had a slight increase in the area, yet the spatial distribution remained nearly unchanged; the construction land gradually expanded to all of the coastal plains and southern islands with a trend "first southward, then eastward and finally northward," and the area increased by 571.88%; the coastal cropland/grassland surrounding Zhoushan Island was observed to have been gradually occupied by construction land as noted by a 27.94% decrease in area and the spatial distribution becoming discrete; the mudflat decreased by 93.39% and was mainly converted into construction land; the total land area observed in this study increased by 8.87%, which was achieved primarily by sea reclamation and conversion to construction land and inland water body. These results provide a better understanding of the spatial and temporal evolvement features of LUCC in Zhoushan, China, and the LUCC characteristics that can be expected to significantly support urban management and sustainable development.

TI  - Assessment of Urban Heat Risk in Mountain Environments: A Case Study of Chongqing Metropolitan Area, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - For urban climatic environments, the urban heat island (UHI) effect resulting from land use and land cover change (LUCC) caused by human activities is rapidly becoming one of the most notable characteristics of urban climate change due to urban expansion. UHI effects have become a significant barrier to the process of urbanization and sustainable development of the urban ecological environment. Predicting the spatial and temporal patterns of the urban heat environment from the spatial relationship between land use and land surface temperature (LST) is key to predicting urban heat environment risk. This study established an Urban Heat Environment Risk Model (UHERM) as follows. First, the urban LST was normalized and classified during three different periods. Second, a Markov model was constructed based on spatio-temporal change in the urban heat environment between the initial year (2005) and middle year (2010), and then a cellular automata (CA) model was used to reveal spatial relationships between the urban heat environments of the two periods and land use in the initial year. The spatio-temporal pattern in a future year (2015) was predicted and the accuracy of the simulation was verified. Finally, the spatio-temporal pattern of urban heat environment risk was quantitatively forecasted based on the decision rule for the urban heat environment risk considering both the present and future status of the spatial characteristics of the urban heat environment. The MODIS LST product and LUCC dataset retrieved from remote sensing images were used to verify the accuracy of UHERM and to forecast the spatio-temporal pattern of urban heat environment risk during the period of 2015-2020. The results showed that the risk of urban heat environment is increasing in the Chongqing metropolitan area. This method for quantitatively evaluating the spatio-temporal pattern of urban heat environment risk could guide sustainable growth and provide effective theoretical and technical support for the regulation of urban spatial structure to minimize urban heat environment risk.

TI  - A systematic evaluation of influence of image selection process on remote sensing-based burn severity indices in North American boreal forest and tundra ecosystems
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imagery has been widely used for the assessment of wildfire burn severity within the scientific community and fire management agencies. Multiple indices have been proposed to assess burn severity, among which the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) is arguably the most commonly used index that is expected to provide an objective and consistent assessment. However, although evidence of variability in the dNBR-based assessment of bum severity driven by image pair selection has been shown in many studies, the comprehensive examination of the extent of the bias resulting from the image selection has been lacking. In this study, we focus on three factors of the image selection process which are encountered by most Landsat-derived dNBR applications, including the sensor combination and the difference in timing of image acquisition (for both the year and seasonality) of pre- and post-fire image pairs. Through separate analyses, each targeting a single factor, we show that Landsat sensor combination between the pre- and post-fire images has a limited impact on the dNBR values. The difference in the year of acquisition between the images in the image pairs is shown to influence dNBR assessment with a noticeable increase in mean dNBR (> 0.1) with only a single year difference between images compared to multi-year differences. However, differences in the image acquisition seasons and the resulting phonological differences is shown to impact dNBR values most considerably. Based on our results, we warn against the calculation of dNBR when the images are acquired in different seasons. We believe that despite the existence of multiple derivatives of dNBR, there remains a need for an improved version; one that is less susceptible to the phonological impacts introduced by the selected images.

AB  - In this paper, an algorithm of the land surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) and albedo parameters inversion is proposed based on a simplified atmospheric radiative transfer model coupling with the BRDF model. The algorithm is applied to the Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data. To validate the inversion, the BRDF/ albedo parameters derived from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were collected and resampled to match the MSI data. The preliminary validation shows a good consistency between the two datasets with the correlative coefficient (R) greater than 0.8 and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) less than 0.05 for the red and near infrared bands. The advantage of this algorithm is that the spatial resolution of the satellite-derived BRDF/albedo parameters can be improved as high as 20 m, which has great potential in quantitative remote sensing applications.

AB  - Remote sensing technology has great advantages for fire detection, meanwhile, many studies neglect the contribution of small fires which appear burned area and time uncertainly. Crop residue burning is a kind of biomass burning, and a kind of small fires as well. So far, no matter the satellite remote sensing data or detecting algorithms that cannot meet monitoring requirements of crop residue burning. It is difficult to detect and monitor. In this paper, using MODIS burned area product and active fire product, the burned area detection algorithm of crop residue burning was developed, and then, took a test in the Yangtze River Delta. Results show that developed detection algorithm not only detect crop residue burning well, but also estimate the burned area. This study about small fires has obvious progress compared with other fire detection methods.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of the economy, the demand for urban land resources is also growing. How to make more rational use of land resources and make more rational planning of cities become a major problem in current economic development. At present, the use of remote sensing images to classify urban land use areas has become a research hot spot. However, the traditional classification accuracy rate using the maximum likelihood classification method needs to be improved. How to improve the classification accuracy rate of urban land use area of remote sensing image has become the focus and key of the research. Both rough sets and fuzzy sets are mathematical methods for dealing with uncertain problems. The rough fuzzy sets generated by the combination of the two can solve the problem of information loss due to the rough set discretization process. Based on the advantages of fuzzy rough sets, this paper applies fuzzy rough sets to the study of urban land use area classification of remote sensing images, so as to improve the accuracy of urban land use area classification of remote sensing images. Firstly, the spectral features and texture features of the remote sensing image are extracted after preprocessing the remote sensing image. Secondly, using the domain relationship fuzzy rough set reduces the extracted features. Finally, the support vector machine is used to classify the reduced feature set, and the classification of urban land use area is realized. In the simulation experiment, the classification accuracy is evaluated by the overall classification accuracy, Kappa coefficient, and single class classification success index. The evaluation data shows that the fuzzy rough set is applied to the remote sensing image urban land use area classification, which has a good application effect.

AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion utilizes the complementarity of high-temporal-low-spatial (HTLS) and high-spatial-low-temporal (HSLT) resolution data to obtain high temporal and spatial (HTHS) resolution fusion data, which can effectively satisfy the demand for HTHS data. However, due to the difference of spatial resolution, it is difficult to obtain precise spatial information in spatiotemporal fusion. To solve this problem, a multi-level strategy-based spatial domain prediction algorithm is proposed to enhance the spatial information extraction in spatiotemporal remote sensing imagery fusion, which can reduce the noise superposition in the process of multiple reconstruction. By learning-based first and then interpolation-based Super resolution reconstruction, the proposed method can obtain better prediction of spatial information and improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal fusion.

AB  - Remote sensing scene change detection (SCD) is to detect whether and what changes have occurred in the semantic category of corresponding scenes for a long time at the semantic level. This can provide detailed land use/land cover change information for Urban planning and environmental monitoring. Previous studies take regular patches divided by uniform grid sampling as scene units. This may lead to mosaic phenomenon, and use fixed Window to extract features, ignoring the multi-scale features of ground objects, while extracting scene features. To solve the problems, the multi-scale irregular bag of visual features (MIBVF) framework is proposed for high spatial resolution (HSR) imagery SCD. In this paper, we integrate image classification of the physical characteristics from remote sensing data with the socio-economic attributes from open source geographic data. Road network data is used to preserve the geological significance and semantic integrity of urban scenes, and multi-scale window sampling is used to solve the problem of different object sizes. To confirm the feasibility of the proposed method, experiments with multi-temporal images of the Pudong area in Shanghai indicate that the proposed method achieves a clearly higher change detection accuracy than current state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Exploring the Spatial-Temporal Dynamics of the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration Based on Night-Time Light Remote Sensing Technology
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the generation and development of urban areas is of great significance to improve our understanding of urbanization. However, it is still difficult to explore the spatial-temporal dynamic characteristics of urban agglomeration in the global scope. The easily accessible night-time light (NTL) data provide a window to observe the progress of human urban development from space. This study proposes a method based on NTL-Internet data. By combining the NTL center of gravity and the interregional link index model, it is used to detect the spatial expansion characteristics of the Yangtze river delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA), thus completing the comprehensive exploration of the urbanization in YRDUA. Results demonstrate that YRDUA, compared with the five major urban agglomerations in Europe, North America, and Asia, maintains the greatest urbanization potential. Further analysis shows that the urban area of Hefei has a huge development momentum. In addition, the urbanization level of YRDUA is easily affected by national planning, which conforms to the model of urban expansion, including infilling, edge expansion, and leapfrogging in different metropolitan areas. Finally, the link index model based on Internet data is utilized to quantitatively calculate the relevance of various cities in YRDUA. The results not only confirm the findings based on the NTL data but also explain that those metropolitan areas play a complementary and indivisible role in the urbanization process of YRDUA. This study will provide a framework for other research works to assess the spatial-temporal changes in urban characteristics, which is beyond the scope of a single city.

TI  - An Inherent Optical Properties Data Processing System for Achieving Consistent Ocean Color Products From Different Ocean Color Satellites
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - We used field measurements and multimission satellite data to evaluate how well an inherent optical properties (IOPs) data processing system performed at correcting the residual error of the atmospheric correction in satellite remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and how well the system simultaneously minimized intermission biases between different remote sensing systems. We developed the IOPs data processing system as a semianalytical algorithm called IDAS. Our results show that IDAS generates accurate and consistent IOPs products from two ocean color missions: Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Aqua (MODISA). Specifically, with "high-quality" SeaWiFS and MODISA R-rs data, IDAS provided temporally consistent IOPs products for the oligotrophic open ocean resulting in an annual mean intermission difference of less than 3%, which is significantly lower than what a quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) provided. We used IDAS to generate a long time series of b(b)(555) from the Northwest Atlantic Subtropical Gyre using SeaWiFS (1998 to 2002) and MODISA (2003 to 2017) images. Our results show that the IDAS-derived annual b(b)(555) decreased monotonically by 2.81% per decade from 1998 to 2017. Comparing the IDAS-generated annual trend for b(b)(555) to the same data processed with the QAA algorithm, we found that the QAA results differed because of impacts of the residual errors of the atmospheric correction and intermission biases. The differences in the annual trends existed despite the same temporal changing patterns of in situ particulate organic carbon existing in the Sargasso Sea and in the satellite chlorophyll-a concentration in the Northwest Atlantic Subtropical Gyre.

TI  - A comparative study of impervious surface extraction using Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy and efficiency of impervious surface extraction using different algorithms vary greatly, and algorithm applicability depends on the study area. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out a comparative study of different algorithms across different study areas. This study compared six impervious surface extraction indices (i.e., normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), index-based built-up index (IBI), biophysical composition index (BCI), combinational build-up index (CBI), combinational biophysical composition index (CBCI), and enhanced normalized difference impervious surfaces index (ENDISI)) using Sentinel-2 imagery in Fuxian Lake Basin, Shenzhen City, and Nanjing City. Three study areas with different geographical locations, climatic conditions and altitudes can test spatial heterogeneity of different indices. The results show that: (1) All indices could be used to extract impervious surface, but BCI and CBI were greatly disturbed by water bodies; (2) CBCI, IBI, and NDBI were influenced by study area, while ENDISI could be used across all three study areas; (3) ENDISI algorithm was the best among the six algorithms with a much higher separability degree and an overall accuracy of more than 91.00%. ENDISI can extract impervious surface quickly and accurately from Sentinel-2 imagery across different study areas, and can be well applied in the field of impervious surface change monitoring.

TI  - An Adaptive GaoFen-3 SAR Wind Field Retrieval Algorithm Based on Information Entropy
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chinese GaoFen-3 (GF-3) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery acquired in standard strip mode can capture streak features caused by wind over the sea surface, which are commonly known as wind streaks. To retrieve the sea surface wind field from a GF-3 SAR image, an adaptive wind retrieval algorithm based on information entropy is proposed in this paper. This algorithm can adaptively extract the optimal wavenumber range of each subimage based on maximum information entropy. After all subimages are processed for possible wind streak direction solutions, a circle median filter is used to determine the unique wind streak direction solution for each subimage. Twelve GF-3 standard strip SAR images are inverted to validate the proposed algorithm. The experiments show that when the GF-3 image data are compared to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis wind field data, the root mean square error of wind speed and direction retrieved by the algorithm are 1.29 m/s and 15.33 degrees, respectively, and when they are compared to the National Data Buoy Center buoy wind data, the mean absolute deviation errors of wind speed and direction are 0.57 m/s and 9.95 degrees, respectively. These comparisons demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively retrieve wind field information from GF-3 SAR images.

TI  - Adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy with simultaneous integrated boost to tumor bed with intensity modulated radiotherapy technique in elderly breast cancer patients
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy is the standard of care for breast cancer patients after partial mastectomy. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has been reported to reduce acute toxicities compared to conventional radiotherapy. IMRT with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique can deliver higher doses to tumor bed and irradiate whole breast with a lower dose level to shorten overall treatment duration. This study presents the long-term results of adjuvant IMRT with SIB in elderly breast cancer patients who received partial mastectomy.Methods: From January 2007 to January 2018, 93 elder breast cancer patients (>= 65-year-old) who received IMRT with SIB technique after partial mastectomy were reviewed retrospectively. The axillary areas were managed with either sentinel lymph node biopsies or axillary lymph node dissection. The dose to whole breast was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions in all patients and the dose to tumor bed was 61.6 to 66.4 Gy in 28 fractions. The primary end point is locoregional control. Secondary end points include: overall survival, breast cancer-specific survival, distant-metastases-free survival, disease-free survival, and acute and chronic toxicities.Results: The median follow-up was 56.1 months. One patient had ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, 3 patients had regional lymph node recurrence, and 9 patients had distant metastases. Death occurred in 5 patients, including 3 patients died of breast cancer progression. Five-year overall survival is 96.3% and 5-year locoregional recurrence-free survival is 96.4%. The 5-year breast cancer specific survival and 5-year distant metastases-free survival is 97.5% and 87.2%, respectively. Seven patients developed second primary cancer after RT. Eighty-one point seven percent patients had acute grade 1 dermatitis while 18.3% suffered from grade 2 dermatitis. The incidence of grade 1 pneumonitis and grade 1 stomatitis was 4.3% and 8.6%, respectively.Conclusions: Adjuvant IMRT with SIB technique is a safe and effective treatment strategy for elderly breast cancer patients after partial mastectomy.

AB  - Satellite and Aerial Image Time Series contain tremendous amounts of information of ground targets in space and time and have been commonly used in temporal pattern analysis tasks of ground targets. It has a wide range of applications including environment monitoring, urban planning, hazard assessment, etc. PV (photovoltaic) field construction monitoring is a new topic with increasing attentions. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective network based on LSTM (long short term memory) to detect PV field construction event. We build image time-series dataset from Sentinel-2 data of an Egypt PV field under construction to monitor the project progress. Compared with clustering model and CNNs (convolutional neural networks), our network achieves the better accuracy. Although low resolution and mislabeled pixels limit the accuracy cap, the simple network is still robust and easy to transfer for other applications.

TI  - A Novel Statistical Texture Feature for SAR Building Damage Assessment in Different Polarization Modes
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Texture features are important characteristics in distinguishing collapsed buildings and intact buildings. However, texture features currently used in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) building damage assessment are extracted following the methods of optical images directly, which do not consider the statistical feature of speckles and limit the accuracy improving. Therefore, a statistical texture feature-G0-para-was proposed to reflect the homogeneity of buildings in complex urban areas after a disaster. The G0-para is arising from the G(0) distribution of SAR image and used to distinguish collapse buildings and intact buildings. First, the G0-para is unified to satisfy different polarization data-single-/dual-/quad-/compact-polarization. Second, the distinguishing ability of G0-para is under comparison in single-/dual-/quad-/compact-polarization, through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve analysis. Then, collapsed buildings with RADARSAT-2 and ALOS-1 data are evaluated, selecting the optimal combinations of each mode and comparing with the preferable existing texture features. The results show that the statistical texture parameter-G0-para-is better than the variance of gray-level histogram and the contrast of gray level co-occurrence matrix in distinguishing intact buildings and collapsed ones and G0-para can be applied to single-/dual-/quad-/compact-polarimetric SAR data. For experimental data, VV and HH in single polarization, VH/VV and HH/HV in dual polarization, and hybrid mode in compact polarization are recommended when the best quad polarization is unavailable.

TI  - Automatic Building Extraction via Adaptive Iterative Segmentation With LiDAR Data and High Spatial Resolution Imagery Fusion
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extracting buildings from remotely sensed data is a fundamental task in many geospatial applications. However, this task is resistant to automation due to variability in building shapes and the environmental complexity surrounding buildings. To solve this problem, this article introduces a novel automatic building extraction method that integrates LiDAR data and high spatial resolution imagery using adaptive iterative segmentation and hierarchical overlay analysis based on data fusion. An adaptive iterative segmentation method overcomes over- and undersegmentation based on the globalized probability of boundary contour detection algorithm. A data-fusion-based hierarchical overlay analysis extracts building candidate regions based on segmentation results. A morphological operation optimizes a building candidate region to obtain final building results. Experiments were conducted on the international society for photogrammetry and remote sensing (ISPRS) Vaihingen benchmark dataset. The extracted building footprints were compared with those extracted using the state-of-the-art methods. Evaluation results show that the proposed method achieved the highest area-based quality compared to results from the other tested methods on the ISPRS website. A detailed comparison with four state-of-the-art methods shows that the proposed method requiring no samples achieves competitive extraction results. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved a completeness of 94.1%, a correctness of 90.3%, and a quality of 85.5% over the whole Vaihingen dataset, indicating that the method is robust, with great potential in practical applications.

TI  - Application of an Incomplete Landslide Inventory and One Class Classifier to Earthquake-Induced Landslide Susceptibility Mapping
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and effective evaluation of landslide susceptibility after earthquakes is critical for various applications, such as emergency rescue, land planning, and disaster prevention. Current research suffers from the lack of a complete landslide inventory and sample selection uncertainty issues. To solve these problems, this study presents a landslide susceptibility mapping model that integrates one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) and an incomplete landslide inventory, which was established with the aid of change detection from bi-temporal Landsat images. Wenchuan County is selected as the study area to test the performance of the proposed method. The proposed method is also compared with standard two-class SVM that selects a sample randomly. Experimental results show that OCSVM can achieve better performance than SVM when only an incomplete landslide inventory is available. The findings of this study can be applied to determine regional landslide susceptibility after earthquakes and provide an essential reference for emergency response.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - Quickly extracting the spatial extent of flooding is necessary for disaster analysis and rescue planning. A large number of researches utilized optical remote sensing data to extract surface water extent. However, current data products derived from optical sensors are difficult to meet the need of rapid flood monitoring due to cloud cover. Radar remote sensing supports 'all-weather' and 'day-and-night' water information extraction. Here, we proposed an automatic thresholding approach to extract flood coverage using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and prior classes information. Sixteen years of Landsat remote sensing image data were analyzed by Google earth engine (GEE) and prior classes of water and non-water were generated from composited dynamic water extent (cDSWE). We combined the distribution probability data of the prior classes of water with the extracting result to calculate the area of inundation. Two sites, Shouguang in Shandong province and Ji'an in Jiangxi province, were selected as representative areas for reservoir and floodplain. The results show that the overall classification accuracy for water is above 90%. Commission errors of water bodies ranged from 0% to 11.32%, and the omission errors ranged from 6.0% to 10.2%. Validations indicate the algorithm can effectively extract the spatial extent of reservoir or floodplain.

TI  - SAR Image Speckle Filtering With Context Covariance Matrix Formulation and Similarity Test
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Speckle filtering of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a necessary pre-processing for many subsequent applications. The challenge lies in how to adaptively select a sufficient number of similar pixels for an unbiased estimator generation. A novel SAR speckle filter is proposed and the core idea contains two aspects. Firstly, a context covariance matrix representation is developed within a local neighborhood to characterize the contexture information. Then, the Wishart statistic test is extended to examine the similarity of context covariance matrices. The extended similarity test indicator derived from context covariance matrices is verified to be sensitive for similar pixel localization. Thereafter, a sample averaging estimator is adopted based on the similar samples determined by the context covariance matrices similarity test (the proposed method is named as the CCM+SimiTest). Furthermore, a fast similarity test computation scheme is established which can handle large images smoothly even with a normal laptop. Intensive experimental studies with Radarsat-2, MiniSAR and ALOS-2 datasets are carried out. Comparisons with several state-of-the-art methods from both subjective and objective viewpoints demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Gap-Filling Method Producing Daily Cloud-Free NDSI Time Series
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference snow index (NDSI) is the most popular snow detection index. Due to cloud cover, it is difficult to produce complete and gap-free NDSI datasets. In this study, a spatial and temporal adaptive gap-filling method (STAGFM) is developed, whereby a weighted cloud-free similar pixel function is established for NDSI prediction. Cloud-covered NDSI gaps are filled by combining daily MOD10A1 and MYD10A1, and adjacent temporal composite is applied. STAGFM is implemented with long-time interval data to completely recover NDSI gaps. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer NDSI product data (from November 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018) of Northeast China are chosen as an example, and daily cloud-free NDSI time series over this period are produced. The method effectiveness was validated by cloud assumption and snow depth data, and the results show that STAGFM completely removes clouds and achieves an average correlation coefficient (r), root-mean-square error, and mean absolute error of 0.95, 0.08, and 0.06, respectively.

TI  - Post-mastectomy and post-breast conservation surgery pain syndrome: a review of etiologies, risk prediction, and trends in management
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) or breast conservation surgery (BCS) pain syndrome could be long-term and lead to disability and impairment on body and social function. The pain syndromes are not uncommon in breast cancer patients. It can affect social, psychological, physical and behavioral aspects of a patient. Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and psychological factors can all contribute to the development of pain syndromes. Axillary dissection is a strong predictor for pain development. Pain medications, ganglion blocks are typically given to the patient for management. Integrative medicine such as acupuncture and psychological management methods are promising modalities in the management arsenal. In this study, we summarized the up-to-date literature to elucidate the etiology, risk factors and management strategies for PMPS.

TI  - The spatial aspect of ecosystem services balance and its determinants
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, the balance of ecosystem services in urban agglomerations is increasingly influenced by coupled human and natural systems. Studying the balance of ecosystem services has been an essential part of research into global environmental change and sustainable development. However, the existing literature lacks research about the spatial dependence and spatial spillover effects of the ecosystem services balance; this reduces the effectiveness of formulating and implementing ecosystem conservation and land use policies, especially in developing countries. In this study, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature by examining the geographic variations and spatial determinants of the ecosystem services balance with an integrated spatial panel approach in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River Urban Agglomerations (MRYRUA), China. Land use/land cover change data derived from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper are employed to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution features of landscape pattern and the supply, demand, and balance of ecosystem services with landscape pattern metrics and a revised ecosystem services matrix method in the MRYRUA from 1995 to 2015. The results indicate that construction land in the MRYRUA increases continuously, while farmland decreases during that time. Counties with higher indices of ecosystem services supply and balance are concentrated primarily in mountainous areas, while indices of ecosystem services demand in the three smaller urban agglomerations, plains areas, surrounding counties of major cities, and along major traffic routes are higher. Spatial dependence and spatial spillover effects of the ecosystem services balance index are observed in the MRYRUA. Population density and road density are negatively associated with an ecosystem services balance. Landscape pattern metrics are also statistically significant-either positive or negative. Our findings suggest that the driving forces as well as the spillover effects should be taken into consideration in integrative ecosystem management and land use sustainability measures in urban agglomerations. These findings have important implications for urban planning and decision-making related to development and ecosystem services.

TI  - Fine Land Cover Classification in an Open Pit Mining Area Using Optimized Support Vector Machine and WorldView-3 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine land cover classification in an open pit mining area (LCCOM) is essential in analyzing the terrestrial environment. However, researchers have been focusing on obtaining coarse LCCOM while using high spatial resolution remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms. Although support vector machines (SVM) have been successfully used in the remote sensing community, achieving a high classification accuracy of fine LCCOM using SVM remains difficult because of two factors. One is the lack of significant features for efficiently describing unique terrestrial characteristics of open pit mining areas and another is the lack of an optimized strategy to obtain suitable SVM parameters. This study attempted to address these two issues. Firstly, a novel carbonate index that was based on WorldView-3 was proposed and introduced into the used feature set. Additionally, three optimization methods-genetic algorithm (GA), k-fold cross validation (CV), and particle swarm optimization (PSO)-were used for obtaining the optimization parameters of SVM. The results show that the carbonate index was effective for distinguishing the dumping ground from other open pit mining lands. Furthermore, the three optimization methods could significantly increase the overall classification accuracy (OA) of the fine LCCOM by 8.40%. CV significantly outperformed GA and PSO, and GA performed slightly better than PSO. CV was more suitable for most of the fine land cover types of crop land, and PSO for road and open pit mining lands. The results of an independent test set revealed that the optimized SVM models achieved significant improvements, with an average of 8.29%. Overall, the proposed strategy was effective for fine LCCOM.

TI  - A Model to Predict the Risk of Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer Based on Clinicopathological Characteristics
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) may cause lymphatic and nervous system side effects in patients with breast cancer. It is imperative to develop a model to evaluate the risk of sentinel lymph node metastasis to avoid unnecessary operation.Patients and Methods: A total of 2705 cases of female breast cancer patients enrolled in this retrospective study. We divided into the training group (SLNB group) and the validation group (ALND group) to analyze the relathionship between lymph node metastasis and clinical-pathological factors. Logistic regression analysis was performed to verify the variables which involved in ALN metastasis and established a prediction model. ROC curves were employed to evaluate the predictive ability of the model.Results: In the SLNB group, 9 variables, including pathological type, histological grade, tumor size, hormone receptor, HER-2, Ki-67, multifocality, and molecular subtypes, were related to breast cancer ALN metastasis. Clinically negative lymph nodes, favorable histologic type, tumor size <2 cm, and Ki-67 <15% were at very low risk for lymph node metastasis. The AUC of the validation group was 0.786.Conclusion: We successfully establish a mathematics model to predict lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. Axillary surgery should be individual with preoperative clinical characteristics, especially for patients with a longer life expectancy.

AB  - Ship navigation route planning in ice-covered sea is important for the safety of voyages. Sea ice channels, only in which vessels can pass through, change their topology as a result of the appearance and disappearance of sea ice. This paper provides a route planning method for ships that travel through the sea ice channels based on high resolution satellite images. The main processes of the method include: (1) Classification of sea ice using high resolution satellite images. (2) Extraction of sea ice channels topology based on the classification results. (3) Automated route planning based on the topology of sea ice channels. The key algorithms in the processes are presented in this paper. Practically, we used the aforementioned scheme to find the optimal path for voyages on several simulated missions. The simulations indicate that the proposed method is very practical and time-efficient for route planning with high resolution satellite images, while traditional pixel-based-algorithm is unable to cope with large-size images and the dynamic change of the sea ice. Moreover, the proposed method can take the advantages of the widely available high resolution satellite data and the near real-time sea ice observation. Therefore, the proposed method is potential to be applied on the navigation system for vessels travelling in the north and south polar regions.

TI  - A Novel Water Change Tracking Algorithm for Dynamic Mapping of Inland Water Using Time-Series Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-scale mapping of inland water is important for regional or global ecosystem monitoring; however, due to the spectral heterogeneity of inland water, large-scale dynamic mapping of these water bodies is usually challenging. In this article, we propose a water change tracking (WCT) algorithm, that uses only optical data, for accurate inland water mapping. Simultaneously, time-series of Landsat imagery are used as an example for illustrating the effectiveness of the method. First, time-series of Minimum Normalized Water Score (MNWS) images and corresponding 'bad-pixel' (cloud, ice and snow) masks were developed using time-series of Landsat imagery. Secondly, based on the MNWS time-series stack and 'bad-pixel' masks, time-series trajectories were formed to track changes in water bodies. A 30-m Dynamic Inland Water Body Map (DIWBM) of China was then produced to test the robustness of the WCT algorithm. Eight test sites were selected, and the water detection algorithms used in the Global 1 arc-second Water Body Map (G1WBM) and the function of mask (FMASK) were applied to our data to provide a comparison with the DIWBM results. The results indicated that the DIWBM gave a better performance of 96.20% against 85.91% for the G1WBM results and against 76.36% for the FMASK results. The DIWBM achieved user's accuracies of 98.36% and 92.53%, and producer's accuracies of 97.45% and 95.39% for permanent and temporary water, respectively. The proposed method was also better at identifying small water bodies. It is concluded, therefore, that the WCT algorithm is a promising method for large-scale dynamic inland water mapping.

AB  - Orbit prediction is the premise of consistency transfer calibration of space radiation standard. By using the satellite's orbital elements and the calibration sites information, the time and location of the two satellites are predicted with the joint observation constraints. The orbit prediction process of the consistency transfer calibration of space radiation standard is briefly introduced, and the satellite space position calculation method for orbit prediction is studied. By selecting TERRA and Landsat8 as the radiation reference satellites, GF-1, GF-2, GJ-1, etc. as the satellites to be calibrated and analyzing the constraints such as the observation time interval and the observation angle difference that limit the joint observation cross frequency, the analysis of the cross-matching constraint mechanism is done with the six calibration sites. The simulation and analysis results are helpful for the optimization design of the standard satellite orbit with the cross frequency of twice a month, and could provide technical support for the high-frequency and high-precision in-orbit radiometric calibration for Chinese satellites.

TI  - MONITORING OF SUGARCANE GROWTH BASED ON THE FUSED REMOTE SENSING NDVI SERIES AND GROUND SEEDING SURVEY
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study addressed the instability of clear-sky remote sensing data with high spatial resolution in sugarcane growing areas in southern China and the current inconsistency between traditional survey results and remote sensing results for seedling growth. Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and China land resources satellite (HJ-1 CCD) data were used to build high-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series using the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM). Agronomic indicators of sugarcane were obtained by field sampling and were used for determining the remote sensing monitoring index (NDVI) of sugarcane growth. The method provided satisfactory results for evaluating sugarcane growth, with accuracy exceeding 90%. Moreover, sugarcane growth monitoring in a wider area was highly correlated with yield per unit area.

TI  - Cloud and Cloud Shadow Detection Based on Multiscale 3D-CNN for High Resolution Multispectral Imagery
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud and cloud shadow detection is one of the most important tasks for optical remote sensing image preprocessing. It is not an easy task due to the variety and complexity of underlying surfaces, such as the low-albedo objects (water and mountain shadow) and the high-albedo objects (snow and ice). In this study, an end-to-end multiscale 3D-CNN method is proposed for cloud and cloud shadow detection in high resolution multispectral imagery. Specifically, a multiscale learning module is designed to extract cloud and cloud shadow contextual information of different levels. In order to make full use of band information, four band-combination images are inputted into the multiscale 3D-CNN. A joint spectral-spatial information of 3D-convolution layer is developed to fully explore the joint spatial-spectral correlations feature in the input data. Overall, in the experiments undertaken in this paper, the proposed method achieved a mean overall accuracy of 97.27 & x0025; for cloud detection, with a mean precision of 96.02 & x0025; and a mean recall of 95.86 & x0025;. For cloud shadow detection, the proposed method achieved a mean precision of 95.92 & x0025; and a mean recall of 92.86 & x0025;. Experimental results on two validation datasets (GF-1 WFV validation data and ZY-3 validation data) show that the proposed multiscale-3D-CNN method achieved good performance with limited spectral ranges.

TI  - Thick Clouds Removal From Multitemporal ZY-3 Satellite Images Using Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of clouds greatly reduces the ground information of high-resolution satellite data. In order to improve the utilization of high-resolution satellite data, this article presents a cloud removal method based on deep learning. This is the first end-to-end architecture that has great potential to detect and remove clouds from high-resolution satellite data. For cloud detection, a convolution neural network (CNN) architecture is used to detect them. For cloud removal, the content generation network, the texture generation network, and the spectrum generation network based on traditional CNN are proposed. The proposed CNN architecture can use multisource data (content, texture, and spectral) as an input of the unified framework. The results of both the simulated and real image experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and can effectively remove thick clouds, thin clouds, and cloud shadows. In addition, compared with some existing methods, the proposed method can recover land cover information accurately.

TI  - A robust visible near-infrared index for fire severity mapping in Arctic tundra ecosystems
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tundra fires are projected to increase with anthropogenic climate change, yet our ability to assess key wildfire metrics such as fire severity remains limited. The Normalized Bum Ratio (NBR) is the most commonly applied index for fire severity mapping. However, the computation of NBR depends on short-wave infrared (SWIR) data, which are not commonly available from historical and contemporary high-resolution (<= 4 m) optical imagery. The increasing availability of visible near-infrared (VNIR) measurements from proximal to spaceborne sensors/platforms has the potential to advance our understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of fire severity within tundra fires. Here we systematically assess the feasibility of using VNIR data for fire severity mapping in ten Alaskan tundra fires (cumulatively burned similar to 1700 km(2)). We compared the accuracy of 10 published VNIR-based fire indices using both uni-temporal (post-fire image) and bi-temporal (pre-fire and post-fire image difference) assessments against ground-based fire severity data (Composite Burn Index, CBI) at 109 tundra sites. The Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI) had the highest correspondence with CBI (R-2 = 0.77 uni-temporal; R-2 = 0.85 bi-temporal), with similar performance to NBR (R-2 = 0.77 uni-temporal; R-2 = 0.83 bi-temporal). Tundra vegetation types affected NBR but not GEMI, as SWIR reflectance was influenced to a greater extent in shrub than graminoid tundra. We applied GEMI to contemporary high-resolution (i.e. Quickbird 2) and historical meso-resolution imagery (i.e. Landsat Multispectral Scanner) to demonstrate the capability of GEMI for resolving fine-scale patterns of fire severity and extending fire severity archives. Results suggest that GEMI accurately captured the heterogeneous patterns of tundra fire severity across fire seasons, ecoregions, and vegetation types.

T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, there have been a significant influenza activity and emerging influenza strains in China, resulting in an increasing number of influenza virus infections and leading to public health concerns. The aims of this study were to identify the epidemiological and aetiological characteristics of influenza and establish seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models for forecasting the percentage of visits for influenza-like illness (ILI%) in urban and rural areas of Shenyang. Influenza surveillance data were obtained for ILI cases and influenza virus positivity from 18 sentinel hospitals. The SARIMA models were constructed to predict ILI% for January-December 2019. During 2010-2018, the influenza activity was higher in urban than in rural areas. The age distribution of ILI cases showed the highest rate in young children aged 0-4 years. Seasonal A/H3N2, influenza B virus and pandemic A/H1N1 continuously co-circulated in winter and spring seasons. In addition, the SARIMA (0, 1, 0) (0, 1, 2)(12) model for the urban area and the SARIMA (1, 1, 1) (1, 1, 0)(12) model for the rural area were appropriate for predicting influenza incidence. Our findings suggested that there were regional and seasonal distinctions of ILI activity in Shenyang. A co-epidemic pattern of influenza strains was evident in terms of seasonal influenza activity. Young children were more susceptible to influenza virus infection than adults. These results provide a reference for future influenza prevention and control strategies in the study area.

TI  - A multidecadal change analysis for irrigation ponds in Taoyuan, Taiwan, using multisource data
T2  - PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A multidecadal change analysis of the irrigation ponds in Taoyuan, Taiwan, was conducted by using multisource data including digitized ancient maps, declassified single-band CORONA satellite images, and multispectral SPOT images. Ponds and paddy fields are texturally similar but spectrally different, whereas the paddy fields and built-up are texturally different but spectrally similar. In this study, supervised land-use/land-cover classifications were conducted using four textural features derived from the single-band CORONA images and spectral features derived from SPOT images. Post-classification analysis revealed that the number of irrigation ponds in the study area decreased during the post-World War II farmland consolidation period (1945-1965) and the subsequent industrialization period (1970-2000). However, efforts on restoration of irrigation ponds in recent years have resulted in gradual increases in the number (9%) and total area (12%) of irrigation ponds in the study area.

TI  - Prognostic Factors and Clinical Outcomes of Clinical Node-Negative Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma Patients An Asian Single Institute Study
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Cutaneous malignant melanoma is notorious for its aggressive behavior and relatively poor outcome compared with other common skin malignancies. Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) accounts for at least 50% of melanoma in the Asian population and has a significantly lower survival rate. However, previous studies of the prognostic factors of melanoma-specific survival were all conducted from Western institutions. Here, we performed a retrospective analysis to investigate this issue. Methods Fifty patients diagnosed as having clinical node-negative cutaneous malignant melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between January 2007 and December 2018 were enrolled. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and lymph node characteristics were evaluated by chart review. Results Eighty-two percent of the melanoma in the sample population was ALM. Twelve patients (24.0%) presented at least 1 metastatic sentinel node, and the average number of retrieved SLNs was 3. Of the patients with positive SLNs who proceeded to completion lymph node dissection, only 2 (16.7%) had metastatic nonsentinel nodes (NSNs). The average follow-up time for all patients was 45 months. Recurrence and melanoma-specific death occurred in 21 patients (42.0%) and 15 patients (30.0%), respectively. Melanoma-specific survival was significantly lower in patients with ulcerative lesions (P= 0.005) and more metastatic SLNs (P= 0.036). The overall morbidity rate of completion lymph node dissection was 66.7%. Conclusions The presence of ulcerations and number of metastatic SLNs were the most important prognostic factors in this ALM-dominant Asian cohort. Among patients with clinically negative nodes but positive SLNs, less than one-fourth of patients harbored metastatic NSNs. Completion lymph node dissection carries a relatively high risk of morbidity; therefore, further research regarding predictors of positive NSNs in the Asian population is necessary.

TI  - Coal Mining Deformation Monitoring Using SBAS-InSAR and Offset Tracking: A Case Study of Yu County, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground deformation caused by underground coal mining has a large subsidence gradient and high nonlinearity and may cause continuous destruction to the surface structure after mining. A synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) is a powerful method for measuring and reconstructing the ground displacement. In this article, a total of 19 descending orbit X-band TerraSAR-X and 16 ascending orbit C-band Sentinel-1 images were integrated to monitor the ground displacement of a coal mining area in Yu County (Hebei Province, China) using a small baseline subset (SBAS-InSAR) algorithm. We found that the SBAS-InSAR technology can obtain reliable results in regions without a high gradient deformation by combining the deformation rates derived from both the TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 datasets. The maximum subsidence rate was approximately 125 mm/y between 17 June 2015 and 07 January 2016. In the case of large-gradient deformation, it is indeed difficult to obtain the mining-induced surface subsidence information accurately using the conventional multitemporal (MT-InSAR) techniques owing to the limitations of the SAR wavelength. In response to this problem, a new decision-making fusion method based on SBAS-InSAR and offset tracking was developed to monitor the large-gradient settlement in mining areas. The results show that the method developed compensates for the shortcomings of the traditional MT-InSAR technologies in the field of large-gradient deformation and obtains reliable results.

CL  - Barcelona, SPAIN
AB  - Pansharpening is widely used to increase the spatial resolution of a multispectral (MS) image by fusing with a panchromatic (PAN) image that has high-spatial resolution and the same scene. In this paper, the similarities of MS and PAN images in cartoon-texture space are exploited. The cartoon and texture components of an image always contain the global structure information and the locally-patterned information, respectively. Therefore, the global and local spatial details (i.e., high-order information) could be preserved well in the fused high-spatial resolution MS image after leveraging the similarities of these images. Pansharpening is formulated as the optimization problem with respect to the cartoon-texture similarities between the MS and the PAN images in this work based on the aforementioned observation. Specifically, cartoon similarity is determined through gradient sparsity and formulated as a total variation term, whereas texture similarity is described according to the low-rank property. The alternative direction multiplier method is used to solve the optimization problem. In the experiment, the Gaofen-1 satellite dataset is used to compare the proposed method with other classical pansharpening methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the comparison methods in terms of visual and quantitative qualities.

AB  - Remote sensing image analysis often involves image-level classification and/ or regression. One major problem with remote sensing data is that it is difficult to obtain abundant precise manual annotations to train fully supervised deep networks that have achieved great success in computer vision. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel general semisupervised framework (GSF) which only requires a small amount of annotated samples for training. It employs a new hybrid (dis)similarity to characterize different aspects of the images and realizes label propagation while fine-tuning a deep neural network (NN). As shown by the experimental results, GSF outperforms several supervised baselines and state-of-the-art semisupervised models in classification and regression.

AB  - Urban land use and land cover (LULC) change is the result of urban population economic activities and national policy. Determining the spatial pattern of land cover types in cities is of particular significance for regional sustainable development. To achieve a better understand the spatiotemporal patterns of land use types in Shenzhen, the fractal dimension of spatial distributions is adopted as an index of the complex evolution of urban land-use. In addition, a long-term sequences LULC datasets are collected to do analysis, which covers the period 1988-2015 by employing Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI of 1988, 1993, 1999, 2001, 2005, 2008, 2011, 2013 and 2015. Last but not least, a granularity analysis is adopted to study the structural changes of each land cover. After analysis, it can be observed that a significant self-similarity law exists in the Shenzhen city. From 1988 to 2015, the fractal dimension of grassland, waterbody and bare land exhibits a bi-fractals dimension. However, grassland and bare land structure show a bi-fractals trend which increases every year, and the waterbody bi-fractals trend is weakening. The development of urban land in this region experiences a process of a multiscale differential development with a hierarchical spatial system. These findings will provide some scientific references for the regional planning decisions on evolution of urban land use of Shenzhen city.

AB  - Open Data Cube is a potential solution to facilitate Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). This solution can provide improvement in the use of land change monitoring and disaster management from massive Earth Observation data. Sentinel Asia is Asia-Pacific regional initiative to join force Space Agencies and Disaster Management Agencies in DRR efforts. In its 10-Years Strategic Plan, a high priority task is to improve the efficiency of the operation. This task comprises of endeavors to introduce satellite imaging scheduling platform, and to establish cloud services. Additional measure is to consider utilization of Open Data Cube in data analysis. Taiwan Data Cube (TWDC) is therefore developed and applied to advance the development of key disaster information products and to promote the utilization of satellite-derived products by users. Data analysis under the disaster management cycle can be also addressed by TWDC to optimize the efficiency of generating value-added products in rapid disaster mapping. TWDC can further provide the co-operation and experience sharing with Sentinel Asia members in decision-making and management of DRR. This paper presents the progress of TWDC development and the application in Sentinel Asia.

TI  - THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION CHARACTERISTICS OF EVAPOTRANSPIRATION IN BEIJING BASED ON SEBAL
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology has the advantages of fast, accurate, large scale, visualization which provides important imformation on a variety of water resources issues. Estimation of large-scale evapotranspiration is the most difficult part of surface water conversion. With the development of quantitative remote sensing, an effective solution has been obtained. The objective of this study was to verify the rationality of the surface energy balance algorithm for land(SEBAL)model for estimating ET on urban scale and study the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of ET in Beijing. A total of 5 usable Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite images(February 2, May 28, August 16, October 3, December 22, 2016) were processed to estimate surface energy fluxes and generate ET distribution maps. Results from the SEBAL model were compared with the value calculated by Penman-Monteith(P-M) equation, and a very good correlation was found between the P-M equation and SEBAL-estimated ET with a good R-2 of 0.83 and a root-mean-square difference(RMSD) of 0.89 mm/d, Therefore, SEBAL has certain reliability for ET-estimation. Through the analysis of the 5 ET distribution maps, ET was higher in the northwest because of higher vegetation coverage, and it showed a very good progression of ET with time during the year of 2016, it was a single-peak distribution in a year, in various seasons, it was the highest in summer,followed by spring and autumn,while it was the lowest in winter. Conclusion can be made that underlying surface type is one of the most important factors for affecting ET distribution in Beijing, and different meteorological factors in various seasons are the main factors for affecting ET trend in a year.

TI  - Multitask Multisource Deep Correlation Filter for Remote Sensing Data Fusion
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the amount of remote sensing data increasing at an extremely fast pace, machine learning-based technique has been shown to perform superiorly in many applications. However, most of the existing methods in the real-time application are based on single modal image data. Although a few approaches use the different source images to represent the object via a fusion scheme, it may not be appropriate for multimodality information processing. In addition, these methods hardly benefit from the end-to-end network training due to the limitations of implementation difficulty and computational cost. In this article, we propose a multitask multisource information fusion method in the deep learning and correlation filter frameworks, which is applied to the fields of tracking and remote sensing data processing. The contribution of individual layers from different source data inside the deep network model is considered as a task. The proposed method can employ interdependencies among different sources data and tasks to learn deep network parameters and filters jointly to improve the performance. Second, we present an effective object appearance selection scheme to adaptively capture the object appearance changes via an effective deep learning network, then integrating information from different modalities to achieve information fusion. Different source information can provide robust performance from different aspects with complementary properties. Third, we further extend the proposed approach to the field of remote sensing for semantic labeling. The layers' sensitivity is utilized to verify the robustness of different classes. Extensively experiments on five benchmarks show that the proposed approach performs favorably against the state-of-the-arts.

AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is an indicator of the thermal condition at the ground-atmosphere interface. The MODIS LST products from Terra and Aqua satellites provide spatially continuous monitoring ground temperature. But it still has limitations at local scale due to atmospheric disturbances and the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of land surface. In this study, a novel algorithm based on Random Forest (RF) is proposed to reconstruct MODIS LST. The RF was trained using MOD11A1, MOD09A1 and MOD15A2 from Terra MODIS and digital elevation data from ASTER DEM as inputs. LST observations from The Tibetan Plateau Soil Moisture and Temperature Monitoring Network (TP-SMTMN) are used as target data. Experimental results indicate the algorithm can improve the estimation MODIS LST products from the aspects of accuracy and data availability.

AB  - This paper examines Lee In-hwi's In the Name of Laborer (2018), the most iconic work of the Korean labor novels. In political terms of the democratic labor union movement, the novel is a collection of aesthetic elements such as worldview or ethics, narrative structure, and figurativity of labor novels in both the 1980s and 1990s, and additionally is an updated version of them to the contemporary readers.The novel deals mainly with controversial issues of (dis)continuous Korean labor movements over one generation since 1987. In order to explore reflect such the history, the work is based on a true story of the Hyundai Motors union movement and casts in the lead role of the movement a Hyundai Motors worker, Yang Bongsoo, who fought against unfair dismissal and eventually committed suicide in 1995.The labor movement in the 1990s continues militant unionism―the cultural and political chracteristics of the 1980s labor movement. However, it has to be also in antagonism with the new currents of the 1990s emerging as liberalization, individualsim, globalization, and popularization in Korea. In this macroscopic context, the novel portrays ‘the cultural politics of labor movement martyrs,’ the relationship between the ‘ ‘sincerity regime’ and labor, and the process of cultural formation and disintegration of the Korean working class in the 1990s. These descriptions enables us to see things from another angle―not from the dominant view on the 1980s and 1990s. The 1990s labor movement unquestionably makes progress, but it turns out to have their limitations at the same time―under threat from liberalism-hegemony, it even changes into giant enterprise-dominated corporate-level labor union movement. Through Lee’s novel, accordingly, we can thoroughly investigate the remarkable transition from the 1980s to the 1990s which also serves as an example of transitional Chronotope in a study of literature/culture.

M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - This article questions the reemergence of scientific antireligious activist movements in the last centuries. Considering intellectual and political aspects of scientific materialism, Monist and New Atheism movements' programs as well as the historical context of their development a number of structural similarities is being drawn. Notably, the Darwinian theory of evolution in monistic dysteleological interpretation represents the main rhetoric weapon of atheistic science popularizers against opponents. Also, science is employed as a tool of 'freethought' communities' formation and campaigning for irreligious rights and against creationism's intellectual expansion. However, if earlier atheistic science popularizers were quite explicit on their world change ambition, contemporaries show no interest to author some new science-inspired worldview systems or political projects.

T2  - ArrayExpress Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been successful in yielding >60 loci for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). However, it is known that GWAS just reports genomic signals and not necessarily the precise localization of culprit genes, with eQTL efforts only able to infer causality to a minority of such loci. Thus, we sought to carry out physical and direct variant to gene mapping by integrating results from high-throughput chromatin conformation capture and ATAC-seq assays. This experiment refers to the ATAC-seq part of our work. To determine informative proxy SNPs for each of the SLE GWAS sentinel loci, we generated ATAC-seq open chromatin maps for primary human T Follicular Helper (TFH) cells from tonsils of healthy volunteers (3 biological replicates), a model relevant to SLE as TFH operate upstream of the activation of pathogenic autoantibody-producing B cells during the disease. We also generated open chromatin maps for naive CD4-positive helper T cells (3 biological replicates).

AB  - This article deals with the "non-poetry" problem in modern Sinophone Malaysian poetry by examining two cases during the 1970's and 80's: poems by You Chuan, and problems in modern Sinophone Malaysian poetry exposed by You Chuan's reorientations of writing style. These two cases of poetry and non-poetry seem to actually share a same ideological basis and similar worldview. Both cases reflect the influence of essay on poetry writing. Essays and non-poetic poems are the two most productive genres in Sinophone Malaysian literature. In addition to being non-poetic, they are usually cliches representing a turning loose of emotion. These writing styles probably reflect the poor quality, and dilemma of Chinese Malaysian culture.Y

AB  - Modern education on all its levels develops and functions within the framework of intensive world integration processes that create multicultural setting. The efficiency of intercultural communication is determined by the ability of individuals with different national, ethnic etc backgrounds to understand, decode and uncover meaning of different cultural phenomena.Various cultural codes become a barrier in education. They construct a large and flexible body of meaningful generalizations represented as symbols. The inability to implement symbolic methods and decoding tools leads to misunderstanding of relevant information. Misunderstanding brings either denial or false perception that is created in accordance with one's worldview.That is why teaching students to make correct assumptions about cultural phenomena is crucial to overcome cultural barriers in education. We combine two different approaches to this problem (semiotic and cross-cultural) in teaching one course ("Social psychology") to undergraduate students.The semiotic approach is aimed at enabling students to create a mental chart that allows them to use a system of cognitive strategies relevant to different cultures. It helps to build the logic of studying an object according to the context of its functioning. As part of the semiotic approach students learn various ways to code information and discover that different cultures may use externally similar coding tools but give different meaning to the symbols. Types of symbols and ideograms as well as the degree of their involvement in practice are determined by psychological characteristics of cultures as different cultural languages represent the specifics of cognitive functions externalized in sensory and operational activity models.The cross-cultural approach dwells, first, on teaching students to differentiate between personal and cultural phenomena (mainly social practices) and make correct assumptions accordingly. Secondly, it focuses on uncovering cultural values and implementing universal constructs to compare the aforementioned phenomena. Students were taught culture dimensions theory and learned to analyze social practices from different cultures using culture dimensions.Empirical research conducted by the authors shows the efficiency of implementing two approaches to overcome intercultural barriers in education.

AB  - This paper presents an application of reconstructing Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series to extract the water area in the lowland region of the Mekong River. Firstly, MODIS13A1 EVI time series with land surface reflectance 16day and 500 m spatial resolution is collected from 2000 to 2017, resulting total of 411 images. Then, these images are used for reconstructing EVI time-series by using the Whittaker smoother method on the Google Earth Engine. Next, the water area in each image is computed based on the smooth EVI value. The results showed that the extracting water areas in year 2000 was in line with the observed water elevation at Tan Chau station (for the Mekong Delta) and at Phnom Penh station (for the Cambodian region). The correlation coefficient between the extracting water area and water elevation equals to 0.885 for the Mekong Delta while its value is 0.924 for the Cambodian region. The extracting water area from MODIS13A1 EVI for the lowland region of the Mekong River can be used for assessment of inundated area resulting from different flow conditions as well as for studying inundation processes in the lowland region of the Mekong River when using hydrodynamic models.

AB  - We introduce a new SAR based flood extent mapping algorithm enabling systematic and automatic monitoring of water bodies at large scale in near real time. The algorithm is both efficient and robust, especially in areas where flood events are not sporadic but long lasting (e.g. monsoon-related floods). It is based on the regular processing of subsequently acquired pairs of Sentinel-1 images. The algorithm has been developed in the framework of the ESA-funded e-DRIFT project, with the aim to respond to the needs of the disaster risk financing sector in Southeast Asia. The approach has been validated after intensive testing over different areas of interest in South East Asia i.e. Myanmar and Laos, where risks associated with flooding are currently not well-known. Moreover, the algorithm is implemented on a virtual platform that efficiently handles large collections of Sentinel-1 data from all the orbits and dates available over areas of interest affected by floods. The output of this near real-time system are reliable and useful input data for the parametric modelling carried out by the (re-)insurance companies, allowing them to better anticipate risk of natural disasters.

AB  - In this paper, we present a fully automatic algorithm capable of mapping floodwater in urban areas using 20 m Sentinel-1 SAR data. It is composed of a two-steps approach that first uses the SAR data to identify buildings and then takes advantage of the Interferometric SAR coherence feature from both co- and cross-polarizations to detect the presence of floodwater in urbanized areas. The preliminary detection of buildings is a pre-requisite for classifying them as flooded based on the InSAR coherence temporal decrease when water is present in urban areas, given that in general buildings show a strong temporal coherence. In addition, the short temporal and perpendicular baselines of the intereferomeric Sentinel-1 image acquisitions is an advantage for this kind of approach. The algorithm is applied to Sentinel-1 images acquired during the major flood event that hit Jakarta (Indonesia) in January 2020.

AB  - We present NeMO-Net, the first open-source fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) and interactive learning and training software aimed at assessing the present and past dynamics of shallow marine systems through habitat mapping into geomorphological (9 classes) and biological classes (22 classes). Shallow marine systems, particularly coral reefs, are under significant pressures due to climate change, ocean acidification, and other anthropogenic pressures, leading to rapid, often devastating changes, in these fragile and diverse ecosystems. Historically, remote sensing of shallow marine habitats has been limited to meter-scale imagery due to the optical effects of ocean wave distortion, refraction, and optical attenuation. NeMO-Net combines 3D cm-scale distortion-free imagery captured using NASA's airborne FluidCam and fluid lensing remote sensing technology with low resolution airborne and spaceborne datasets of varying spatial resolutions, spectral spaces, calibrations, and temporal cadence in a supercomputer-based deep learning framework. NeMO-Net augments and improves the benthic habitat classification accuracy of low-resolution datasets across large geographic and temporal scales using high-resolution training data from FluidCam.NeMO-Net's FCNN uses ResNet and RefineNet to perform semantic segmentation and cloud masking of remote sensing imagery of shallow marine systems from drones, manned aircraft, and satellites, including FluidCam, WorldView, Planet, Sentinel, and Landsat. Deep Laplacian Pyramid Super-Resolution Networks (LapSRN) alongside Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANNs) are used to augment low resolution imagery with high resolution drone-based datasets as well as recognize domain-invariant features across multiple instruments to achieve high classification accuracies, ameliorating inter-sensor spatial, spectral and temporal heterogeneities.An online active learning and citizen science application is used to allows users to provide interactive training data for NeMO-Net in 2D and 3D, fully integrated within an active learning framework. Preliminary results from a test case in Fiji demonstrate 9-class classification accuracy exceeding 84%.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this project was to implement and evaluate the integration of a computer-based virtual simulation program into a community clinical course as an alternative or complement to conventional clinical with agencies or neighbourhoods. Securing quality community health clinical opportunities for undergraduate nursing students remains challenging. In addition, evidence of a theory-practice gap in community clinical education, particularly in non-traditional settings, suggests that nurse educators need to adopt different pedagogies to ensure that students will gain competencies necessary to practice community/population health nursing. In response, we piloted the use of Sentinel City (R) 3.0, a virtual reality simulation program.Method: A 5-point Likert-style questionnaire was administered to students randomly assigned to different clinical placements.Results: Results indicated that there were no learning outcomes in which students in Sentinel City (R) 3.0 reported percentages lower than students in agencies or geographical neighbourhoods. When there were statistically significant differences, students engaged in Sentinel City (R) 3.0 performed better than students in other experiences.Conclusion: We recommend further exploration of multi-contextual pedagogies for community clinical.

AB  - This study explored the possibility to optimize irrigation scheduling through the integrated use of crop data derived from multispectral satellite imagery and an agro-hydrological model. The study was conducted with reference to an industrial tomato crop in an irrigated open field. Three methods for estimating irrigation needs were compared: estimates obtained with a calibrated AquaCrop model; estimates obtained by applying the AquaCrop model with sequential assimilation of crop cover retrieved from multispectral images; estimates obtained with the IRRISAT irrigation advisory service, based only crop state parameters retrieved from satellite multispectral images. The results confirm the usefulness of integrating agro-hydrological models and satellite observations to improve the prediction of crop water requirements. The agro-hydrological model offers more reliable estimates of the water irrigation requirements in the early stages of crop development, being able to simulate the effect of evaporative losses from the soil, when the canopy cover is still small. On the other hand, satellite data allows reducing model simulation errors in the most advanced stages of crop development and during senescence.

AB  - With the rapid development of media environment and contents production technology, the era of multi-platform convergence transmedia has emerged, and communication method through trans media contents has attracted attention. Transmedia content refers to the concept of translating individual content into multi-platforms, which creates an expanded worldview of convergence. In addition, the interaction generated in this process is very important and difficult to control in the progress of the content. In this paper, we focused on the combination of transmedia content and gamification concept as a solution, and based on the 'MDA framework' which is a theoretical system of analysis and approach for implementing game design, We looked at the structure. It is expected that a review of the fundamental game design structure, which establishes a prediction system of value and fun experiences through the balance of technology and emotions, will be helpful as a basis for designing trans media contents.

AB  - This study examines how the image of the sea in a Ocean Film has changed with the times through the sign of maritime nature. The film is accompanied by social rules and commercial attributes from birth. So the audience needs to be thoroughly analyzed. The genre is a device that can sense the universal water level in the audience society of that era. Ocean Film explain the times through sea images. Therefore, the Ocean Film does not simply express the sea image, but philosophically explains it.The research interest is also here. It is to see how the audience understands and consumes Ocean Film. The contemporary film reflects the thinking of the day. Ocean Film Reflects the social and cultural consciousness and ideology of the era. This is confirmed by applying it to Kim Soo-yong’s <The Seashore Village>(1965) and Kim Han-min’s <The Admiral: Roaring Currents>(2014).The 1960s began with 419 and 516. The 1960s is a meaningful year of political, economic, and social upheaval in the modern history of Republic of Korea. The sea image of <The Seashore Village> follows the fateful worldview, passively consistent as the state leads. And <The Admiral: Roaring Currents>, the situation of Joseon is the same as the internal and external situation of Korea in 2014. The trauma that the audience feels is connected to the image of the sea. Through this, we consider how the sea image has changed over time. And now, I want to provide an opportunity to look into our society.For these studies First, we will first check the maritime characteristics of Korean films and the genre concepts of Ocean Film. Second, examine the acts of the semantic meaning expressed by the sea image. In addition, the changes in the sea image seen in the two works are analyzed. Through this, I would like to raise the status of Ocean films and provide an opportunity to confirm its value.

TI  - Changes in Underwater Visibility Due to Turbidity Associated with Typhoon Soulik
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes of visibility in the water column off the southern coast of Korea due to the effects of Typhoon Soulik (Aug. 22-23, 2018; 955 hPa; maximum wind speed, 40 m/s) were investigated. The beam attenuation coefficient (BAC) was measured using a transmissometer (C-Star; Wet Labs, Inc.), and visibility range was calculated using the conversion method employed by the US Navy. For comparison and verification of the data, a conductivity-depth-temperature (CTD) probe (SBE19 Plus; Sea-Bird Scientific) equipped with optical backscatter and fluorescence sensors was deployed simultaneously with the transmissometer. The Secchi depth was also estimated during each cast to improve accuracy. The Secchi depth deviated by up to 20% from the calculated visibility range. Additionally, during continuous observation of BAC from the seafloor upward, a light source (color temperature: 6,500 K) was installed on a 5-m bar with length markings, and a video camera recorded changes in visibility. Daily Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite data were used to identify changes in surface visibility in the study area. Before the typhoon, the visibility in the water column was in the range 25-30 m. Near the seafloor, visibility approached 0 m due to a 3-6-m turbidity current. The visibility distance was significantly shorter in the bottom layers based on video images. Four days after Typhoon Soulik had passed over the Korean Peninsula, the visibility was in the range 2.6- 9.0 m in the upper layers of the water column, increasing gradually to 11 m in the middle layers. The size of the turbid bottom current did not differ significantly between observations before and after the typhoon. Surface visibility calculated from satellite data also decreased by 20-30% compared to that before the typhoon.

AB  - Purpose: To analyze the effects of average length of stay (ALOS) on RN staffing. Methods: Public data of patient surveys collected 8 times between 1996 and 2016 were analyzed. The sample included 2,408,669 discharged patients from 2,266 general hospitals. The ALOS for each hospital was computed by dividing the sum of inpatient days by the number of discharges. RN staffing was defined as the number of RNs per 100 inpatients. ALOS was transformed into base-2 logarithmic values for regression analysis. Results: ALOS decreased from 13.3 to 9.6 days. Large hospitals in the capital region had the greatest reduction, from 15.7 to 7.4 days. RN staffing increased from 32.7 to 54.8 RNs per 100 patients. ALOS had an inverse relationship with RN staffing. Controlling for other factors, a 50% reduction in ALOS was associated with increases in RN staffing by 12.18 and 13.72 RNs per 100 inpatients in large hospitals in the capital region and elsewhere, respectively. Conclusion: Hospitals may have to increase staffing to respond to the increased workload resulting from the shortened ALOS. It remains uncertain whether such increases in staffing were sufficient for the increased workload. Changes in ALOS should be taken into account when determining appropriate staffing.

T2  - 동학학보
M3  - research-article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the profound politico-philosophical implications of the holistic new paradigm represented by the quantum mechanical worldview and its practical application. First, we will take a glance at the changes of scientific methodology, which is an epistemological framework to understand the world, and then examine the nature and characteristics of the new paradigm, its politico-philosophical implications, and the limitations of practical application, and further explore the ways to overcome the limitations from the perspective of Donghak.The politico-philosophical implications of the new paradigm can be seen in two major aspects: the great transition to life politics and life culture, and the great historical transition of civilization to the era of consilience. Only by the politics of the new paradigm based on the holistic nature of life can biopolitical division be overcome and a great transition to true life politics and life culture be made possible. Without understanding the fact that life is not just an individualized material life, but a spirituality based on nonseparability and nonduality, true insight into the era of great consilience cannot arise.The limitation of the practical application of the new paradigm comes from the failure to see the mechanism of consilience and thus to gain insight into the oneness of life, the essence of the universe. The new paradigm is essentially nonseparable and nondual, so it is difficult to apply it in practice if our worldview, way of thinking and value system fail to live up to it. The triad structure of the Donghak ‘Si’ allows us to overcome the limitations of practical application of the new paradigm by perceiving the mechanism of consilience, thereby revealing that all things are the manifestation of Oneness and unfolding practical thoughts on the oneness of life.

AB  - In general, It is told that there is no creation story by personal God in the chinese worldview and on the contrary, the cosmogony with self-generated ultimate reality, that is Dao was chosen to explain the generic process of the cosmos. However Daoistic explanation of generic process of universe and myriad things can not be classified into cosmogony type with self-generated ultimate reality alone. At least, Daoist scriptures of Southern and Northern Dynasties presented clearly the creation of universe by persona God as like God of Lord Lao(老君) or Celestial Worthy of Premordial Beginning(元始天尊).This paper is for elucidation the creation theory of Daoism in various scriptures of the Northern and Southern Dynasties period, and Tang Dynasty in China. Another purpose of this research is to identify the characteristics of Daoistic doctrines related to the creation theory of Daoism. Especially, this paper focuses on the meaning and roles of the supreme god as a personal creator in the Taoist conflict with Buddhism.

AB  - The issues associated with “speed” and “emotion” that heated up the left-wing literary world at the very beginning of 1928. They caused an explosive reaction while asking fundamental questions about revolutionary literature. “Contemporary Chinese Literature and Social Life”, written by Jian Guang Ci, triggered this dispute. The article defined revolution as an emotional state rather than a “speed battle”. It is meaningful to review it since it put the brakes on the revolution as an ideology and the movements followed the “Grant recit”.Here, we can capture another aspect of the revolution that cannot be returned by only using rationality. The revolution does not end by changing everything upside down at one stroke, but it should continue until it incapacitates the old habits by cultivating the sentiment continuously. Is that the reason? Jiang Guang Ci’s gaze reaches to the abyss through the e-motion towards the e-out. In the “dimension of affection”, the revolution is implied by the changes in “trust” and “sympathy” deep down inside where numerous clues of emotion are condensed. “Additionally, pluralistic values and worldviews exist in the space where these emotions operate and conflicts between them are inevitable. Therefore, these conflicts are always associated with emotional elements such as commitment, attachment, involvement, and loyalty to a value or a worldview. It does not try to divide politics into ‘public ration’ and ‘private emotion’ dichotomically. Moreover, it supports the idea that we cannot understand it in this way.” “The knowledge of revolution emotion”, a process to find clues of feelings regarding the revolution in a myriad of emotions and cultivate them appropriately, is thus attrition warfare rather than temporary entertainment or collective excitement. While living in the era of a blitzkrieg where the time requiring for maturity cannot be guaranteed, the diagnosis of Jiang Guang Ci is extremely interesting. It will, of course, be established as another “professional literature”, different from the established professional literature. This article aims to discuss how Jiang Guang Ci’s attempt led to a revolutionary situation, separated from the conventional literary world, using individual works.

AB  - This study aims to examine how the concept of energy thermodynamics is reflected in 19th century English fiction. The concepts of the energy thermodynamics of modern physicists such as Robert von Meyer, Herman von Helmholtz, James Joule, William Thompson, and Rudolf Clausius were so well projected into Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, Charles Dickens’s The Bleak House, Samuel Butler’s Erewhon, Robert Stevenson’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and H. G. Wells’ Time Machine that a close examination of the works would enable us to explore how the concepts shaped the world view of the time as well as how they changed the social and cultural order in the contemporary society. The reason why the concepts of physics were represented in literature is that it had a great influence on the culture and economy as well. Thus, naturally, the writers as the cultured and the intellectuals reflected the concepts of energy thermodynamics in their works at the ontological and epistemological levels. Therefore, the study of the thermodynamics in literature can be an important means to understand the spirit of the times. The discourse of the thermodynamic energy shows how the intellectuals in the nineteenth century began to perceive the world beyond religion through the eyes of science. In that sense, this study can contribute to understanding better the social and cultural orders as well as the people’s worldview of the nineteenth century world.

TI  - Mode of presentation and skin thickening on ultrasound may predict nodal burden in breast cancer patients with a positive axillary core biopsy
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: A number of pre-operative factors predicting nodal burden in females with breast cancer have recently been identified. The aim of this study is to assess if these factors independently influence nodal burden in females with a positive axillary core biopsy.Methods: All node positive patients detected on axillary core biopsy were identified in our cancer audit database, Mode of presentation, age, core tumour grade, core tumour type, ER and HER2 status were evaluated. Tumours were assessed for ultrasound size, distance of tumour-to-skin, presence of invasion of skin and diffuse skin thickening. Axillary lymph nodes were assessed for cortical thickness and presence of ultrasound replaced nodes. Statistical significance was ascertained using univariate logistic regression. A predictive model was produced following a multiple logistic regression model incorporating cross-validation and assessed using receiving operating characteristic curve.Results: 115 patients' data were analysed. Patients referred because of symptoms (70% vs 38%, p = 0.005), and those with ultrasound skin thickening (87% vs 59%, p = 0.055) have higher nodal burden than those referred from screening or without skin thickening. These factors were significant after multivariate analysis. The final predictive model included mode of presentation, ultrasound tumour size, cortical thickness and presence of ultrasound skin thickening. The area under curve is 0.77.Conclusion: We have shown that mode of presentation and ultrasound skin thickening are independent predictors of high nodal burden at surgery. A model has been developed to predict nodal burden pre-operatively, which may lead to avoidance of axillary node clearance in patients with lower nodal burden.Advances In knowledge: Method of presentation and skin involvement/proximity to skin by the primary tumour are known to influence outcome and nodal involvement respectively but have not been studied with regard to nodal burden. We have shown that mode of presentation and skin thickening at ultrasound are independent predictors of high nodal burden at surgery.

AB  - Recently, SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is being highlighted as a solution to the coarse spatial resolution of remote sensing data in water resources research field. Spatial resolution up to 10 m of SAR backscattering coefficient has facilitated more elaborate analyses of the spatial distribution of soil moisture, compared to existing satellite-based coarse resolution (>10 km) soil moisture data. It is essential, however, to multilaterally analyze how various hydrological and environmental factors affect the backscattering coefficient, to utilize the data. In this study, soil moisture estimated by WCM (Water Cloud Model) and linear regression is compared with in-situ soil moisture data at 5 soil moisture observatories in the Korean peninsula. WCM shows suitable estimates for observing instant changes in soil moisture. However, it needs to be adjusted in terms of errors. Soil moisture estimated from linear regression shows a stable error range, but it cannot capture instant changes. The result also shows that the effect of soil moisture on backscattering coefficients differs greatly by land cover, distribution of vegetation, and water content of vegetation, hence that there’re still limitations to apply preexisting models directly. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze variable effects from different environments and establish suitable soil moisture model, to apply SAR to water resources fields in Korea.

AB  - Monitoring the urban environmental changes caused by the urban regeneration project is necessary for evaluating the effect of the various types of urban regeneration projects that have been carried out in Seoul, South Korea. However, there is few available data and professional expert for evaluating the effect of these urban regeneration projects. This research evaluated the effect of the construction of rainwater village in Jangwi-dong area, constructed through the Seoul urban regeneration project, by utilizing the land surface temperatures derived from the multi-temporal Landsat-8 satellite images through the following steps. In the first step, the land surface temperature images were generated using the multispectral bands of the Landsat-8 satellite images. In the final step, the effect of constructing the rainwater villages was assessed by calculating the seasonal LST statistics for Jangwi-dong area, its neighbor area and entire Seoul area. The experimental results led the following conclusion: the construction of rainwater villages did not have the significant effect on the land surface temperature changes in Jangwi-dong area.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland biomass is a key biophysical metrics to characterize grassland growth and a sensitive indicator of environmental change and ecological functioning. The quantification and timely information on aboveground biomass (AGB) of grassland are crucial for the sustainable use and management of grassland resources. In this study, AGB for main grassland types in the North Tibet was analyzed using field measurements and climatic controls of variations of aboveground biomass were explored, and the general estimate models for grassland AGB were further developed based on the relationships between MODIS vegetation indices (VIs) and the field measurements. The results indicated that alpine swamp meadow has the highest AGB of 356.8 g/m(2) on average, followed by temperate steppe (64.5 g/m(2)) and alpine meadow (61.6 g/m(2)), and AGB of alpine steppe is lowest at 48.9 g/m(2). Precipitation is main climate factor impacting variations of grassland AGB. The exponential relationships existed between grassland AGB and MODIS VIs and exponential models based on MODIS NDVI were found to be optimum for monitoring and estimating grassland AGB. Study also showed that AGB in the North Tibet spatially decreases from southeast to northwest, which is above 100 g/m(2) in the southeast and is below 20 g/m(2) in the northwest.

TI  - Satellite-Based Water Quality Mapping from Sequential Simulation with Parameter Outlier Removal
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite-based regression model provides the data model that identifies water quality for inland and coastal waters. However, the satellite regression usually depends on the selection of observation, satellite data, and model type. A resampling simulation technique, such as sequential simulation using geographically weighted regression (GWR simulation), can be applied in generating multiple realizations for water quality estimation to reduce the sampling effect and consider spatial heterogeneity. Traditional models often result in considerable underestimation in extreme observations. The GWR simulation provides the best goodness of fit and spatial varying relationship between observed water quality and remote sensing considering parameter outlier and noise removal for parameter stability. This simulation model can increase the sampling diversity from various observations and reduce the neighboring effects of observations using outlier and noise removal. The model that handles spatial uncertainty and heterogeneity is a novel tool for inferring the characteristics of water quality from a series of sample subsets.

TI  - Spatial Heterogeneity of Winter Wheat Yield and Its Determinants in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding spatial differences of crop yields and quantitatively exploring the relationship between crop yields and influencing factors are of great significance in increasing regional crop yields, promoting sustainable development of regional agriculture and ensuring regional food security. This study investigates spatial heterogeneity of winter wheat yield and its determinants in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) region. The spatial pattern of winter wheat in 2015 was mapped through time series similarity analysis. Winter wheat yield was estimated by integrating phenological information into yield model, and cross-validation was performed using actual yield data. The geographical detector method was used to analyze determinants influencing winter wheat yield. This study concluded that the overall classification accuracy for winter wheat is 88.09%. The estimated yield agreed with actual yield, with R-2 value of 0.74 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.02 t ha(-1). Cumulative temperature, soil salinity and their interactions were key determinants affecting winter wheat yield. Several measures are recommended to ensure sustainable crop production in the YRD region, including improving irrigation and drainage systems to reduce soil salinity, selecting salt-tolerant winter wheat varieties, and improving agronomy techniques to extend effective cumulative temperature.

TI  - The Use of Test-negative Controls to Monitor Vaccine Effectiveness A Systematic Review of Methodology
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The test-negative design is an increasingly popular approach for estimating vaccine effectiveness (VE) due to its efficiency. This review aims to examine published test-negative design studies of VE and to explore similarities and differences in methodological choices for different diseases and vaccines. Methods: We conducted a systematic search on PubMed, Web of Science, and Medline, for studies reporting the effectiveness of any vaccines using a test-negative design. We screened titles and abstracts and reviewed full texts to identify relevant articles. We created a standardized form for each included article to extract information on the pathogen of interest, vaccine(s) being evaluated, study setting, clinical case definition, choices of cases and controls, and statistical approaches used to estimate VE. Results: We identified a total of 348 articles, including studies on VE against influenza virus (n = 253), rotavirus (n = 48), pneumococcus (n = 24), and nine other pathogens. Clinical case definitions used to enroll patients were similar by pathogens of interest but the sets of symptoms that defined them varied substantially. Controls could be those testing negative for the pathogen of interest, those testing positive for nonvaccine type of the pathogen of interest, or a subset of those testing positive for alternative pathogens. Most studies controlled for age, calendar time, and comorbidities. Conclusions: Our review highlights similarities and differences in the application of the test-negative design that deserve further examination. If vaccination reduces disease severity in breakthrough infections, particular care must be taken in interpreting vaccine effectiveness estimates from test-negative design studies.

TI  - Integrated Remote Sensing and GIS Based Approach for Sustainable Development of Khirthar National Park
T2  - Sindh University Research Journal -Science Series
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainable management and planning for the conservation of National Park is extremely important and to assess the changes in National Park's biodiversity, natural eco-system and ground surface features by gathering larger area information through integrated remote sensing and GIS techniques. Multi-Spectral remotely sensed satellite data has been implemented in this study to assess change in Khirthar National Park where human influence is slowly increasing due to which agriculture is also expanding and will ultimately restrict the accommodations of wildlife and remove the rare natural vegetation species in National Park. This research study carried filed survey, analyzes the vegetation change using NIR and RED band of Land sat imagery to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)and extracted the Land Surface Temperature (LST) using thermal band to define variations in climate at Khirthar National Park (KNP). NDVI and LST was calculated to assess decadal change at KNP by acquiring satellite images of Land sat 5 TM (1992, 2000 and 2010) and Lands at 8 OLI&TIRS (2018).The results of this research study and field survey revealed that NDVI and LST has been increased during study period, the high NDVI values of 1992, 2001, 2010 and 2018 results were 0.31, 0.38, 0.42 and 0.45. The high temperature during the study time span results of 1992, 2001, 2010 and 2018 were 49 degrees C, 47.5 degrees C, 51 degrees C and 56 degrees C. This increase of vegetation is not just because of the natural vegetation but it is mainly due to increase of agriculture. Therefore the sustainable management is highly recommended for such natural heritage to prevent further loss of biodiversity and natural eco-system.

M3  - research-article
AB  - In this study, I will analyze the light and colors expression in Ivan Bunin’s creative world and recognize the aesthetic meaning. In Russia, many researchers are interested in the expression of light and color in Bunin’s works. It is hoped that this study will provide a new perspective to understand Bunin's creative way, style and worldview.Bunin had a special interest in color throughout his life and loved painting. In particular, Bunin was interested in colors and paintings and wanted to embody the principles of paintings in his works by P. А. Nilus’s great influence.There are several professional painters in Bunin’s works, but the author pays much attention to their inner world, relationships and emotions. In general, the color description of the hero who appears as a narrator in the work is weak, and the main focus is on the female figure and nature. In the work, there are vivid impressionist features such as original color description, feast of light, nude genre, pursuit of unity of color, and fragmentary composition.In other words, the Bunin uses the color spectrum of nature and women most widely and variously. This divided color description is deeply related to the preference of impressionists who like to depict landscapes and figures in painting. Therefore, the principle of impressionism is reflected in the pictorial depiction embodied in Bunin’s prose.

AB  - In modern times when idols made of wood and stone disappeared, another face of the idol appears as ideology. Ideology was a term used in Marxism and structuralist philosophy to refer to the idea of defining and constraining humans and society in the wrong direction. Althusser pointed out the inevitability of “ideological state organization” that would rule and subsidize a person as long as he/she may participate in a particular world. Ideology, which emerged as a tool of social and political theory in the twentieth century, seized the function of the worldview held by religion through the weakening of the influence of traditional religion. The quasi-religious ideology is the confinement of those subordinated in fiction and hypocrisy to the object of desire and pursuit. There are three ways in which religious ideology exerts the power of idols.First, ideology would absolutize the historical and relative into a historic and transcendental through the process of self-referential, self-authenticating and self-affirming mystification. Fetish capitalism or Nazi nationalist idols were born this way.Second, ideology distorts reality perception by injecting illusions about reality into those who are embedded in it, further justifying hermeneutic distortion. A person whose perception, interpretation, and disposition is distorted by ideology, identifies the will of his ideology and his will, blindly follows ideology and executes it enthusiastically.Third, ideology misuses human imitation tendencies and shaping traits to form human temperaments, habits, and actions in the wrong direction. As modern thinkers reveal, human beings imitate, desire and pursue something through mediation outside of them to reflect and resemble it.Churches and Christians who practice true godliness must discern and oppose ideology, the modern idol, in order that the gospel message and confession of faith will not turn into ideological manifestations.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) is able to photograph the earth’s surface regardless of weather conditions, day and night. Because of its possibility to search for hydrological factors such as soil moisture and groundwater, and its importance is gradually increasing in the field of water resources. SAR began to be mounted on satellites in the 1970s, and about 15 or more satellites were launched as of 2020, which around 10 satellites will be launched within the next 5 years. Recently, various types of SAR technologies such as enhancement of observation width and resolution, multiple polarization and multiple frequencies, and diversification of observation angles were being developed and utilized. In this paper, a brief history of the SAR system, as well as studies for estimating soil moisture and hydrological components were investigated. Up to now hydrological components that can be estimated using SAR satellites include soil moisture, subsurface groundwater discharge, precipitation, snow cover area, leaf area index(LAI), and normalized difference vegetation index(NDVI) and among them, soil moisture is being studied in 17 countries in South Korea, North America, Europe, and India by using the physical model, the IEM(Integral Equation Model) and the artificial intelligence-based ANN(Artificial Neural Network). RADARSAT-1, ENVISAT, ASAR, and ERS-1/2 were the most widely used satellite, but the operation has ended, and utilization of RADARSAT-2, Sentinel-1, and SMAP, which are currently in operation, is gradually increasing. Since Korea is developing a medium-sized satellite for water resources and water disasters equipped with C-band SAR with the goal of launching in 2025, various hydrological components estimation researches using SAR are expected to be active.

AB  - Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a short-lived reactive trace gas, which plays vital roles in air quality, tropospheric chemistry and climate. Rapid changes in the technologies and expansion of energy sector is anticipated to have influenced the distribution of SO2 across the Indian subcontinent, however continuous in situ observations are scarce. In this direction, we investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of SO2 over the Indian region combining the remote sensing observations from space (OMI), in situ measurements (CPCB), and results from the global models (MERRA-2 and CAMS) for 2005-2015 period. The comparison of MERRA-2 results with surface SO2 observations show model's ability to reproduce the general aspects of SO2 distribution over this region. Analysis of the long-term MERRA-2 and CAMS simulations reveal an enhancement in the SO2 levels, more pronounced over the industrial regions in the north, east and central India at rates in range of 0.1-0.3 ppbv yr(-1) during 2005-2015 period. This concord well with the trends based on satellite-based observations and emission inventories over this region. These changes in SO2 are further found to impact the regional distribution of the sulphate aerosols significantly.We estimated higher efficiency of sulphate formation during monsoon (0.30) than that during winter (0.15). This study highlights a need to conduct in situ observations of SO2 over a network of stations especially in the identified regions of stronger SO2 enhancements to understand the impacts on the regional air quality and climate.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is focused on detecting vegetation stress in natural and seminatural riparian wetland ecosystems. Wetland ecosystems play an important role at the local and global scale. They provide various ecosystem services as long as they are in good condition. The global climate change influences a local environment, in which wetlands health become an indicator of drought conditions. Persisting adverse conditions might lead to irreversible changes in these precious ecosystems. Hence, modern methods for the monitoring of these ecosystems are required to be developed. In the scope of this study, based on basic meteorological elements (air temperature and humidity) and canopy temperature from two different platforms (meteorological tower and Landsat-8 satellite), crop water stress index (CWSI) was proposed for riparian wetland habitats and wet meadows monitoring. The study was conducted in the Upper Biebrza Basin (NE, Poland). As a first step, CWSI was calculated based on meteorological measurements and compared with CWSI calculated for surrounding Landsat-8 pixels covered by the same land-use type as one being in the tower sensor field of view. CWSI from both sensors were in significant agreement. In the second step of the analysis, CWSI and selected optical indices were calculated for a longer period based on satellite data. Those indices were compared with test if they indicate the same conditions, or if their indications are inconsistent. Results show that CWSI and optical indices indicate different plant stress factors. Hence, for proper wetlands condition assessment, still more research is required to properly assess their conditions and its causes.

AB  - In this study we developed an algorithm for spontaneous green space identification in the cities. The algorithm was developed based on NDVI analyses (calculated from Sentinel-2 data) in Warsaw's green spaces, Poland. We analysed NDVI values in nearly 2000 points which allowed us to develop an algorithm for a distinction between managed and spontaneous vegetation, the algorithm results show that in all vegetation classes NDVI values obtained for managed vegetation are lower than for spontaneously occurring one. Application of algorithm requires a time series of satellite images, for all each of them, the NDVI threshold value is calculated. Finally, based on the number of exceedances of the threshold value each green space pixel is assigned to managed or spontaneous vegetation class. The validation shows that the algorithm achieves 70% accuracy for both classes.

AB  - The 4 year-long Recovery Observatory project was triggered by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) to define a sustainable vision for increased use of satellite EO in support of recovery after 2016 Hurricane Matthew struck southwestern Haiti. ESA's Geohazards Exploitation Platform (GEP) was exploited to develop a SAR-based workflow to access, process and generate value-added products with Sentinel-1, TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed imagery that Haitian end-users can use to support their decision-making processes and recovery progress monitoring. Sentinel-1 IW data were processed with SNAP and SNAC tools to generate change detection products (e.g. coherence and amplitude change maps to detect flooded areas). InSAR ground deformation products generated with PS-InSAR FASTVEL and P-SBAS tools allowed the identification of unstable areas in the town of Jeremie and along its western coastline, which highlight potential concern for urban development and reconstruction. Ground truth and evidence of land instability were collected in the field in mid-2019 to validate satellite observations.

AB  - Long stacks of Copernicus Sentinel-1 IW SAR images acquired in 2014-2019 are processed with the Small Baseline Subset ( SBAS) and Permanent Scatterers (PS) Interferometric SAR (InSAR) methods to retrieve present-day land deformation rates across major cities in central Mexico. InSAR-derived subsidence velocity reflects intense groundwater pumping from shallow and deep aquifers for public, agricultural and industrial use, and consequent water level drop and aquifer depletion. In the capital Mexico City, as well as in the valleys of Toluca and Tulancingo, which all belong to aquifers recognized by the National Water Commission as in deficit in 2018, vertical deformation rates are as high as 40, 8 and 6 cm/year, respectively. Most pronounced rates occur mainly on highly compressible, Quaternary clay and silt-rich deposits. Rates of 6.5 cm/year are also observed at well-defined subsiding zones in Puebla, in response to groundwater abstraction for public-urban and industrial use.

AB  - In this paper we propose a lossless and lossy onboard compression algorithm for multispectral and hyperspectral images, based on the recent CCSDS-123.0-B-2 standard, which takes advantage of cloud screening in order to perform data volume reduction, by avoiding to transmit pixels that are covered by clouds. In particular, we develop methods addressing two problems: i) how to signal the cloud mask in the compressed file, and ii) how to handle cloudy pixels in order to maximize the amount of compression. Experimental results on a set of LANDSAT 8 ETM+ and AVIRIS images show a significant data volume reduction with respect to the plain use of the CCSDS-123.0-B-2 standard.

TI  - An Approach for Estimating Border Length in Marine Coasts From MODIS Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of data approximation methods from coarse spatial resolution images is gaining increasing interest in the research community. This letter aims to extend and validate a developed methodology for estimating border length of diverse marine coastlines from coarse spatial resolution images like Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) by using fractal attributes and its error behavior. The accuracy of MODIS-based estimates and the reliability of the method to predict coastline length measurements by extrapolation was evaluated using Landsat 8 over different coastline types. It is shown that with our method, 250-m MODIS images are adequate for estimating coastline lengths with a precision equivalent to standard linear measurements performed on 30-m resolution imagery, with average errors between 3 and 18 for straight and complex coasts, respectively. These results indicate that an underestimation error, occurring in rugged and complex coasts, is more frequent and significant than overestimation occurring in smooth and straight coasts.

AB  - From simple scattering mechanism extraction and throughout more complex applications (e.g., land classification, disaster monitoring), polarimetry has become a key element for remote sensing. For the particular case of bistatic polarimetry, the development of a theoretical basis has not been yet aligned with a comprehensive experimental validation. At the moment, an exhaustive search across the polarimetric scientific literature will reveal that for true bistatic geometries (i.e., significant angular separation between transmitter and receiver), only a small number of qualitative investigations have been made and there is still work to be done. In the current paper, one of the most popular polarimetric decomposition methods (H - alpha) is applied to dual-pol VV-VH data, in both bistatic (space-surface geometry with ground-based receiver) and monostatic configurations. Images from both geometries are displaying a common, urban scene. Comparing the obtained results, objective observations are presented.

AB  - The earth's climate has a direct impact on the spatial distribution of the vegetation cover. Forests are one of the most prevalent ecosystems on earth. The forest's structure, if unaltered, can be an indicator of some climate patterns. This paper proposes an algorithm for identifying vegetation inversions within mountain forest ecosystems in the eastern Carpathians of Romania, using freely available GIS and remote sensing data. Air temperature has a direct impact on the spatial distribution of tree species. Therefore, temperature-inversion spatial patterns can be estimated.

TI  - Comparison of multi-seasonal Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 and hyperspectral images for mapping forest alliances in Northern California
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current era of earth observation now provides constellations of open-access, multispectral satellite imagery with medium spatial resolution, greatly increasing the frequency of cloud-free data for analysis. The Landsat satellites have a long historical record, while the newer Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites offer higher temporal, spatial and spectral resolution. The goal of this study was to evaluate the relative benefits of single- and multi-seasonal multispectral satellite data for discriminating detailed forest alliances, as defined by the U.S. National Vegetation Classification system, in a Mediterranean-climate landscape (Sonoma County, California). Results were compared to a companion analysis of simulated hyperspectral satellite data (HyspIRl) for the same study site and reference data (Clark et al., 2018). Experiments used real and simulated S2 and Landsat 8 (L8) data. Simulated S2 and L8 were from HyspIRI images, thereby focusing results on differences in spectral resolution rather than other confounding factors. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was used in a hierarchical classification of land-cover (Level 1), followed by alliances (Level 2) in forest pixels, and included summer-only and multi-seasonal sets of predictor variables (bands, indices and bands plus indices). Both real and simulated multi seasonal multispectral variables significantly improved overall accuracy (OA) by 0.2-1.6% for Level 1 tree/no tree classifications and 3.6-25.8% for Level 2 forest alliances. Classifiers with S2 variables tended to be more accurate than L8 variables, particularly for S2, which had 0.4-2.1% and 5.1-11.8% significantly higher OA than L8 for Level 1 tree/no tree and Level 2 forest alliances, respectively. Combining multispectral bands and indices or using just bands was generally more accurate than relying on just indices for classification. Simulated HyspIRI variables from past research had significantly greater accuracy than real L8 and S2 variables, with an average OA increase of 8.2-12.6%. A final alliance-level map used for a deeper analysis used simulated multi-seasonal S2 bands and indices, which had an overall accuracy of 74.3% (Kappa = 0.70). The accuracy of this classification was only 1.6% significantly lower than the best HyspIRI-based classification, which used multi-seasonal metrics (Clark et al., 2018), and there were alliances where the S2-based classifier was more accurate. Within the context of these analyses and study area, S2 spectral-temporal data demonstrated a strong capability for mapping global forest alliances, or similar detailed floristic associations, at medium spatial resolutions (10-30 m).

T2  - MSMR
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This report describes early exploratory analysis of ICD-10-CM code U07.1 (2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease [COVID-19]) to assess the use of administrative data for case ascertainment, syndromic surveillance, and future epidemiological studies. Out of the 2,950 possible COVID-19 cases identified between 1 April 2020 and 4 May 2020, 600 (20.3%) were detected in the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS) and not in the Disease Reporting System internet (DRSi) or in Health Level 7 laboratory data from the Composite Health Care System. Among the 150 out of 600 cases identified exclusively in the DMSS and selected for Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) review, 16 (10.7%) had a certified positive lab result in AHLTA, 17 (11.3%) met Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) criteria for a probable case, 46 (30.7%) were not cases based on CSTE criteria, and 71 (47.3%) had evidence of a positive lab result from an outside source. Lack of full capture of lab results may continue to be a challenge as the variety of available tests expands. Administrative data may provide an important stopgap measure for detecting lab positive cases, pending incorporation of new COVID-19 tests and standardization of test and result nomenclature.

AB  - Remote sensing has become an important mean to assess crop areas, specially for the identification of crop types. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a free platform that provides a large number of satellite images from different constellations. Moreover, GEE provides pixel-based classifiers, which are used for mapping agricultural areas. The objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of different classification algorithms such as Minimum Distance (MD), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Naive Bayes (NB) on an agricultural area in Tuscany (Italy). Four different scenarios were implemented in GEE combining different information such as optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, indices and time series. Among the five classifiers used the best perfomiers were RF and SVM. Integrating Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) slightly improves the classification in comparison to the only S2 image classifications. The use of time series substantially improves supervised classifications. The analysis carried out so far lays the foundation for the integration of time series of SAR and optical data.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Higher education institutions shape the professions which are the conduit for the disciplines' ways of knowing, the worldview or mindset of the professions, and the intellectual frameworks by which problems and policies are defined. The generational, conscious, and unconscious agreements between higher education and the professions perpetuate the status quo, resulting in continued disproportional impacts based on race, gender, ethnicity, language, orientation, and differing abilities in every major industry sector; including education, health, employment, housing, finance, technology, and the criminal justice system. Cultural responsive pedagogy provides a process of altering these agreements by surfacing the dual consciousness of our multiple social identities and the multidimensional social, political, and economic contexts in our collective co-existence. The connections between culture and mindset, conscious and unconscious, and the social-political context shape teaching and learning. Mindfulness is a pathway for cultivating cultural competency through embodied awareness by building the reflective muscle to recognize, disrupt, and transform deep-rooted beliefs, entrenched assumptions, and well-established behaviors. Mindfulness invites both faculty and students to bring their intellectual, social, emotional, and spiritual selves to the learning exchange.

AB  - Due to the complexity and difficult comprehension of remote sensing data, ubiquitous methods for content exploitation are difficult to identify. The main limitation is ascribed to the fact that different perceptions, individual human experts and non-identical remote sensors fabricate a total heterogeneous context. In order to overpass these breaches, an interactive learning model is demanded, where different experts, participating into a validation process, expose and verify shared dictionaries based on users' understanding. We propose a federated system for collaborative labeling of remote sensing datasets that transform blockchain storage into blockchain knowledge. This writing wants to provide insights into a decentralized methodology, capable of building a publicly available, largescale benchmark data for image classification and hosting a permanently updated machine learning (ML) model.

TI  - Social discontinuity and systems thinking. Cultural differentiation and social integration in times of globalization
T2  - CAMBIO-RIVISTA SULLE TRASFORMAZIONI SOCIALI
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the obsolescence of a linear, homeostatic and reductionist worldview unable to face current social discontinuity, the laceration of a stable universe of expectations marking world scenarios, this paper argues the heuristic power of System Theory in understanding and managing, by emergence, circular causation between system and environmental and micro-macro co-essentiality conceptual frameworks, social integration crisis in our culturally differentiated and globalized western modern societies. The discussion on normative multiculturalism validity (in particular neo-communitarian multiculturalism) and, therefore, on sufficiency of procedural foundations as device of cultural difference integration and social cohesion is controversial and far from reaching a turning point. To get out of this impasse and support policymaking processes able to face social integration crisis, the paper argues to bring the debate on complexity epistemological plan. Systems Thiking could give new lymph to current debate, hooking it to a safer ground, made so by new acquisitions on systems' working and evolution mechanism. So, Complexity language intervenes fruitfully to justify the caution with which normative multiculturalism is believed that should be considered, by anchoring this caution to configuration of a society projected to dangerously visit that range of maximum differentiation among its components which should be avoided being identified as the range of disorder and ungovernability. Not only, in the emergence logic, integration is just one of the many possibilities to which self-organization process being initiated by processes of signifying of recognition policies is open, but sociologically there are even theoretical reasons to believe that in itself the same functionalist device is such as to make this possibility little probable and does not lead where it promises. How to reduce complexity' how to fill up this relationality deficit that normative multiculturalism institutes and avoid the risk of a society unable to regain order with coherence? The Complexity framework is where the whole debate must be kept. Here, the integration proposal of pluralism and interculturalism can gain greater meaning, avoiding the risks of mono-culturalism, on the one hand, and social balkanization, on the other hand.

TI  - Estimates for Lyme borreliosis infections based on models using sentinel canine and human seroprevalence data
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASE MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two models were developed to estimate Lyme borreliosis (LB) cases. One was based on the seroprevalence of Borrelia infections in human samples. This model used corrections for false negative and false positive results from published test sensitivity and specificity measures. A second model based on Borrelia infections in sentinel dogs was used to quantify the prevalence of Lyme disease Borrelia infections in humans; the reference baseline for this model was human and canine infections in Germany. A comparison of the two models is shown and differences discussed. The relationships between incidence, prevalence and total infection burden for LB were derived from published data and these were used in both models to calculate annual incidence, prevalence and total LB infections. The modelling was conservative and based on medical insurance records coded for erythema migrans. Linear model growth rates were used in place of the commonly adopted exponential growth. The mean of the two models was used to create estimates for various countries and continents. Examples from the analyses for LB estimated for 2018 include: incidence - USA 473,000/year, Germany 471,000/year, France 434,000/year and UK 132,000/year; prevalence - USA 2.4 million, Germany 2.4 million, France 2.2 million and UK 667,000; total infections - USA 10.1 million, Germany 10.0 million, France 9.3 million and UK 2.8 million. Estimates for the world for 2018 are: incidence 12.3 million/year; prevalence 62.1 million; and total infection burden 262.0 million. These figures are far higher than officially published data and reflect not only the underestimation of diagnosed cases, which is acknowledged by health agencies, but also undiagnosed and misdiagnosed cases.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Built-up areas extraction and characterization from remote sensing images is essential for monitoring urbanization and the associated challenges. This work presents a novel integrated classification framework building on the symbolic machine learning classifier and fully polarimetric Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) to derive both the extent and vertical components of built-up areas from the same scene. It also explores the complementarity between ascending and descending orbits of PALSAR-2 for built-up areas detection. The experimental results in Chicago and Tokyo cities with different landscape and characteristics of built-up areas demonstrate that the proposed generic method can achieve three main challenges of urban remote sensing: 1) enabling automated delineation of built-up areas at a spatial resolution of 5 m with a balanced accuracy of 85% using globally available low-resolution training data, 2) assessing the density of building height class with a root mean square error of 0.25, 0.034, and 0.032 for the low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise building density class, respectively, and 3) dealing with the scattering components of buildings with different orientation angles by combining data from ascending and descending orbits for enhanced mapping of built-up areas.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the potential for glyphosate drift during aerial application using rice plants as sentinels, aiming to determine the effect of drift on irrigated rice crops. For this purpose, a field experiment was performed using an entirely randomized design with four replicates, evaluating different distances from the site of application [control (no application), 0, 12.5, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300, and 400 m]. The experiment was carried out at the Granjas 4 Irmaos farm, located in the Rio Grande city, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. The glyphosate dose application was 1,920 g e.a. he (Roundup Transorb (R), 480 g e.a. glyphosate isopropylamine salt). A dose-response curve was developed to estimate the drift rate in sentinel plants, by applying increasing glyphosate doses in rice plants and assessing the injury level. The drift rates estimated by the injury level in sentinel plants were 14% (150 m), 13% (200 m), and 5% (400 m). Death of the experimental units was observed for distances between 0 and 50 m, while in distances between 75 and 150 m, 25 to 50% of the plants survived, reducing productivity. In the distances between 200 and 400 m, there was no reduction in productivity when compared to the control, even when the injury levels reached 52 to 82%. Thus, we concluded that a 5% glyphosate drift reached up to 400 m from the application range. Considering the recommendation of zero drift, distances greater than 400 m should be adopted to avoid symptoms in rice plants. We suggest using distances of more than 400 m in future studies.

TI  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCENARIOS AND THE INCENTIVE TO PROTECT PERMANENT PRESERVATION AREAS IN THE MICROBACIA DO RIO FAGUNDES, PARAIBA DO SUL/RJ
T2  - GEO UERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - To encourage farmers to preserve and/or restore native vegetation as envisaged in Law 12,651/2012, a sustainable rural development program in Rio de Janeiro invests in the protection and recovery of permanent preservation areas, especially in the spring. Related to the program, the objective of this work is to construct environmental scenarios in the Fagundes River Basin in Paraiba do Sul/RJ, which will subsidize the planning and management of PPAs. The methodology is the quantification of land cover classes, "Forest", "Non Forest", "Water" and "Unclassified" using geotechnologies in two comparative scenarios, 2011 and 2016 and a future scenario, 2046. The program was used ArcGis 10.3 for digital image processing, the Landsat 5TM and Landsat 8 OLI sensors and the Idrisi Selva 17.0/Land Change Modeler program for the generation of predictive models and comparative analysis. The results indicate that, between 2011 and 2016, there was an increase of 160.4 hectares of the "No Forest" class on the "Forest" class: the "Forest" class decreased by 7.4%, while the "No Forest" class increased 5.33%. For the future scenario 2046, the Markovian probabilistic model presents a 52% chance of converting from the "Forest" class to "No Forest", therefore, there is a prediction of a pessimistic future trend of deforestation. It is recommended the monitoring of the watershed related to changes in the land cover and actions of preservation of "Forest".

TI  - Patent blue V dye anaphylaxis: a case report and literature review
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ANESTESIOLOGIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Anaphylaxis is a constant perioperative concern due to the exposure to several agents capable of inducing hypersensitivity reactions. Patent blue V (PBV), also known as Sulfan Blue, a synthetic dye used in sentinel node research in breast surgery, is responsible for 0.6% of reported anaphylactic conditions. We present a case of a 49-year-old female patient who underwent left breast tumorectomy with sentinel lymph node staging using PBV and experienced an anaphylactic reaction.Methods: We conducted a literature search through PubMed for case reports, case series, reviews, and systematic reviews since 2005 with the keywords "anaphylaxis" and "patent blue". We then included articles found in these publications' reference sections.Results: We found 12 relevant publications regarding this topic. The main findings are summarized, with information regarding the clinical presentation, management, and investigation protocol. Hypotension is the most common clinical manifestation. The presentation is usually delayed when compared with anaphylaxis from other agents, and cutaneous manifestations are occasionally absent. Patients may have had previous exposure to the dye, used also as a food, clothes and drug colorant.Conclusion: The diagnosis of anaphylaxis in patients under sedation or general anesthesia may be difficult due to particularities of the perioperative context. According to the published literature, the presentation of the reaction is similar in most cases and a heightened clinical sense is key to address the situation appropriately. Finding the agent responsible for the allergic reaction is of paramount importance to prevent future episodes. (C) 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Anestesiologia. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

TI  - Exploring BFAST to detect forest changes in Portugal
T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXVI
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVI
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Landsat 8 data and Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) were used in a region of central Portugal to detect forest clear-cuts and burnt areas. A total of 79 Landsat 8 images from 2013 to 2019 were downloaded for path/row 204/032, and the NDVI was calculated. The same data processing was done for path/row 203/032 to create a denser time series in the overlapping area, which increased to 124 images. The output of the analysis is a binary map of change (i.e., forest loss) and no-change. A probabilistic accuracy assessment based on random stratified sampling was implemented with 100 random points per stratum. Each point was interpreted as being either "no-change", "clear-cut" or "burnt area" based on reference data. Furthermore, the date of change (if any) was defined. Results show an overall accuracy of 0.85 +/- 0.02 for the binary classification with omission and commission errors of class "Change" of 0.30 +/- 0.02 and 0.19 +/- 0.02. Moreover, it is estimated that 32% of the forested area in path/row 204/032 went through at least one episode of clear-cut or fire in the period analyzed. The time lag between the date of change and detection was about 2.5 months on average, which decreased to 1.5 months in the regions of the denser time series. The results are promising but BFAST is somewhat slow and hence some concerns remain about its efficiency in operation use.

TI  - Assessment of Agricultural Practices From Sentinel 1 and 2 Images Applied on Rice Fields to Develop a Farm Typology in the Camargue Region
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the global change context, an efficient management of the available resources has become one of the most important topics particularly for the sustainable crop development. Many questions concern the evolution of the rice farming systems in Camargue in Southeastern France, which play a crucial role in controlling the soil salinity. Their surface area significantly decreased from 20 000 ha in 2010 to 14 000 ha in 2014. The arrival of the new Sentinel satellites makes it possible to evaluate these crop evolutions. The objectives of this study were to propose operational methodologies to accurately assess the surface areas of the main crops, rice, wheat, and grassland, from classifications based on multispectral data; map agricultural practices (sowing and harvest residue burning); and elaborate a farm typology based on variables computed from remote sensing data to better understand the farming strategies. Dense time series of Sentinel images acquired at high spatial resolution (10 m) were analyzed for 2016 and 2017. A satisfactory accuracy was obtained for land use classification with 88% of correctly classified fields. The accuracy obtained for the estimation of the sowing date varied according to the studied year from 8 to 12 days, and burned areas were correctly identified (80%). The farm typology allowed to cluster farms at the territory level.

TI  - Prosperity Theology and African Traditional Religion: Assessing their resonance through a case study
T2  - STELLENBOSCH THEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of Prosperity Theology in Africa have increased as research into Pentecostalism has burgeoned, but few theological analyses have explored the significance of African Traditional Religions and their role in shaping Prosperity Theology. While some studies have explored the resonance of Prosperity Theology and African Traditional Religions, they tend to do so briefly, or with a focus on sociology rather than theology. Through a case study of Nigerian Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, this research tests the thesis that many have intuited: Prosperity Theology resonates with traditional African religion, and these resonances contribute to an explanation of the expression and proliferation of Prosperity Theology in Africa. Evaluating the resonance of Oyakhilome's teaching with African Traditional Religions (relying especially on John S. Mbiti's work) demonstrates that Oyakhilome's emphasis on accessing blessing, spiritual enemies, and activating power draws heavily on the resources of the typical African religious worldview.

TI  - Examining Institutional Support Structures and Worldview Climate for Sexual Minority Students in Christian Higher Education
T2  - CHRISTIAN HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Using data from a survey administered at 61 institutions from 2011 to 2015, we examined how campus support structures for sexual minority students (e.g., a recognized LGBTQ student organization) influence student perceptions of the campus climate for worldview diversity at Christian colleges and universities. Further, analysis of the survey data explored whether the effects of institutional supports on climate perceptions differ for sexual minority and heterosexual students. Findings suggest that campus support structures for the LGB + community play a role in shaping students' perceptions of the worldview diversity climate at Christian institutions. For one support structure in particular-educational programs/series-the effects on climate perceptions among LGB + individuals are stronger than they are for heterosexual students. Implications for research and practice are discussed fully at the conclusion of the article.

TI  - Potential of Recurrence Metrics from Sentinel-1 Time Series for Deforestation Mapping
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The REDD+ framework requires accurate estimates of deforestation. These are derived by ground measurements supported by methods based on remote sensing data to automatically detect and delineate deforestations over large areas. In particular, in the tropics, optical data is seldom available due to cloud cover. As synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data overcomes this limitation, we performed a separability analysis of two statistical metrics based on the Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter over forested and deforested areas. We compared the range between the 5th and 95th temporal percentiles (PRange) and the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) Trend metric. Unlike the PRange, the RQA Trend considers the temporal order of the SAR data acquisitions, thus contrasting between dropping backscatter signals and yearly seasonalities. This enables the estimation of the timing of deforestation events. We assessed the impact of polarization, acquisition orbit, and despeckling on the separability between forested and deforested areas and between different deforestation timings for two test sites in Mexico. We found that the choice of the orbit impacts the detectability of deforestation. In all cases, VH data showed a higher separability between forest and deforestations than VV data. The PRange slightly outperformed RQA Trend in the separation between forest and deforestation. However, the RQA Trend exceeded the PRange in the separation between different deforestation timings. In this study, C-Band backscatter data was used, although it is commonly not considered as the most suitable SAR dataset for forestry applications. Nevertheless, our approach shows the potential of dense C-Band backscatter time series to support the REDD+ framework.

TI  - SUMMER URBAN HEAT ISLAND OF GALATI CITY (ROMANIA) DETECTED USING SATELLITE PRODUCTS
T2  - PRESENT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the main features of the urban heat island of Galati city during the summer season for a period of 16 years (2003-2018) using MODIS products. The main objectives were to analyse the extension and geometry of the urban heat island (UHI), its intensity, as well as its connection with land cover. The study is based on LST (Land Surface Temperature), a product obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors located on board of the Terra (EOS AM-1) satellite since 2001 and Aqua (EOS PM-1) satellite since 2003. The boundaries, geometry and spatial extent of the UHI were delimited primarily through the Rodionov test. Through this method, the changing points along four transects over Galati city were identified (North-South, East-West, Northeast-Southwest and Northwest-Southeast) and have been used to delimitate the UHI.Overall, the Galati UHI assessed by satellite information is stronger during the day when the UHI is split in two centres, developed over the industrial area in the west and over the residential part of the town in the east, while during the night the UHI is weaker being developed more clearly over the oldest part of the city. One of the major characteristics of the Galati UHI is that it is highly influenced by the water bodies encircling the city. During the day the intensity of UHI reaches 2-2.5 degrees C while during the night decreases below 2.0 degrees C. The relation of the UHI with land cover and the attenuation of UHI in the surrounding area are also investigated.

TI  - Integrating Incidence Angle Dependencies Into the Clustering-Based Segmentation of SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar systems perform signal acquisition under varying incidence angles and register an implicit intensity decay from near to far range. Owing to the geometrical interaction between microwaves and the imaged targets, the rates at which intensities decay depend on the nature of the targets, thus rendering single-rate image correction approaches only partially successful. The decay, also known as the incidence angle effect, impacts the segmentation of wide-swath images performed on absolute intensity values. We propose to integrate the target-specific intensity decay rates into a nonstationary statistical model, for use in a fully automatic and unsupervised segmentation algorithm. We demonstrate this concept by assuming Gaussian distributed log-intensities and linear decay rates, a fitting approximation for the smooth systematic decay observed for extended flat targets. The segmentation is performed on Sentinel-1, Radarsat-2, and UAVSAR wide-swath scenes containing open water, sea ice, and oil slicks. As a result, we obtain segments connected throughout the entire incidence angle range, thus overcoming the limitations of modeling that does not account for different per-target decays. The model simplicity also allows for short execution times and presents the segmentation approach as a potential operational algorithm. In addition, we estimate the log-linear decay rates and examine their potential for a physical interpretation of the segments.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Increased human presence and commercial activities in the Barents Sea (fishing, offshore oil and gas exploration) are amplifying the need for large-scale operational ocean monitoring of the eventual oil spills in the region. The geographical location and climate impose additional constraints on satellite-based monitoring, making it necessary to use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Dark features or low backscatter areas are frequent within the SAR images and their occurrence may indicate oil spills or so-called lookalikes. Automatic oil spill detection hinges on accurate separation of the lookalikes from actual oil spills. Two main types exist in the Barents Sea: newly formed sea ice and low wind regions, where the former occur during the freezing part of the year (approx. November - April) and the other year around. Mapping the occurrence of oil spills and lookalikes in the Barents Sea on a seasonal basis would add to our understanding and knowledge of the low backscatter phenomena. Awareness of the major locations of oil spills, natural oil seeps, or lookalikes, are important for operational services and their effort to reduce false alarms. Here, we explore the use of a segmentation-based dark feature detection method with Sentinel-1 Extra Wide-Swath SAR images. We test the method on images acquired over the Barents Sea during the freezing season, and cross-validate the results with two sets of dark features segmented by operational expert oil spill and sea ice monitoring services. The results are discussed, together with currently developing method improvements, all while working towards a fully-automated method for monitoring dark features in the Barents Sea.

TI  - The global distribution of leaf chlorophyll content
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf chlorophyll is central to the exchange of carbon, water and energy between the biosphere and the atmosphere, and to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. This paper presents the first spatially-continuous view of terrestrial leaf chlorophyll content (Chl(Leaf)) at the global scale. Weekly maps of Chl(Leaf) were produced from ENVISAT MERIS full resolution (300 m) satellite data using a two-stage physically-based radiative transfer modelling approach. Firstly, leaf-level reflectance was derived from top-of-canopy satellite reflectance observations using 4-Scale and SAIL canopy radiative transfer models for woody and non-woody vegetation, respectively. Secondly, the modelled leaf-level reflectance was input into the PROSPECT leaf-level radiative transfer model to derive Chl(Leaf). The Chl(Leaf) retrieval algorithm was validated using measured Chi(Leaf) data from 248 sample measurements at 28 field locations, and covering six plant functional types (PFTs). Modelled results show strong relationships with field measurements, particularly for deciduous broadleaf forests (R-2 = 0.67; RMSE = 9.25 mu g cm(-2); p < 0.001), croplands (R-2 = 0.41; RMSE = 13.18 mu g cm(-2); p < 0.001) and evergreen needleleaf forests (R-2 = 0.47; RMSE = 10.63 mu g cm(-2); p < 0.001). When the modelled results from all PFTs were considered together, the overall relationship with measured Chl(Leaf )remained good (R-2 = 0.47, RMSE = 10.79 mu g cm(-2); p < 0.001). This result is an improvement on the relationship between measured Chl(Leaf) and a commonly used chlorophyll-sensitive spectral vegetation index; the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI; R-2 = 0.27, p < 0.001). The global maps show large temporal and spatial variability in Chl(Leaf), with evergreen broadleaf forests presenting the highest leaf chlorophyll values, with global annual median values of 54.4 mu g cm(-2). Distinct seasonal Chl(Leaf) phenologies are also visible, particularly in deciduous plant forms, associated with budburst and crop growth, and leaf senescence. It is anticipated that this global Chl(Leaf) product will make an important step towards the explicit consideration of leaf-level biochemistry in terrestrial water, energy and carbon cycle modelling.

AB  - The paper is focused on the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique. First, it addresses the substantial evolution of PSI in the last twenty years. Three main factors are identified: the availability of SAR images, the development of advanced data processing techniques, and the increase of the computation capability. The paper then addresses the PSI deformation monitoring initiatives at regional and national scale. Finally, in the last section, it is described a pan European deformation monitoring service: the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS).

TI  - A Divergence of Interests: Critical Race Theory and White Privilege Pedagogy
T2  - TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Context: Informed by the increasing racial disparity between the nation's predominantly White teaching force and the growing number of students of color in K-12 schools, along with the well-documented struggles that White teachers have in exploring race and racial identity, the authors critique the use of White privilege pedagogy as a strategy for promoting antiracist dispositions in White pre-service teachers.Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: By deploying several concepts central to critical race theory, as well as critiques that note the shortcomings of past attempts at racial reform (Brown v. Board of Education, Voting Rights Act), the authors investigate the effectiveness of White privilege pedagogy within the teacher education setting.Research Design: To construct our conceptual critique of White privilege pedagogy within teacher education, we reviewed the extant literature that discussed the range of shortcomings to this pedagogical approach. To create a more historical and structural critique, we demonstrated how the tenets of White privilege pedagogy conflicted with key principles of critical race theory and with lessons from past racial remedies. We contend that White privilege pedagogy arises from a racial liberalist worldview and requires an untenable convergence of interests that limits its long-term impact. We parallel our critiques of White privilege pedagogy with arguments used by critical race scholars to explain the limited impact of previous efforts at racial reform.Conclusions/Recommendations: The authors urge teacher educators to move away from the individualized and over-essentialized representations of racism inherent to White privilege pedagogy in favor of historical, structural, and intersectional discussions of race, racism, and the construction of White privilege.

AB  - Sugarcane is a crop of great commercial and economic importance in over 130 countries, including Mexico. One of the main problems faced by sugarcane producers is how to improve the yield of the crop. In order to develop new techniques that can improve the yield of the sugarcane crop, it is key to be able to identify the critical stages of growth and to be able to make timely decisions. In this paper, a method is presented to identify the phenological stages of sugarcane crops using data from the MultiSpectral Instrument sensor onboard the Sentinel-2 satellite. For the development of the proposed method, classification some methods were evaluated. k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes. Also, time series of five vegetation indices were used as input data; the results were validated using the cross-validation technique with k = 10 iterations. The results show that the method Random Forest achieves an accuracy = 92.45%, which is the best suited to identify the growth stages of sugarcane crops.

AB  - In recent decades the global effects of climate change have requested for a more sustainable approach in thinking and planning of our cities, making them more inclusive, safe and resilient. In terms of consumption of natural resources and pollution, cities are seen as entities with most significant impact to the natural environment. Strategic policies focused on tackling the challenges induced by climate change suggest in fact the necessity to start from the management and operating models of the cities themselves. This study illustrates an initial evaluation of parameters for purposes of urban generation studies using optical multi-spectral satellite imagery from Landsat-5, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 missions. The changes in land occupation and urban density are the first aspects chosen to be examined for the period 1985-2020. The focus was given on possible modifications occurred in occasion of Milano Expo 2015. The paper firstly explores the known best band combination for observation of urban fabric. Suggestions derived have then been calibrated with reference to ground truth data, while the image pairs over the 35 years span were then build with selected bands. Finally, all image pairs have been processed for Principal Component Analysis in order to identify possible "hot-spots" of significant changes. The results found on the image pair 2006-2015 have been explored in detail and checked upon official orthophotos. Monitoring of changes in urban fabric using multispectral optical imagery can provide valuable insights for further evaluation of single urban generation interventions. Such contributions could be considered in the processes of urban planning policies in a more systematic manner.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The Mediterranean ecosystem represents an important natural resource, being able to produce ecosystem services, has both economic and social repercussions, especially if located in urban and peri-urban areas.In the last decades, increased forest vulnerability is being reflected in a larger number of severe decline episodes associated mainly with drought conditions. In this context, the Mediterranean area shows high forest vulnerability and a subsequent decline in its natural renewal rate.In this context, the objective of this research is to evaluate the different vegetation indices to monitor the effect of drought on the health of the Castelporziano pine wood. For this purpose, we used the NDVI, NDII and NMDI, provided by ESA Sentinel-2 images and field observations, to monitor the health status of a historic pinewood that has recently been affected by a rapid spread of parasites (Tomicus destruens Woll.).The application of these indices, on the scale of the entire pinewood, showed that the NDVI and NDII indices differentiate better the changes in vegetative health status for the observed period than the NMDI.Moreover, NDVI and NDII were applied, based on the classifications made, to volume and age classes. Ultimately, these preliminary results require further studies to better understand the potential and limiting factors of the indices used in monitoring pinewoods under stress due to aridity.

AB  - GATR (TM) (Globally-scalable Automated Target Recognition) is a software system for object detection and classification on a worldwide basis developed by Lockheed Martin. One of the targets it detects are oil/gas fracking wells. In this work we explore the following techniques for efficiently training a fracking well detector in WorldView satellite imagery: determining the optimal ground sample distance (GSD) of data to use for training/inference, leveraging the use of auto-generated training labels, training on different sized subsets of the training data, and using active learning to determine the best subsets of data to train with. We compare the mean average precision (mAP) for models trained at different GSDs from 0.3 to 12 m and find optimal performance at 1.2 m GSD (mAP = 0.91), but acceptable performance all the way to 6 m GSD (mAP = 0.80). We also show that using auto-generated training labels from fracking well permits results in a model with mAP reduced by less than 4% (IoU threshold = 0.2) compared to a model trained on the human annotated dataset. We show that training on just 20% of the full dataset results in a mAP drop of less than 6% (mAP = 0.86). Finally, we compare multiple active learning selection methods.

AB  - High-resolution soil moisture dataset is crucial for various application such as meteorology, climatology, hydrology and agriculture. Active microwave remote sensing sensors like radar provide earth observations at high spatial resolutions. This study based on physical model simulations (Advanced Integral Equation Method, AIEM, and Water Cloud Model, WCM) combined with the Artificial Neural Networks to investigate the potential of the ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 radar images for estimating soil moisture at high spatial resolution. The results shows that the statistical parameters of the relationships between estimated and measured soil moisture, expressed in terms of R, bias, and RMSE, are 0.834 similar to 0.878, 1.59 similar to 3.65 vol% and 3.36 similar to 6.15 vol% for ALOS-2, and 0.722 similar to 0.896, 1.75 similar to 2.97 vol% and 3.24 similar to 6.86 vol%, for Sentinel-1. In densely vegetated area, RMSE significant increases, due to the limited penetration ability of L and C bands in high vegetation areas.

TI  - Integration of optical and SAR remote sensing images for crop-type mapping based on a novel object-oriented feature selection method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an important technical means to investigate land resources. Optical imagery has been widely used in crop classification and can show changes in moisture and chlorophyll content in crop leaves, whereas synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is sensitive to changes in growth states and morphological structures. Crop-type mapping with a single type of imagery sometimes has unsatisfactory precision, so providing precise spatiotemporal information on crop type at a local scale for agricultural applications is difficult. To explore the abilities of combining optical and SAR images and to solve the problem of inaccurate spatial information for land parcels, a new method is proposed in this paper to improve crop-type identification accuracy. Multifeatures were derived from the full polarimetric SAR data (GaoFen-3) and a high-resolution optical image (GaoFen-2), and the farmland parcels used as the basic for object-oriented classification were obtained from the GaoFen-2 image using optimal scale segmentation. A novel feature subset selection method based on within-class aggregation and between-class scatter (WA-BS) is proposed to extract the optimal feature subset. Finally, crop-type mapping was produced by a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The results showed that the proposed method achieved good classification results with an overall accuracy of 89.50%, which is better than the crop classification results derived from SAR-based segmentation. Compared with the ReliefF, mRMR and LeastC feature selection algorithms, the WA-BS algorithm can effectively remove redundant features that are strongly correlated and obtain a high classification accuracy via the obtained optimal feature subset. This study shows that the accuracy of crop-type mapping in an area with multiple cropping patterns can be improved by the combination of optical and SAR remote sensing images.

AB  - Early in China's HIV epidemic, officials and health authorities relied solely on case reporting to monitor the epidemic. However, since a majority of cases were diagnosed very late, the information case reporting provided was outdated and had limited utility. Thus, in 1995, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention was tasked with developing a network of sentinel surveillance sites to improve epidemic monitoring. Over time, this network evolved and expanded and today, it encompasses integrated sentinel and behavioral surveillance with nationwide coverage among 12 high-risk populations. Methods have been improved and refined over time, surveillance for antiretroviral drug resistance has been added, and substantial work in developing estimates of risk group -population size has further helped to improve the quality of the information -provided by what has become China's National HIV Surveillance Program.

AB  - Surface soil moisture (SM) plays an essential role in the water and energy balance between the land surface and the atmosphere. The published soil moisture products, having a low spatial resolution of 25-40 km, and low temporal resolution of 2-3 days, limits their applications at regional scale. In this study, the spatio-temporal resolution of Fengyun (FY) SM products was improved using a machine-learning model named the General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), with the help of selected six high spatial resolution parameters, including Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), albedo, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Longitude (Lon) and Latitude (Lat) after gap-filled as input variables. An implements tested over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) showed that the spatio-temporal resolution of FY-3B SM was improved from 0.25 degrees and 2-3 days to 0.05 degrees and 1-day. The high spatio-temporal resolution SM can enhance our understanding of water-energy cycle under climate change.

AB  - It has been found that large amounts of gases emitted from the earth's crust into the atmosphere before, during and after the great earthquakes. The 12 May 2008 Wenchuan M-S 8.0 earthquake occurred in the Longmenshan fault zone in western Sichuan, China, which locates in the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Spatial and temporal variations of total column (TotCO) and multiple layers (CO VMR) of CO differences associated with the Wenchuan earthquake were investigated using satellite data from AQUA AIRS in order to understand the lithospheric and atmospheric interactions during the seismic activity. The analyzing results indicated that anomalies of TotCO and multiple layers of CO VMR occurred along the fault zone, the peak values were found at the epicenter area, and the anomalies of TotCO and CO VMR appeared in the month of earthquake occurrence, which indicated that CO anomaly was closely related to the seismic and tectonic activities. The results could help to identify the earthquake anomalies and the meteorological anomalies.

The results showed that (1) The vegetation index of 32a in the study areas showed an increasing trend, the vegetation growth of Yongcheng was better than that of Xiayi, and the NDVI equivalent biomass was higher than that of Xiayi; (2) The SOS of the Yongxia experimental sites was significantly advanced, and the EOS was slightly advanced, resulting in a significant increase in the vegetation growth period in the two study areas, and the increase of vegetation LOS in Yongcheng experimental area was about 3 times that of summer maize. The advancement of LOS was the main way to respond to climate change by vegetation activities in Yongxia areas; (3) The NDVI in the study areas was significantly positively correlated with temperature and had no significant correlation with precipitation.

AB  - Systematic tree inventories based on field surveys are resource-intensive. Remote sensing data has shown added value herein, and current high-resolution images open the opportunity to apply novel methods such as deep learning neural networks achieving even higher accuracy on tree detection. In this study, an optimized palm tree inventory model is proposed based on the RetinaNet object detector and high-resolution RGB images. The aim was to classify and locate palm trees in different scenes, with a different appearance, and with varied ages. We used orthophoto imagery available from the municipality of Elche (Spain) with a spatial resolution of 25 cm. Date palms and canary palms, grown in the region, were inventoried. The detection model for palm tree inventory achieved a precision of 89.3% (mAP@IoU = 0.50) on the validation dataset and 76.9% (mAP@IoU = 0.50) on the test dataset. These results demonstrate the promising outcomes of applying deep learning approaches from computer vision to remote sensing image analysis.

TI  - A high-throughput shared service to estimate evapotranspiration using Landsat imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The execution of workflows to estimate time series of evapotranspiration (ET) from Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) data is a computing intensive activity. When running these workflows on their own personal computers, users usually need to restrict one or more of the following dimensions: resolution of input EOS data, size of the area of interest, and/or duration of the time series. Recently, a large public cloud provider has made available a platform for the parallel execution of these workflows. Although this system addresses the performance issue, it still presents limitations. In particular, it provides little support for the management of metadata associated with the executions that generated the ET estimations, impairing the effective sharing of such data. Additionally, it does not allow the reuse of already available implementations of ET estimation algorithms. Moreover, the service governance model is entirely defined by that service provider, raising risks that users may not want to face. We address all these challenges by leveraging software containerization technology. Firstly, we use containers to facilitate the deployment of independent and customizable ET processing services on top of either public or private clouds. This not only addresses the performance issue, but also provides freedom for each service to define its own governance model, in consonance with the needs of users. Secondly, we define a simple protocol allowing the easy integration of different container-based implementations of the different stages of the workflow, including those already available. Finally, the service automatically collects provenance information required for the effective sharing of the output it generates. The paper presents the architecture of the proposed service, emphasizing how it addresses the above-mentioned challenges, and provides a performance assessment of a small deployment. It also includes a discussion on possible applications that can benefit from the proposed service.

TI  - Skin incision versus laser - the influence of different techniques on scar formation and lymphatic drainage in rats. A preliminary report
T2  - POSTEPY DERMATOLOGII I ALERGOLOGII
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The constantly rising number of skin malignancies and increasing cancer awareness encourage more people to visit outpatient clinics in order to have various skin lesions removed. Despite the fact that scarring is a physiological response to any excision procedure, minimizing the size of it is a goal of every good practitioner. Therefore the question arises whether different techniques used to remove skin lesions may impact the formation and quality of skin scars.Aim: To perform an evaluation of skin scars formed by laser and surgical incisions and their influence on lymphatic outflow in rats.Material and methods: Five male rats were used. Using methylene blue, the migration of dye through lymphatic channels of the lower extremity was measured. Afterwards, transverse incisions were made distally using laser and a surgical blade. Wounds were left to heal by secondary intention. After 4 weeks dye migration assessment was repeated and tissue samples were obtained for microscopic evaluation.Results: Wounds after surgical incisions healed entirely. Wounds after laser treatment had not healed, with a visible area of granulation tissue and hair loss. Significantly worse dye migration was observed in rat extremities after laser therapy than after surgical incision (p = 0.007).Conclusions: The results of the study show that the size of the scar can depend on the incision technique used. Larger scars after laser therapy limit the lymphatic flow of the skin, which may have an adverse effect on mapping sentinel lymph nodes. However, this hypothesis requires further research.

AB  - The Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet) is a coordinated multinational effort to provide in situ data that are suitable for the radiometric calibration and validation of Earth observation sensors that operate in the visible to shortwave infrared solar reflective spectral region (400 nm to 1000 nm). The main goals of RadCalNet are to provide top-of-atmosphere reflectance data to the scientific community, standardize data collection protocols for automated test sites, and to document the SI-traceable uncertainty budgets for each automated test site, of which there are currently four. The data available from RadCalNet are suitable for the calibration and validation of spaceborne imaging spectrometers. The work presented here provides a description of RadCalNet as well as a sample of the current results from the Radiometric Calibration Test Site (RadCaTS), which is located at Railroad Valley, Nevada, USA. Selected sensors for comparison include Terra and Aqua MODIS, SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS, and Sentinel-3A and -3B OLCI.

AB  - Remote sensing has demonstrated its potential for wide-scale biodiversity monitoring. It overcomes the spatial limitations of ground-based measurements and allows acquiring high-temporal, -spatial and -spectral resolution data. The temporal trajectories of vegetation spectral responses hold information about time-specific physiological and morphological turnover that may express genetic constraints. We investigated the spectral response of individual trees derived from multi-temporal airborne imaging spectroscopy data along with genetic information and climatic variables. By deriving similarities of spectral and genetic distances, we present a multitemporal approach using remote sensing data to improve biodiversity monitoring at the level of genetic diversity within species.

T2  - WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT & REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotational shiftwork (RS) has been linked to increased risk for safety and health of shift workers, globally. A growing literature has revealed a trend toward increased accident and injury rates in shift workers than non-shift workers.AIMS: The present research was aimed: 1) to develop a methodological path for a preliminary objective assessment of occupational risk by RS in a metal industry 2) to detect the consequent effective interventions for moderating the RS risk.METHODS: A modified version of the Rotational Shiftwork Questionnaire was designed by a panel of experts, through a Delphi study; the questionnaire was used for a pilot study to assess the RS risk in a metal industry.RESULTS: The questionnaire was entitled Rotating Shiftwork Questionnaire-Industry (RSQ-I) and was made up of two sections: 1) Sentinel Events; 2) Risk Factors. The assessment of RS risk showed a medium level of risk in the studied metal industry. Organizational level interventions were detected for moderating the impact of RS-risk on workers' safety and health.CONCLUSION: RSQ-I showed a valid and reliable tool to analyze RS risk in a 24-hours metal industry. The pilot study demonstrated the effectiveness and feasibility of the introduced RSQ-I to approach the risk, through the analysis of both sentinel events and shift schedules.

AB  - This work had as main objective to map the gullies of the urban perimeter of the city of Rio Preto da Eva, in Amazonas. It is worth mentioning that these are erosive features that are characterized by having a great impact on the landscape, especially in urban environments. The registration form and the images generated by UAVs processed using the Agisoft Metashape software were used as tools. The extraction of geomorphometric data was performed using the Alos Palsar image, in which they were processed in the Arcgis 10.5 software to obtain hypsometry, contour lines and slope. The results indicate the existence of 3 gullies that add up to an area of more than 5,254.42 m(2) and an eroded volume of more than 89,000 m(3). Due to the characteristics observed in the field, it was found that these are quite active, and indicate risks for the population in their surroundings.

AB  - Although the atheist position of the English ethologist Richard Dawkins (1941) is closely associated with the publication of his work The god delusion (2006), intellectually, his nonreligious worldview was developed in his early works, particularly in The selfish gene (1976) and The blind watchmaker (1986). In this article, my objective is to talk about how the neo-Darwinism intellectual scene of the second half of the 20th century forged Richard Dawkins' atheism. Based on this epistemic basis, he develops an interpretation of the religious phenomenon presented in the book The god delusion.

M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Fluctuations in climate have been associated with variations in mosquito abundance.OBJECTIVES To analyse the influence of precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and humidity on the oviposition dynamics of Aedes aegypti in three distinct environmental areas (Brasilia Teimosa, Morro da ConceicAo/Alto Jose do Pinho and Dois Innaos/Pintos) of the city of Recife and the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago northeastern Brazil.METHODS Time series study using a database of studies previously carried out in the areas. The eggs were collected using spatially distributed geo-referenced sentinel ovitraps (S-OVTs). Meteorological satellite data were obtained from the IRI climate data library. The association between meteorological variables and egg abundance was analysed using autoregressive models.FINDINGS Precipitation was positively associated with egg abundance in three of the four study areas with a lag of one month. Higher humidity (beta= 45.7; 95% CI: 26.3 - 65.0) and lower wind speed (beta= -125.2; 95% CI: -198.8 - -51.6) were associated with the average number of eggs in the hill area.MAIN CONCLUSIONS The effect of climate variables on oviposition varied according to local environmental conditions. Precipitation was a main predictor of egg abundance in the study settings.

TI  - Land Use Land Cover Changes and Its drivers in Gojeb River Catchment, Omo Gibe Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) changes are inherently spatial and dynamic with high spatiotemporal variability resulted from complex human-environmental interactions. Current extents, rates and intensities of LULC changes are driving unprecedented changes in ecosystems functions and environmental processes at local, regional and global scales. The study was conducted to assess LULC changes and its drivers using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) in Gojeb River Catchment, Ethiopia. The satellite images at different reference years (1978, 1987, 2001 and 2015) were obtained from Landsat images. Supervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithm was applied for image processing and change analysis. The LULC classes identified were cropland, forestland, shrubland, swamp, and woodland. The study found that the catchment has undergone significant LULC changes. The major changes were expansion of cropland at the expense of other LULC classes at the rate of 29.56% in 1978, 38.91% in 1987, 46.62% in 2001 and 52.74% in 2015. It has gained about 160,736.08 ha with an annual average increment of 4,344.22 ha. Conversely, forestland has undergone reductions at an annual rate of 9,030.0 ha between 1978 and 1987. The conversions of other classes to cropland are mainly associated with more demand for crop production. On the other hand, the conversion of relevant part of forest land to other classes could be due to vegetation degradation. Hence, the conversion of forestland to other land use classes could be attributed to the highly demand of agricultural land, firewood, charcoal, timbers and housing materials. The major driving forces which should be considered in sustainable watershed management were population growth and government induced settlements. Provision of modern alternative sources of energy, agricultural inputs and promoting non-agricultural sectors are also other considerations for the community sustainable livelihood. It is critical to follow holistic view and management of the catchment for successful integrated watershed management endeavours.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article addresses the problem of estimating scene visibility in time series of satellite images. It focuses on satellites with few spectral bands and high revisit frequency. Our approach exploits the redundancy of information acquired during these revisits. It is based on an unsupervised algorithm that tracks local ground textures across time and detects ruptures caused mainly by opaque clouds and in some cases by haze, cirrus and shadows. Experiments have been carried out on 18 PlanetScope image times series of various locations. These time series come with handmade ground truth labels that are published together with this paper. We compare our results with the Unusable Data Masks (UDM) that Planet provides together with the images, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method: success rates of 97.78% and 89.36% are reached for the visible and occluded regions classification. This article is related to the following publication: [Tristan Dagobert, Jean-Michel Morel, Carlo de Franchis and Rafael Grompone von Gioi, Visibility detection in time series of Planetscope images, IEEE International Geoscience And Remote Sensing Symposium, 2019].

TI  - Cloud Detection by Luminance and Inter-band Parallax Analysis for Pushbroom Satellite Imagers
T2  - IMAGE PROCESSING ON LINE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a cloud detection algorithm for Earth observation images obtained by pushbroom satellite imagers. The pushbroom technology induces an inter-band acquisition delay leading to a parallax effect for the clouds. We propose a method exploiting this characteristic thanks to the analysis of the inter-band disparity. Several other features discriminating clouds are also defined and all are merged to build a robust a contrario statistical decision. Experiments applied on scenes acquired by various pushbroom satellites such as Sentinel-2, RapidEye and WorldView-2 show the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, we demonstrate a balanced accuracy rate close to 98% for cloud and non cloud classification for Sentinel-2 images.
