TI  - Seasonal impact on the relationship between land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index in an urban landscape
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study assesses the seasonal variation of land surface temperature (LST) and the relationship between LST and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on different types of land use/land cover (LULC) in Raipur City of India using 119 Landsat images of pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon and winter seasons from 1988 to 2019. The results show that the highest LST is found in the bare lands and built-up areas, whereas the lowest LST is observed in the green vegetation. The LST-NDVI correlation is strong negative in the monsoon (-0.51) and post-monsoon (-0.50) seasons, moderate negative (-0.46) in the pre-monsoon season and weak negative (-0.24) in the winter season. The different LULC types largely influence the nature and strength of the LST-NDVI correlation. The correlation is strong negative (-0.60) on green vegetation, moderate negative (-0.35) on the built-up area and bare land and nonlinear on the water bodies.

TI  - Biofuel Burning Influences Refractory Black Carbon Concentrations in Seasonal Snow at Lower Elevations of the Dudh Koshi River Basin of Nepal
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - When deposited on snow and ice, light absorbing impurities (LAIs) such as dust and black carbon (BC) reduce surface albedo and enhance melt. BC comes from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. Local and regional sources of BC exist in High Mountain Asia, such as dry-dung burning for heat and fuel, which occurs in close proximity to snow and glaciers. Local dust or dust transported from the Indo-Gangetic Plain is also present. In the Ganges River Basin, meltwater is dominated by seasonal snow, yet relatively few observations of impurities in seasonal snow exist. To understand sources of impurities and their concentrations for seasonal snow on land, we evaluated multiple lines of evidence to scale up from ground-based measurements in the Dudh Koshi River Basin, a remote headwater basin within the Khumbu Region of Nepal. We obtained ground-basedin-situobservations of refractory black carbon (rBC) measured by Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2), including size distributions in snow on land. We interpreted these results in the context of concurrent Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations and speciated aerosol optical depth derived from reanalysis products modeled with the Navy Aerosol Analysis Prediction System global aerosol model. We collected snow samples, mostly in the Gokyo Valley, at varying distances from local tea houses along a 2000 meters above sea level (m a.s.l.) elevation transect from 3250 to 5299 m a.s.l. rBC concentrations ranged from 3.9 to 76.8 mu g-rBC/L-H2O. Although previous data do not exist at these lower elevations, our findings are higher than previous surface snow results at higher elevations in the nearby Khumbu Valley. In general, rBC concentrations were lower in fresh snow than aged snow; concurrent MODIS satellite observations of snow albedo also show smaller impacts from LAIs in visible wavelengths in fresh snow. In aged snow samples, rBC decreased with elevation, as did concurrent MODIS albedo observations. rBC-particle size distributions also shifted to a larger mode for aged snow samples. Results from the Navy Aerosol Analysis Prediction System model indicate anthropogenic and biogenic fine aerosols from biofuel (dry-dung burning) are the primary aerosol species in the atmosphere for the study period, at similar to thrice the concentration of dust and smoke.

TI  - First Direct Observational Evidence for Secondary Gravity Waves Generated by Mountain Waves Over the Andes
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A mountain wave with a significant brightness temperature amplitude and similar to 500 km horizontal wavelength was observed over the Andes on 24-25 July 2017 in Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS)/Aqua satellite data. In the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), reanalysis data, the intense eastward wind flowed over the Andes. Visible/Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)/Suomi-NPP (National Polar-orbiting Partnership) did not detect the mountain waves; however, it observed concentric ring-like waves in the nightglow emissions at similar to 87 km with similar to 100 km wavelengths on the same night over and leeward of the Southern Andes. A ray tracing analysis showed that the mountain waves propagated to the east of the Andes, where concentric ring-like waves appeared above a region of mountain wave breaking. Therefore, the concentric ring-like waves were likely secondary waves generated by momentum deposition that accompanied mountain wave breaking. These results provide the first direct evidence for secondary gravity waves generated by momentum deposition.

TI  - Enhancing Accuracy of Air Quality and Temperature Forecasts During Paddy Crop Residue Burning Season in Delhi Via Chemical Data Assimilation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the accuracy of Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) generated 72 hr fine particulate matter (PM2.5) forecasts in Delhi during the crop residue burning season of October-November 2017 with respect to assimilation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals, persistent fire emission assumption, and aerosol-radiation interactions. The assimilation significantly pushes the model AOD and PM2.5 toward the observations with the largest changes below 5 km altitude in the fire source regions (northeastern Pakistan, Punjab, and Haryana) as well as the receptor New Delhi. WRF-Chem forecast with MODIS AOD assimilation, aerosol-radiation feedback turned on, and real-time fire emissions reduce the mean bias by 88-195 mu g/m(3) (70-86%) with the largest improvement during the peak air pollution episode of 6-13 November 2017. Aerosol-radiation feedback contributes similar to 21%, similar to 25%, and similar to 24% to reduction in mean bias of the first, second, and third days of PM2.5 forecast. Persistence fire emission assumption is found to work really well, as the accuracy of PM2.5 forecasts driven by persistent fire emissions was only 6% lower compared to those driven by real fire emissions. Aerosol-radiation feedback extends the benefits of assimilating satellite AOD beyond PM2.5 forecasts to surface temperature forecast with a reduction in the mean bias of 0.9-1.5 degrees C (17-30%). These results demonstrate that air quality forecasting can benefit substantially from satellite AOD observations particularly in developing countries that lack resources to rapidly build dense air quality monitoring networks.

TI  - New Insights Into the Vertical Structure of Clouds in Polar Lows, Using Radar-Lidar Satellite Observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - For the first time, we characterize the vertical distribution of cloud microphysical properties in polar lows (PLs). We base our investigation on colocations found between A-Train satellites overpasses and 82 PL occurrences evidenced from AVHRR observations in the Nordic Seas. We use the raDAR/liDAR DARDAR satellite cloud products to retrieve the thermodynamic phase and ice microphysical properties of clouds (ice water content [IWC] and ice crystal effective radius [r(eff)]). Two thirds of the investigated PLs show cloud tops higher than commonly documented (5 km), and up to 9 km. PLs are largely dominated by the ice phase, with more supercooled liquid occurrences in the eye. We also show that spiraliform clouds have larger average IWC in the few kilometers below cloud top, by up to a factor of 2, compared to comma-shaped PLs.

TI  - Regional development in Amazonas, Peru: science-society interactions for sustainability
T2  - ANTHROPOCENE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientific-technological knowledge maintains the anthropocentric power-pattern and exploitive attitude with regard to nature, butsustainability scienceasks for an integration of territorial and decontextualized knowledge systems. Visual participatory methodologies involving diverse local stakeholder facilitate dialogue on environmental and sustainability issues. Inspired by visual ethnography and mediated discourse analysis, the present article uses semiological analysis to reconstruct the depicted narratives on the nature-society system in drawings representing "regional development". The drawings were elaborated in a series of participatory workshops involving university faculty and students, regional government and non-governmental organizations and farmers from local communities in the northern Amazonian region of Peru. The analysis reveals a prevailing anthropo and technology centered, "colonial" conception of the nature-society system, and a marginalization of alternative narratives. Beyond confirming the potential for visual participatory methods to enhance multi-stakeholder dialogue, it demonstrates how semiological analysis can be used to deepen an understanding of the cultural, organizational and technological constraints facing critical, trans-disciplinary efforts to decolonize the technology-centered, anthropocentric mainstream worldview of nature and society.

TI  - Fusion of multispectral imagery and LiDAR data for roofing materials and roofing surface conditions assessment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of rooftop rainwater harvesting (RRWH) quality and suitability requires detail and reliable information on roofs. Characterization of roof surface conditions affects the quality of harvested rainwater. Nevertheless, the implementation of the system requires improvement in terms of the roof detection techniques to ensure the roof of the building is selected appropriately. Thus, the classification techniques need to be optimized to detect roof materials and roof surface conditions (new or old) with high accuracy. This study aimed to produce high precision detailed roof materials and roof surface conditions map with using high-resolution remote sensing imagery, WorldView-3 (WV3) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Three different fusion methods; layer stacking (LS), Gram-Schmidt (GS) and principal components spectral sharpening (PCSS) were explored and their performances were compared to improve the spatial and spectral richness of the image. Subsequently, the roof materials and roof surface conditions classes which include old concrete, new concrete, old metal, new metal, old asbestos and new asbestos had been discriminated by employing support vector machine (SVM) and the rule-based technique known as a decision tree (DT). Generally, generated rule-sets present a higher overall accuracy with 87%, 72% and 66% for LS, GS and PCSS, respectively. For SVM classifier, the maximum accuracy recorded for LS, PCSS and GS were 70%, 63% and 43% respectively. Therefore, rule-based classification via LS fusion technique was utilized to identify suitable rooftops for the development of harvested rainwater system in the urban area. Findings indicate that the degradation status of a roof in heterogenous urban environments could be determined from satellite observation and the quality of roof-based harvested rainwater affected by roofing materials and roofing surface conditions can be analysed effectively.

TI  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image processing for operational space-based agriculture mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Few countries are using space-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to operationally produce national-scale maps of their agricultural landscapes. For the past ten years, Canada has integrated C-band SAR with optical satellite data to map what crops are grown in every field, for the entire country. While the advantages of SAR are well understood, the barriers to its operational use include the lack of familiarity with SAR data by agricultural end-user agencies and the lack of a 'blueprint' on how to implement an operational SAR-based mapping system. This research reviewed order of operations for SAR data processing and how order choice affects processing time and classification outcomes. Additionally this research assessed the impact of speckle filtering by testing three filter types (adaptive, multi-temporal and multi-resolution) at varying window sizes for three study sites with different average field sizes. The Touzi multi-resolution filter achieved the highest overall classification accuracies for all three sites with varying window sizes, and with only a small (< 2%) difference in accuracy relative to the Gamma MaximumA Posteriori(MAP) adaptive filter which had similar window sizes across sites. As such, the assessment of order of operations for noise reduction and terrain correction was completed using the Gamma MAP adaptive filter. This research found there was no difference in classification accuracies regardless of whether noise reduction was applied before or after terrain correction. However, implementing the terrain correction as the first operation resulted in a 10 to 50% increase in processing time. This is an important consideration when designing and delivering operational systems, especially for large geographies like Canada where hundreds of SAR images are required. These findings will encourage country-wide, regional and global food monitoring initiatives to consider SAR sensors as an important source of data to operationally map agricultural production.

TI  - Glacier mapping and change analysis in Chandra basin, Western Himalaya, India during 1971-2016
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For carrying out glacier change analysis in Chandra basin, Western Himalaya, India during 1971-2016, glacier inventory is generated for year 2002 using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model Version 2 (GDEM V2) data. Total 395 glaciers are mapped covering 703.3 +/- 20.4 km(2)area with minimum glacier size being >0.02 km(2). Out of these, 59 glaciers have debris-covered ice covering an area of 67.2 +/- 1.9 km(2). In this study, a subset of 169 glaciers is used for glacier area change analysis using Corona KH-4B (1971), Landsat ETM+ (2002) and Sentinel-2 (2016) images due to the availability of cloud free data sources. In 1971, 639.4 +/- 5.8 km(2)glacier area is estimated which decreased to 620.2 +/- 18.0 km(2)(-3.0 +/- 3.0%) in 2002 and 608.1 +/- 10.3 km(2)(-4.9 +/- 1.9%) in 2016. The change in glacier length of Samudra Tapu and Gepang Gath glaciers is showing increasing trend since last two decades as compared to Hamtah, Chhota Shigri and Bara Shigri glaciers due to presence of pro-glacial lake at their snout. Clean-ice glaciers, glaciers with low mean elevation, glaciers having steep surface, glaciers with west to south and east to south orientation, small size glaciers and glaciers having pro-glacial lake at the snout are responsible to higher loss in glacier area. Statistical trend analysis using Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator test show that Asian Precipitation-Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation (APHRODITE) based annual mean temperature have rising trend at a rate of 0.02 degrees C per year during 1961-2015, and can be ascribed as one of the factors for glacier shrinking.

TI  - Mapping thermokarst lakes and ponds across permafrost landscapes in the Headwater Area of Yellow River on northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The large variety of the semi-automated methods in mapping the surface water bodies and the frequent omission of ponds (< 10,000 m(2)) from permafrost regions inventories motivates this work. Based on the correlation matrix, several widely used classification methods for mapping the surface water bodies were assessed. Water bodies inventory was generated at a local and landscape scale in the Headwater Area of the Yellow River (HAYR) on a Sentinel-2 satellite image from 23 November 2015. The assessed methods are: spectral water indices, supervised and unsupervised classifiers (k-means, Density Slicing, Maximum Likelihood Classification - MLC), and machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Support Vector Machines). The MLC method applied on visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands represents the best ratio regarding the accuracy (96%), Kappa coefficient (0.87), and water surface (14.87 km(2)). However, misclassifications are still present, which requires manual editing. Based on the MLC approach, 651 more water bodies were identified than previous inventories. Ponds are account for up to 93% of the 966 of individual water bodies and contribute to 42% of the total water surface, in the context that were omitted before. This analysis emphasize the importance of method settings for the classifier performance, as well as the ponds abundance and substantial contribution to the total water surface. This inventory will improve the general circulation models and provides baseline information for sustainable management of water resources in the HAYR, one of the core Asian Water Towers.

TI  - Landslide Monitoring and the Inventory Map Validation by Ensemble DInSAR Processing of ASAR and PALSAR Images (Case Study: Doab-Samsami Basin in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, Iran)
T2  - GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications of Synthetic Aperture Sensors (SAR) and particularly Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) have provided new opportunities for detecting and monitoring of slow and even fast land deformations such as landslides and also updating their inventory maps. Employing this technique has made possible continuous detection and monitoring of small land movements with high precision over a wide spread area. In this study, two image series including 12 radar images with descending orbit acquired by ASAR sensor of ENVISAT satellite and 10 radar images with ascending orbit collected by PALAR sensor of ALOS satellite were selected and processed by the DInSAR method in order to detect landslides in the Doab-Samsami basin in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, Iran. Landslides detected in the study area cover over 5959 hec according to the processing of ASAR and PALSAR images collected between 2003 and 2011, whereas landslides detected by field studies cover over 5056 hec. Based on the results of the radar processing technique for detecting and mapping of landslides, the ASAR images can provide more details of slides due to their shorter wavelengths but the PALSAR images have comparatively greater penetration and lower incoherence due to the longer wavelengths. Results of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) method show a well agreement between the landslides map provided by the DInSAR approach and field study. The area under the curve of receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was estimated to be 0.95 with a standard deviation of 0.02 at 95% confidence level. The Cohen's Kappa of 0.61 indicate relatively good conformity between classification of the detected landslide distribution in the study area based on the DInSAR method and field survey.

TI  - Mapping plant functional types in Northwest Himalayan foothills of India using random forest algorithm in Google Earth Engine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant functional types (PFTs) have been widely used to represent the vegetation characteristics and their interlinkage with the surrounding environment in various earth system models. The present study aims to generate a PFT map for the Northwest Himalayan (NWH) foothills of India using seasonality parameters, topographic conditions, and climatic information from various satellite data and products using Random Forest (RF) algorithm in Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The seasonality information was extracted by carrying out a harmonic analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series (2008 to 2018) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra surface reflectance 8 day 500 m data (MOD09A1). For topographic information, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) derived aspect and Multi-Scale Topographic Position Index (MTPI) were used, whereas, for climatic variables, WorldClim V2 Bioclimatic (Bioclim) variables were used. RF, a machine learning classifier, was used to generate a PFT map using these datasets. The overall accuracy of the resulting PFT map was found to be 83.33% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.71. The present study provides an effective approach for PFT classification using different well-established, freely available satellite data and products in the GEE platform. This approach can also be implemented in different ecological settings by using various meaningful variables at varying resolutions.

TI  - Synergetic utilization of sentinel-1 SAR and sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data for surface soil moisture estimation for Rupnagar, Punjab, India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to improper agricultural and soil management, there has been a drop in crop yield over the last few years and food security has become a major issue. For a country like India, with a huge population to cater, the problem becomes more serious. Since the inception of remote sensing in scientific agriculture management, optical remote sensing along with field data has been used for soil health monitoring and mapping. SAR or microwave remote sensing has an all-weather and high temporal data availability which has found applications for various domains. For soil health studies of multiple soil classes and sub-classes of same type, both aerial and spaceborne SAR remote sensing is currently in use for a multitude of monitoring and parameter modelling approaches. This study utilizes Sentinel 1 A, C-band SAR remote sensing data with VV and VH polarization channels for surface soil moisture estimation for alluvial soil and its sub-types in Rupnagar of Punjab state in India. While Index based OLS Regression method for soil moisture estimation was done using backscatter from Sentinel-1A SAR data, it was validated using Normalized Differential Moisture Index (NDMI) generated from Sentinel 2 optical datasets. This approach though did not consider the actual soil moisture data from field yet gave a low Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.5 and R2-statistics of 0.72 (72%) in training and testing phases. The Index based OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) Regression method for soil moisture estimation aims to establish a technique for cases when field data is either not available or the study area is not easily accessible. In the statistical approach with field data, the same OLS model, when replaced by on-field surface soil moisture data gave a RMSE of 1.9 and R2-statistics of 0.968 and 0.948 in training and testing phases respectively at 97.5% confidence level. The study is significant for using freely available optical and SAR remote sensing data parameters synergistically, in a simplified manner for surface soil moisture estimation. The results have comparable accuracies given by studies using commercial data and complex modelling approaches.

TI  - Comparing the potential of stereo aerial photographs, stereo very high-resolution satellite images, and TanDEM-X for estimating forest height
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is generally known as the most accurate and primary source providing the 3D structure of forest canopy model (CHM) information; however, in many countries, it is not updated as needed for continuous forest management planning due to its high costs. Image-based point clouds derived from airborne stereo aerial photographs, space-borne stereo very high-resolution WorldView-2, and TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement (TanDEM-X) can also be used for the generation of the CHM. In this study, we compared the performance of three types of 3D data, i.e. stereo aerial photographs, stereo very high-resolution WorldView-2, and TanDEM-X for the retrieval of forest CHM. Digital surface models (DSMs) generated from image-based point clouds produced from stereo aerial photographs and stereo WorldView-2 using image-matching algorithms and from TanDEM-X data using interferometry. Finally, three types of CHMs generated by subtracting ALS-based digital terrain model (DTM) from the above three DSMs. Plot-level heights and density metrics extracted from the CHMs and regressed with the field-based Lorey's mean, and maximum height. Stereo aerial photographic CHM showed the most accurate results with root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 1.71 m, followed by high-resolution stereo WorldView-2 with RMSE = 2.04 m, and TanDEM-X with RMSE = 2.13 m, respectively. Also, for maximum height, we obtained higher accuracy for image-based point clouds with RMSE = 2.33 m, followed by high-resolution stereo WorldView-2 with RMSE = 2.71 m, and TanDEM-X with RMSE = 2.81 m, respectively. Our overall finding indicated that stereo aerial photography is the most accurate option followed by stereo very high-resolution WorldView-2 and TanDEM-X data for estimating forest heights. The study shares valuable information for the generation and regular update of forest structure information in the presence of pre-existing ALS DTM.

TI  - Soil moisture estimation using Bayesian Maximum Entropy algorithm from FY3-B, MODIS and ASTER GDEM remote-sensing data in a maize region of HeBei province, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) algorithm that can model larger-scale spatial heterogeneity and integrate multiple types of data is a better spatial estimation algorithm in avoiding the circular problem and improving the estimation accuracy of parameters than original empirical geostatistic and spatial statistic methods. To obtain higher-resolution and higher-accuracy soil moisture (SM) data, this study used the BME algorithm to integrate the multiple environmental factor variables related to SM as auxiliary data (11 data sets in total) such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and Albedo products with 1 kilometre (km) grid resolution from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) satellite data, and the Slope, Aspect, Plan curvature, Profile curvature, Surface roughness, Wetness index, Relief amplitude products generated from ASTER GDEM data. First, the FengYun 3-B satellite (FY3-B) SM product with 25 km grid resolution was downscaled to 1 km grid resolution using the visible, infrared (IR), and microwave fusion method. The downscaled FY3-B SM data and auxiliary data were used to generate the weighted probability soft data (SD) under four cases, case 1: 500 sample points of SD, case 2: 450 sample points of SD, case 3: 400 sample points of SD, and case 4: 350 sample points of SD. Particularly, we used two methods, the multivariable correlation analysis method and principal component analysis (PCA) method to get the weight values of environmental factor variables, i.e. NDVI, LST, Albedo, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Slope, Aspect, Plan curvature, Profile curvature, Surface roughness, Wetness index, and Relief amplitude with SM. Then, thein-situSM measurements as hard data (HD) were used to calibrate the weighted probability SD in the procedure of BME SM estimation. The SM under four cases were estimated from the weighted probability SD and HD using BME algorithm. Finally, comparisons of the estimated SM using BME algorithm within-situSM measurements at maize study area were carried out in this study. Our results indicated that the accuracy of the estimated SM using BME algorithm, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.049 cm(3) cm(-3), the correlation coefficient (r) = 0.639, the unbiased RMSE (RMSEu) = 0.047 cm(3) cm(-3), and Bias = 0.002 cm(3) cm(-3), under case 1 based on PCA method was obviously better than the downscaled FY3-B SM (RMSE = 0.079 cm(3) cm(-3),r= 0.096, RMSEu = 0.069 cm(3)cm(-3), and Bias = 0.039 cm(3)cm(-3)) that was generated by the visible, IR, and microwave fusion method. We concluded that integrating auxiliary data into SM estimation using BME algorithm could further improve the downscaled FY3-B SM that was generated by visible, IR, and microwave fusion method.

TI  - High-Resolution Surface Velocities and Strain for Anatolia From Sentinel-1 InSAR and GNSS Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of present-day surface deformation are essential for the assessment of long-term seismic hazard. The European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellites enable global, high-resolution observation of crustal motion from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). We have developed automated InSAR processing systems that exploit the first similar to 5 years of Sentinel-1 data to measure surface motions for the similar to 800,000-km(2) Anatolian region. Our new 3-D velocity and strain rate fields illuminate deformation patterns dominated by westward motion of Anatolia relative to Eurasia, localized strain accumulation along the North and East Anatolian Faults, and rapid vertical signals associated with anthropogenic activities and to a lesser extent extension across the grabens of western Anatolia. We show that automatically processed Sentinel-1 InSAR data can characterize details of the velocity and strain rate fields with high resolution and accuracy over large regions. These results are important for assessing the relationship between strain accumulation and release in earthquakes.Plain Language Summary Satellite-based measurements of small rates of motion of the Earth's surface made at high spatial resolutions and over large areas are important for many geophysical applications including improving earthquake hazard models. We take advantage of recent advances in geodetic techniques in order to measure surface velocities and tectonic strain accumulation across the Anatolia region, including the highly seismogenic and often deadly North Anatolian Fault. We show that by combining Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements we can enhance our view of surface deformation associated with active tectonics, the earthquake cycle, and anthropogenic processes.

TI  - Automatic distortion-suppressed time series fitting method for irregular sampled NDVI
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) fitting, which describes the discrete time series observations with a mathematical model, can remove the residual noise, fill in the missing data, and produce a noise-free continuous time series; therefore, numerous time series fitting methods have been developed, but most of them focused on regularly sampled, noise-suppressed data, as NDVI time series derived from medium-spatial remote sensing images has irregular sampled and distortion-intensive characteristic, limiting the applicability of traditional methods. To address this problem, an automatic distortion-suppressed time series fitting method for irregular sampled NDVI is proposed in this paper. First, the observation quality is evaluated: (I) the observations on a fully clear image are identified as clear observations. (II) According to the prior knowledge that the NDVI is underestimated, the observations in the upper convex hull and above the line of two temporal-adjacent clear observations (identified by fully clear image and upper convex) are labelled as clear observations. (III) As the temporal evolution of NDVI is a slow and continuous process, deep-V observations, which has experienced an abrupt decrease and increase consecutively, are identified as noisy observations. Second, different weights are assigned to observations based on the quality assessment result, and the NDVI time series is weighted fitted. To highlight the observations above the fitting line and suppress those below the fitting line, the weights are updated according to the direction and distance between the actual observation and fitting prediction value. Then, fitting and reweighting processes are repeated until a stable fitting result is obtained. We use images acquired by the Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 satellite in Shouxian, Anhui Province to construct NDVI time series and test the method. The result demonstrates that our method can suppress the distortion and realize time series fitting automatically, compared with the state of art method, our method can obtain reasonably overestimation of the NDVI, providing an alternative for fitting irregular sampled NDVI.

TI  - The utility of fusing multi-sensor data spatio-temporally in estimating grassland aboveground biomass in the three-river headwaters region of China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is crucial for effective grassland utilization. However, most current satellites cannot provide data with high spatial and temporal resolutions simultaneously. Spatiotemporal fusion models can combine the resolution advantages of different remote sensing data and support high-precision vegetation monitoring. In order to obtain accurate grassland AGB maps with high resolution in the Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR) of China, we developed an estimation method based on the synthetic 30 m growing season averaged normalized difference vegetation index (GS-NDVI), which was fused from 30 m Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and 250 m Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data. To choose the optimal fusion model, we investigated the performances of three spatiotemporal fusion models for NDVI fusion, the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM), and the rule-based piecewise regression tree model (RPRTM). The three models all produced reasonable NDVI predictions, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.58 to 0.86. RPRTM had the highest efficiency and was more suitable for large-scale spatiotemporal data fusion. Compared with the models generated from 250 m MODIS GS-NDVI, the AGB estimation models based on 30 m synthetic GS-NDVI were more accurate, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods. The resulting AGB map of 30 m resolution provides spatially detailed AGB information that will be useful for regional ecosystem studies and local land management decisions.

TI  - On the Performance of Sentinel-3 Altimetry Over New Reservoirs: Approaches to Determine Onboard A Priori Elevation
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite radar altimetry has become an important data source supplementing in situ water level. For practical reasons, a radar altimeter can only record reflected echoes within its range window. Therefore, water surface elevation must fall within the range window. To this end, the Sentinel-3 radar altimetry mission is configured with a new tracking function (i.e., open loop) to position its range window based on an onboard a priori elevation of ground targets. We found that Sentinel-3 is unable to observe recently built reservoirs due to the incorrect onboard elevations. To overcome this issue, four approaches are proposed to improve the a priori elevation for inland water bodies, particularly reservoirs. These approaches can significantly increase data availability of Sentinel-3 over reservoirs and can be used to prepare the onboard elevations of reservoirs and lakes for future missions such as Sentinel-6, Sentinel-3C/-3D, and the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission.

TI  - Coupling high-resolution field monitoring and MODIS for reconstructing wetland historical hydroperiod at a high temporal frequency
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Historical wetland hydrology data are instrumental to support the design of wetland management and restoration strategies but are rarely available. In this study, we tested the capabilities and limitations of a simple methodological framework based on publicly available MODIS Land Reflectance Products to estimate wetland soil surface saturation and inundation spatiotemporal dynamics. Using supervised learning and high-resolution groundwater and surface water elevation data, the framework searches for spectral algorithms, referred to as the wet/dry wetland status classifier (WSC) and the continuous wetland dynamics identifier (WDI), that best predict upper soil layer wetness status in the study wetland. We used Google Earth Engine (GEE) for fast access and processing of the full range of MODIS data. The capabilities of GEE also enabled us to readily conduct a comparative assessment of the MODIS 8-day composite and daily collections and test various pixel-level quality filters to select reliable data at the highest possible temporal resolution. We tested the framework on the internationally-recognized Ramsar site Palo Verde National Park wetland in Costa Rica, and we obtained good results (overall prediction accuracy of 86.6% and kappa coefficient of 0.7 for the WSC; r(2) of 0.71 for the WDI). High-resolution water level data allowed us to assess the challenges, promises and limitations of using MODIS products for wetland hydrology applications. We then applied the WSC and WDI to map the 2000-2016 sub-weekly wetland hydroperiod at 500m resolution, achieving a temporal resolution rarely matched in remote sensing for wetland studies. The analysis of the end-products, combined with the field water elevation data, provided new insights into the drivers controlling the spatiotemporal dynamics of hydroperiod within the Palo Verde wetland and did not reveal any significant temporal trends. The WSC and WDI framework developed here can be useful for reconstructing long-term hydroperiod variability and uncovering its drivers for other wetland systems globally.

TI  - A multi-sensor and modeling analysis of a severe convective storm in Lake Maggiore area (northwestern Italy)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of a severe convective storm, occurred in northwestern Italy during late summer 2012, is presented here. The event was characterized by heavy precipitation, hail and intense wind gusts, causing injuries and damages to trees, buildings and infrastructures.The description of the case study draws upon a wide palette of observational data. Surface and upper-air observations helped characterize the event, emphasizing the rapid changes in the meteorological parameters in the study area; satellite data highlights the presence of deep moist convection, associated with strong updrafts; Doppler radar allows the identification of the main features of the event in terms of storm-motion, hail detection/probability and the possible presence of a mesocyclone.A high-resolution (3 km inner grid spacing) simulation with the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model was performed to study the atmospheric conditions conducive to convection, as well as to estimate the main instability parameters. The main features of the storm were well reproduced with WRF; furthermore, the high values of the simulated instability parameters denote the presence of favourable conditions for severe convection.The analysis of this event shows that supercells can develop also in a pre-alpine environment, characterized by a complex orography, in particular in the sub-regions where the local morphology creates conditions favourable for severe weather development.

TI  - Estimating the Columnar Concentrations of Black Carbon Aerosols in China Using MODIS Products
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Black carbon (BC), the strongest light-absorbing particle, is believed to play substantial roles in regional air quality and global climate change. In this study, taking advantage of the high quality of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products, we developed a new algorithm to estimate the BC columnar concentrations over China by simulating the BC and non-BC aerosol mixing states in detail. The results show that our new algorithm produces a reliable estimation of BC aerosols, in which BC columnar concentrations and their related parameters (aerosol absorption and BC surface concentration) show reasonable agreements and low biases compared with ground-based measurements. The uncertainties of BC retrievals are mainly associated with the surface and aerosol assumptions used in the algorithm, ranging from -14 to 44% at higher aerosol optical depth (AOD > 0.5). The proposed algorithm can improve the capability of space-borne aerosol remote sensing by successfully distinguishing BC from other aerosols. The acquired BC columnar concentrations enable the spatial pattern of serious BC aerosol pollution over East China to be characterized, showing that it exhibits higher levels in winter. These nationwide results are beneficial for estimating BC emissions, proposing mitigation strategies for air pollution, and potentially reducing the uncertainties of climate change studies.

TI  - Influence of surface water on coarse resolution C-band backscatter: Implications for freeze/thaw retrieval from scatterometer data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The freeze/thaw state of permafrost landscapes is an essential variable for monitoring ecological, hydrological and climate processes. Ground surface state can be obtained from satellite data through time series analysis of C-band backscatter from scatterometer and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations. Scatterometer data has been used in a variety of studies concerning freeze/thaw retrieval of the land surface. Coarse spatial resolution scatterometer data has great potential for application in this field due to its high temporal resolution (approx. daily observations). In this study, we investigate the influence of sub-grid cell (12.5 km) surface water (ice free and ice covered) on freeze/thaw retrieval based on ASCAT data using a threshold algorithm. We found discrepancies related to the surface water fraction in the detected timing of thawing and freezing of up to 2 days earlier thawing for spring and 3.5 days earlier freezing for autumn for open water fractions of 40% resulting in an overestimation of the frozen season. Results of this study led to the creation of a method for correction of water fraction impact on freeze/thaw data. Additionally, this study demonstrates the applicability of a new approach to freeze/thaw retrieval which has not so far been tested for SAR, specifically Sentinel-1.

TI  - Evaluation of global leaf area index and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation products over North America using Copernicus Ground Based Observations for Validation data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With a growing number of Earth observation (EO) products available through operational programmes such as the European Union's Copernicus, there is increasing emphasis on product accuracy and uncertainty, necessitating evaluation against in situ reference measurements. Whilst existing reference datasets have proven a valuable resource, they incorporate little data with which products from recent EO instruments can be assessed. A reliance on individual field campaigns has also led to several inconsistencies, whilst limiting the extent to which temporal variations in EO product performance can be captured. Recently established environmental monitoring networks such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), which collect routine in situ measurements using standardised instruments and protocols, provide a promising opportunity in this respect. The Copernicus Ground Based Observations for Validation (GBOV) service was initiated in recognition of this fact. In the first component of the project, raw observations from existing networks have been collected and processed to provide reference data for a range of EO land products. In this study, we focus on leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR). Raw digital hemispherical photography (DHP) from twenty NEON sites was processed to derive in situ reference measurements, which were then upscaled to provide high spatial resolution reference maps. Using these data, we assess the recently released Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) 300 m Version 1 (V1) products derived from PROBA-V, in addition to existing products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). When evaluated against reference data, the CGLS 300 m V1 product demonstrated the best agreement (RMSD = 0.57 for LAI and 0.08 for FAPAR), followed by the Collection 6 VNP15A2H and MOD15A2H products (RMSD = 0.81 to 0.89 for LAI and 0.12 for FAPAR). Differing assumptions of the products and in situ reference measurements, which cause them to be sensitive to slightly different quantities, are thought to explain apparent biases over sparse vegetation and forest environments. To ensure their continued utility, future work should focus on updating the GBOV in situ reference measurements, implementing additional corrections, and improving their geographical representativeness.

TI  - Disruptive influences of residual noise, network configuration and data gaps on InSAR-derived land motion rates using the SBAS technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) small baseline subset (SBAS) technique can be applied to land with varying deformation magnitudes ranging from mm/yr to tens of cm/yr. SBAS defines a network of interferograms that is limited by temporal and spatial baseline thresholds that are often applied arbitrarily, or in apparently subjective ways in the literature. We use simulated SAR data to assess (1) the influence of residual noise and SBAS network configuration on InSAR-derived deformation rates, and (2) how the number of interferograms and data gaps in the time series may further impact the estimated rates. This leads us to an approach for defining a SBAS network based on geodetic reliability theory represented by the redundancy number (r-number). Simulated InSAR datasets are generated with three subsidence signals of linear rates plus sinusoidal annual amplitudes of -2 mm/yr plus 2 mm, -20 mm/yr plus 5 mm and -100 mm/yr plus 10 mm, contaminated by Gaussian residual noise bounded within [-2; +2] mm, [-5; +5] mm and [-10; +10] mm, corresponding to standard deviations of approximately 0.5 mm, 1.5 mm and 3.0 mm, respectively. The influence of data gaps is investigated through simulations with percentages of missing data ranging from 5% to 50% that are selected (1) randomly across the 4-year time series, and (2) for three-month windows to represent the northern winter season where snow cover may cause decorrelation. These simulations show that small deformation rates are most adversely affected by residual noise. In some extreme cases, the recovered trends can be contrary to the signal (i.e., indicating uplift when there is simulated subsidence). We demonstrate through simulations that the r-number can be used to pre-determine the reliability of SBAS network design, indicating the r-values between similar to 0.8 and similar to 0.9 are optimal. r-numbers less than similar to 0.3 can deliver erroneous rates in the presence of noise commensurate with the magnitude of deformation. Finally, the influence of data gaps is not as significant compared to other factors such as a change in the number of interferograms used, although the blocks of "winter" gaps in the SBAS network show a larger effect on the rates than gaps at random intervals across the simulated time series.

TI  - Land subsidence and its relation with groundwater aquifers in Beijing Plain of China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Beijing is a major metropolis with significant land subsidence because of long-term overexploitation of groundwater. While the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SWDP) has provided new water sources Beijing; it has changed the pattern of land subsidence evolution in Beijing since 2015. Here we address how land subsidence evolution before and after SWDP, and we quantify also the impact of groundwater level changes in different aquifers on land subsidence at spatial scale. Subsidence evolution before and after SWDP were compared by adopting Persistent Scatterer Inteferomotry (PSI) with Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 data. Spatial correlation between Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) derived subsidence and groundwater levels in four aquifers was investigated using the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm and Geographical Detectors (GD) technique. Extensometer deformation data and corresponding variation in groundwater level observations at three monitoring stations were used for validations. The study reveals that: firstly, both InSAR-derived subsidence area and maximum annual deformation rate decreased from 79.2% and 141 mm/yr before SWDP, to 60.1% and 135 mm/yr after SWDP. A reduction of time series deformation at four subsidence centers started about two years after the commence of SWDP in 2015. Secondly, the variation of groundwater level in the second confined aquifer has the strongest spatial correlation with subsidence in all the aquifers, but its impact on this aquifer has decreased after SWDP. These findings have an important scientific significance for the rational allocation of water resources and management strategy for mitigating hazards associated with subsidence against the background of SWDP.

TI  - Accurate landslide detection leveraging UAV-based aerial remote sensing
T2  - IET COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is significantly important in emergency rescue applications and operations. Particularly, the on-site images from UAVs can provide valuable information for hazard identification and disaster assessment. In this study, the authors propose a novel method by using back propagation neural networks with feature fusion to detect landslides from UAV images. Specifically, the authors first construct a fundamental shape model of landslides and devise a scale-invariant feature transform algorithm for feature matching and transformation. By fusing the spatial shape features and spectral features of the landslide, the suspected landslide object from UAV images can be detected initially. Next, the change features of a pre/post-landslide object are extracted by using the satellite sensing images (before landslide) and the UAV image (after landslide). The authors further feed the change features into the proposed model to enhance the precision and accuracy of landslide detection. They conduct numerous experimental studies with aerospace remote sensing data in two real-world landslide scenarios. The evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline algorithms by achieving over 91% accuracy in landslide detection.

TI  - Improving the practicability of remote sensing data-assimilation-based crop yield estimations over a large area using a spatial assimilation algorithm and ensemble assimilation strategies
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assimilating remote sensing data with crop growth model is a promising method to estimate crop yields over a large area. However, the method is always subject to the problems with biases in remote sensing products and assimilation weights in practical applications. In this study, we demonstrated the robustness of a 'spatial assimilation' method in dealing with the biases in three different remote sensing leaf area index (LAI) products. We further explored assimilation strategies for determining the assimilation weights when using 'spatial assimilation' method. Three different remote sensing LAI products were assimilated with MCWLA-Wheat model in the North China Plain during 2008-2015. The results demonstrated that the 'spatial assimilation' method was robust in mitigating the influences of biased LAI values and easily coupled with various LAI products based on different sources and retrieving algorithms. Furthermore, we found that the historical experiences of the optimal assimilation weights were not suitable to directly drive data assimilation in the coming seasons. Thus data-assimilation strategies to estimate crop yields without prior knowledge on the optimal assimilation weights were investigated. Two ensemble-mean-based assimilation strategies were recommended, which could reach 84 similar to 98% of yield estimation accuracy using the optimal assimilation weights. This study provides reliable and promising solutions for yield estimation over a large area using data assimilation without being limited by the biased state variables in remote sensing products and the lack of prior knowledge on the optimal assimilation weights. The 'spatial assimilation' method and the proposed ensemble-mean-based assimilation strategies have great potentials for wide applications, laying solid foundations for developing crop growth monitoring and yield forecasting system.

TI  - Carbon assimilation, water consumption and water use efficiency under different land use types in subtropical ecosystems: from native forests to pine plantations
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of selective logging in Argentinean native subtropical forests or its replacement by pine plantations on carbon and hydrological cycles is of importance for developing strategies for a sustainable use of water resources and climate mitigation in subtropical humid regions. Ecosystem-level gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET) and water use efficiency (WUE) were assessed using multi-temporal MODIS remote sensing data and its response to climatic variables were analyzed in well-preserved native forests, degraded native forests by selective harvesting and pine plantations. Field measurements of leaf area index (LAI), tree density, basal area, tree high, diameter at breast height and understory cover was implemented. The GPP was high throughout the year across all three-land use types. Selective harvesting of commercial trees resulted in a significant decrease in tree density and in basal area compared to well-preserved native forests but did not have a negative impact on GPP. Mean annual ET was similar between both native forests because although the degraded forest had a lower tree density they had a greater maximun DBH per tree than the well-preserved forests and therefore high transpiration. The WUE was similar across the ecosystem types. Removal of 5.5 m(2) of canopy trees produced a compensatory change in ecosystem structure and function resulting in the maintenance of GPP and ET. Replacement of native forests by pine plantations for wood production did not change annual GPP compared to native forests, but the final carbon assimilation should be lower due to the CO2 released before canopy closure and after harvesting. All climatic variables were linearly and significantly related to monthly GPP, ET and WUE with the exception of precipitation with monthly GPP. Finding forest management techniques for increasing carbon assimilation is of importance for limiting the rise of global CO2 emissions and for regulation of the water cycle.

TI  - An Optimal Approach for Land-Use / Land-Cover Mapping by Integration and Fusion of Multispectral Landsat OLI Images: Case Study in Baghdad, Iraq
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Using solely an optical remotely sensed dataset to obtain an accurate thematic map of land use and land cover (LU/LC) is a serious challenge. The dataset fusion of multispectral and panchromatic images play a big role and provide an accurate estimation of LU/LC map simply because using a dataset from different spectrum portions with different spatial and spectral characteristics will improve image classification. For this study, the Landsat operational land imager multispectral and panchromatic images were adopted. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of using a panchromatic highly spatial resolution to refine the methodology for LU/LC mapping in Baghdad city, Iraq, by performing a comparison of classifications using different algorithms on multispectral and fused images. Different classification algorithms were employed to classify the data set; minimum distance (MD) and the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). A suitable classification method was proposed to map LU/LC based on the outcome results. The result evaluation was conducted by applying a confusion matrix. An overall accuracy of a fused image using a principal component-based spectral sharpening algorithm and classified by the MLC classifier reveals the highest accurate results with an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 98.90% and 0.98, respectively. Results showed that the best methodology for LU/LC mapping of the study area is found from fusion of multispectral with panchromatic images via principal component-based spectral algorithm with MLC approach for classification.

TI  - SMAP underestimates soil moisture in vegetation-disturbed areas primarily as a result of biased surface temperature data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Soil Moisture Active Mission (SMAP) baseline V-pol single channel algorithm (SCA-V) retrieves soil moisture (SM) based on the 2000-2010 Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) climatology. This parameterization scheme might affect SM retrievals in the context of vegetation disturbances, e.g., as a result of drought. By referencing the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI), the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) L3 (SMOS-L3) and the SMOS-IC SM datasets, this study investigated the effects of SMAP vegetation parameterization on SMAP-reference SM differences in global land areas that are subject to differing vegetation disturbances. The results show that SMAP might underestimate SM by similar to 0.007 m(3).m(-3) for a relative NDVI decrease of 10%. The underestimation might be primarily caused by low biases in the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) surface temperature. Although using NDVI climatology might cause an overestimation of SM (due to an overestimation of vegetation effects and an underestimation of surface roughness effects), the concurrent underestimation of the GMAO surface temperature might cause an even larger underestimation of SM. The vegetation biases, particularly the surface temperature biases, should be considered for SMAP SM retrieval. These results have implications for future updates of SMAP SCA-V and applications of time series SMAP SM data for hydroecological studies, especially in the future, which is projected to have strong and long-lasting droughts.

TI  - Remote sensing and statistical analysis of the effects of hurricane Maria on the forests of Puerto Rico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Widely recognized as one of the worst natural disaster in Puerto Rico's history, hurricane Maria made landfall on September 20, 2017 in southeast Puerto Rico as a high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale causing widespread destruction, fatalities and forest disturbance. This study focused on hurricane Maria's effect on Puerto Rico's forests as well as the effect of landform and forest characteristics on observed disturbance patterns. We used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to assess the severity of forest disturbance using a disturbance metric based on Landsat 8 satellite data composites with pre and post-hurricane Maria. Forest structure, tree phenology characteristics, and landforms were obtained from satellite data products, including digital elevation model and global forest canopy height. Our analyses showed that forest structure, and characteristics such as forest age and forest type affected patterns of forest disturbance. Among forest types, highest disturbance values were found in sierra palm, transitional, and tall cloud forests; seasonal evergreen forests with coconut palm; and mangrove forests. For landforms, greatest disturbance metrics was found at high elevations, steeper slopes, and windward surfaces. As expected, high levels of disturbance were also found close to the hurricane track, with disturbance less severe as hurricane Maria moved inland. Results demonstrated that forest and landform characteristics accounted for 34% of the variation in spatial forest spectral disturbance patterns. This study demonstrated an informative regional approach, combining remote sensing with statistical analyses to investigate factors that result in variability in hurricane effects on forest ecosystems.

TI  - The use of remote sensing for reliable estimation of net radiation and its components: a case study for contrasting land covers in an agricultural hotspot of the Brazilian semiarid region
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to ascertain the uncertainties related to the spatiotemporal estimation of net radiation, and its components, using remote sensing data. Geographical focus is an irrigated agricultural hotspot of the Brazilian semiarid region, for which we also investigate the impact that contrasting land-cover types have on the upwelling radiation balance components, and hence on net radiation. Instantaneous (R-n) and daily (R-n,R-24) values of net radiation were estimated based on OLI/TIRS-Landsat-8 images and key weather variables. In addition, we evaluated two models for downwelling shortwave (R-sw), ten models for downwelling longwave radiation (R-1w), and two models for derivation of R-n,R-24. The accuracy of each model was evaluated with radiation measurements obtained from research quality sensors installed in micrometeorological towers. The best performances were found for the Allen model, Duarte model, and De Bruin model for R-sw, R-1w,R- and R-n,R-24, respectively. The contrasting land-use types exhibited substantial differences in the biophysical variables and radiative properties that affect R-n. The albedo for the irrigated crops has average absolute values that are 0.01-0.03 greater than those found for the pristine caatinga, whereas the land surface temperature, LST, is 3-5 degrees smaller. However, R-n for these two distinctly different surface types was similar, as a result of a considerably lower surface emissivity in the caatinga. For rangeland, the albedo, LST, and hence the upwelling radiation had greater values than those found for the caatinga, which caused reduced values of R-n. The urban areas exhibited the lowest values of R-n, mainly as a consequence of their high albedo values. We show that when in-situ net radiation data are not available, remote sensing data combined with more readily available in-situ weather data can be used to derive spatiotemporal estimates of R-n. This facilitates the identification of anthropogenic impacts on the radiation at the land-surface and ultimately the energy balance, including the short-term seasonal and long-term effects.

TI  - Prediction of PM<sub>2.5</sub> daily concentrations for grid points throughout a vast area using remote sensing data and an improved dynamic spatial panel model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The incorporation of spatial and temporal correlations can significantly improve the accuracy of PM2.5 concentration prediction models. However, the dynamic spatial panel model which explicitly deals with these two correlations remains absent from current approaches to out-of-sample concentration prediction. An issue is that the prediction of daily concentrations for grid points across a vast area may well overwhelm existing algorithms, as it requires an enormous amount of computational resources and an enlarged spatial weight matrix. This paper develops improved algorithms that address this issue. The dynamic spatial panel approaches used in this paper predict daily series PM2.5 concentrations for grid points covering Mainland China, using daily aerosol, vegetational and meteorological remote sensing data as the explanatory variables. The predicted concentration maps offer more realistic detail in areas where monitoring stations are sparse. Indeed, the error map for the out-of-sample prediction shows that MAPE is less than 30% in most regions, and the average MAPE is 24.28%, which is relatively low compared with similar studies. In contrast to methods which cannot provide coefficients of variables, the developed method offers coefficients to assess the contributions of explanatory variables and temporal-spatial correlation terms, allows quantification of convergence effects, and can distinguish between spillover effects and local effects. A performance comparison of models with various spatial weight matrices shows that model achieves the optimal fitting levels by using the neighbouring unit number threshold of 18 or the distance threshold of 150 km. The case analysis in this paper finds that spillover effects are about three times larger than local effects, and the spatial correlation is greater than the cumulative effects of earlier concentrations. This finding adds further weight to the notion that management of PM2.5 pollution and associated impacts requires multi-regional and even multi-national coordination and effort.

TI  - Satellite observations of forest resilience to hurricanes along the northern Gulf of Mexico
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most destructive natural disasters, hurricanes pose a great threat to forest ecosystems, particularly in the coastal areas. A better understanding of forest resilience to hurricane disturbances is essential for reducing hazard risks as well as sustaining forests in a time of increasing climate disasters. Although hurricane-induced forest damage has been extensively studied at both local and regional levels, the lack of large-scale assessment of post-hurricane recovery still limits our understanding of forest resilience to hurricane disturbances. In this study, we utilized four remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs), including the normalized difference infrared index (NDII), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), leaf area index (LAI), and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), to examine the forest resilience to hurricanes of different strengths by quantifying the resistance, net change, and recovery of the forest after hurricanes that made landfall along the northern Gulf of Mexico from 2001 to 2015. The results revealed that the NDII was superior in monitoring the large-scale forest resilience. SIF exhibited a performance similar to that of the EVI. Wind speed was found to be the leading factor affecting forest damage and post-hurricane recovery. The impacted forest canopy began to recover approximately one month after the landfall. Woody wetlands exhibited less VI reduction and shorter recovery time than evergreen forests for the same category of hurricanes. For regions dominated by evergreen forests, NDII values lower than the mull-year average were observed across all seasons during the year after being impacted by a major hurricane. The widespread drought of 2006/2007 has aggravated the VI decrease and substantially extended the recovery period after hurricanes Ivan and Katrina. Overall, our findings derived from satellite observations provide essential information for understanding forest resilience to hurricanes as well as implementing efficient posthurricane forest restoration.

TI  - Evaluating the potential of LiDAR data for fire damage assessment: A radiative transfer model approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Providing accurate information on fire effects is critical to understanding post-fire ecological processes and to design appropriate land management strategies. Multispectral imagery from optical passive sensors is commonly used to estimate fire damage, yet this type of data is only sensitive to the effects in the upper canopy. This paper evaluates the sensitivity of full waveform LiDAR data to estimate the severity of wildfires using a 3D radiative transfer model approach. The approach represents the first attempt to evaluate the effect of different fire impacts, i.e. changes in vegetation structure as well as soil and leaf color, on the LiDAR signal. The FLIGHT 3D radiative transfer model was employed to simulate full waveform data for 10 plots representative of Mediterranean ecosystems along with a wide range of post-fire scenarios characterized by different severity levels, as defined by the composite burn index (CBI). A new metric is proposed, the waveform area relative change (WARC), which provides a comprehensive severity assessment considering all strata and accounting for changes in structure and leaf and soil color. It showed a strong correlation with CBI values (Spearman's Rho = 0.9 +/- 0.02), outperforming the relative change of LiDAR metrics commonly applied for vegetation modeling, such as the relative height of energy quantiles (Spearman's Rho = 0.56 +/- 0.07, for the relative change of RH60, the second strongest correlation). Logarithmic models fitted for each plot based on the WARC yielded very good performance with R-2 (+/- standard deviation) and RMSE (+/- standard deviation) of 0.8 (+/- 0.05) and 0.22 (+/- 0.03), respectively. LiDAR metrics were evaluated over the King Fire, California, U.S., for which pre- and post-fire discrete return airborne LiDAR data were available. Pseudo-waveforms were computed after radiometric normalization of the intensity data. The WARC showed again the strongest correlation with field measures of GeoCBI values (Spearman's Rho = 0.91), closely followed by the relative change of RH40 (Spearman's Rho = 0.89). The logarithmic model fitted using WARC offered an R-2 of 0.78 and a RMSE of 0.37. The accurate results obtained for the King Fire, with very different vegetation characteristics compared to our simulated data, demonstrate the robustness of the new metric proposed and its generalization capabilities to estimate the severity of fires.

TI  - An improved algorithm for retrieving high resolution fine-mode aerosol based on polarized satellite data: Application and validation for POLDER-3
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The fine-mode aerosols (FMA), generally generated from anthropogenic sources, play an essential role in global radiation balance, climate change, atmospheric environment, and human health. However, the FMA retrieval remains a challenge. An improved high resolution FMA retrieval algorithm based on the Spectral Neutrality of Surface Polarized Reflectance (SNOSPR) was developed using polarized satellite data. SNOSPR utilizes a lookup table approach to simultaneously retrieve high spatial resolution FMA parameters, such as FMA optical depth (AODf), Angstrom exponent (AE), and surface polarized reflectance (SPR), without using the surface Bidirectional Polarization Distribution Function (BPDF) model, which may yield relatively more significant errors of SPR estimation in certain surface types. Besides, a new cost function (CF) based on the hypothesis of invariance of SPR was used to select the best retrievals. SNOSPR algorithm was applied to POLDER-3 polarized observation data (i.e., 2010-2012). Inter-comparison between SNOSPR (6 km) and POLDER-3 (L2_LGC,18 km) for two typical cases and monthly averaged AODf products showed a generally consistent spatial distribution, while SNOSPR provided more details, and better coverage over barren and coastal areas at high spatial resolution. Furthermore, all retrieved AODf, AE products of SNOSPR and L2_LGC were validated using AERosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) measurements. The AODf results showed fine correlation coefficients, i.e., R of 0.9 and 0.89, respectively. However, products of SNOSPR had the expected error range which was higher than that of L2_LGC over all surface types (i.e., 77.3% vs 70.6%), urban (i.e., 76.0% vs 60.6%) and wetland (i.e., 82.4% vs 68.4%). Time-series comparison over grassland showed that SNOSPR had better coverage and more accurate retrievals. Considering AE, both SNOSPR and L2_LGC underestimated its value when validated against AERONET measurements. On the other hand, SPR was retrieved at higher retrieval accuracy by SNOSPR than L2_LGC, which used BPDF. Accuracies of the retrieved AODf improved significantly when multi-directional data was used, especially when the viewing angle number increased from one to four. The uncertainty analysis of spectral neutrality and spatial invariance of SPR was discussed for future improvements of SNOSPR. Last, SNOSPR was applied on Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC), i.e., a POLDER-like sensor onboard the Chinese Gao Fen-5 satellite. The results in this study demonstrated the effectiveness of the SNOSPR algorithm and its potential for more reliable AODf/SPR retrievals for monitoring local atmospheric pollution and related studies.

TI  - Inactivation times from 290 to 315 nm UVB in sunlight for SARS coronaviruses CoV and CoV-2 using OMI satellite data for the sunlit Earth
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - UVB in sunlight, 290-315 nm, can inactivate SARS CoV and SARS CoV-2 viruses on surfaces and in the air. Laboratory exposure to ultraviolet irradiance in the UVC range inactivates many viruses and bacteria in times less than 30 min. Estimated UVB inactivation doses from sunlight in J/m(2)are obtained from UVC measurements and radiative transfer calculations, weighted by a virus inactivation action spectrum, using OMI satellite atmospheric data for ozone, clouds, and aerosols. For SARS CoV, using an assumed UVC dose near the mid-range of measured values,D-90= 40 J/m(2), 90% inactivation timesT(90)are estimated for exposure to midday 10:00-14:00 direct plus diffuse sunlight and for nearby locations in the shade (diffuse UVB only). For the assumedD(90)= 40 J/m(2)model applicable to SARS CoV viruses, calculated estimates show that near noon 11:00-13:00 clear-sky direct sunlight gives values ofT(90)< 90 min for mid-latitude sites between March and September and less than 60 min for many equatorial sites for 12 months of the year. Recent direct measurements of UVB sunlight inactivation of the SARS CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 show shorterT(90)inactivation times less than 10 min depending on latitude, season, and hour. The equivalent UVC 254 nmD(90)dose for SARS CoV-2 is estimated as 3.2 +/- 0.7 J/m(2)for viruses on a steel mesh surface and 6.5 +/- 1.4 J/m(2)for viruses in a growth medium. For SARS CoV-2 clear-skyT(90)on a surface ranges from 4 min in the equatorial zone to less than 30 min in a geographic area forming a near circle with solar zenith angle < 60(O)centered on the subsolar point for local solar times from 09:00 to 15:00 h.

TI  - Epidemiological Chronicle of the First Recovered Coronavirus Disease Patient From Panama: Evidence of Early Cluster Transmission in a High School of Panama City
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The first patient infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Panama was reported on March 9, 2020. Here, we describe the first case of recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the country. The patient was a 49-year-old male high school teacher, who did not show any primary symptoms of COVID-19 described by health authorities as the signs for medical attention. Nonetheless, he became severely ill over the course of 2 weeks and almost lost the battle against COVID-19. The identification of the first cluster of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission in the secondary school where the patient of this case report taught, led to the closure of the school and, a day after, the shutdown of the national education system, which may have prevented the spread and slowed the transmission rate of COVID-19 during the early stages of invasion. This case report highlights the need to increase awareness among healthcare professionals in Latin America to consider symptoms such as anosmia and dysgeusia as the sentinel signs of COVID-19 infection in order to prevent deaths, especially in high-risk patients.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node detection differs when comparing lymphoscintigraphy to lymphography using water soluble iodinated contrast medium and digital radiography in dogs
T2  - VETERINARY RADIOLOGY & ULTRASOUND
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping by various means has become standard of care in certain types of human cancers and is receiving more attention in veterinary oncology. Current SLN mapping techniques can be costly and often require advanced imaging equipment. The objective of this prospective, method comparison study was to compare an SLN mapping protocol of lymphoscintigraphy to lymphography using water soluble iodinated contrast medium (WIC) and digital radiography for identification of an SLN. Lymphoscintigraphy and lymphography were performed on eight healthy purpose-bred dogs using technetium-99m sulfur colloid and WIC injected into the subcutaneous tissues in a four-quadrant technique around a predefined area of skin on the brachium. Images were obtained using a gamma camera and digital radiography at different time points post-injection. Image sequences were evaluated by one of two American College of Veterinary Radiology board-certified veterinary radiologists. Data obtained were compared between methods using descriptive statistics. An SLN was identified in all dogs with lymphoscintigraphy and seven of eight dogs with lymphography. Agreement between results of the lymphoscintigraphy and lymphography studies was a complete match in three dogs, a partial match in four dogs, and no match in one dog. The SLN detected differed based on the imaging modality used.

TI  - Improved offset tracking for predisaster deformation monitoring of the 2018 Jinsha River landslide (Tibet, China)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing is a potential technique for long-term monitoring of landslideprone areas. Pixel offset tracking methods work well for fast-moving landslides (more than tens of cm/yr). However, existing methods may present some limitations, such as (i) a high dependence of estimation window design on experience, (ii) a tradeoff between the accuracy of single points and the overall efficiency, and (iii) a low confidence in the results caused by heterogeneous in-window samples. In this paper, an improved offset tracking method is proposed to address these problems. First, the workflow is optimized by a "preseparation" step added before offset estimation to distinguish between feature matching and speckle pattern matching. The optimized workflow is more efficient for natural scenes containing both feature and non-saliency regions. Second, an improved algorithm called adaptive incoherence speckle offset tracking based on homogeneous samples (AISOT-HS) is proposed for non-saliency regions. Its two key points are (i) adaptive design of the optimal estimation windows by introducing a coherence map as a guide and (ii) offset estimation without heterogeneous samples. We apply the proposed method to study the evolution of the 2018 Jinsha River landslide (Tibet, China) using SAR data from the Gaofen 3 (GF-3) satellite and the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) system onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) satellite. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed method improves the efficiency and reduces the uncertainty. We also analyze the spatiotemporal displacement pattern of this landslide, which shows that the Jinsha River landslide was most likely a thrust load-caused landslide. This study demonstrates the role of SAR remote sensing in global landslide monitoring, especially where ground truth data are scarce.

TI  - Comparing global passive microwave freeze/thaw records: Investigating differences between Ka- and L-band products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The NASA L-Band Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission launched in 2015 has produced soil moisture and freeze thaw (FT) products at a global scale. While the use of L-band (1.41 GHz) passive microwave radiometry (P-MW) has proven useful in detecting changes in the surface FT state, these classifications have not been comprehensively assessed against similar existing FT products, such as the global FT record from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I, Ka-band, 37.0 GHz) as part of the FT Earth System Data Record (FT-ESDR). In order to fill in this gap, this study investigates regions in which FT classifications diverge and identifies potential sources of classification variability. The SMAP and SSM/I FT records are compared over an extended period covering multiple seasonal cycles from April 2015 through December 2017. The spatially and temporally varying relationship between these products is examined in relation to climate (Koppen-Geiger climate classes and air temperature), MODIS (MoDerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) land cover, and topography (using Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data). SMAP and SSM/I FT product agreement proportion (Ap) was corrected for seasonality and then separated by land cover classes and compared to the global Ap mean. The agreement between these products vary most notably during freeze and thaw onset and in areas near abundant surface water, snow and ice, and wetlands. Relative to other vegetation types, reduced agreement between FT products is also observed over grasslands, sparsely vegetated lands, as well as mixed and evergreen forests. Distinct seasonal differences in FT classification agreement were also detected between products over cold arid regions and between continental and temperate classes. Similarly, as topographic complexity increases, a decreasing trend in agreement between L- and Ka-band FT products is observed. While reiterating challenges in FT classifications identified by prior studies, this work also contributes new insights by providing detailed geospatial and seasonal analyses into the factors contributing to FT product divergence.

TI  - Satellite-based reflectances capture large fraction of variability in global gross primary production (GPP) at weekly time scales
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A perception has emerged, based on several studies, that satellite-based reflectances are limited in terms of their ability to predict gross primary production (GPP) globally at weekly temporal scales. The basis for this inference is in part that reflectances, particularly expressed in the form of vegetation indices (VIs), convey information about potential rather than actual photosynthesis, and they are sensitive to non-green substances (e.g., soil, woody branches, and snow) as well as to chlorophyll. Previous works have suggested that processing and quality control of satellite-based reflectance data play an important role in their interpretation. In this study, we use high quality reflectance data from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to train neural networks that are used to upscale GPP estimated from eddy covariance flux tower measurements globally. We quantify the ability of the machine learning approaches to capture GPP variability at daily to interannual time scales. Our results show that MODIS reflectances, when paired only with potential short-wave radiation, are able to capture a large fraction of GPP variability (approximately 77%) at daily to weekly time scales. Additional meteorological information (temperature, water vapor deficit, soil water content, ET, and incident radiation) captures only a few more percent of the GPP variability. The meteorological information is used most effectively when information about plant functional type and climate classification is included. We show that machine learning can be a useful tool for estimating GPP uncertainties as well as GPP itself from upscaling methods. Our estimated global annual mean GPP for 2007 is 142.5 +/- 7.7 Pg C y(-1), which is higher than some other satellite-based estimates but within the range of other reported observation-, model-, and hybrid-based values.

TI  - Value of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence for quantifying hydrological states and fluxes: Current status and challenges
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Predictions of hydrological states and fluxes, especially transpiration, are poorly constrained in hydrological models due to large uncertainties in parameterization and process description. Novel technologies like remote sensing of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)-which provides information from the photosynthetic apparatus-may help in constraining water cycle components. This paper discusses the nature of the plant physiological basis of the fluorescence signal and analyses the current literature linking hydrological states and fluxes to SIF. Given the connection between photosynthesis and transpiration, through the water use efficiency, SIF may serve as a pertinent constraint for hydrological models. The FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) satellite, planned to be launched in 2023, is expected to provide spatially high-resolution measurements of red and far-red SIF complementing the products from existing satellite missions and the high-temporal resolution products from upcoming geostationary missions. This new data stream may allow us to better constrain plant transpiration, assess the impacts of water stress on plants, and infer processes occurring in the root zone through the soil-plant water column. To make optimal use of this data, progress needs to be made in 1) our process representation of spatially aggregated fluorescence signals from spaceborne SIF instruments, 2) integration of fluorescence processes in hydrological models-particularly when paired with other satellite data, 3) quantifying the impact of soil moisture on SIF across scales, and 4) assessment of the accuracy of SIF measurements-especially from space.

TI  - Artificial neural networks model based on remote sensing to retrieve evapotranspiration over the Brazilian Pampa
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) quantification improves the comprehension of the water, heat, and carbon interactions and the feedback to the climate, which is essential for global change research. We aimed to model ET using artificial neural networks (ANNs) based on Landsat-8 and reanalysis data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction over the grasslands of the Pampa biome. The output variable was the ET trained by eddy covariance (EC) measurements acquired from a flux tower located in Santa Maria, Brazil. ANN was performed using the backpropagation algorithm with four remote sensing input variables (albedo, normalized difference vegetation index, land surface temperature, and surface net radiation). In addition, four meteorological variables from the Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System Version 2 hourly product were included in the model (air temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humid, and wind speed). We analyzed 67 clear-sky scenes between 2014 and 2019. Results produced very robust daily ET estimates. ANN exhibited a correlation of 0.88 relative to in situ EC data, demonstrating a good linear relationship between ET estimated and measured and producing a root-mean-square error (mean absolute error) of 0.75 (0.58) mm/day. The ANN model was also compared with the widely known simplified surface energy balance index (S-SEBI) model. S-SEBI exhibited lower correlation with the ET in situ compared to the ANN model. Furthermore, the ANN model had a superior performance in summer and winter seasons in which S-SEBI was found to outperform the ET in situ. The model developed in our research is an alternative to approaches that need a great number of input variables or in situ data since it is only dependent on freely available data. Therefore, it should support future integrated strategies of water resources allocation over the natural grasslands of the Brazilian Pampa.

TI  - Towards delivering on the sustainable development goals using earth observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - With less than a decade left to attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this communication aims to improve understanding of the enabling environment that is essential for Earth observations (EO) to be fully adopted within the institutional settings that drive the implementation of the SDGs and the Global Indicator Framework, an effective review mechanism for tracking progress at global to national and local levels. This paper also serves as an introduction to the Remote Sensing of Environment's Special Issue (SI) on Earth Observation for the Sustainable Development Goals. The seventeen contributions published in this SI showcase the application of EO data, methods, and tools to support countries in target setting for the SDGs, including baseline determination, as well as tracking of progress on SDG implementation and informing sustainable development planning and decision making. The majority of published articles focus on Goals 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 14 (Life below Water) and 15 (Life on Land). We also present our own analysis of existing EO systems available to generate data for SDG indicators addressed via the SI contributions, including main resolution characteristics, and assess factors that hinder the full integration of EO solutions for the SDGs within country processes, institutions of government, and policies. We conclude that an urgent need exists for the EO community to work more closely with local and regional governments and other relevant stakeholders to promote the operationalization of EO solutions for implementing the 2030 Agenda at global to local levels. Our review also illustrates the need for transitioning towards new EO for SDG frameworks that are focused on the knowledge element of the data-information-knowledge-wisdom paradigm, rather than the data and information aspects.

M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe National Neisseria Network (NNN), Australia comprises reference laboratories in each state and territory that report data on susceptibilities for an agreed group of antimicrobial agents for the Australian Gonococcal Surveillance Programme (AGSP). The antibiotics are ceftriaxone, azithromycin, penicillin and ciprofloxacin; they represent current or potential agents used for the treatment of gonorrhoea. Ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin is the recommended treatment regimen for gonorrhoea in the majority of Australia. However, there are substantial geographic differences in gonococcal susceptibility patterns in Australia, with certain remote regions of the Northern Territory and Western Australia having low antimicrobial resistance rates. In these regions, an oral treatment regimen comprising amoxicillin, probenecid, and azithromycin is recommended for the treatment of gonorrhoea. Additional data on other antibiotics are reported in the AGSP Annual Report. The AGSP has a program-specific quality assurance process.

TI  - Machine learning approaches to retrieve pan-Arctic melt ponds from visible satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Melt ponds on sea ice play an important role in the seasonal evolution of the summer ice cover. In this study we present two machine learning algorithms, one (multi-layer neural network) for the retrieval of melt pond binary classification and another (multinomial logistic regression) for melt pond fraction using moderate resolution visible satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). To minimize the impact of the anisotropic reflectance characteristics of sea ice and melt ponds, normalized MODIS band reflectance differences from top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) measured reflectances were used. The training samples for the machine learning were based on MODIS reflectances extracted for sea ice, melt ponds and open water classifications based on high resolution (similar to 2 m) WorldView (WV) data. The accuracy assessment for melt pond binary classification and fraction is further evaluated against WV imagery, showing mean overall accuracy (85.5%), average mean difference (0.09), and mean RMSE (0.18). In addition to cross-validation with WV, retrieved melt pond data are validated against melt pond fractions from satellite and ship-based observations, showing average mean differences (MD), root-mean-square-error (RMSE), and correlation coefficients (R) of 0.05, 0.12, and 0.41, respectively. We further investigate a case study of the spectral characteristics of melt ponds and ice during refreezing, and demonstrate an approach to mask out refrozen pixels by using yearly maps of melt onset and freeze-up data together with ice surface temperatures (IST). Finally, an example of monthly mean pan-Arctic melt pond binary classification and fraction are shown for July 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019. Bulk processing of the entire 20 years of MODIS data will provide the science community with a much needed pan-Arctic melt pond data set.

TI  - Monitoring high-altitude river ice distribution at the basin scale in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau from a Landsat time-series spanning 1999-2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - River ice monitoring is important for hydrological research and water resource management of the Tibetan Plateau but limited by the serious shortage of field observations, and remote sensing can be used as an effective supplementary means for monitoring river ice. However, remote sensing high-altitude river ice is scarce and a basin-scale understanding of river ice is lacking on the Tibetan Plateau. To ascertain the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of high-altitude river ice at the basin scale, we selected the Babao River basin as the study area, which is a typical river basin located in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Utilizing 447 available Landsat images during the river ice period from 1999 to 2018 and the classical normalized difference snow index (NDSI) algorithm, we monitored the river ice in a long time series at the Babao River basin. The average Khat of accuracy validation reached 0.973. The average area of river ice in the river ice period of this basin showed a weak decreasing trend and was negatively correlated with air temperature. We also found that gentle slopes and high elevations are beneficial for the development of river ice. The melting of river ice supplements river discharge in spring. This study is the first to reveal the distribution characteristics and changing trend of river ice at the basin scale on the Tibetan Plateau, and the results provide a reference for river ice research in this region.

TI  - Comparisons and evaluation of aerosol burden and optical depth in CMIP5 simulations over East Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol plays an important role in the climate system by affecting the radiative and energy balances. Hence, in this paper, the spatial patterns of aerosol burden and aerosol optical properties (AOD) in four the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) models over East Asia during 2001-2005 are compared to quantify inter-model differences and to evaluate AOD simulations against observations. The evaluation of AOD against Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite retrievals shows that CMIP5 models can reproduce the spatial pattern of MODIS AOD reasonably well. The mean AOD over eastern China shows that NorESM1-M underestimates MODIS AOD by 40%, due to the lack of emissions of some aerosol components, such as nitrate, biogenic aerosol, and non-desert mineral dust. In contrast to that, CSIRO-Mk3.6.0 overestimates annual mean of MODIS AOD over eastern China by 20%, partially caused by larger aerosol emissions and burden. Compared to MODIS AOD, GFDL-CM3 performs the best in simulating AOD in eastern China, because ammonium and nitrate are included in this model. The comparisons of CMIP5 and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD show similar results. In addition, the simulated AOD values are closer to AERONET AOD in Mongolia, China, Japan and Korea than that in India. The results also reveal that there are some inter-model differences of aerosol burden over East Asia, caused by the inter-model differences of aerosol emissions, wet scavenging, and transport. Over eastern and northwestern China and the west Pacific, the inter-model differences of anthropogenic aerosol burden and spatial variabilities are smaller than that of natural aerosol burden.

TI  - Deep-learning based high-resolution mapping shows woody vegetation densification in greater Maasai Mara ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Greater Maasai Mara Ecosystem (GMME) in Kenya is an iconic savanna ecosystem of high importance as natural and cultural heritage, notably by including the largest remaining seasonal migration of African ungulates and the semi-nomadic pastoralist Maasai culture. Comprehensive mapping of vegetation distribution and dynamics in GMME is important for understanding ecosystem changes across time and space since recent reports suggest dramatic declines in wildlife populations alongside troubling reports of grassland conversion to cropland and habitat fragmentation due to increasing small-holder fencing. Here, we present the first comprehensive vegetation map of GMME at high (10-m) spatial resolution. The map consists of nine key vegetation cover types (VCTs), which were derived in a two-step process integrating data from high-resolution WorldView-3 images (1.2-m) and Sentinel-2 images using a deep-learning workflow. We evaluate the role of anthropogenic, topographic, and climatic factors in affecting the fractional cover of the identified VCTs in 2017 and their MODIS-derived browning/greening rates in the preceding 17 years at 250-m resolution. Results show that most VCTs showed a preceding greening trend in the protected land. In contrast, the semi- and unprotected land showed a general preceding greening trend in the woody-dominated cover types, while they exhibited browning trends in grass-dominated cover types. These results suggest that woody vegetation densification may be happening across much of the GMME, alongside vegetation declines within the non-woody covers in the semi- and unprotected lands. Greening and potential woody densification in GMME is positively correlated with mean annual precipitation and negatively correlated with anthropogenic pressure. Increasing woody densification across the entire GMME in the future would replace high-quality grass cover and pose a risk to the maintenance of the region's rich savanna megafauna, thus pointing to a need for further investigation using alternative data sources. The increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing and efficient approaches for vegetation mapping will play a crucial role in monitoring conservation effectiveness as well as ecosystem dynamics due to pressures such as climate change.

TI  - Using the Google Earth Engine to estimate a 10 m resolution monthly inventory of soil fugitive dust emissions in Beijing, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil fugitive dust (SFD) is an important contributor to ambient particulate matter (PM), but most current SFD emission inventories are updated slowly or have low resolution. In areas where vegetation coverage and climatic conditions undergo significant seasonal changes, the classic wind erosion equation (WEQ) tends to underestimate SFD emissions, increasing the need for higher spatiotemporal data resolution. Continuous acquisition of precise bare soil maps is the key barrier to compiling monthly high-resolution SFD emission inventories. In this study, we proposed taking advantage of the massive Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery data sets stored in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform to enable the rapid production of bare soil maps with spatial resolutions of up to 10 m. The resulting improved spatiotemporal resolution of wind erosion parameters allowed us to estimate SFD emissions in Beijing as being similar to 57 times the level calculated by the WEQ. Spring and winter accounted for >85% of SFD emissions, while April was the dustiest month with SFD emissions of PM10 exceeding 11,000 t. Our results highlighted the role of SFD in air pollution during winter and spring in northern China, and suggested that GEE should be further used for image acquisition, data processing, and compilation of gridded SFD inventories. These inventories can help identify the location and intensity of SFD sources while providing supporting information for local authorities working to develop targeted mitigation measures.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic parameters and radiomics model based on dynamic contrast enhanced MRI for the preoperative prediction of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer
T2  - CANCER IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background To establish pharmacokinetic parameters and a radiomics model based on dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for predicting sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in patients with breast cancer. Methods A total of 164 breast cancer patients confirmed by pathology were prospectively enrolled from December 2017 to May 2018, and underwent DCE-MRI before surgery. Pharmacokinetic parameters and radiomics features were derived from DCE-MRI data. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method was used to select features, which were then utilized to construct three classification models, namely, the pharmacokinetic parameters model, the radiomics model, and the combined model. These models were built through the logistic regression method by using 10-fold cross validation strategy and were evaluated on the basis of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. An independent validation dataset was used to confirm the discriminatory power of the models. Results Seven radiomics features were selected by LASSO logistic regression. The radiomics model, the pharmacokinetic parameters model, and the combined model yielded area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72 to 0.89), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.68 to 0.86), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.72 to 0.89), respectively, for the training cohort and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.89), 0.74 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.90), and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.61 to 0.91), respectively, for the validation cohort. The combined model showed the best performance for the preoperative evaluation of SLN metastasis in breast cancer. Conclusions The model incorporating radiomics features and pharmacokinetic parameters can be conveniently used for the individualized preoperative prediction of SLN metastasis in patients with breast cancer.

TI  - Night and day: The influence and relative importance of urban characteristics on remotely sensed land surface temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics of urban land surfaces contribute to the urban heat island, and, in turn, can exacerbate the severity of heat wave impacts. However, the mechanisms and complex interactions in urban areas underlying land surface temperature are still being understood. Understanding these mechanisms is necessary to design strategies that mitigate land temperatures in our cities. Using the recently available night-time moderate-resolution thermal satellite imagery and employing advanced nonlinear statistical models, we seek to answer the question "What is the influence and relative importance of urban characteristics on land surface temperature, during both the day and night?" To answer this question, we analyze urban land surface temperature in four cities across the United States. We devise techniques for training and validating nonlinear statistical models on geostatistical data and use these models to assess the interdependent effects of urban characteristics on urban surface temperature. Our results suggest that vegetation and impervious surfaces are the most important urban characteristics associated with land surface temperature. While this may be expected, this is the first study to quantify this relationship for Landsat-resolution nighttime temperature estimates. Our results also demonstrate the potential for using nonlinear statistical analysis to investigate land surface temperature and its relationships with urban characteristics. Improved understanding of these relationships influencing both night and day land surface temperature will assist planners undertaking climate change adaptation and heat wave mitigation.

TI  - Mapping canopy nitrogen in European forests using remote sensing and environmental variables with the random forests method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy nitrogen (N) influences carbon (C) uptake by vegetation through its important role in photosynthetic enzymes. Global Vegetation Models (GVMs) predict C assimilation, but are limited by a lack spatial canopy N input. Mapping canopy N has been done in various ecosystems using remote sensing (RS) products, but has rarely considered environmental variables as additional predictors. Our research objective was to estimate spatial patterns of canopy N in European forests and to investigate the degree to which including environmental variables among the predictors would improve the models compared to using remotely sensed products alone. The environmental variables included were climate, soil properties, altitude, N deposition and land cover, while the remote sensing products were vegetation indices and NIR reflectance from MODIS and MERIS sensors, the MOD13Q1 and MTCI products, respectively. The results showed that canopy N could be estimated both within and among forest types using the random forests technique and calibration data from ICP Forests with good accuracy (r(2) = 0.62, RRMSE = 0.18). The predicted spatial pattern shows higher canopy N in mid-western Europe and relatively lower values in both southern and northern Europe. For all subgroups tested (All plots, Evergreen Needleleaf Forest (ENF) plots and Deciduous Broadleaf Forest (DBF) plots), including environmental variables improved the predictions. Including environmental variables was especially important for the DBF plots, as the prediction model based on remotely sensed data products predicted canopy N with the lowest accuracy.

TI  - Assessing salt marsh extent and condition changes with 35 years of Landsat imagery: Tagus Estuary case study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable information on salt marsh extent and condition is crucial to promote effective management strategies towards their maintenance and recovery. Most of previous studies on salt marsh extent assessment used Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), being limited the current knowledge about the performance of other Vegetation Indices (VI). Based on Landsat imagery this study proposes a new methodology to map salt marsh extent in estuarine systems by combining Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and VI, exploring their performance when using different VI. Moreover, it aims to assess the extent and condition changes between 1984 and 2018 in two salt marshes (Pancas and Corroios) located within Tagus Estuary. The VI best-performing salt marsh extent was determined and the methodology applied to assess salt marsh extent changes. Condition change was investigated by statistically analyzing spatially averaged VI over salt marsh extent change regions. Results demonstrated that NDWI and VI combined can be used to efficiently map the marsh extent and NDVI was the VI with the best performance. Corroios revealed mostly stable without noticeable changes in its extent and condition. Oppositely, Pancas registered a continuous seaward progression at a mean rate of 3 ha/year since 1984, while restricted upper regions dieback after 2004-2005, likely due to high soil salinity conditions. In general, NDVI performs better salt marsh extent, but others VI corrected to minimize soil effects perform better when tidal flats are entirely, or almost entirely, exposed, opening perspectives to the development of new methods combining the use of different VI to optimize salt marsh extent detection.

TI  - Impact of ageing and soil contaminants on telomere length in the land snail
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Telomeres (TLs) are non-coding DNA sequences that are usually shortened with ageing and/or chemical exposure. Bioindicators such as the land snail can be used to assess the environmental risk of contaminated soils. As for most invertebrates, the evolution of TLs with ageing or exposure to contaminants is unknown in this mollusc. The aims of this study were to explore the relationships between ageing, contaminant exposure, sublethal effects and TL length in the terrestrial gastropod Cantareus aspersus. TL length was investigated in haemocytes from five age classes of C. aspersus. The impact of contaminants on sub-adult snails exposed to Cd, Hg or a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soils for one or two months was studied. Bioaccumulation, growth, sexual maturity and TLs were measured. TL attrition was significant for the juvenile and sub-adult stages, but not later. Exposure to Cd increased the mortality (around 30%). Exposure to polluted soils inhibited growth (19-40%) and sexual maturity (6-100%). Although the health of the snails exposed to Cd, Hg and PAHs was altered, TL length in haemocytes was not disturbed, suggesting a high capacity of this snail species to maintain its TLs in haemocytes under chemical stress. These results first address TL length in snails and reveal that the relationship commonly proposed for vertebrates between TL shortening and ageing or exposure to contaminants cannot be generalized.

TI  - Dual polarimetric radar vegetation index for crop growth monitoring using sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have provided an unprecedented opportunity for crop monitoring due to its high revisit frequency and wide spatial coverage. The dual-pol (VV-VH) Sentinel-1 SAR data are being utilized for the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) as well as for other national projects, which are providing Sentinel derived information to support crop monitoring networks. Among the Earth observation products identified for agriculture monitoring, indicators of vegetation status are deemed critical by end-user communities. In literature, several experiments usually utilize the backscatter intensities to characterize crops. In this study, we have jointly utilized the scattering information in terms of the degree of polarization and the eigenvalue spectrum to derive a new vegetation index from dual-pol (DpRVI) SAR data. We assess the utility of this index as an indicator of plant growth dynamics for canola, soybean, and wheat, over a test site in Canada. A temporal analysis of DpRVI with crop biophysical variables (viz., Plant Area Index (PAI), Vegetation Water Content (VWC), and dry biomass (DB)) at different phenological stages confirms its trend with plant growth dynamics. For each crop type, the DpRVI is compared with the cross and co-pol ratio (sigma(0)(VH)/sigma(0)(VV)) and dual-pol Radar Vegetation Index (RVI = 4 sigma(0)(VH)/(sigma(0)(VV) + sigma(0)(VH))), Polarimetric Radar Vegetation Index (PRVI), and the Dual Polarization SAR Vegetation Index (DPSVI). Statistical analysis with biophysical variables shows that the DpRVI outperformed the other four vegetation indices, yielding significant correlations for all three crops. Correlations between DpRVI and biophysical variables are highest for canola, with coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.79 (PAI), 0.82 (VWC), and 0.75 (DB). DpRVI had a moderate correlation (R-2 >= 0.6) with the biophysical parameters of wheat and soybean. Good retrieval accuracies of crop biophysical parameters are also observed for all three crops.

TI  - Analyzing Controversies in Management and Surveillance of Early-Stage Melanoma
T2  - ONCOLOGY AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The incidence of cutaneous melanoma continues to rise dramatically worldwide, presenting a significant burden to the healthcare system. Despite this, there is still controversy in the guidelines regarding follow-up surveillance for patients with thin melanoma. Since there are no randomized clinical trials to support evidence-based guidelines for follow-up surveillance, dermatologic and oncologic organizations have developed their own recommendations based on expert opinion. However, these recommendations differ widely and are often vague, resulting in considerable variability in the management of early-stage melanoma among clinicians. The benefits of frequent follow-up visits are early detection of recurrent lesions, lower cost of early-stage melanoma compared to that of late-stage melanoma, decreased need for sentinel lymph node biopsy and adjuvant therapies, and the opportunity to educate patients on self-examination and sun protection. However, the high cost of screening and potential increased rates of biopsy, as well as over-imaging and overtreating, pose serious concerns about this approach. While more rigorous research is needed to resolve this controversy, currently clinicians should follow a relatively universal recommendation to tailor the follow-up regimen based on the patient's relative risk of recurrence and comfort.

TI  - Assessing satellite-derived fire patches with functional diversity trait methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire disturbance is a significant component of the climate system. Analysis of satellite-derived burned areas has allowed the identification of fire patches and their morphology as a new resource for tracking fire spread to improve fire models used to assess the impact of fires on climate and the carbon cycle. A critical parameter of the flood-fill algorithm used to create fire patches is the cut-off (in days) below which it aggregates two contiguous burned pixels to the same fire patch. However, the current level of validation is insufficient to understand the effect of the cut-off values and sensor resolutions on the subsequent fire-patch morphology. The FRY v1.0 database of functional fire-patch traits (e.g., size, elongation, and direction) emanates from the analyses of two global burned-area products derived from MODIS and MERIS sensors with different spatial and temporal resolutions and with cut-off values of 3, 5, 9, and 14 days. To evaluate whether the FRY products are accurately identifying the spatial features of fire patches and what are the most realistic cut-off values to use in different sub-regions of North America, we propose a new functional diversity trait-based approach, which compares the satellite-derived fire patches to forest service perimeters as reference data. This paper shows the accuracy of the FRY fire patches >= 300 ha in North America during 2005-2011. Our analysis demonstrates that fire patches with a high cut-off of 14 days and those derived from the MODIS sensor, with their high temporal resolution, better identify the fire diversity in North America. In conclusion, our statistical framework can be used for assessing satellite-derived fire patches. Furthermore, the temporal resolution of satellite sensors is the most important factor in identifying fire patches- thus space agencies should consider it when planning the future development of cost-effective climate observation systems.

TI  - Multispectral high resolution sensor fusion for smoothing and gap-filling in the cloud
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing optical sensors onboard operational satellites cannot have high spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions simultaneously. In addition, clouds and aerosols can adversely affect the signal contaminating the land surface observations. We present a HIghly Scalable Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (HIST-ARFM) algorithm to combine multispectral images of different sensors to reduce noise and produce monthly gap free high resolution (30 m) observations over land. Our approach uses images from the Landsat (30m spatial resolution and 16 day revisit cycle) and the MODIS missions, both from Terra and Aqua platforms (500m spatial resolution and daily revisit cycle). We implement a bias-aware Kalman filter method in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to obtain fused images at the Landsat spatial-resolution. The added bias correction in the Kalman filter estimates accounts for the fact that both model and observation errors are temporally auto-correlated and may have a non-zero mean. This approach also enables reliable estimation of the uncertainty associated with the final reflectance estimates, allowing for error propagation analyses in higher level remote sensing products. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated products through comparison with other state-of-the-art methods confirm the validity of the approach, and open the door to operational applications at enhanced spatio-temporal resolutions at broad continental scales.

TI  - MODIS land surface temperature time series decomposition for detecting and characterizing temporal intensity variations of coal fire induced thermal anomalies in Jharia coalfield, India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term MODIS time series Land Surface Temperature (LST) observations over coal fire affected areas were utilized for detection and characterization of coal fire as a function of its temporal intensity variation (e.g. growing, temporally consistent or diminishing) on annual basis in Jharia coalfield. LST pixel time series (LPTS) vectors were generated for selected coal fire and non-coal fire locations using 782 LST maps of the duration 2001 - 2017. LPTS vectors were decomposed to extract the nonlinear trend component using Seasonal Trend decomposition based on Loess model. Background-referenced trends were generated for coal fire pixels. Slope,p-value of Mann-Kendall test and average annual deviation parameters were calculated for annually segmented background-referenced coal fire trends to characterize coal fire on annual basis and to separate coal fire induced anomalous trend and non-coal fire trends. The results were validated with that of published literature.

TI  - Self-Synchronized, Continuous Body Weight Monitoring Using Flexible Force Sensors and Ground Reaction Force Signal Processing
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Change patterns in body weight are significant indicators of a variety of medical conditions and in some instances, such as congestive heart failure, strong predictors of critical care interventions. The continuous monitoring of body weight can therefore help care givers and patients reduce the risks that are inherent in ignoring body weight changes or in measuring them infrequently. One possible approach to continuous body weight monitoring is to use shoe-integrated sensors. Such approach is however hampered by the lack of patient's adherence to medical protocols and by the detrimental impact of motion artifacts on weight measurements during body movement. The objective of this paper is to show that both problems can be readily addressed by pushing body weight measurement into the background of the patient's daily routine and by adapting piezoresistive flexible force sensors to the specific requirements of accurate body weight measurement during motion. The proposed solution is enabled by two major innovations. The first is a sensor array architecture that helps in collecting the total vertical GRF on each foot during the walk cycle. The second is based on extracting unique features from the waveforms of ground reaction forces (GRFs) as measured by the flexible force sensor array. This paper is dedicated to a full and detailed description of this second innovation that includes the extraction of GRF waveform features using real-time signal processing and the elimination of motion artifacts using accurate estimates of the vertical acceleration of the body's center of mass. A prototype demo system of the proposed solution is described along with testing results using a human subject in various walk conditions. The prototype is comprised of three subsystems: the shoe-integrated flexible sensor array, a sentinel subsystem implemented as a wearable smart watch, and a communication subsystem between sensors and sentinel. The prototype is distinguished with several unique features that ensures its wearability and low cost, including its self synchronizing data collection and the absence of any inertial motion units.

TI  - Spatial analysis of early mangrove regeneration in the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia, using geomatics
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Successful mangrove tree regeneration is required to maintain the provision of wood for silviculturally managed mangrove forest areas and to ensure mangrove rehabilitation in disturbed areas. Successful natural regeneration of mangroves after disturbance depends on the dispersal, establishment, early growth and survival of propagules. Focusing on the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) in Peninsular Malaysia, we investigated how the location of a mangrove forest patch might influence the early regeneration of mangroves after clear-felling events that regularly take place on an approximately 30-year rotation as part of local management. We used Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) annual time series from 1988 to 2015 to indicate the recovery of canopy cover during early regeneration, which was determined as the average time (in years) for the NDMI to recover to values associated with the mature forests prior to their clear felling. We found that clear-felled mangrove patches closer to water and/or to already established patches of Rhizophora regenerated more rapidly than those farther away. In contrast, patches located closer to dryland forests regenerated slower compared to patches that were farther away. The study concludes that knowledge of the distribution of water, hydro-period and vegetation communities across the landscape can indicate the likely regeneration of mangrove forests through natural processes and identify areas where active planting is needed. Furthermore, time-series comparisons of the NDMI during the early years of regeneration can assist monitoring of mangrove establishment and regeneration, inform on the success of replanting, and facilitate higher productivity within the MMFR.

TI  - Estimates of plume height from infrasound for regional volcano monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Present efforts in volcano monitoring, particularly in Southeast Asia, rely on the combination of local data (generally gathered at less than 100 km from the volcano), and satellite remote sensing. While this combination has its strengths, there are still weaknesses that the use of ground-based remote sensing data such as distant infrasound measurements could help alleviate. Infrasound offers tools for detecting and characterizing volcanic plumes independent of cloud cover and time of day. Larger volcanic eruptions generate infrasound that is related to the plume and offers a unique view into eruption dynamics within the context of monitoring. Past research has demonstrated that infrasound can be used to estimate source parameters, such as the rate at which material is ejected from volcanic vents during eruptions; these are key input parameters into empirical and numerical models to estimate the height of volcanic plumes, atmospheric ash transport and dispersion. Here, we demonstrate the use of remote infrasound in estimating the height of volcanic plumes, including a case study on the May 30, 2014 plume from the volcano Sangeang Api in Indonesia. We were able to determine the plume height using infrasound gathered from 2000 to over 5000 km distance from the volcano. During the January 2020 eruption of Taal volcano in the Philippines, this method was applied to remote infrasound recorded 1650 km to the east. We show that our workflow can be implemented in near real-time, offering an effective tool for rapid plume height measurement, including associated uncertainties, when volcanic clouds are not visible from the ground or space.

TI  - Modelling hourly spatio-temporal PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in wildfire scenarios using dynamic linear models
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) is one of the main pollutants generated in wildfire events with negative impacts on human health. In research involving wildfires and air quality, it is common to use emission models. However, the commonly used emission approach can generate errors and contradict the empirical data. This paper adopted a statistical approach based in evidence of ground level monitoring and satellite data. An hourly PM2.5 spatio-temporal model based on a dynamic linear modelling framework with Bayesian approach was proposed in a territorial context with a reduced number of monitoring stations for particulate matter. The model validation is complicated by the fact that all monitoring stations are used in the model calibration. The novel validation method proposed considered both the particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 mu m (PM10) recorded as daily value from 24-h mean every six days as well as the PM2.5/PM(10 )ratio. Modelling was carried out to provide satisfactorily the exposure level of PM2.5 in a case study of wildfire event.

TI  - How to quantify the links between bioavailable contamination in watercourses and pressures of anthropogenic land cover, contamination sources and hydromorphology at multiple scales?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Active biomonitoring permits the quantification of biological exposure to chemicals through measurements of bioavailable concentrations in biota and biological markers of toxicity in organisms. It enables respective comparison of the levels of contamination between sites and sampling campaigns. Caged gammarids are recently proposed as relevant probes for measuring bioavailable contamination in freshwater systems. The purpose of the present study was to develop a multi-pressure and multiscale approach, considering metallic contamination levels (from data based on active biomonitoring) as a response to pressures (combination of individual stressors). These pressures were anthropogenic land cover, industry density, wastewater treatment plant density, pressures on stream hydromorphological functioning, riverside vegetation and bioavailability factors. A dataset combining active biomonitoring and potentially related pressures was established at the French national scale, with 196 samplings from 2009 to 2016. The links between pressures and metallic contamination were defined and modelled via structural equation modeling (more specifically partial least squares path modeling). The model enabled the understanding of the respective influences of pressures on metallic bioconcentration in caged sentinel organisms. Beyond validating the local influence of industries and wastewater treatment plants on metallic contamination, this model showed a complementary effect of driving forces of anthropogenic land cover (leading to human activities). It also quantified a significant influence of pressures on stream hydromorphological functioning, presence of vegetation and physico-chemical parameters on metal bioconcentration. This hierarchical multi-pressure approach could serve as a concept on how pressures and contamination (assessed by active biomonitoring) can be connected. Its future application will enable better understanding of environmental pressures leading to contamination in freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - Modeling Diurnal Land Surface Temperature on a Local Scale of an Arid Environment Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Time Series of Landsat-8 Derived Spectral Indexes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to model diurnal Land Surface Temperature (LST) on a local scale of an arid environment by utilizing the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and time series analysis of Landsat-8 satellite imageries. An arid region containing an in-situ LST station (DRA) located in Nevada, United States, was chosen as a test site. 78 Landsat-8 satellite imageries covering the test site were utilized to calculate spectral indexes. Since the spectral indexes represent the surface of Earth as land cover indexes, they can be used as indicators that affect the LST. The relationship between ten spectral indexes and in-situ LST were investigated, and the highly correlated indexes were determined as Built-up Area Extraction Index (BAEI) and Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI). The BAEI and NDBaI showed -0.80 and -0.94 correlation coefficients (r), respectively, with in-situ LST. Those two indexes and meteorological data, namely relative humidity (RH) and air temperature (AT), were used as inputs in the ANN model. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) feed-forward network was considered in this study. The ANN model presented highly accurate results in the training and testing process with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values 0.74 K and 2.54 K, respectively. After learning and testing processes, the weights and biases were extracted to form the mathematical equation of the ANN model, and the equation was utilized to map LST for three data sets which were acquired during the winter and summer times and were not utilized in the ANN model. The results showed that the LST difference was lower than 1 K with regard to wintertime LST images. However, the LST difference was 2.49 K in the summertime. To test the spatial variability of ANN-based LST, MODIS LST products were considered and ANN-based LST was resampled to 1 km, the same resolution as the MODIS data, for comparison. As a result of the comparison, the highest mean LST difference (for all pixels in the scene) between ANN-based and MODIS LST was calculated as 1.1 K. Although the proposed method tended to underestimate LST as it increased, the obtained results showed that the ANN method would be a powerful tool for predicting and modeling the diurnal LST in an arid environment.

TI  - Sentinel-3 OLCI observations of water clarity in large lakes in eastern China: Implications for SDG 6.3.2 evaluation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.3.2 of the United Nations (UN) focuses on ambient water quality, while water clarity simplistically and visually reflect water quality and can potentially support SDG 6.3.2 reporting. In this study, based on extensive field data and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) imagery, a random forest regression (RFR) Secchi depth (Z(sd)) model suitable for turbid and eutrophic waters was established. With this model, the Zsd of 86 large (> 30 km(2)) lakes in Eastern China was obtained from May 2016 to April 2018. Additionally, the potential for applying OLCI-derived Z(sd) data in the SDG 6.3.2 evaluation was assessed. Of six common atmospheric correction (AC) processors (i.e., BAC, C2RCC, POLYMER, BP, MUMM, and 6SV), 6SV often exhibited the best performance except for at 754 nm (root mean square error (RMSE) <= 0.0094 sr(-1), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) <= 36.27%, and mean normalized bias (MNB) <= 15.89%). The RFR model had higher accuracy (R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.13 m, MAPE = 33.43%, and MNB = 14.55%) and was more suitable for eutrophic and turbid inland lakes across Eastern China than the other available Z(sd) algorithms. The average OLCI-derived Z(sd) of the lakes in Eastern China was 0.44 +/- 0.13 m, suggesting that these lakes are extremely turbid. The average Zsd of lakes in the Eastern Plain Lake (EPL) zone (0.45 +/- 0.12 m) was higher than that of the lakes in the Northeastern Plain and Mountain Lake (NPML) zone (0.40 +/- 0.17 m). The majority of lakes showed higher Z(sd) values in summer (rainy season) than in fall and winter (dry season). A simple SDG 6.3.2 evaluation scheme was developed based on the Zsd product, and only 54.65% of the lakes (N = 47) reached the "good" level during the monitoring period as a result of the eutrophication of the lakes in Eastern China. This study provides water clarity information for large lakes in Eastern China and facilitates the understanding of ambient water quality under the 2030 UN SDG framework as well as data and technical support for future SDG 6.3.2 evaluations.

TI  - Observations of SAR polarimetric parameters of lake and fast sea ice during the early growth phase
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines links between two sets of parameters obtained from Radarsat-2 Quad-pol data and geophysical information of lake ice and landfast sea ice in the Resolute Bay area, Nunavut, Canada. The first set includes the three orthogonal backscatter coefficients (sigma(0)(hh), sigma(0)(vv), sigma(0)(vh)) in addition to the total backscatter power (SPAN). The second set includes polarimetric decomposition parameters obtained using Cloude-Pottier and Yamaguchi decomposition methods. Data were collected during the early freezing period from 20 September until 28 December 2017. Meteorological and ice climatological data from the weather station of Resolute Bay were used to facilitate this task. Ice thickness and salinity were obtained from established empirical models. Results show that single-bounce and multiple-bounce scattering mechanisms are active in lake ice during the entire freezing period while multiple-bounce scattering is active in sea ice only during the initial freezing. Backscatter parameters can be used to determine the thickness of lake ice up to any depth, while both backscatter and the tested decomposition parameters are related to the thickness of young sea ice (<30 cm thick). Physical explanations are offered in each case. Spatial maps of ice thickness are produced. Polarimetric decomposition parameters demonstrate erratic behavior throughout the development of lake ice. High entropy (>0.6) is found to be associated with comparable single- and multiple-bounce scattering mechanisms, hence can be used to identify new ice. Orthogonal backscatter coefficients and polarimetric decomposition parameters provide different information, yet their combination offers clues to better identify ice conditions and investigate questions about scattering mechanisms.

TI  - Semi-automated impervious feature extraction using built-up indices developed from space-borne optical and SAR remotely sensed sensors
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to cope up with the emerging demand of interpreting and detecting urban features from remotely sensed imagery, this study proposes an innovative unique yet practically easy approach to extract impervious surfaces and features using certain built-up indices (BUIs) that are developed from space-borne optical and SAR remotely sensed sensors. Resourcesat-2 LISS III and HH/HV dual polarized L-band ALOS PALSAR data are respectively the space-borne optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data used for designing the BUIs used for impervious feature detection. BUI generated from optical sensor uses green (G), red (R), near infrared (NIR) and short wave infrared (SWIR) channels simultaneously. BUI designed from SAR sensor uses horizontal-horizontal (HH) co-polarized and horizontal-vertical (HV) cross-polarized L-band backscatter coefficient/sigma nought (sigma degrees) data. The feature extraction performed by two new indices, one derived from existing indices using spectral-based information from optical sensors- an Impervious Built-up Index (IBUIopt); and the other from SAR HH/HV sigma degrees backscatter information- an Impervious Built-up Index (IBUIsar); are cross-checked and validated with Ground Truth (GT) data that revealed the performance of the indices designed and proposed in the study for three sample sites bearing completely different biophysical environments; for easy and rapid extraction of impervious land features in satellite imageries. Overall accuracies of impervious feature extraction using IBUIopt are 92.3%, 95% and 75.6% in comparison to 90%, 98% and 87.6% using IBUIsar for the three study areas respectively. The approach adopted in this study is henceforth acceptable due to its high accuracy, simplicity and reliability; and hence easy to replicate. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Scalable mapping and monitoring of Mediterranean-climate oak landscapes with temporal mixture models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean-climate oak woodlands are prized for their biodiversity, aesthetics, and ecosystem services. Conservation and maintenance of these landscapes requires accurate observations of both present and historic conditions capable of spanning millions of hectares. Decameter optical satellite image time series have the observational coverage to meet this need, with almost 40 years of intercalibrated global observations from the Landsat program alone. However, the optimal approach to leverage these observations for oak ecosystem monitoring remains elusive. Temporal mixture models (TMMs) may offer a solution. TMMs use a linear inverse model based on temporal endmembers (tEMs) chosen to optimize both parsimony and information content by 1) possessing clear biophysical meaning, and 2) accurately representing the variance structure of the observations in the temporal feature space (TFS) composed of low-order Principal Components. We apply this approach to oak woodlands of the California Sierra Nevada foothills. Low-order TFS structure across the approximate to 1200 km(2) study area is consistently bounded by 4 tEM phenologies: annual grasses, evergreen perennials, deciduous perennials + shadow, and unvegetated areas. Satellite-based tEM phenologies correspond to ground-based PhenoCam time series (correlations 0.8 to 0.9). Systematic temporal decimation is conducted to simulate years with varying numbers of cloud free measurements. Fractional cover of temporal endmembers is observed to scale linearly using as few as 6 images per year and coarse feature space topology is retained with as few as 4 well-timed images per year. In comparing 10 m versus 30 m pixel resolution, linear scaling is observed with correlations of 0.78-0.95. Comparison of 10 m Sentinel-2 and LiDAR-derived tree cover estimates at San Joaquin Experimental Range shows a correlation of 0.74. Visual orthophoto validation shows accuracies of annual, deciduous, and evergreen cover fractions of 74-88% (n = 102). Multi-year analysis of August imagery at Sequoia National Park to investigate dynamics associated with the 2012-2016 drought reveals 5 tEMs corresponding to: steady growth, steady decline, early decline then regrowth, persistent vegetation, and no vegetation. Validation images are sparse, but where available show accuracies in the 88 to 91% range for decrease, growth, and persistently vegetated multiyear endmembers (n = 102). Decreases are observed in areas with oak mortality documented in a recent field-based study. Overall, our results suggest the TMM approach has promise as an accurate, explainable, and linearly scalable method for retrospective analysis and prospective monitoring of Mediterranean-climate oak landscapes.

TI  - Evaluation of the mechanisms and performances of major satellite-based evapotranspiration models in Northwest China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of the water cycle and surface energy balance system. Accurate measurements and estimations of ET can be used to manage and allocate regional water resources and in agricultural water management under climate change. Satellite-based ET models extrapolate site ET values to regional scales, but there are uncertainties in their simulations. In this study, the use of satellite-based ET models including the Shuttleworth-Wallace-Hu (SWH), Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), and the moderate-resolution (MOD) imaging spectroradiometer ET product (MOD16) was validated, and their applicability in Northwest China were compared. In addition, the sensitivity of these models to driving data and the correlation between the models were analyzed. Results showed that the SWH model provided superior applicability in Northwest China, followed by SEBAL and MOD16. The correlation coefficient, mean relative error, root mean square error, and index of agreement of the ET simulated by SWH compared with the eddy flux of the Haibei station were 0.90, 0.39 mm.d (-1), 0.55 mm.d(-1), and 0.87, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity to driving data in SWH was the highest among all models. The correlation between the models was high during the vegetation growth period but low in winter. The model simulation effects were also compared with respect to their mechanisms, and it was evident that further improvements and validation could be achieved by investigating the model structures and examining the ET estimations and critical parameters of each model.

TI  - Soil Suitability Evaluation Using Remotely Sensed Data and GIS: A Case Study from Kumaon Himalayas
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil resource characterization of Kumaon hills of Himalayas was carried out through soil survey and established soil-physiography relationship after identification and delineation of six physiographic units in Khulgad watershed of Almora district, Uttarakhand. The satellite image characteristics identified through the visual/digital interpretation of IRS-1D LISS-III fused with PAN data on 1:12,500 scale were utilized in the present study. Based on the characteristics of soils developed on different physiographic units, the soils were evaluated for land capability classification and suitability for major crops in the region for sustainable development of the study area. GIS technique was used to develop decision trees employing various soil-site parameters for assessing crop suitability. The results revealed that deep to moderately deep soils with high clay content on the stable terraces and valley lands mostly appearing as dark blue to blackish blue in satellite imagery grouped under land capability classes II and III were interpreted as suitable for wheat, rice, finger millet and mustard crops. Moderately deep to deep soils occurring on moderately steep hill slopes and upper terraces were suitable for potato, mustard and finger millets. Soils on degraded hills with terraced tops having forest in patches (showed mix tone of grey and pink in imagery) categorized into class IV were found to be marginally suitable for wheat, mustard and potato with constraints of soil and topography, while soils on upper hill slopes, degraded hill tops/slopes with thin forest/grazing land and rocky ridges with dark to light blue, white and greyish mixed tone and dark blue with pale pink mixed tone in the imagery placed under land capability classes VI to VII were presently not suitable for crops cultivation and moderately suitable for grassland pasture or silvipasture purposes. The extent of suitability of soils for various crops has also been highlighted using GIS software and the maps were prepared. GIS is found to be helpful in processing spatial and non-spatial remote sensing data and conventional data of highly folded and faulted chain of Kumaon Himalayas to evaluate soil-site parameters for assessing crop suitability for optimum utilization of land.

TI  - Air quality impacts of the 2018 Mt. Kilauea Volcano eruption in Hawaii: A regional chemical transport model study with satellite-constrained emissions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic eruptions emit a vast amount of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ash into the air, often imposing substantial impacts on air quality and the ecosystem. Quantifying its impacts, however, is difficult due to the uncertainties in estimating the strength and variations of volcanic emissions. Here we developed and evaluated a new approach to combine satellite SO2 detection and chemical transport modeling to assess the impact of the 2018 Mt. Kilauea eruption on air quality over Hawaii. During the sustained eruption of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii's Big Island from May to July 2018, considerable SO2 and PM2.5 enhancements were observed both from the ground and from space. We studied this case using an experimental version of the NOAA National Air Quality Forecast Capability (NAQFC) modeling system. Daily emissions of SO2 and ash were estimated using a combination of SO2 column density retrieved by Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite (OMPS) Nadir-Mapper (NM) aboard the Suomi-NPP satellite and the NAQFC model with an inverse emission modeling approach. We found that the volcanic SO2 emission rates peaked at 15,000 mol/s from the Kilauea's East Rift zone and Summit. The formation and transport of volcanic smog, or Vog, was highly dependent upon the vertical distribution of the volcanic emission, controlled by the heat flux of emission sources. We conducted four model simulations with various emission settings, and compared them to satellite data (CALIOP, OMPS and VIIRS) and in-situ measurements. All the runs tended to underpredict the peak values of surface SO2 and PM2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 mu m in diameter). The "No Plume Rise" run underestimated the Vog plume rise and downstream transport. Using fixed emission rate or removing the temporal variations ("3-Day Mean") led to miss peak Vog effects or inconsistent transport pattern compared to the observations. Therefore, the Base simulation with daily-varying emission and plume rise was used to quantify the air quality effects of the Kilauea eruption. We found that the volcanic eruption elevated surface PM2.5 concentration by 30-40 mu g/m(3) in the southeast part of the Big Island, with peak values up to 300 mu g/m(3). The Vog effect on trace gases, such as O-3, NOx, and non-methane hydrocarbons, were much weaker (<1 ppbV), but extended to farther downstream.

TI  - Quality indicators in carotid surgery
T2  - GEFASSCHIRURGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. In vascular surgery, carotid artery stenosis is the only disease for which a German nationwide quality assurance is mandatory. In this article the quality indicators (QI) in the quality assurance procedures for carotid artery revascularization (carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting) are described.Methods and definition of terms. The QIs are summarized and put into context with the literature. Furthermore, the different methods, such as QIs, key transparency figures and sentinel event indicators used to assess quality goals are described. Of these only QIs have an established reference range.Results. The aim of carotid revascularization is stroke prevention. The mandatory quality assurance procedure of carotid revascularization therefore pursues two quality goals measured with QIs: the correct indications and low complication rate of the primary endpoint stroke or death. The QI for outcome is measured by calculating the risk-adjusted ratio of the observed expected rate of periprocedural stroke or death. The nationwide adjusted risk over the years was 2.1-2.9% for carotid endarterectomy and 3.1-4.5% for carotid artery stenting.Conclusions. Carotid revascularization is the only procedure in vascular surgery that requires mandatory quality assurance by evaluating the correct indications and periprocedural stroke and fatality risks. This creates an important tool for ensuring the quality of care in invasive treatment of carotid stenosis in Germany. With increasing scientific evidence, a continuous adjustment of the QIs is necessary.

TI  - 150 shades of green: Using the full spectrum of remote sensing reflectance to elucidate color shifts in the ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes a simple and intuitive classification system by which to define full spectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) data with a quantitative output that enables a more manageable handling of spectral information for aquatic science applications. The weighted harmonic mean of the R-rs(lambda) wavelengths outputs an Apparent Visible Wavelength (in units of nanometers), representing a one-dimensional geophysical metric of color that is inherently correlated to spectral shape. This dimensionality reduction of spectral information combined with the output along a continuum of wavelength values offers a robust and user-friendly means to describe and analyze spectral R-rs(lambda) in terms of spatial and temporal trends and variability. The uncertainty in the algorithm's estimation of spectral shape is demonstrated on a global scale, in addition to the utility of the algorithm to discern spectral-spatial-temporal trends in the ocean, on a per-pixel basis for the entire 22 year continuous ocean color (SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua) time-series. This technique can be applied to datasets of varying multi- and hyper-spectral resolutions, providing continuity between heritage and future satellite sensors, and further enabling an effective means of elucidating similarities or differences in complex spectral signatures within the constraints of two dimensions. This straightforward means of conceptualizing multi-dimensional variability can help maximize the potential of the spectral information embedded in remote sensing data.

TI  - Disentangling the role of prefire vegetation vs. burning conditions on fire severity in a large forest fire in SE Spain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire severity is a function of dynamic interactions between vegetation and burning conditions. To understand the factors that control it, accurate methods for estimating prefire vegetation structure and composition as well as fire propagation conditions are required. Here we analyzed the spatial variability of fire severity in a mixed-severity fire (3217 ha) that occurred in southeast Spain (Yeste, Albacete) from 27th July to 1th August 2017, burning mostly a pine woodland, including part of an earlier fire in 1994. Fire severity was estimated using three satellite-based indices derived from the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) using Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images from the dates before and immediately after fire. The field-based Composite Burn Index (CBI) was used for validation. Prefire vegetation conditions and fuel models were derived from LiDAR metrics and other vegetation data. Fire propagation conditions were estimated based on a fire progression map provided by the Forestry Services of Castilla-La Mancha. In addition, hourly fire weather and aligned (i.e., in the sense of the propagating fire-front) slope and wind speed were calculated for each burning period. Regression models using different spectral fire severity indices and their driving factors were obtained applying Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs). Fire severity was highly predicted by both burning conditions and prefire vegetation (mean adjusted R-2 [Adj.R-2]: 86% +/- 0.04 and 68% +/- 0.05 for training and validation sets, respectively). Alone, burning conditions explained more variance than LiDAR metrics and vegetation separately. The single variables that contributed most to the models were the rate of spread of the fire-front, biomass proxies (i.e., Leaf Area Index [LAI] and fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation [fPAR]) and understory vegetation (i.e., density of LiDAR points 1-2 m). Higher fire severity occurred in areas burning uphill, with a high rate of spread driven by high velocity winds and under high maximum temperature. Fire severity was high in wooded stands that were heterogeneous in height, composed by scattered and small Pinus halepensis trees, with high and homogeneous understory cover. In contrast, lower fire severity occurred in mature stands dominated by tall Pinus pinaster and Pinus nigra trees. There were strong interactions between vegetation, weather, fire-aligned topography and rate of spread. Because vegetation variables were important drivers of fire severity, even under extreme fire weather conditions, fuel management treatments to limit fire severity and, potentially, fire size should be implemented.

TI  - Mapping sugarcane plantation dynamics in Guangxi, China, by time series Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane is a major crop for sugar and ethanol production and its area has increased substantially in tropical and subtropical regions in recent decades. Updated and accurate sugarcane maps are critical for monitoring sugarcane area and production and assessing its impacts on the society, economy and the environment. To date, no sugarcane mapping tools are available to generate annual maps of sugarcane at the field scale over large regions. In this study, we developed a pixel- and phenology-based mapping tool to produce an annual map of sugarcane at 10-m spatial resolution by analyzing time-series Landsat-7/8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 images (LC/ S2/S1) during August 31, 2017 - July 1, 2019 in Guangxi province, China, which accounts for 65% of sugarcane production of China. First, we generated annual maps of croplands and other land cover types in 2018. Second, we delineated the cropping intensity (single, double and triple cropping in a year) for all cropland pixels in 2018. Third, we identified sugarcane fields in 2018 based on its phenological characteristics. The resultant 2018 sugarcane map has producer, user and overall accuracies of 88%, 96% and 96%, respectively. According to the annual sugarcane map in 2018, there was a total of 8940 km(2) sugarcane in Guangxi, which was similar to 1% higher than the estimate from the Guangxi Agricultural Statistics Report. Finally, we identified green-up dates of those sugarcane fields in 2019, which could be used to support the sugarcane planting and management activities. Our study demonstrates the potential of the pixel- and phenology-based sugarcane mapping tool (both the algorithms and the LC/S2/S1 time series images) in identifying croplands, cropping intensity and sugarcane fields in the complex landscapes with diverse crop types, fragmented crop fields and frequent cloudy weather. The resultant annual maps from this study could be used to assist farms and sugarcane mills for sustainable sugarcane production and environment.

TI  - Recent declines in global water vapor from MODIS products: Artifact or real trend?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric water vapor plays a key role in the global water and energy cycles. Accurate estimation of water vapor and consistent representation of its spatial-temporal variation are critical to climate analysis and model validation. This study used ground observational data from global radiosonde and sunphotometer networks to evaluate MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) precipitable water vapor (PWV) products for 2000-2017. The products included the thermal-infrared (TIR) (Collection 6, C006) and its updated version (Collection 061, C061), and near-infrared (NIR) products (C061). Our results demonstrated that compared to its earlier version subject to sensor crosstalk problem, the C061_TIR data showed improved accuracy in terms of bias, standard deviation, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and coefficient of determination, regression slope and intercept. Among the PWV products, C061_NIR data achieved the best overall performance in accuracy evaluation. The C061_NIR revealed the PWV had a multi-year average of 2.50 +/- 0.08 cm for the globe, 2.03 +/- 0.06 cm for continents, and 2.70 +/- 0.09 cm for oceans in 2000-2017. The PWV values yielded an increasing rate of 0.015 cm/year for the globe, 0.010 cm/year for continents, and 0.017 cm/year for oceans. Nearly 98.95% of the globe showed an increasing trend, 80.74% of statistical significance, mainly distributed within and around the tropical zones. The findings should be valuable for understanding of global water and energy cycles.

TI  - Changes of water clarity in large lakes and reservoirs across China observed from long-term MODIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity is a well-established first-order indicator of water quality and has been used globally by water regulators in their monitoring and management programs. Assessments of water clarity in lakes over large temporal and spatial scales, however, are rare, limiting our understanding of its variability and the driven forces. In this study, we developed and validated a robust Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) algorithm for lakes across China based on two water color parameters, namely Forel-Ule Index (FUI) and hue angle alpha, retrieved from MODIS data. The MODIS Z(SD) model shows good results when compared with in-situ measurements from 17 lakes, with a 27.4% mean relative difference (MRD) in the validation dataset. Compared with other empirical Z(SD) models, our FUI and alpha-based model demonstrates improved performance and adaptability over a wide range of water clarity and trophic states. This algorithm was subsequently applied to MODIS measurements to provide a comprehensive assessment of water clarity in large lakes (N = 153) across China for the first time. The mean summer Z(SD) of the studied lakes between 2000 and 2017 demonstrated marked spatial and temporal variations. Spatially, the Z(SD) of large lakes presented a distinct spatial pattern of "high west and low east" over China. This spatial pattern was found to be associated with the significant differences in lake depth and altitude between west and east China while China's population, GDP, temperature, and precipitation distribution have also contributed to a certain extent. Temporally, the Z(SD) of most lakes increased during this period, with an overall mean rate of 3.3 cm/yr for all lakes. Here, 38.6% (N = 59) of the lakes experienced a significant increase in their Z(SD) value during the past 18 years while only 8.5% (N = 13) showed a significant decreasing trend. Significant increases in lake Z(SD) were observed in west China, which were found to correlate with the increase of air temperature and lake surface area. This is possibly a response of the lakes in west China to climate change. In the lake systems of east China, which are predominately used as a drinking water source, the increase in lake Z(SD) was found to be strongly correlated with changes in local GDP (gross domestic production), NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and lake surface area, suggesting a combined effect of the implemented management practices and climatic variability. The results of this study provide important information for water quality conservation and management in China, and also highlight the value of satellite remote sensing in monitoring water quality over lakes at a large scale and long-term.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Field-level monitoring of crop types in the United States via the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) has played an important role in improving production forecasts and enabling large-scale study of agricultural inputs and outcomes. Although CDL offers crop type maps across the conterminous US from 2008 onward, such maps are missing in many Midwestern states or are uneven in quality before 2008. To fill these data gaps, we used the now-public Landsat archive and cloud computing services to map corn and soybean at 30m resolution across the US Midwest from 1999-2018. Our training data were CDL from 2008-2018, and we validated the predictions on CDL 1999-2007 where available, county-level crop acreage statistics, and state-level crop rotation statistics. The corn-soybean maps, which we call the Corn-Soy Data Layer (CSDL), are publicly hosted on Google Earth Engine and also available for download online

TI  - DART radiative transfer modelling for sloping landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Topography is one of the key factors that impact remotely sensed data and their interpretation. Indeed, combined with the viewing geometry and neighbour effects, it strongly affects the direct, diffuse and multi-scattered scene irradiance, which in turn impacts the radiative budget and remote sensing signals of the landscapes. The increased availability of digital elevation models (DEM) and the advancement of 3D radiative transfer (RT) models allow us to better address these topographic effects. DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) is one of the most accurate and comprehensive 3D RT models that simulate remote sensing observations of natural and urban landscapes with topography and atmosphere. It simulates environmental effects (i.e., impact of adjacent landscape on the observed landscape) using a so-called infinite slope mode that infinitely duplicates the observed landscape while ensuring the continuity of slope and altitude at the DEM edges. Up to DART version 5.7.4, this mode was slightly inaccurate and computer intensive, depending on the topography. This paper presents an innovative modelling strategy that greatly improves it in terms of accuracy, image quality and computer efficiency. For that, a fictive auxiliary oblique plane, adapted to the landscape topography, is introduced for managing the scene illumination, the Earth-Atmosphere coupling and the storage of the radiation that exits the scene before being projected onto the sensor plane. Improvements and validations are illustrated both visually and quantitatively by DART images, radiometric products and radiative budget. For example, the observed reflectance of a Lambertian slope is equal to the expected analytical value. In addition, the solar plane reflectance of a forest on a mountain slope (experimental scene) has an average error of about 0.01% relative to the reflectance of the same forest stand in the reference scene (i.e., nine duplications of the experimental scene). This new modelling is already integrated in the official DART version (https://dart.omp.eu).

TI  - Wetland extent tools for SDG 6.6.1 reporting from the Satellite-based Wetland Observation Service (SWOS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Wetlands are the most fragile and threatened ecosystems worldwide, and also one of the most rapidly declining. At the same time wetlands are typically biodiversity hotspots and provide a range of valuable ecosystem services, such as water supply and purification, disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and carbon sequestration.Pressures on wetlands are likely to further intensify in the coming decades due to increased global demand for land and water, and due to climate change. Stakeholders at all levels of governance have to be involved to slow, stop and reverse these processes. However, the information they need on wetland extent, their ecological character, and their ecosystem services is often scattered, sparse and difficult to find and access.The freely available Sentinel satellite data of the Copernicus Programme, as well as the Landsat archive, provide a comprehensive basis to map and inventory wetland areas (extent), to derive information on the ecological status, as well as long- and short-term trends in wetland characteristics. However, making use of these Earth Observation (EO) resources for robust and standardized wetland monitoring requires expert knowledge on often complex data processing techniques, which impedes practical implementation. In this respect, the Satellite-based Wetland Observation Service (SWOS), a Horizon 2020 funded project (www.swos-service.eu) has developed and made disseminated monitoring approaches based on EO data, specifically designed for less experienced satellite data users.The SWOS monitoring tools aim at assisting countries in conducting national wetland inventories for their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting and monitoring obligations, and additionally facilitates other monitoring obligations such as those required by the Ramsar Convention and supports decision-making in local conservation activities. The four main components of the SWOS approach are: map and indicator production; software development; capacity building; and initializing the GEO Wetlands Community Portal. Wetland managers and data analysists from more than fifty wetland sites and river basins across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa investigated the benefits and limitations of this EO-based wetland mapping and monitoring approach.We describe research that applies the SWOS tools to test their potential for the mapping of wetlands in a case study based in Albania, and show its effectiveness to derive metrics relevant to the monitoring of SDG indicator 6.6.1.

TI  - Aerosol data assimilation using data from Fengyun-4A, a next-generation geostationary meteorological satellite
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) meteorological satellite, a next-generation geostationary meteorological satellite, was launched on December 11, 2016. For instance, the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) aboard FY-4A (AGRI/FY-4A) takes full-disk images at a 15-min interval in 14 spectral bands with the 0.5-4-km resolution. Here we developed data assimilation system based on the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system in which the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) derived from FY-4A data were successfully assimilated for the first time. The capability to assimilate FY-4A Aerosol optical depth (AOD) with an hourly cycling configuration was then evaluated by a dust storm over East Asia during 12-14 May 2019. The analyses initialized Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model forecasts. The system is tested with FY-4 AOD, Himawari-8 AOD in experiments and then the results are compared to the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD observations, which serving as the independent observations. The results indicated that assimilating FY-4 AOD substantially showed much better agreement with observations than those from the control. Furthermore, the Bias and RMSE generally reduced about 20% with forecast range. This study indicates that the aerosol data assimilation using data from FY-4A can be used to improve the performance of forecast model.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and land expansion persistently shrink urban green field, which accelerates soil sealing and land degradation. Spatio-tempral pattern analysis of green field caused by soil sealing contributes to its protection but quantitative tools are rare. Taking Shanghai-Hangzhou Bay Urban Agglomeration (SHBUA) as an example, we interpreted Landsat imagery into three categories: green filed (such as farmland, grass, forest etc.), gray field (impervious surface) and water bodies in 1994, 2003, 2009, and 2015. We first analyzed swallowed green field by soil sealing and then calculated density (proportion) of green field in concentric rings using gradient analysis. Results show that green field density increases slowly around the city center followed by a sharp increase from urban core areas to urban fringe, and then slowly increases again until at a stable level, presenting an S-shape overall. We proposed an S-shaped function that can fit the spatial gradient of green field density well in nine represented cities. We further compare spatial gradients of densities of green field and gray field. This study provides a quantitative tool to characterize the spatial distribution of green field within cities, which supports to find hotspots of green field loss due to soil sealing and further identify prior areas for green field protection.

TI  - DeepCropMapping: A multi-temporal deep learning approach with improved spatial generalizability for dynamic corn and soybean mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop mapping provides important and timely information for decision support on the estimation of crop production at large scale. Most existing crop-specific cover products based on remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms cannot serve large agriculture production areas as a result of poor model transfer capabilities. Developing a generalizable crop classification model for spatial transfer across regions is greatly needed. A deep learning approach, named DeepCropMapping (DCM), has been developed based on long short-term memory structure with attention mechanisms through integrating multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing data for large-scale dynamic corn and soybean mapping. Full cross validation of classification experiments were conducted in six sites each covering 2,890,000 pixels at 30 m resolution in the U.S. corn belt from Year 2015 to 2018. Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) and Cropland Data Layer (CDL) were adopted as the input satellite observations and ground reference, respectively. Transformer, Random Forest (RF), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were built for comparison. The DCM model produced a mean kappa score of 85.8% in base sites and a mean average kappa score of 82.0% in transfer sites at the end of the growing season. It yielded a comparable performance to Transformer and better than RF and MLP at the local test. The DCM model significantly outperformed other three models with a 95% confidence interval in the spatial transfer analysis. The results demonstrated the capability of learning generalizable features by the DCM model from ARD time series. The computational complexity analysis suggested that the DCM model required a shorter training time than Transformer but longer than MLP and RF. The results of the in-season classification experiment indicated the DCM model captured critical information from key growth phases and achieved higher accuracy than other models after the beginning of July. By monitoring the classification confidence in each time step, the results showed that the increased length of seasonal remote sensing time series would reduce the classification uncertainty in all sites. This study provided a viable option toward large-scale dynamic crop mapping through the integration of deep learning and remote sensing time series.

TI  - The Impact of Glacier Surface Temperature on the Glacier Retreat of Agri Mountain
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agri ice cap is the biggest glacier in Turkey, but there are only a few published studies on Agri glacier. Many of them are focused on the spatial changes of the glacier detected by temporal data. In addition to the spatiotemporal changes of glacier, the main contribution of this study is to investigate the relation between Glacier Surface Temperature Anomalies (GSTA) and glacier retreat. The study was conducted in two steps by using Landsat TM 4-5 and Landsat 8 Oli satellite data. In the first step, the glacier boundaries were delineated with both band ratio technique and Normalize Difference Snow Index for each year and the spatiotemporal analysis is performed. In the second step, GSTA were calculated by using thermal infrared bands, and the areas with high anomalies were compared with the melting areas in the sequential years. According to results, a loss of 39% of glacier in the period of 28 years was determined. Furthermore, the relationship between GSTA and melting areas was exposed in both short- and long-term analysis. Hence, GSTA should be in consideration as a vital specification in the prediction of melting zones studies.

TI  - Satellite-derived river width and its spatiotemporal patterns in China during 1990-2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers are essential to the Earth's ecosystem, but the current understanding of river width variability is limited, owing to the sparse distribution of gauging stations. Remote sensing data enable the surveying and analysis of river geomorphology by providing multi-temporal Earth observation data from satellites at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. We proposed an optimized RivWidth method to automatically calculate width for all channels in a water map and parallelized it to produce the Multi-temporal China River Width (MCRW) dataset, which is the first 30-m multi-temporal river width dataset for China during 1990-2015, including estimates under both seasonal fluctuations and dynamic inundation frequencies. The MCRW dataset is made up of 1.3 x 10(8) seasonal estimates of river width, and covers 1.4 x 10(5) km of rivers in China. We validated the MCRW dataset against in-situ measurements. The MCRW estimates at maximum water extent showed a satisfactory accuracy of 15.0% and 15.2% for the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE), respectively. The MCRW dataset was further compared with the current state-of-the-art global product, the Global River Widths from Landsat (GRWL) dataset, which demonstrated the superiority of the MCRW in describing the basins of China. Our analysis indicated that the mean river widths of China in both summer and winter have increased over the past 25 years, and river width of the Yangtze River mainstream in the lower drainage region has shown a downward trend while the its middle reaches and tributaries (upstream of the Three Gorges Dam) have shown an upward trend. We also developed a locally adaptive search method to quantify seasonal (summer and winter) river width variability. The results revealed that most of the rivers were wider in summer during the study period, and mainstream of Yangtze River in middle/lower region exhibited less seasonal variability than its tributaries. Larger widths were observed in the middle reaches of the Yellow River and the upper reaches of the Black River in winter due to ice-jam floods. Overall, the generated MCRW dataset has the potential to serve as a fundamental resource in Earth system science, and could provide valuable support to surface water resource and riverine management.

TI  - The SPART model: A soil-plant-atmosphere radiative transfer model for satellite measurements in the solar spectrum
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiative transfer models (RTMs) of vegetation canopies can be applied for the retrieval of numerical values of vegetation properties from satellite data. For such retrieval, it is necessary first to apply atmospheric correction to translate the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) satellite data into top-of-canopy (TOC) values. This atmospheric correction typically assumes a Lambertian surface reflection, which introduces errors if the real surface is non-Lambertian. Furthermore, atmospheric correction requires atmospheric characterization as input, which is not always available. In this study, we present an RTM for soil-plant-atmosphere systems to model TOC and TOA reflectance as observed by sensors, and to retrieve vegetation properties directly from TOA reflectance skipping the atmosphere correction processes with the inversion mode of the RTM. The model uses three computationally efficient RTMs for soil (BSM), vegetation canopies (PROSAIL) and atmosphere (SMAC), respectively. The sub-models are coupled by using the four-stream theory and the adding method. The resulting 'Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Radiative Transfer model' (SPART) simulates directional TOA spectral observations, with all major effects included, such as sun-observer geometries and non-Lambertian reflectance of the land surface. A sensitivity anaylsis of the model shows that neglecting anisotropic reflection of the surface in coupling the surface with atmosphere causes considerable errors in TOA reflectance. The model was validated by comparing TOC and TOA reflectance simulations with those simulated with the atmosphere-included version of the DART RTM model. We show that the differences between DART and SPART are less than 7% for simulating TOC reflectance, and are less than 20% (less than 10% at most bands) for simulating TOA reflectance. The model performance in retrieving key vegetation and atmospheric properties was evaluted by using a synthetic dataset and a satellite dataset. The inversion mode allows estimating vegetation properties along with atmospheric properties and TOC reflectance with reasonable accuracy directly from TOA observations, and remarkable accuracy can be achieved if prior information is used in the model inversion. The model can be used to investigate the sensitivity of surface and atmospheric properties on TOC and TOA reflectance and for the simulation of synthetic data of existing and forthcoming satellite missions. More importantly, it facilitates a quantitative use of remote sensing data from satellites directly without the need for atmospheric correction.

TI  - Using Landsat 8 data to compare percent impervious surface area and normalized difference vegetation index as indicators of urban heat island effects in Connecticut, USA
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This empirical research examines the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the percent impervious surface area (%ISA) as indicators of urban heat island (UHI) effects, using the relationships between land surface temperature (LST), %ISA, and NDVI. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor data were used to estimate the LST in Connecticut at different times. A map of the percent impervious surface was generated using the Impervious Surface Analysis Tool developed by the Center for Land Use Education and Research and distributed through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Strong linear relationships between LST and %ISA exist, as stated in previous studies, whereas the relationship between LST and NDVI is evidently affected by the seasons. As the patterns of LST in urban areas are influenced by the UHI, the results demonstrate that %ISA is a more reliable indicator of UHI effects than NDVI. Thus, %ISA could be a promising alternative for use in the quantitative analysis of LST when studying UHI effects.

TI  - Remote detection of ecosystem degradation in the Everglades ridge-slough landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Indicators of landscape condition should be sensitive and specific to environmental change and provide early warning detection of ncipient changes. We assessed a suite of five spectral metrics derived from Landsat 5 TM imagery spanning a decade (1996-2007) to quantify ecosystem condition in the ridge-slough mosaic of the Everglades (South Florida, USA). These included the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the same index using green instead of red band as the visible reference (NDVIg), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), the simple ratio of NIR and red bands (SR) and the moisture stress index (MSI). Mean and variance from pure ridge or slough pixels (i.e., those >30 m from a mapped patch edge) were quantified for twentyfour 2 x 5 km blocks across a gradient of hydrologic and ecological condition. Metrics were compared with field measures of landscape condition from block-scale soil elevation surveys, which capture dramatic spatial gradients between conserved and degraded locations. Elevationbased measures of landscape condition, validated as diagnostic in previous work, included soil elevation bi-modality (BISE), a binary measure of ecosystem condition, and the soil elevation standard deviation (SDSE), a continuous measure of condition. Spectral metric performance was assessed based on the strength (sensitivity) and shape (leading vs.lagging) of the relationship with elevation-based measures. We observed significant logistic regression slopes with BISE for only 3 metrics (mean ridge NDVI and NDVIg, mean ridge SR). In prediction of variance SDSE, the standard deviation of our VIs was more informative than the mean, and measures from sloughs more informative than ridges. The strongest predictions are variance in slough NDVIg and SR, suggesting that spatial heterogeneity in slough biomass is most informative for predicting the status of soil elevation variance. None of the vegetation metrics were leading indicators of change; a multivariate model using three VIs selected based on consistent performance across years (variance in Slough SR, slough NDVIg, and ridge NDWI) substantially improve predictions of SDSE and yielded more plausible prediction maps. These findings suggest that soil elevation changes from altered peat accretion dynamics precede visible changes in vegetation reflectance. While this constrains predictions of incipient ecosystem change, the reasonable performance of spectral metrics indicates that efficient monitoring of ridge-slough landscape health is possible as part of the ongoing Everglades restoration effort.

TI  - A long short-term memory approach to predicting air quality based on social media data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution, such as PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic equivalent diameter of less than 2.5 mu m), PM10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic equivalent diameter of less than 10 mu m), NOx, and SOx, is a global concern because it may cause many chronic and fatal diseases, especially in developing countries. To better address air pollution problems, an important step is the timely and accurate prediction of air quality. Traditional methods are mainly based on meteorological data, regression model data, remote sensing data and different retrieval methods. Numerous studies on deep learning methods have suggested that these approaches may be able to perform accurate predictions for complex systems. In this paper, a long short-term memory (LSTM) approach for predicting air quality is proposed; moreover, meteorological data are used and Chinese social media is investigated as a proxy for public perceptions and responses for air quality prediction. We gathered daily air quality data, meteorological data and Weibo check-in data for Beijing, China from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016. The average sentiment of the related Weibo posts was selected as the public response proxy. The performance of our proposed model is evaluated based on real data. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) indicated that our method presented better prediction results than traditional methods in terms of the PM2.5, PM10, O-3, NO2, SO2 and CO concentrations. We focused on the prediction performance during the 2015 China Victory Day Parade period, during which social and political factors played an important role in air quality predictions. The results indicated that the proposed method, which incorporates public response data, was especially suitable for predicting the air quality in extreme short-term social events and provides a timely social measurement and feedback for environmental problems.

TI  - Three-dimensional convolutional neural network model for tree species classification using airborne hyperspectral images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data with both rich spectral and spatial features can effectively improve the classification accuracy of vegetation species. However, the spectral data of hundreds of bands brings about problems such as dimensional explosion, which poses a huge challenge for hyperspectral remote sensing classification based on classical parameters models. Deep learning methods have been used for remotely sensed images classification in recent years, but the popular HSI datasets including Kennedy Space Center, Indian Pines, Pavia University scene and Salinas scene, have low spatial resolution, significant differences between categories, and regular boundaries. When applied to the classification of forestry tree species, the accuracy often decreases because the spectral response of different plants of the same family and genus are very similar, especially under the fragmented species distribution, complex topography and the occluded canopy. So we collect new data sets, selected Gaofeng State Owned Forest Farm in Guangxi province in south China as the research area and adopted the airborne hyperspectral data obtained by the LiCHy system of the Chinese Academy of Forestry to explore an improved three-dimensional convolutional neural network(3D-CNN) model for tree species classification. The proposed model uses raw data as input without dimension reduction or feature screening, and simultaneously extracts spectral and spatial features. After the 3D convolutional layer, the captured high-level semantic concept is a joint spatial spectral feature representation, so we can turn it into a one-dimensional feature as a new input to learn a more abstract level of expression. The widely used earlystop method is also used to prevent overfitting. The proposed model is a lightweight, generalized, and fast convergence classification model, by which the short-time and large-area of multiple tree species classification with high-precision can be realized. The result shows that the 3D-1D CNN model can shorten the training time of the 3D CNN model by 60% and achieve a classification accuracy of 93.14% within 50 ha in 6.37 min, which provides a basis for the classification of tree species, the mapping of forest form and the inventory of forest resources.

TI  - A generalized approach based on convolutional neural networks for large area cropland mapping at very high resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate delineation of the cropland extent over large area is crucial for operational agriculture monitoring and is also beneficial to address food security issues. Existing global datasets associated with cropland are limited by insufficient spatial resolution to properly represent areas with small parcel size distributions, and their less-than-ideal accuracies hamper application at regional and local scales. Diverse very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite systems are now available, offering sub-meter to five-meter resolution (e.g. Gaofen-1, Gaofen-2, and ZiYuan-3), and hence enabling explicit extraction of cropland areas from heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes. This study presented a generalized methodology for operational cropland mapping at very high resolution using a deep convolutional neural network to automatically learn the robust and discriminative features. Specifically, we slightly modified the pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet) and combined deep long-range features with shadow local features to provide predictions with high level of detail. We demonstrated the modified PSPNet (MPSPNet) over four province-wide study areas (Heilongjiang, Hebei, Zhejiang and Guangdong) with diverse agrosystems across China from north to south using multi-source very high spatial resolution satellite images (mainly Gaofen-1 supplemented with Gaofen-2 and ZiYuan-3), with the overall accuracies ranging from 89.99% to 92.31%. Moreover, we compared MPSPNet with other CNN models and investigated the its behavior by visualizing the learned features on different layers, indicating that combining low and high level features for final classification was an efficient and accurate strategy for cropland mapping because the former capture edge information related to object boundaries and the latter could learn long-range spatial dependencies that helped recognize croplands. The temporal transfer and spatial transfer assessments from the respects of qualitative and quantitative corroborated the robust generalizability of the proposed method. And the contrast to the traditional object-based classification method also demonstrated the advantages and strong generalization capabilities of MPSPNet in extracting cropland using VHSR remote sensed images. We compared our results with the current cropland maps generated from FROM-GLC10, which further verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach for large-scale cropland mapping at very high resolution.

TI  - Quantifying expansion and removal of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> on Chongming island, China, using time series Landsat images during 1995-2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rampant encroachment of Spartina alterniflora into coastal wetlands of China over the past decades has adversely affected both coastal ecosystems and socio-economic systems. However, there are no annual or multi-year epoch maps of Spartina saltmarsh in China, which hinders our understanding and management of Spartina invasion. In this study, we selected Chongming island, China, where Spartina saltmarsh had expanded rapidly since its introduction in the 1990s. We investigated phenology of Spartina, Phragmites and Scirpus saltmarshes, and the time series vegetation indices derived from Landsat images showed that Spartina saltmarsh did not green-up in April-May and stayed green in December-January, which differed from the phenology of Phragmites and Scirpus saltmarshes. We developed a pixel- and phenology-based algorithm that used time series Landsat data to identify and map Spartina saltmarsh, and we applied it to quantify the temporal dynamics (expansion and removal) of Spartina saltmarsh on Chongming island during 1995-2018. The resultant maps showed that Spartina saltmarsh area on Chongming island increased from similar to 4 ha in 1995 to similar to 2067 ha in 2012 but dropped substantially to similar to 729 ha in 2016 after a large-scale ecological engineering project (US$ 186 million) was started to remove Spartina during 2013-2016. Chongming island still had similar to 1315 ha Spartina saltmarsh in 2018, and majority of it was distributed outside the Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve, which could serve as the sources for reinvasion in the near future. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using time series Landsat images, pixel- and phenology-based algorithm, and GEE platform to identify and map Spartina saltmarsh over years in the region, which is useful to the management of invasive plants in coastal wetlands.

TI  - Reconstruction of daytime land surface temperatures under cloud-covered conditions using integrated MODIS/Terra land products and MSG geostationary satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is considerable demand for satellite observations that can support spatiotemporally continuous mapping of land surface temperature (LST) because of its strong relationships with many surface processes. However, the frequent occurrence of cloud cover induces a large blank area in current thermal infrared-based LST products. To effectively fill this blank area, a new method for reconstructing the cloud-covered LSTs of Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daytime observations is described using random forest (RF) regression approach. The high temporal resolution of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) LST product assisted in identifying the temporal variations in cloud cover. The cumulative downward shortwave radiation flux (DSSF) was estimated as the solar radiation factor for each MODIS pixel based on the MSG DSSF product to represent the impact from cloud cover on incident solar radiation. The RF approach was used to fit an LST linking model based on the datasets collected from clear-sky pixels that depicted the complicated relationship between LST and the predictor variables, including the surface vegetation index (the normalized difference vegetation index and the enhanced vegetation index), normalized difference water index, solar radiation factor, surface albedo, surface elevation, surface slope, and latitude. The fitted model was then used to reconstruct the LSTs of cloud-covered pixels. The proposed method was applied to the Terra/MODIS daytime LST product for four days in 2015, spanning different seasons in southwestern Europe. A visual inspection indicated that the reconstructed LSTs thoroughly captured the distribution of surface temperature associated with surface vegetation cover, solar radiation, and topography. The reconstructed LSTs showed similar spatial pattern according to the comparison with clear-sky LSTs from temporally adjacent days. In addition, evaluations against Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) NOAH 0.25 degrees 3-h LST data and reference LST data derived based on in-situ air temperature measurements showed that the reconstructed LSTs presented a stable and reliable performance. The coefficients of determination derived with the GLDAS LST data were all above 0.59 on the four examined days. These results indicate that the proposed method has a strong potential for reconstructing LSTs under cloud-covered conditions and can also accurately depict the spatial patterns of LST.

TI  - Remote sensing spatiotemporal patterns of frozen soil and the environmental controls over the Tibetan Plateau during 2002-2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The changing climate is affecting the frozen soil at an unprecedented rate across the Northern Hemisphere. However, due to sparse ground measurements, the changes of frozen soil and the environmental controls over the vast cryosphere are still unclear, such as in the Tibetan Plateau (TP). In this study, a process-based model solely driven by satellite remote sensing data is employed to investigate the spatiotemporal changes of seasonally frozen ground and permafrost over the entire TP (similar to 3 million km(2)) during 2002-2016 at a spatial resolution of 1 km. Comprehensive validations against in situ observations of frozen ground types, mean annual ground temperature, active layer thickness, soil temperature, and frozen depth at 608 boreholes and 109 meteorological stations demonstrate an overall satisfactory performance of the model in reproducing the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of the frozen soil in the region. Spatially, land surface temperature (LST; both in-season and off-season) primarily controls the frozen ground types and frozen depth, with seasonally frozen ground and permafrost covering similar to 56% and similar to 37% of the plateau, respectively. The estimated spatial-averaged annual maximum soil freeze depth (SFD) is similar to 1.29 m, and the annual maximum active layer thickness (ALT) of permafrost is similar to 1.85 m. Temporally, ALT shows an overall increasing trend at an average rate of +3.17 cm yr(-1), while SFD exhibits both decreasing (at similar to 62% areas) and increasing (at similar to 38% areas) trends in the region. Again, LST is found to be the dominant factor that controls the temporal changes in both SFD and ALT while precipitation (i.e., both rainfall and snowfall) plays an important (especially in more arid areas and regions near the lower limit of permafrost) but secondary role. Our results demonstrate the advantages of the satellite-based method in frozen soil simulations over large scales with complex topography and landscape and highlight the important roles of both temperature and precipitation in shaping the frozen soil patterns on the TP or other cold, dry regions.

TI  - An observation-driven optimization method for continuous estimation of evaporative fraction over large heterogeneous areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-based evaporative fraction (EF) observations have been used widely for validation purposes in previous remote sensing-based EF models. Few studies have investigated whether such measurements can be utilized for calibration use. In this paper, an observation-driven optimization method is proposed to quantify EF over a large heterogeneous area within the surface temperature-vegetation index framework. It is designed at both daily scale and seasonal scale with MODIS products and in-situ EF observations over the Southern Great Plains in the US. The goal is to search for the optimal dry edge within the allowable range that minimizes the difference between the estimated and observed EF of a given site. Results show that the accuracy produced using only one site for calibration has reached a level comparable to those produced by traditional triangle methods. Compared with the daily-scale optimization method, the seasonal-scale optimization method has not only demonstrated its superiority in accuracy but also held distinctive advantages over the traditional triangle methods. Specifically, the dry edge produced by our optimization method holds true under both clear sky and partially cloudy conditions. This has not only bypassed the repetitive work of previous triangle methods but also made it possible to conduct a continuous monitoring of EF. Besides, the optimization method is characterized by its simplicity in algorithm, stability in accuracy and extensibility in parameterization, which makes it a suitable tool for providing a quick and reasonable estimation of EF over large heterogeneous areas from a limited number of in-situ EF observations.

TI  - Muslim reformist scholars' arguments for democracy independent of religious justification
T2  - CRITICAL RESEARCH ON RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the ideas of three contemporary Muslim reformists, namely Abdolkarim Soroush, Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd, and Muhammad Mujtahed Shabestari, concerning the relationship between democracy and the Islamic principle ofshura(consultation). The article aims to demonstrate how the theological-philosophical approaches of these scholars-particularly with respect to their methods of interpreting the QurMODIFIER LETTER RIGHT HALF RINGan and the distinctions they draw between the pre-modern and modern worldview-have contributed to the rise of a political discourse which seeks to understand concepts such asshuraand democracy within their own specific epistemological and cultural contexts. This political discourse, as the article argues, supports democracy without any narrow religious justification and promotes a form of government whose legitimacy is not based on religious sources or authority, and thus is neutral towards different religions and their followers.

TI  - High-frequency and tidal period observations of suspended particulate matter in coastal waters by AHI/Himawari-8
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Driven by tidal forcing and terrestrial inputs, suspended particulate matter (SPM) in shallow coastal waters usually shows high-frequency dynamics. Although specific geostationary satellite ocean color sensors such as the geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) can observe SPM hourly eight times in a day from morning to afternoon, it cannot cover the whole semi-diurnal tidal period (similar to 12 h), and an hourly frequency may be insufficient to witness rapid changes in SPM in highly dynamic coastal waters. In this study, taking the Yangtze River Estuary as an example, we examined the ability of the geostationary meteorological satellite sensor AHI/Himawari-8 to monitor tidal period SPM dynamics with 10-min frequency. Results showed that the normalized water-leaving radiance (Lwn) retrieved by the AHI was consistent with the in-situ data from both cruise- and tower-based measurements. Specifically, AHI-retrieved Lwn was consistent with the in-situ cruise values, with mean relative errors (MREs) of 19.58%, 16.43%, 18.74%, and 26.64% for the 460, 510, 640, and 860 nm bands, respectively, and determination coefficients (R-2) larger than 0.89. Both AHI-retrieved and tower-measured Lwn also showed good agreement, with R-2 values larger than 0.75 and MERs of 14.38%, 12.42%, 18.16%, and 18.89% for 460, 510, 640, and 860 nm, respectively. Moreover, AHI-retrieved Lwn values were consistent with the GOCI hourly results in both magnitude and spatial distribution patterns, indicating that the AHI can monitor ocean color in coastal waters, despite not being a dedicated ocean color sensor. Compared to the 8 h of SPM observations by the GOCI, the AHI was able to monitor SPM dynamics for up to 12 h from early morning to late afternoon covering the whole semi-diurnal tidal period. In addition, the high-frequency 10-min monitoring by the AHI revealed the minute-level dynamics of SPM in the Yangtze River Estuary (with SPM variation amplitude found to double over 1 h), which were impossible to capture based on the hourly GOCI observations.

TI  - Interpretation of Geometric Elements of the Fahs Aquifer System, Northeast Tunisia: Joint Use of Vertical Electrical Sounding Data, Well Logs and Satellite Imagery
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the characterization of the Fahs aquifer system (northeastern Tunisia) was achieved using data from 13 water boreholes, 70 vertical electrical soundings (VES) and a Landsat TM image. Available lithological columns and their corresponding well logs were compared to define precisely the Quaternary water reservoirs. Qualitative and quantitative interpretations of VES data were carried out to reconstitute the geometry of these reservoirs. They were supported by satellite imagery processing, which allowed identification of superficial lineaments affecting the Fahs plain. The restitution of lithological columns using well logs revealed that the Quaternary series contains three lithological units: two clayey units separated by a gravel and sand unit encompassing some clayey intercalations that increase northward (toward the oued El Kebir downstream). Moreover, it was recognized that, in the southern part of the plain at 22-128 m depth, the substratum of the Quaternary series consists of Cretaceous marls and limestones. This zone, which exhibits high apparent resistivities (45-100 omega m) for different AB spacings, appears to be rich in reservoirs. The correlation between the restored lithological columns and the interpreted VES, in the form of geo-electrical cross sections, revealed variations in depth (8-50 m), thickness (14 to > 80 m) and resistivity (12-35 omega m) of the coarse unit corresponding to the Fahs aquifer. Seven discontinuities were discerned from these sections, whereas 16 superficial lineaments were determined from the Landsat image. Their joint superposition showed that five of them coincided perfectly; they may correspond to normal faults generating an aquifer system compartmentalized in raised and sunken blocks.

TI  - Monitoring responses of vegetation phenology and productivity to extreme climatic conditions using remote sensing across different sub-regions of China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a major natural disaster that significantly impacts the susceptibility and flexibility of the ecosystem by changing vegetation phenology and productivity. This study aimed to investigate the impact of extreme climatic variation on vegetation phenology and productivity over the four sub-regions of China from 2000 to 2017. Daily rain gauge precipitation and air temperature datasets were used to estimate the trends, and to compute the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Remote sensing-based Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data from a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) was used to characterize vegetation phenology. The results revealed that (1) air temperature had significant increasing trends (P< 0.05) in all sub-regions. Precipitation showed a non-significant increasing trend in Northwest China (NWC) and insignificant decreasing trends in North China (NC), Qinghai Tibet area (QTA), and South China (SC). (2) Integrated enhanced vegetation index (iEVI) and SPEI variations depicted that 2011 and 2016 were the extremely driest and wettest years during 2000-2017. (3) Rapid changes were observed in the vegetation phenology and productivity between 2011 and 2016. In 2011, changes in the vegetation phenology with the length of the growing season (Delta LGS) = was - 14 +/- 36 days. In 2016, the overall net effect changed at the onset and end of the growing season with Delta LGS of 34 +/- 71 days. The change in iEVI per SPEI increased rapidly with a changing rate of 0.16 from arid (NWC, and QTA) to semi-arid (NWC, QTA and NC) and declined with a rate of - 0.04 from semi-humid (QTA, NC, and SC) to humid (SC) region. A higher association was observed between iEVI and SPEI as compared to iEVI and precipitation. Our finding exposed that north China is more sensitive to climatic variation.

TI  - Integrating spectral and non-spectral data to improve urban settlement mapping in a large Latin-American city
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on urban settlements is crucial for sustainability planning and management. While remote sensing has been used to derive such information, its applicability can be compromised due to the complexity in the urban environment. In this study, we developed a remote sensing method to map land cover types in a large Latin-American city, which is well known for its mushrooming unplanned and informal settlements. After carefully considering the landscape complexity there, we designed a data fusion method combining multispectral imagery and non-spectral data for urban and land mapping. Specifically, we acquired a cloud-free Landsat-8 image and two non-spectral datasets, i.e., digital elevation models and road networks. Then, we implemented a set of experiments with different inputs to evaluate their merits in thematic mapping through a supervised protocol. We found that the map generated with the multispectral data alone had an overall accuracy of 73.3% but combining multispectral imagery and non-spectral data yielded a land cover map with 90.7% overall accuracy. Interestingly, the thermal infrared information helped substantially improve both the overall and categorical accuracies, particularly for the two urban classes. The two types of non-spectral data were critical in resolving several spectrally confused categories, thus considerably increasing the mapping accuracy. However, the panchromatic band with higher spatial resolution and its derived textural measurement only generated a marginal accuracy improvement. The novelties of our work are with the successful separation between the two major types of urban settlements in a complex environment using a carefully designed data fusion approach and the insight into the relative merits of the thermal infrared information and non-spectral data in helping resolve the issue of class ambiguity. These findings should be valuable in deriving accurate urban settlement information which can further advance the research on socio-ecological dynamics and urban sustainability.

TI  - UsingInSARto identify hydrological connectivity and barriers in a highly fragmented wetland
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological connectivity is a critical determinant of wetland functions and health, especially in wetlands that have been heavily fragmented and regulated by human activities. However, investigating hydrological connectivity in these wetlands is challenging due to the costs of high-resolution and large-scale monitoring required in order to identify hydrological barriers within the wetlands. To overcome this challenge, we here propose an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)-based methodology to map hydrologic connectivity and identify hydrological barriers in fragmented wetlands. This methodology was applied along 70 transects across the Baiyangdian, the largest freshwater wetland in northern China, using Sentinel 1A and 1B data, covering the period 2016-2019. We generated 58 interferograms providing information on relative water level changes across the transects that showed the high coherence needed for the assessment of hydrological connectivity. We mapped the permanent and conditional (temporary) barriers affecting connectivity. In total, 11% of all transects are permanently disconnected by hydrological barriers across all interferograms and 58% of the transects are conditionally disconnected. Areas covered by reed grasslands show the most undisturbed hydrological connectivity while some of these barriers are the result of ditches and channels within the wetland and low water levels during different periods of the year. This study highlights the potential of the application of Wetland InSAR to determine hydrological connectivity and location of hydrological barriers in highly fragmented wetlands, and facilitates the study of hydrological processes from large spatial scales and long-time scales using remote sensing technique.

T2  - MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The earthworm (Drawida gisti) is an ecologically important sentinel species for soils that is widely distributed throughout Eastern Asia; however, the molecular tools required for genetic diversity studies of this earthworm are still rare. The aim of the study was to develop and characterize microsatellite markers inD. gistiand to evaluate their transferability to otherDrawidaspecies. We employed a RAD-seq approach to develop 12 microsatellite markers forD. gisti. The characterization and analysis of loci was achieved using 24 individuals ofD. gistifrom a natural population. The number of alleles per locus ranged from four to eleven, with an average of 6.5. Observed and expected heterozygosities varied from 0.708 to 0.958, and from 0.568 to 0.883, respectively. No loci presented significant deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, while linkage disequilibrium was detected between three loci. Cross-species amplification tests suggested that the transferability of ten loci was positive for the two congenersD. japonicaandD. ghilarovi. This set of microsatellite markers may be used to evaluate the genetic diversity and population structures ofD. gistiand related species in the future.

T2  - BMC MEDICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Current sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) techniques, including use of radioisotopes, have disadvantages including the use of a radioactive tracer. Indocyanine green (ICG) based near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and cone beam CT (CBCT) have advantages for intraoperative use. However, limited literature exists regarding their use in head and neck cancer SLNB. Methods This was a prospective, non-randomized study using a rabbit oral cavity VX2 squamous cell carcinoma model (n = 10) which develops lymph node metastasis. Pre-operatively, images were acquired by MicroCT. During surgery, CBCT and NIR fluorescence imaging of ICG was used to map and guide the SLNB resection. Results Intraoperative use of ICG to guide fluorescence resection resulted in identification of all lymph nodes identified by pre-operative CT. CBCT was useful for near real time intraoperative imaging and 3D reconstruction. Conclusions This pre-clinical study further demonstrates the technical feasibility, limitations and advantages of intraoperative NIR-guided ICG imaging for SLN identification as a complementary method during head and neck surgery.

AB  - We present a case detailing a 70-year-old female with a history of triple-negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) of the left breast and contralateral stage pT2a nodular melanoma of the right upper arm who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy of the right axilla demonstrating a metastatic epithelioid tumor that was strongly positive for S-100 protein and SOX10. The tumor cells were negative for HMB-45 and Melan-A and positive for CK7 and other breast markers (GCDFP15, mammaglobin, and GATA3). While concerning for metastatic melanoma based on clinical history and initial immunohistochemistry, tumor morphology and subsequent immunohistochemistry was supportive of metastatic breast adenocarcinoma. This case demonstrates a rare but perilous diagnostic pitfall of triple-negative breast carcinomas that strongly and diffusely express S-100 protein and SOX10 mimicking melanoma.

TI  - The innate immune response in Zika virus infection
T2  - REVIEWS IN MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV;Flaviviridae,Flavivirus) was discovered in 1947 in Uganda, Africa, from the serum of a sentinel Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). It is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, which encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved into 10 individual proteins. In 2015, the Zika-epidemic in Brazil was marked mainly by the exponential growth of microcephaly cases and other congenital defects. With regard to host-pathogen relationships, understanding the role of the immune response in the pathogenesis ZIKV infection is challenging. The innate immune response is the first-line immunological defence, in which pathogen-associated molecular patterns are recognized by pattern-recognition receptors that trigger macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells and endothelial cells to produce several mediators, which modulate viral replication and immune evasion. In this review, we have summarized current knowledge on the innate immune response against ZIKV.

TI  - Mapping the forest disturbance regimes of Europe
T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in forest disturbance affect their sustainability. This study finds that between 1986 and 2016, 36 million disturbances by humans or other causes affected 17% of Europe's forest area.Changes in forest disturbances can have strong impacts on forests, yet we lack consistent data on Europe's forest disturbance regimes and their changes over time. Here we used satellite data to map three decades of forest disturbances across continental Europe, and analysed the patterns and trends in disturbance size, frequency and severity. Between 1986 and 2016, 17% of Europe's forest area was disturbed by anthropogenic and/or natural causes. We identified 36 million individual disturbance patches with a mean patch size of 1.09 ha, which equals an annual average of 0.52 disturbance patches per km(2)of forest area. The majority of disturbances were stand replacing. While trends in disturbance size were highly variable, disturbance frequency consistently increased and disturbance severity decreased. Here we present a continental-scale characterization of Europe's forest disturbance regimes and their changes over time, providing spatial information that is critical for understanding the ongoing changes in Europe's forests.

TI  - Psychosis as a dialectic of aha- and anti-aha-experiences: a qualitative study
T2  - PSYCHOSIS-PSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIAL AND INTEGRATIVE APPROACHES
M3  - Article
AB  - Experiences of sudden and abrupt insight, sometimes termed aha-experiences, are often reported during psychosis. The aha-experience is described as a radical and sudden restructuring, realization or change in understanding. Based on personal experience, we argued that alongside this aha-experience exists theanti-aha-experience. The anti-aha-experience refers to an experience of sudden insight that does not fit within one's framework, convictions or worldview and has an undermining effect. We have conceptualized psychosis as a dialectic of aha- and anti-aha-experiences and argue that a dialectic tension between aha- and anti-aha experiences undermines a stable personal perspective. In this study, we set out to investigate whether individuals with lived experience of psychosis do indeed report forms of sudden insight, and particularly if they report aha- and anti-aha-experiences, and the dialectic between them. We therefore conducted 21 in-depth interviews and 6 focus groups with individuals with lived experience of psychosis and analyzed the transcripts using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The findings show that these phenomena are indeed often reported and could play a significant role in psychosis. Integrating these phenomena into our understanding of psychosis could help to better grasp the lived experience of individual patients and additionally inform other forms of research on psychosis.

TI  - Quantifying highly dynamic urban landscapes: Integrating object-based image analysis with Landsat time series data
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Urban landscapes are highly dynamic with changes frequently occurring at short time intervals. Although the Landsat data archive allows the use of high-density time-series data to quantify such dynamics, the approaches that can fully address the spatial and temporal complexity of the urban landscape are still lacking. Objectives A new approach is presented for accurately quantifying urban landscape dynamics. Information regarding when and where a change occurs, what type of change exists, and how often it happens are incorporated. Methods The new approach integrates object-based image analysis and time-series change detection techniques by using all available Landsat images for several decades. This approach was tested on the rapidly urbanizing city of Shenzhen, China from 1986 to 2017. Results Land cover changes in both long- and short-time intervals can be proficiently detected with an overall accuracy of 90.65% and a user's accuracy of 92.18% and 82.40% for "No change" and "Change", respectively. The frequency and time of change can be explicitly displayed while incorporating the advantages of object-based image analysis and time-series change detection. The efficiency of the change analysis can be greatly increased because the object-based analysis greatly reduces the number of analyzed units. Conclusion The new approach can accurately and efficiently detect the land cover change for quantifying urban landscape dynamics. Integrating the object and the remotely sensed time-series data has the potential to link the physical and socio-economic properties together for facilitating sustainable landscape planning.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - During breast cancer staging, histological evaluation of axillary sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) is usually straightforward. However, the exact characterization of a small epithelial deposit in an SLN can be challenging, especially during the frozen section examination. We report the first case of endosalpingiosis involving bilateral axillary lymph nodes. We review published literature on axillary endosalpingiosis and discuss the differential diagnosis of small epithelial deposits in an axillary SLN. Pathologists should consider benign epithelial rests and displaced epithelium as differential diagnoses for the microscopic epithelial nodal deposit, especially during the frozen section examination.

TI  - Glacial lake inventory of high-mountain Asia in 1990 and 2018 derived from Landsat images
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - There is currently no glacial lake inventory data set for the entire high-mountain Asia (HMA) area. The definition and classification of glacial lakes remain controversial, presenting certain obstacles to extensive utilization of glacial lake inventory data. This study integrated glacier inventory data and 668 Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI images and adopted manual visual interpretation to extract glacial lake boundaries within a 10 km buffer from glacier extent using ArcGIS and ENVI software, normalized difference water index maps, and Google Earth images. The theoretical and methodological basis for all processing steps including glacial lake definition and classification, lake boundary delineation, and uncertainty assessment is discussed comprehensively in the paper. Moreover, detailed information regarding the coding, location, perimeter and area, area error, type, time phase, source image information, and subregions of the located lakes is presented. It was established that 27 205 and 30 121 glacial lakes (size 0.0054-6.46 km(2)) in HMA covered a combined area of 1806:47 +/- 2:11 and 2080:12 +/- 2:28 km(2) in 1990 and 2018, respectively. The data set is now available from the National Special Environment and Function of Observation and Research Stations Shared Service Platform (China): https://doi.org/10.12072/casnw.064.2019.db (Wang et al., 2019a).

TI  - Soil Moisture Assessment Based on Multi-Source Remotely Sensed Data in the Huaihe River Basin, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The reliable estimation of soil moisture on spatial and temporal scales is of fundamental importance in improving the impact assessment of drought and flood on plant productivity and enhancing our understanding of the link between the water and biogeochemical cycles. Currently, remotely sensed data can offer a chance to improve spatial variability, especially in environments with scarce ground-based data. To obtain soil moisture information with high resolution and high precision in such mountainous areas as the Huaihe River Basin, we combined the advantages of MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) optical remote sensing sensor that has high spatial resolution and sensitive characteristics to surface covering type and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) passive microwave sensor that has high temporal resolution and the characteristics of small interference by clouds. Five years of AMSR-E and MODIS data (2006-2010) were fused based on the wavelet transform (WT) method. The soil moisture in the Huaihe River Basin was extracted using these fused remotely sensed data. The results showed that the soil moisture from AMSR-E and MODIS fusion data could capture soil moisture dynamics well. The accuracies of soil moisture from AMSR-E and MODIS fusion data based on WT were better than those from single remote sensing data. The soil moisture from MODIS and AMSR-E fusion data was more sensitive to the season, especially in spring, summer, and autumn. The accuracy of soil moisture from MODIS and AMSR-E fusion data in time and space varied in the Huaihe Basin. From the time series, high accuracies of soil moisture were observed in the spring of 2009 and in the spring and winter of 2010. From the spatial series, high accuracies of soil moisture were found in Zhumadian and Bozhou stations, and the worst accuracies were observed in Huaiyin and Shangqiu stations, which were primarily related to some factors such as local topography, vegetation coverage, and precipitation. These findings will provide interesting insights that can be useful for developing measures to prevent drought and flood disasters on a regional scale in China.

TI  - Integrated response of the toxicity of environmentally relevant concentrations of copper in the backwater clam<i>Meretrix casta</i>
T2  - CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Copper is released into the aquatic environment as a consequence of anthropogenic activities such as mining and runoffs of copper-containing pesticides and fertilisers. This may pose a threat to the health of the organisms inhabiting coastal water bodies or estuaries. The present study was therefore carried out to assess the toxicity of environmentally relevant concentrations of copper in the estuarine backwater clamMeretrix casta. In the experimental setup, clams were exposed to five concentrations of CuCl2(0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 mu g/L) for 15 days in water. Biomarkers of genotoxicity (Micronucleus test and comet assay), oxidative stress (Catalase and malondialdehyde assays), acetylcholinesterase activity and condition index were employed to study the effects of copper on the clams. Genotoxicity, oxidative stress, acetylcholinesterase activity and condition index were found to be non-significant in all the concentration groups indicating that such low concentrations of copper were unable to induce any toxic response. However, using the Integrated Biomarker Response index, a concentration-dependent increase was observed indicating that the integration of these biomarker responses could give information on early signs of copper contamination in aquatic habitats.Meretrix castacould potentially be used as a sentinel species for monitoring copper contamination in the estuarine environment.

TI  - Prominent vegetation greening and its correlation with climatic variables in northern China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global vegetation has been reported to be turning greener, especially in China and India. The Yellow River Basin is one of the most prominent greening areas in China. While some studies have attributed vegetation greening to large-scale ecological restoration efforts, our study focuses on the role of climate change in vegetation greening. We selected a time series of annual vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) and vegetation coverage from satellite data to quantify the vegetation greening trend. Annual temperature and precipitation were selected to examine the climate trend from 2000 to 2019. The results showed that the Yellow River Basin experienced a rapid increase in temperature and precipitation during this period. Annual temperature increased with an average speed of 0.905 degrees C per decade, approximately 4.5 times larger than that of global warming. Annual precipitation increased by 82.8%, with an average speed of 9.17 mm per year. There was widespread vegetation greening in the Yellow River Basin during 2000-2019. This was demonstrated by an increase in vegetation NPP and vegetation coverage in the Yellow River Basin. The increase of annual NPP and coverage from 2000 to 1019 was 26.6% and 30.8%, respectively. Even while considering the effects of conservation and restoration efforts, the rapid increases in temperature and precipitation allowed vegetation to flourish, as evidenced by significant positive correlations between climate variables and vegetation variables. Therefore, climate change played an important positive role in vegetation greening, rather than an undesirable disturbance.

TI  - Resolving Biases in DEM Differencing for Estimation of Change in Elevation of Glacier Surfaces Using Cartosat-I Stereo Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the impact of climatic variations on Himalayan-Karakoram glaciers has now become a necessity for planning water resources of Indus-Ganga-Brahmaputra basins. One of the most important parameters to assess this is the mass balance of glaciers. Besides ground-based studies of mass balance, differencing of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) is now commonly employed for estimating the long-term changes for this purpose. Before applying this approach, it is necessary to evaluate the accuracy of elevation changes of glacier surfaces with respect to terrain parameters and the DEMs used. This study demonstrates the factors governing DEM differencing using an example of four glaciers of Zanskar region by comparing DEMs extracted from Cartosat-1 stereo data of ablation season of the years 2005 and 2015. A strong relation has been observed between slope of the terrain and elevation changes between the two DEMs on non-glaciated stable terrain (R-2 = 0.8144). The regression equation thus developed has been used to correct elevation changes on glacier surface. Lowering of ablation zone of the four sample glaciers over a period of ten years has been of the order of 3.92, 11.17, 4.99 and 4.39 m. The results obtained by using Cartosat-I DEMs have also been validated using ASTER DEMs of similar time interval.

TI  - Assessing trends and predicting the cover management factor in a tropical island state using Enhanced Vegetation Index
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a complex process involving multiple factors that contribute to the amount of soil loss. The amount of vegetation cover is one of the main factors used to estimate soil loss and is an important risk factor in informing land use management and soil conservation policies. Cover/crop management (C-factor) is a dynamic soil loss factor and analysing C-factor trends in the context of both space and time, to build a multi-dimensional data structure, increased the value of the trend analysis. The objectives of the study were to (1) utilise EVI dependent static and dynamic predictive equations to compute the C-factor, and (2) to investigate the spatio-temporal changes of the C-factor and hotspots in a tropical small island developing state (SIDS) from 2010 to 2019. ArcGIS Model Builder was utilised to automate the computation of the C-factor using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data and compute the ordinary least square regression. Spatio-temporal analysis was performed using the novel emerging hot spot analysis in ArcGIS to identify statistically significant hot and cold spot trends of cover management to locate new, intensifying, persistent, or sporadic hot spot patterns at different time-step intervals. The regression output for the C-factor and EVI values indicated a strong r(2), explaining on average 90% of the models. There was no statistically significant (P value>0.05) increase in C-factor trend over a 10 year period (2010-2019, P-value=0.92), a 5 year period (2015-2019; P-value=0.59), or a 3 year period (2017-2019; P-Value=0.31). Our results showed that intensifying hot spots (27%) were concentrated along the north-south corridor of the study area, highlighting areas with a statistically significant increase of the C-factor, thus a reduction in vegetation cover over the study period. Integrating spatio-temporal data and spatial technology provided vital cover management estimates for soil practitioners and farmers to guide conservation strategies.

TI  - Landscape transformation of an urban wetland in Kashmir Himalaya, India using high-resolution remote sensing data, geospatial modeling, and ground observations over the last 5 decades (1965-2018)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are among the most vulnerable and dynamic ecosystems of the world. Any change in the anthropogenic footprint or climate affects the health of these pristine ecologically and socioeconomically important ecosystems. In the present study, land use land cover changes (LULCC) and fragmentation of natural landscape changes in an urban wetland, Khushalsar, located in the heart of the Srinagar City, were assessed using high-resolution satellite data, geospatial modeling approach, and ground observations over the last similar to 5 decades (1965 and 2018). The spatiotemporal changes in LULC of the wetland were assessed for 3 time periods that include 1965-1980, 1980-2018, and 1965-2018. Additionally, landscape fragmentation tool (LFT) was used to quantify fragmentation of land cover. The analysis of LULCC indicated that built-up areas in the vicinity of the wetland increased by 510% between 1965 and 2018. The aquatic vegetation and marshy lands increased by 150% and 33% respectively. The area under agriculture, plantation, open water, and barren lands decreased mostly taken over by built-up areas. Within the wetland, the area under open water spread reduced by 75% while the aquatic vegetation increased by 150% from 1965 to 2018. The built-up areas including roads also showed a substantial increase. The LFT analysis revealed four categories of landscapes i.e., patch, edge, perforated, and core areas. Since the natural land cover types were taken over by land use predominantly built-up areas, the core natural areas and perforated landscapes in the Khushalsar shrunk by 34% and 94% respectively indicating fragmentation of natural environment. The lack of sewage treatment facility, reckless unplanned urbanization within and in the vicinity of the wetland, is responsible for the degradation of the Khushalsar wetland.

T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study applies a combination of geochemical, mineralogical, and WorldView-2 (WV-2) data for gold prospecting in the Siyah Jangal area, southeastern Iran. Geochemical and mineralogical studies, image processing, and field studies were used to identify areas of high-potential gold mineralization. Elemental concentrations in samples collected from exploration trenches in a well-known gold mineralization area were applied to identify Au pathfinders using bivariate and multivariate statistics. Visible-near infrared-shortwave infrared spectroscopy was applied to identify mineral phases. Correlation analysis, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis of measured element concentrations showed that Au has strong associations with As, Pb, Fe, and Cu, among which, Fe is the only element that forms major minerals in the area. The spectroscopy analyses showed that iron oxide-hydroxide bearing minerals including jarosite, hematite, and goethite are the major Fe-bearing phases in the surficial environment. Therefore, mineral fraction images of these minerals were produced by performing matched filtering method on WV-2 data, and the fractions of more than 0.25 of goethite, 0.15 of hematite, and 0.10 of jarosite were combined and converted as map layers to generate a false color composite (RGB) image for targeting potential areas of gold mineralization. The accuracy of iron oxide-hydroxides mapping was proven by field observations and XRD analyses of surficial samples. Moreover, concentrations of Au in samples collected from exploration boreholes in previously mapped areas showed good correlations between enhanced areas by remote sensing studies and gold occurrences.

TI  - MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth Inversion Over Urban Areas Supported by BRDF/Albedo Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols play an important role in climate change and environmental pollution, and monitoring of aerosols via remote sensing is of great significance. However, for urban areas that are closely related to people's lives, remote sensing monitoring of aerosol optical depth (AOD) faces major challenges. These surface types, with bidirectional reflection characteristics, have a high surface reflectivity that is not sensitive to aerosol changes. Therefore, surface reflectivity must be calculated with high precision, which can be difficult using existing methods. To overcome these problems, this paper provides a MODIS AOD inversion method for complex background conditions that is supported by BRDF/Albedo products. Using these products, the accuracy of surface reflectivity and the resulting inversion results of aerosols are improved. Three typical complex background areas (Beijing, Baltimore and Paris) were selected for application testing. AOD inversion was calculated using MODIS BRDF/Albedo data for 6 years from 2012 to 2017. Accuracy was verified using the AERONET ground-based observations in the corresponding areas, and results were compared with the existing MODIS aerosol product (MOD04 AOD). Inversion estimates using this method have a higher correlation with AERONET AOD (R = 0.948). The root mean square error is 0.107, and 70.08% of the points are less than the expected error. When compared with MOD04 AOD products in urban areas, the inversion results of the new algorithm have higher precision and stability.

AB  - Earth observation (EO) data are increasingly being used to monitor vegetation and detect plant growth anomalies due to water stress, drought, or pests, as well as to monitor water availability, weather conditions, disaster risks, land use/land cover changes and to evaluate soil degradation. Satellite data are provided regularly by worldwide organizations, covering a wide variety of spatial, temporal and spectral characteristics. In addition, weather, climate and crop growth models provide early estimates of the expected weather and climatic patterns and yield, which can be improved by fusion with EO data. The AfriCultuReS project is capitalizing on the above to contribute towards an integrated agricultural monitoring and early warning system for Africa, supporting decision-making in the field of food security. The aim of this article is to present the design of EO services within the project, and how they will support food security in Africa. The services designed cover the users' requirements related to climate, drought, land, livestock, crops, water, and weather. For each category of services, results from one case study are presented. The services will be distributed to the stakeholders and are expected to provide a continuous monitoring framework for early and accurate assessment of factors affecting food security in Africa.

TI  - Satellite Retrieved Spatio-temporal Variability of Phytoplankton Size Classes in the Arabian Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term trend in satellite retrieved phytoplankton size classes (PSC) such as picophytoplankton (PP), nanophytoplankton (NP), and microphytoplankton (MP) was studied in the three zones falling under different ecological provinces in open ocean regions of the Arabian Sea. A regionally tuned three-component "abundance" model was used to compute PSC biomass from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard Aqua (MODISA) satellite data for the period of 17 years (2003 to 2019). The overall trend indicated the highest concentration of all PSC in the northern Arabian Sea (ARAB province) which gradually decreased to the southern region (MONS province). All PSC biomass showed a peak during the winter monsoon period in ARAB province attributed to the recurring algal bloom. The long-term temporal trend showed relatively lower concentration (most of the times < 0.1 mg m(-3)) of all PSC biomass in MONS in comparison with ARAB. However, the monthly climatology of total phytoplankton biomass exhibited a similar pattern in all the provinces. The temporal distribution of the PSC biomass discerned rank order of MP > PP > NP in ARAB. In contrast, MONS displayed PSC rank order as PP > NP > MP. A sharp decline in the concentration of MP biomass was observed during the onset of summer monsoon period in comparison with other PSC in MONS.

TI  - Using forestry inventories and satellite imagery to assess floristic variation in bamboo-dominated forests in Peruvian Amazonia
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions Does the floristic composition of trees differ between bamboo forests and adjacent non-bamboo forests? Can the degree of compositional differences be predicted from differences in canopy reflectance as measured by Landsat satellites? Are the results sensitive to different taxonomical data cleaning strategies, or to which tree-size class is considered? Are some tree taxa associated with either bamboo or non-bamboo forests? Location Peruvian Amazonia. Methods We used national forestry inventory data to characterise floristic composition of trees at 25 sites. Bamboo and non-bamboo forests were identified with a pixel-based time series analysis using the entire Landsat TM/ETM+ archive. To visualise floristic similarity among the plots, we used non-metric multidimensional scaling. Floristic differences between bamboo and non-bamboo forests were tested using an analysis of similarity (ANOSIM). Mantel tests were used to assess correlation between floristic turnover and differences in canopy reflectance. We tested the impact of applying three different taxonomic data cleaning strategies and of analysing different tree-size classes. Finally, we ran an indicator species analysis to identify taxa that were associated with either bamboo or non-bamboo forests. Results In floristic ordinations, bamboo-dominated forests appeared floristically distinct from non-bamboo forests regardless of the taxonomic cleaning strategy and tree-size class. This floristic separation was also confirmed through analysis of floristic similarity (ANOSIM). Turnover in floristic composition was strongly correlated with differences in the reflectance values of Landsat bands, especially when using genus-level rather than species-level data. Different palm taxa were associated with bamboo (Socratea) and non-bamboo forests (Iriartea). Conclusions Floristic differences of trees between bamboo-dominated and non-bamboo forests are consistent enough to be observable with different tree-size classes and taxonomic cleaning strategies. Although coarsening the taxonomic resolution to the genus level may hide ecological detail from the results, the fact that it allows keeping incompletely identified stems in the analyses seems to compensate for this.

TI  - Towards a revised framework of modified time series InSAR for mapping land deformation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series technique has been widely applied to map the ground deformation over the past two decades. One of the key steps of InSAR time series approach is to select appropriate measurement scatterer (MS) pixels to build the triangulated irregular network (TIN). In order to build a stable TIN, there are four criteria need to be satisfied: (1) working from whole to the part, (2) hierarchical network, step-by-step control, (3) with sufficient accuracy, and (4) with appropriate spatial density. The effectiveness of Geodesy and Earth Observing Systems-PSI (GEOS-PSI) and GEOS-Advance Time Series Analysis (GEOS-ATSA) approaches have met the first three criteria above. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that higher sparseness of the TIN may lead to unwrapping failures, while having more evenly distributed of MS offers a higher chance to eliminate such effect and include more additional pixels during the adaptive processing. In this work, we proposed a revised MS pixels selection approach to satisfy the fourth criterion, in combination with the GEOS-PSI and GEOS-ATSA processing chain: the modified GEOS-ATSA (GEOS-MATSA). As compared to the conventional MS pixels selection criterion, the proposed approach has three advantages: (1) the MS pixels are added into the main network with control through an adaptive estimation strategy, (2) isolated sub-networks have better chances of including into the main network, and (3) the computing workload can be decreased by reducing the iteration times. The case study area is selected in Beijing-Langfang region, while the ideal threshold settings for the initial reference network are discussed for both persistent scatterer and distributed scatterer pixels in this work.

TI  - Contrast-enhanced ultrasound for sentinel lymph node mapping in the routine staging of canine mast cell tumours: A feasibility study
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Canine mast cell tumours (MCTs) typically spread to lymph nodes (LNs) before reaching distant sites, and LN assessment is an important part of MCT staging. Sentinel LN (SLN) mapping techniques to identify draining LNs are being developed and could improve the accuracy of MCT staging. The primary objective of this feasibility study was to determine the safety and effectiveness of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to identify SLNs. Secondary objectives were to determine if the SLNs identified by CEUS coincided with the regional LN predicted by the anatomical lymphosomes, if previous MCT excision altered CEUS SLN findings, and if CEUS could identify MCT nodal metastases. Between June 2017 and March 2019, 59 dogs with 62 MCTs were enrolled. No adverse events related to CEUS were reported. CEUS detected at least 1 SLN in 59/62 MCTs (95.2%, 95% CI: 86.5-99.0%). In only 32/59 (54.2%) MCTs, clinicians would have correctly predicted the SLN(s) identified by CEUS. Among the 35 MCTs that had histological examination of the SLN(s), the prevalence of metastasis was 60% (95% CI: 42.1-76.1%). Additional staging procedures did not reveal any metastases in dogs with histologically non-metastatic SLNs. Integration of CEUS SLN mapping into the routine staging of MCTs is promising, but future studies are required to refine this procedure and to investigate if it would translate into a clinical benefit.

TI  - Opinions of 12 to 13-year-olds in Austria and Australia on the concern, cause and imminence of climate change
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Review
AB  - Early adolescence (12-13 years old) is a critical but under-researched demographic for the formation of attitudes related to climate change. We address this important area by exploring adolescent views about climate change. This paper presents opinions collected from surveys of 463 1st-year secondary school students (12-13 years old) in public secondary schools in inner-urban centres in Austria and Australia on whether climate change is (1) something about which to worry, (2) caused by humans and (3) happening now. Eligible respondents in both countries showed similar levels of agreement that climate change was probably or definitely something we should (1) worry about (84.6% Austria, 89.1% Australia), which is significantly higher than either country's adult population. Eligible respondents agreed that climate change probably or definitely is (2) caused by humans (75.6% Austria, 83.6% Australia) and that climate change is probably or definitely something that is (3) happening now (73.1% Austria, 87.5% Australia). Their response differed from the respective adult populations, but in opposite directions. Our results suggest that socio-cultural worldview may not have as much influence on this age group as it does on the respective adult populations and suggests that this age group would be receptive and ready for climate science education and engagement initiatives.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In staging patients with clinical stage I-II melanoma, the sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the most important prognostic indicator; however, the false negative rate of SLN biopsy (SLNB) is 15%. Methods Nine patients with clinical Stage I-II melanoma underwent SLNB with repeated intraoperative radiotracer measurements to determine lymphatic transport efficiency (LTE), which was correlated with clinicopathologic data. Results LTE demonstrated the potential to predict SLN status. LTE in patients with occult nodal metastasis is 40 times faster than those with negative SLNBs. There was no confounding of LTE by clinicopathologic factors. Significance: LTE may be a novel biomarker for metastasis, with transformative potential for personalized precision diagnostics of early-stage disease and improved patient survival.

TI  - Reducing Negative Attitudes Toward Immigrants in Russia and Taiwan: Possible Beneficial Effects of Naive Dialecticism and an Incremental Worldview
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Greater mobility in human societies has resulted in more interactions and contact with immigrants. In the current research, we investigated how viewing the world as flexible, changing, and paradoxical (i.e., naive dialecticism and an incremental theory) may predict one's authoritarian beliefs and in turn predict one's attitudes toward immigrants. To test the generalizability of our findings, we recruit comparable samples (i.e., college students) from two societies that are largely different (Russia and Taiwan). Great cultural similarities were observed. Naive dialecticism and an incremental theory appeared as two distinctive constructs. People who were higher on naive dialecticism and an incremental over entity theory had lower support for authoritarian beliefs (i.e., right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation) and, in turn, had more favorable attitudes toward immigrants. Some cultural differences were also observed. Taiwanese participants' negative attitudes toward immigrants were entirely ideology-based, whereas Russian participants' negative attitudes toward immigrants were partly based on presumably personal experiences. Pan-cultural and culturally specific mechanisms in predicting attitudes toward immigrants were further discussed and explored.

TI  - Space-time variations of sea ice in Bohai Sea in the winter of 2009-2010 simulated with a coupled ocean and ice model
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sea ice variations in the severe winter of 2009-2010 in the Bohai Sea are simulated with a coupled ocean and ice model. The modelled ice coverage shows good agreement with satellite observations. Integrated over three sub-regions [the extended Liaodong Bay (LDB), Bohai Bay, and Laizhou Bay], the temporal variations of ice volume and surface air temperature are well correlated at time scales of 5-15 days and longer than 15 days. In LDB, at time scales of 5-15 days, the maximum ice volume lags the minimum surface air temperature by 42 h on average. In LDB, a significant amount of ice formed in the northern part is advected southward and then melts, and the trajectories of the positions of "ice centroids" further demonstrate the distinct trend of southward ice drift in this area. The impacts of winds are obvious during strong wind events. The results of multiple linear regression suggest that the hourly ice drift variations are mainly due to surface currents with significant tidal signals, and the daily ice drift variations can be mostly attributed to surface winds and secondly to surface ocean currents.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are among the extreme natural events which result in catastrophic damage to properties and adversely effects communities. To curb and manage the effects of such events, the decision-makers and disaster management authorities require dependable data in terms of flood depth, discharge, magnitude, and special datasets. The low lying areas of Navsari city was inundated in the floods of 2002 and 2003. This study aims to use the latest version of HEC-RAS for 1D hydrodynamic flood modelling of Purna river in Navasari city, Gujarat, India, with special reference to geospatial techniques. This study is aimed to demonstrate the geospatial analyzing capabilities of HEC-RAS v5. For the purpose of flood modeling, the river data such as bank lines, flow path lines, cross-section cut lines are extracted from Cartosat-1 DEM (Digital Elevation Model). Steady flow analysis is carried out for the simulation of a 1D hydrodynamic model. The outcome obtained from the model is in the form of water depth, which can be observed in the geospatial HEC-RAS mapper window. The flood depth maps for the 2002 and 2004 flood events are generated, which indicate that the low lying areas of Navsari city near Jalalpore and Viraval are susceptible to flooding when the discharge in the river exceeds 8836 m(3)/s. The accuracy of the model is calculated by comparing the simulated data with the observed data for the above-mentioned flood events. The results obtained from the 1D models are promising and accurate.

TI  - Evaluating post-wildfire logging-slash cover treatment to reduce hillslope erosion after salvage logging using ground measurements and remote sensing
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuing long and extensive wildfire seasons in the Western US emphasize the need for better understanding of wildfire impacts including post-fire management scenarios. Advancements in our understanding of post-fire hillslope erosion and watershed response such as flooding, sediment yield, and debris flows have recently received considerable attention. The potential impacts of removing dead trees, called salvage logging, has been studied, however the use of remotely sensed imagery after salvage logging to evaluate spatial patterns and recovery is novel. The 2015 North Star Fire provided an opportunity to evaluate hillslope erosion reduction using two field experiments and coincidental remotely sensed imagery over 3 years. Simulated rill experiments with four flow rates were used to quantify hillslope erosion on skidder trails with and without added logging slash compared with a burned-only control. Seven replicated hillslope silt fence plots with the same treatments were also evaluated for natural rainfall events. WorldView-2 satellite imagery was used to relate ground cover and erodible bare soil between the two experiments using multi-temporal Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) values. Results indicate that the skid trails produced significantly more sediment (0.70 g s(-1)) than either the slash treated skid trail (0.34 g s(-1)) or controls (0.04 g s(-1)) with the simulated rill experiment. Similarly, under natural rainfall conditions sediment yield from hillslope silt fence plots was significantly greater for the skid trail (3.42 Mg ha(-1)) than either the slash treated skid trail (0.18 Mg ha(-1)) or controls (0 Mg ha(-1)). An NDVI value of 0.32 on all plots over all years corresponded to a ground cover of about 60% which is an established threshold for erosion reduction. Significant relationships between NDVI, ground cover, and sediment values suggest that NDVI may help managers evaluate ground cover and erosion potential remotely after disturbances such as a wildfire or salvage logging.

TI  - Spatiotemporal behavior of a large-scale landslide at Mt. Onnebetsu-dake, Japan, detected by three L-band SAR satellites
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - We applied differential InSAR analysis to the Shiretoko Peninsula, northeastern Hokkaido, Japan. All the interferograms of long temporal baseline (similar to 3 years) processed from SAR data of three L-band satellites (JERS-1, ALOS, ALOS-2) commonly indicate remarkable phase changes due to the landslide movement at the southeastern flank of Mt. Onnebetsu-dake, a Quaternary stratovolcano. The area of interferometric phase change matches to known landslide morphologies. Judging from the timing of the SAR image acquisitions, this landslide has been moving at least from 1993 to the present. Successive interferograms of 1-year temporal baseline indicate the temporal fluctuation of the landslide velocity. Especially for the descending interferograms, the positive line-of-sight (LOS) length change, which indicates large subsidence relative to the horizontal movement, is observed in the upslope section of the landslide during 1993-1998, while the negative LOS change is observed in the middle and the downslope section after 2007 indicating less subsidence. The landslide activity culminates from 2014 to 2017: the eastward and the vertical displacement rates reach similar to 6 and similar to 2 cm/yr, respectively. Utilizing high spatial resolution of ALOS and ALOS-2 data, we investigated velocity distribution inside the landslide. During 2007-2010, the eastward component of surface displacement increases toward the east, implying that the landslide extends toward the east. During 2014-2017, the vertical displacement profile exhibits spatially periodic uplift and subsidence consistent with surface gradient, which indicates the ongoing deformation driven by gravitational force. Heavy rainfall associated with three typhoons in August 2016 might have brought about an increase in the landslide velocity, possibly due to elevated pore-fluid pressure within and/or at the base of the landslide material. Also, annual rainfall would be an important factor that prescribes the landslide velocity averaged over 3 years.

TI  - Predicting Survival Benefit of Sparing Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Low-Risk Elderly Patients With Early Breast Cancer: A Population-Based Analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective:The application of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in elderly patients with early breast cancer remains somewhat controversial. This study aimed to establish individualized nomograms to predict survival outcomes of elderly patients with and without SLNB and find out which patients could avoid SLNB. Methods:A total of 39,962 >= 70-year-old patients diagnosed with T1-T2 breast cancer in 2010-2015 were included from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and were divided into the training set (n= 29,971) and the validation set (n= 9,991). Axillary surgery was not specified in the SEER database, and we defined removing one to five lymph nodes as SLNB. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier plot and log-rank test. Multivariate Cox analysis was utilized to identify risk factors for overall survival (OS) and breast-cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Nomograms and a risk stratification model were constructed. Results:In the training set, patients with SLNB had better OS (adjusted HR 0.57,P< 0.001) and BCSS (adjusted HR 0.55,P< 0.001) than patients without SLNB. Multivariate COX analysis identified age, marital status, grade, subtype, T stage, and radiation as independent risk factors for OS and BCSS in both SLNB and non-SLNB groups (allP< 0.05). They were subsequently incorporated to establish nomograms to predict 3- and 5-year OS and BCSS for patients with or without SLNB. The concordance index ranged from 0.687 to 0.820, and calibration curves in the internal set and external set all demonstrated sufficient accuracies and good predictive capabilities. Further, we generated a risk stratification model which indicated that SLNB improved OS and BCSS in high-risk group (OS: HR 0.49,P< 0.001; BCSS: HR 0.54,P< 0.001), but not in the low-risk group (allP> 0.05). Conclusion:Well-validated nomograms and a risk stratification model were constructed to evaluate survival benefit from SLNB in elderly patients with early-stage breast cancer. SLNB was important for patients in the high-risk group but could be omitted in the low-risk group without sacrificing survival. This study could assist clinicians and elderly patients to weigh the risk-benefit of SLNB and make individualized decisions. We look forward to more powerful evidence from prospective trials.

TI  - Trends in eastern China agricultural fire emissions derived from a combination of geostationary (Himawari) and polar (VIIRS) orbiter fire radiative power products
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Open burning of agricultural crop residues is widespread across eastern China, and during certain post-harvest periods this activity is believed to significantly influence air quality. However, the exact contribution of crop residue burning to major air quality exceedances and air quality episodes has proven difficult to quantify. Whilst highly successful in many regions, in areas dominated by agricultural burning, MODIS-based (MODIS: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) fire emissions inventories such as the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) and Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) are suspected of significantly underestimating the magnitude of biomass burning emissions due to the typically very small, but highly numerous, fires involved that are quite easily missed by coarserspatial-resolution remote sensing observations. To address this issue, we use twice-daily fire radiative power (FRP) observations from the "small-fire-optimised" VIIRS-IM FRP product and combine them with fire diurnal cycle information taken from the geostationary Himawari-8 satellite. Using this we generate a unique high-spatio-temporal-resolution agricultural burning inventory for eastern China for the years 2012-2015, designed to fully take into account small fires well below the MODIS burned area or active fire detection limit, focusing on dry matter burned (DMB) and emissions of CO2, CO, PM2.5, and black carbon. We calculate DMB totals 100% to 400% higher than reported by the GFAS and GFED4.1s, and we quantify interesting spatial and temporal patterns previously un-noted. Wheat residue burning, primarily occurring in May-June, is responsible for more than half of the annual crop residue burning emissions of all species, whilst a secondary peak in autumn (September-October) is associated with rice and corn residue burning. We further identify a new winter (November-December) burning season, hypothesised to be caused by delays in burning driven by the stronger implementation of residue burning bans during the autumn post-harvest season. Whilst our emissions estimates are far higher than those of other satellite-based emissions inventories for the region, they are lower than estimates made using traditional "crop-yield-based approaches" (CY-BAs) by a factor of between 2 and 5. We believe that this is at least in part caused by outdated and overly high burning ratios being used in the CYBA, leading to the overestimation of DMB. Therefore, we conclude that satellite remote sensing approaches which adequately detect the presence of agricultural fires are a far better approach to agricultural fire emission estimation.

TI  - Extraction of Buildings in Urban Area for Surface Area Assessment from Satellite Imagery based on Morphological Building Index using SVM Classifier
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rooftops are essential features, extracted from satellite images for their significance in applications such as update of urban geodatabase, risk assessment and rescue map. In this work, a methodology (MBION-SVM) which integrates morphological, spectral, shape and geometrical features with SVM classifier to classify the objects within the satellite image into building rooftops and non-rooftops has been proposed. The probable buildings are detected using Morphological Building Index (MBI). The mislabeled rooftops are eliminated by combining Otsu thresholding and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Geometrical features computed from identified building rooftops are used to train a support vector machine (SVM), and self-correction is performed for removing any mislabeled rooftops and to provide the data on surface area of the perfect rooftops. Here, we have used Very High Resolution (VHR) images of Worldview-2 and Sentinal-2. We have analyzed the performance of the proposed building extraction approach with classification algorithms such as linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression and SVM. Since the proposed method gives an accuracy around 99%, precision of 89%, a perfect recall of 1 and a F-score of 88%, it can be effectively utilized to extract the buildings from VHR images for any appropriate application.

TI  - Gas flaring activity and black carbon emissions in 2017 derived from the Sentinel-3A Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Gas flares are a regionally and globally significant source of atmospheric pollutants. They can be detected by satellite remote sensing. We calculate the global flared gas volume and black carbon emissions in 2017 by applying (1) a previously developed hot spot detection and characterisation algorithm to all observations of the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instrument on board the Copernicus satellite Sentinel-3A and (2) newly developed filters for identifying gas flares and corrections for calculating both flared gas volumes (billion cubic metres, BCM) and black carbon (BC) emissions (g). The filter to discriminate gas flares from other hot spots uses the observed hot spot characteristics in terms of temperature and persistence. A regression function is used to correct for the variability of detection opportunities. A total of 6232 flaring sites are identified worldwide. The best estimates of the annual flared gas volume and the BC emissions are 129BCM with a confidence interval of [35, 419 BCM] and 73 Gg with a confidence interval of [20, 239 Gg], respectively. Comparison of our activity (i.e. BCM) results with those of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire data set and SWIR-based calculations show general agreement but distinct differences in several details. The calculation of black carbon emissions using our gas flaring data set with a newly developed dynamic assignment of emission factors lie in the range of recently published black carbon inventories, albeit towards the lower end. The data presented here can therefore be used e.g. in atmospheric dispersion simulations. The advantage of using our algorithm with Sentinel-3 data lies in the previously demonstrated ability to detect and quantify small flares, the long-term data availability from the Copernicus programme, and the increased detection opportunity of global gas flare monitoring when used in conjunction with the VIIRS instruments. The flaring activity and related black carbon emissions are available as "GFlaringS3" on the Emissions of atmospheric Compounds and Compilation of Ancillary Data (ECCAD) website (https://doi.org/10.25326/19, Caseiro and Kaiser, 2019).

TI  - Evaluation of water conservation function in the Xiongan New Area based on the comprehensive index method
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Water conservation is an important service function of ecosystems. A timely understanding of dynamic changes in the water conservation function is important for the protection and reconstruction of water resources. Based on remote sensing data, meteorological data, land cover data, and the "Technical Criterion for Ecosystem Status Evaluation" issued by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China, a comprehensive evaluation system was designed to assess the water conservation function of the Xiongan New Area from 2005 to 2015. The system created from four aspects, including ecological structure, ecological stress, water balance and landscape ecology. The results showed that from 2005 to 2015, the water conservation function of the Xiongan New Area first decreased and then increased, and the overall trend was upward. The increasing areas were mainly concentrated around Baiyangdian and near the grassland. Among all evaluated indicators, the precipitation compliance rate index fluctuated the most from -16.62 in 2010 to 6.70 in 2015. The evapotranspiration index was the largest in 2010 (6.47) and the smallest in 2005 (3.52). The Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) showed that the drought was the severest in 2010 and the least severe in 2015. However, the other indicators remain relatively stable. From the perspective of the spatial distribution, the water conservation function of the Xiongan New Area was gradually enhanced from north to south.

TI  - Impact of 2018 Kerala Floods on Soil Erosion: Need for Post-Disaster Soil Management
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme precipitation events lead to flash floods, which can trigger soil erosion and landslides. While damages to infrastructure and livelihoods are rapidly assessed on economic terms, damages to natural resources are not estimated due to limited observation record. This study conducted an analysis using remote sensing data to estimate changes in soil erosion rates before, during and after the Kerala 2018 floods, based on the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). The USLE was driven by multiple data including: in situ rainfall data from Indian Meteorological Department (to estimate rainfall erosive factor), soil maps prepared by Food and Agriculture Organization (to estimate the soil erodibility factor from the properties of soil that consists of the percentage of clay, loam and silt), digital elevation model (to estimate topographic slope and length) from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and multispectral imagery (to estimate cover management factor and conservation practice factor) from Landsat-8 satellite. Data from these sources were analysed using a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform. Results indicate a state-wise average increase of 80% (31-56 metric tons ha(-1) year(-1)) in soil erosion rate during the floods. Of the districts, Idukki showed the highest increase, of 220% and more susceptibility to soil erosion, which is in comparison with government survey records. Results show that the floods and associated erosion were not only due to the rainfall event but also due to the rapid change in land use and land cover, from natural to human settlements. Therefore, government agencies need to protect land cover and reduce unsustainable development in ecologically sensitive environments, which if managed properly can act as a buffer for soil erosion extremes in Kerala.

TI  - Snow depth mapping from stereo satellite imagery in mountainous terrain: evaluation using airborne laser-scanning data
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate knowledge of snow depth distributions in mountain catchments is critical for applications in hydrology and ecology. Recently, a method was proposed to map snow depth at meter-scale resolution from very-high-resolution stereo satellite imagery (e.g., Pleiades) with an accuracy close to 0.5 m. However, the validation was limited to probe measurements and unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry, which sampled a limited fraction of the topographic and snow depth variability. We improve upon this evaluation using accurate maps of the snow depth derived from Airborne Snow Observatory laser-scanning measurements in the Tuolumne river basin, USA. We find a good agreement between both datasets over a snow-covered area of 138 km(2) on a 3m grid, with a positive bias for a Pleiades snow depth of 0.08 m, a root mean square error of 0.80m and a normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) of 0.69 m. Satellite data capture the relationship between snow depth and elevation at the catchment scale and also small-scale features like snow drifts and avalanche deposits at a typical scale of tens of meters. The random error at the pixel level is lower in snow-free areas than in snow-covered areas, but it is reduced by a factor of 2 (NMAD of approximately 0.40m for snow depth) when averaged to a 36m grid. We conclude that satellite photogrammetry stands out as a convenient method to estimate the spatial distribution of snow depth in high mountain catchments.

TI  - Encapsulation-Dependent Enhanced Emission of Near-Infrared Nanoparticles Using<i>in vivo</i>Three-Photon Fluorescence Imaging
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We discovered a unique fluorescent enhancement of dye encapsulated polymeric nanoparticles, which strongly depended on the polymeric matrix. Interestingly, the polymer nanoparticles containing a NIR emissive dye exhibited remarkable enhancement of emission encapsulated by the polymer amphiphilic polymer containing polystyrene (PS) moiety, whereas the nanoparticles showed weak fluorescence when using other polymer encapsulation. The highest fluorescent quantum yield of nanoparticles can reach 27% by using PS-PEG encapsulation, where the strong NIR fluorescence can be observed. These ultra-bright fluorescence nanoparticles also possess a strong three-photon fluorescence and show a good candidate forin vivovascular three-photon fluorescence imaging of mouse brain and ear under 1550 nm fs laser excitation. A fine three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction with an imaging depth of 635 and 180 mu m was achieved, respectively. We further demonstrate that these nanoparticles can effectively target the sentinel lymph node (SLN) of mice.

TI  - A spaceborne SAR-based procedure to support the detection of landslides
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of free-access satellite data represents a relevant opportunity for the analysis and assessment of natural hazards. The systematic acquisition of spaceborne imagery allows for monitoring areas prone to geohydrological disasters, providing relevant information for risk evaluation and management. In cases of major landslide events, for example, spaceborne radar data can provide an effective solution for the detection of slope failures, even in cases with persistent cloud cover. The information about the extension and location of the landslide-affected areas may support decision-making processes during emergency responses.In this paper, we present an automatic procedure based on Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, aimed at facilitating the detection of landslides over wide areas. Specifically, the procedure evaluates changes of radar backscattered signals associated with land cover modifications that may be also caused by mass movements. After a one-time calibration of some parameters, the processing chain is able to automatically execute the download and preprocessing of images, the detection of SAR amplitude changes, and the identification of areas potentially affected by landslides, which are then displayed in a georeferenced map. This map should help decision makers and emergency managers to organize field investigations. The process of automatization is implemented with specific scripts running on a GNU/Linux operating system and exploiting modules of open-source software.We tested the processing chain, in back analysis, on an area of about 3000 km(2) in central Papua New Guinea that was struck by a severe seismic sequence in February-March 2018. In the area, we simulated a periodic survey of about 7 months, from 12 November 2017 to 6 June 2018, downloading 36 Sentinel-1 images and performing 17 change detection analyses automatically. The procedure resulted in statistical and graphical evidence of widespread land cover changes that occurred just after the most severe seismic events. Most of the detected changes can be interpreted as mass movements triggered by the seismic shaking.

TI  - Spatial risk analysis for the introduction and circulation of six arboviruses in the Netherlands
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundArboviruses are a growing public health concern in Europe, with both endemic and exotic arboviruses expected to spread further into novel areas in the next decades. Predicting where future outbreaks will occur is a major challenge, particularly for regions where these arboviruses are not endemic. Spatial modelling of ecological risk factors for arbovirus circulation can help identify areas of potential emergence. Moreover, combining hazard maps of different arboviruses may facilitate a cost-efficient, targeted multiplex-surveillance strategy in areas where virus transmission is most likely. Here, we developed predictive hazard maps for the introduction and/or establishment of six arboviruses that were previously prioritized for the Netherlands: West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Rift Valley fever virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, louping-ill virus and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus.MethodsOur spatial model included ecological risk factors that were identified as relevant for these arboviruses by an earlier systematic review, including abiotic conditions, vector abundance, and host availability. We used geographic information system (GIS)-based tools and geostatistical analyses to model spatially continuous datasets on these risk factors to identify regions in the Netherlands with suitable ecological conditions for arbovirus introduction and establishment.ResultsThe resulting hazard maps show that there is spatial clustering of areas with either a relatively low or relatively high environmental suitability for arbovirus circulation. Moreover, there was some overlap in high-hazard areas for virus introduction and/or establishment, particularly in the southern part of the country.ConclusionsThe similarities in environmental suitability for some of the arboviruses provide opportunities for targeted sampling of vectors and/or sentinel hosts in these potential hotspots of emergence, thereby increasing the efficient use of limited resources for surveillance.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - For 43 years, multi-dated satellite imagery is used to examine shifts in shorelines and potential location on shorelines for Dr. Abdul Kalam Island, in the Bay of Bengal, India. A Normalized Difference Water Index with object-based classification system and automatic shoreline extraction tool is used to retrieve the shoreline automatically. To calculate the rates of shoreline change and future positions, based on empirical observations, the simple statistical model, such as EPR and LR models are used. The erosion/accretion scenario is also analyzed for the 1976, 1989, 1997, 2008 and 2018 shoreline of Landsat imaging.Results showsnorth of Dr. Abdul Kalam Island is subjected to high deposition rates and the south part having high erosion rates in the vicinity of the Dhamara Estuary and Maipura River. The short-term (2023) and long-term (2028) shoreline positions are predicted on the basis of the delineated shoreline. Around 63% of transect's RMSE values varies between +/- 10 m, showing better agreement among the estimated shoreline positions and satellite-based ones. The results of the study can be very useful for the quantification of shoreline changes, shoreline forecasting and precautionary measures for anti-satellite missile launching centre.

T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - New possibilities for horizontal current retrieval in marginal ice zones (MIZs) from sequential Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are demonstrated. Daily overlapping SAR acquisitions within 70-85 degrees S/N at time intervals < 1 h enable estimation of high-resolution velocity fields, revealing MIZ dynamics down to submesoscales. An example taken from the Fram Strait MIZ reveals energetic eddies and filaments with Rossby numbers reaching O(1) magnitudes. The SAR-derived velocity estimations at such high spatial resolution can be critical for monitoring the evolving MIZ dynamics and model validation of submesoscale processes in polar oceans.

TI  - Evaluation of Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI) Method for Estimating Actual Evapotranspiration in Kangsabati Reservoir Command Using Landsat 8 Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important hydrological variable for better irrigation management, water budgeting, and runoff estimation which should be estimated as precisely as possible both in space and time. However, most of the available crop coefficient-based ET computation methods provide point-scale estimates which need upscaling to apply at the catchment or command area scale. This study evaluates the applicability of the simplified surface energy balance index (S-SEBI) method to compute the spatially distributed daily ET in the Kangsabati reservoir command in eastern India considering the crop coefficient-based coupled Hargreaves-Samani (ETc_HG) method as the benchmark. The study is based on two major crops of paddy and potato in the Rabi season of 2015 at 100 surveyed ground truth locations in the selected command area having different crop growth stages and using the site-specific Landsat 8 images on three cloud-free dates. The S-SEBI method shows improved ET estimates during the crop development stage characterized by higher canopy cover than that during the initial crop development stage with lesser canopy cover that traps less radiation. Results revealed that S-SEBI-based ET estimates correlated well with ETc_HG withrand RMSE value of 0.06 and 1.13 mm/day (initial stage), 0.71 and 0.52 mm/day (development stage) and 0.77 and 0.52 (maturity stage) for paddy. Therand RMSE value for potato is found to be better during the development stage (0.43, 0.69 mm/day) than the initial stage (0.17, 0.64 mm/day) in a similar trend with paddy. Therefore, the crop coefficient-based method could be advantageous at point-scale with adequate data availability conditions, whereas the S-SEBI method could be used in data-scarce areas to estimate the spatially distributed ET values.

AB  - The ground validation of radiometric calibration results of optical sensors is comprehensive affected by many uncertainty factors in earth-atmosphere system, which leads to the difference of single verification results in single site, and unable to effectively compare and comprehensively analyze the results. In this study, in consideration of the influence of target characteristics, atmospheric environment, and other factors on the single verification results of single site, a comprehensive weighting method based on weighted average value with the uncertainty of verification results as the weight is proposed to obtain the key comparative reference value (KCRV) closer to the real value, so as to realize the comparison and comprehensive analysis of single site verification results. Meanwhile, the radiometric calibration results of ZY-3/MUX made in China arc comprehensively verified based on the ground targets with different reflection characteristics in the national high resolution remote sensing integrated calibration field. The results show that the KCRVs of 12 validation samples in blue, green, red and near-infrared bands arc 3.88%, 5.12%, 6.11%, 9.81% respectively, the corresponding uncertainty is 1.79%, 1.87%, and 2.02 %, respectively. Among them, the equivalence degrees of 9 validation samples arc less than 0.1, prove that the validation results of these samples arc closer to KCRV.

TI  - Finnish and Turkish Student Teachers' Views on Virtual Worldview Dialogue
T2  - RELIGION & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates worldview dialogue between 12 student teachers in Finland and in Turkey. The aim of the study is to explore the experiences of students engaged in virtual worldview dialogue. The research data consist of written emails and transcribed group discussions, which were analyzed using a content analysis approach. The findings indicate that dialogue is perceived through constructive complexity and that the students learned most from their own personal worldview. Differences between secular and religious worldviews were also negotiated, though some challenges were encountered. The study argues that tools for worldview reflexivity and worldview-related dialogue should be fostered in teacher education.

TI  - Characterizing Family Physicians Who Refer to Telepsychiatry in Ontario
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PSYCHIATRIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Telepsychiatry can improve access to psychiatric services for those who otherwise cannot easily access care. Family physicians are gatekeepers to specialized care in Ontario, so it is essential to understand predictors relating to referrals to telepsychiatry to better plan services and increase telepsychiatry adoption. Methods: This study used an annual retrospective cross-sectional study design to compare physicians who referred their patients to telepsychiatry each year from fiscal year (FY) 2008 to FY 2016. A 1-year (FY 2016) comparison of family physicians who referred to telepsychiatry (FPTs) compared to family physicians who did not refer to telepsychiatry (FPNTs) matched (1:2) by region was also conducted. Finally, we used statistical modeling to understand the predictors of referring to telepsychiatry among physicians. Results: Between FY 2008 and FY 2016, the number of patients receiving telepsychiatry increased from 925 visits to 13,825 visits. Thirty-two percent of Ontario primary care physicians referred to telepsychiatry in 2016. Several characteristics were notably different between FPTs and FPNTs: FPTs were more likely to be from a residence with less than 10,000 people, to have more nurse practitioners in the practice, and to be from a family health team than FPNTs. Rostered patients of FPTs were more likely to reside in rural areas, have more clinical complexity, and to utilize more mental health services compared to FPNTs. Conclusions: There has been an increase in the use of telepsychiatry by patients and family physicians over the study period, although there remains opportunity for significant growth. Family physicians who live in rural areas, are part of an FHT, have more NPs, with more rural and complex patients were more likely to refer to telepsychiatry. As recent pro-telemedicine policies support the growth of telepsychiatry, this study will serve as an important baseline.

TI  - Bioaccumulation of heavy metals, lipid profiles, and antioxidant status of snails (<i>Achatina achatina)</i>around cement factory vicinities
T2  - TOXICOLOGY AND INDUSTRIAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Some snails (Achatina spp) can be used as a biosensor of heavy metal poisoning. This study thus estimated some heavy metal levels, antioxidant markers, and lipid profiles of snails handpicked around cement factory vicinities in Ogun State, Nigeria. Snails and soil samples were collected from Oke, Ewekoro, Papalanto, and Mowodani Imeko-Afon (control site). Lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and arsenic (As) levels were estimated in the soil, snail foot, hemolymph, and shell using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry. Triacylglycerol (TAG), phospholipids (PHOL), cholesterol (CHOL), malondialdehyde (MDA), and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, as well as glutathione-S-transferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and arylesterase (AR) activities in the hemolymph, were estimated spectrophotometrically. The snails collected from the Oke site had the highest foot Pb (274.66 +/- 13.50 mg/g tissue), CHOL, TAG, PHOL levels, and GST activity when compared with other sites. Snails collected from Papa had the highest Cd levels (1.79 +/- 0.74 mg/kg), As (1206 +/- 18.87 mg/g tissue) in the foot, and LDH activity, while Ewekoro snails had highest MDA levels and AR activities but the lowest GSH levels. Additionally, there were negative correlations between the heavy metal levels and the activities of GST and AR as well as GSH levels, while positively correlating with LDH activity and MDA level. Workers and the general public around cement factories are at a greater risk of heavy metal-induced pathologies. More so, consumption of snails around these sites may be deleterious to health.

TI  - Saliency Detection for Ship Targets on Four-Band Multi-Spectral Remote Sensing Images
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - To solve the problems of low ship-target detection rate and low multi-spectral near-infrared (NIR) band utilization rate of optical remote sensors in complex background, a novel algorithm for saliency detection of ship targets based on four-band multi-spectral remote sensing images is proposed. The proposed algorithm employs the features of visual images in four-band remote sensing data that have rich color information as well as NIR images that have good ability to describe details. First, the three bands of blue, green, and red images are transformed into the CIE-Lab color space. Then, the NIR image is decomposed via the non-subsampled contourlet transform. The obtained high-frequency components are nonlinearly enhanced to suppress noise and enhance details, and the low-frequency components are enhanced via unsharp masking to improve the uniformity of image brightness. The high-frequency components and low-frequency components are combined with the brightness images in Lab space to obtain a new Lab image. Finally, the maximum symmetric surround model is applied to the new Lab image to obtain a saliency image of the ship target. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can fully suppress the complex background information of clutter interferences, such as cloud waves and sea wakes, and it also can highlight ship targets in low contrast backgrounds. The proposed algorithm has good precision and recall.

TI  - An Ontology-Based Framework for Complex Urban Object Recognition through Integrating Visual Features and Interpretable Semantics
T2  - COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although previous works have proposed sophisticatedly probabilistic models that has strong capability of extracting features from remote sensing data (e.g., convolutional neural networks, CNN), the efforts that focus on exploring the human's semantics on the object to be recognized are required more explorations. Moreover, interpretability of feature extraction becomes a major disadvantage of the state-of-the-art CNN. Especially for the complex urban objects, which varies in geometrical shapes, functional structures, environmental contexts, etc, due to the heterogeneity between low-level data features and high-level semantics, the features derived from remote sensing data alone are limited to facilitate an accurate recognition. In this paper, we present an ontology-based methodology framework for enabling object recognition through rules extracted from the high-level semantics, rather than unexplainable features extracted from a CNN. Firstly, we semantically organize the descriptions and definitions of the object as semantics (RDF-triple rules) through our developed domain ontology. Secondly, we exploit semantic web rule language to propose an encoder model for decomposing the RDF-triple rules based on a multilayer strategy. Then, we map the low-level data features, which are defined from optical satellite image and LiDAR height, to the decomposed parts of RDF-triple rules. Eventually, we apply a probabilistic belief network (PBN) to probabilistically represent the relationships between low-level data features and high-level semantics, as well as a modified TanH function is used to optimize the recognition result. The experimental results on lacking of the training process based on data samples show that our proposed approach can reach an accurate recognition with high-level semantics. This work is conducive to the development of complex urban object recognition toward the fields including multilayer learning algorithms and knowledge graph-based relational reinforcement learning.

TI  - Primary Dermal Melanoma (PDM): Histological and Clinical Interdependence to Guide Therapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/purpose This study examined clinical and histological parameters of primary dermal melanoma (PDM) to aid in its distinction from dermal metastasis. Methods Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort of PDM patients. Includes patients fulfilling the strict histologic criteria for PDM (N= 9) and patients who did not, but clinically, unequivocally had an intradermal melanoma-clinical PDM (cPDM;N= 17). Histopathology slides were re-examined. Prognosticators and outcome measures were compared between groups. Sentinel nodes' retrieval and wide local excision (WLE) were offered to all patients as primary treatment. Results 26 patients identified, 15 females with a median age of 69 years (range 3.5-85). Mean Breslow was 7.9 +/- 5.7 mm (median 5.8, range 1.8-25.0), and the mean mitotic rate was 4.9 +/- 3.8/mm(2)(median 4.0, range 0-17). Initial treatment and follow-up were as for cutaneous melanoma. One patient in each group with a palpable stage III underwent primary radical dissection. Sentinel nodes were retrieved in all 20 lymphatic mappings performed and found to be metastatic in 5 (25%) patients. Treatment consisted of completion lymph-node dissection. At a median postoperative follow-up of 62 months (range 8-132), 20 patients were disease-free, including 6 of 7 patients with stage III disease at presentation. Six patients died all of cPDM; 5 of 6 patients had primary ulcerated or epidermal-abutting melanomas. Conclusions This is the first study to highlight cPDM. Diagnosis requires expert pathology review and a tight correlation to the clinical parameters. Patients seem to benefit from WLE with sentinel node retrieval and complete dissection when appropriate. However, clinical guidelines for dissection have changed since the time period of this retrospective review. Based on this series, complete nodal dissection in these melanomas is associated with better than expected outcome, for stage III disease.

TI  - Pre- and Postcollapse Ground Deformation Revealed by SAR Interferometry: A Case Study of Foshan (China) Ground Collapse
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - On the evening of 7 February 2018, a deadly collapse of a metro tunnel under construction in the Southern China city of Foshan caused 11 deaths, 8 injuries, and 1 missing person. For disaster prevention and mitigation, the spatiotemporal ground deformations before and after the collapse event were derived from 55 Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images spanning from March 2017 to January 2019. The results showed that prominent ground subsidence in the shape of a funnel with a maximum rate of 42 mm/year was observed in the vicinity of the collapse area before the accident. After the accident, the area and magnitude of subsidence decreased compared with precollapse subsidence. This decrease is related to the progress of tunnel excavation and groundwater changes. In the temporal domain, continuous subsidence was observed over a year before and after the accident, and accelerated subsidence appeared one month before the collapse accident. Soft soil consolidation and tunnel-induced soil losses were the main reasons for the subsidence over the study area. The leakage of groundwater accounted for the collapse event. The leaked groundwater eroded the soil, resulting in the formation of an arched hole. The connection between the arched hole and the tunnel reduced the bearing capacity of the soil layer above the arched hole, triggering the collapse event. The findings provide scientific evidence for future collapse monitoring and early warning due to tunnel excavation.

TI  - Detection and attribution of lake water loss in the semi-arid Mongolian Plateau-A case study in the Lake Dalinor
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive lake shrinkages have been observed in the semi-arid Mongolian Plateau over the past several decades, causing a great challenge to the local socio-economic sustainability and ecological security. However, issue on the dominant drivers of this water loss has not been well addressed. In this work, variations in water area and water level of the Lake Dalinor during the period 1984-2018 were tracked using the satellite altimetry and Landsat images. Dominant drivers for the derived variations were then investigated based on the Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI) analysis and the Vegetation Interface Processes model. Results showed that both the water area and water level displayed a two-stage variation with a slightly increasing trend before 2000 and a drastic decline since 2000 (p< 0.01). The SPEI analysis revealed a close relationship between water level variations and the cumulative water anomalies at seasonal and annual scales. The model-based attribution analysis suggested that climate change and anthropogenic impacts contributed 76.5% and 23.5% of the observed declining trend, respectively. Climate warming and drying dominated the water level decline since 2000, while the large-scale conversion from the natural grassland to the seeded pasture might have accelerated this water loss process. This study confirmed the prominent impacts of climate warming and drying on the lake desiccation in the semi-arid Mongolian Plateau and highlighted the gradually intensifying impacts of human activities such as grassland conversion on the lake water budget.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities and pollution are impacting marine environments globally. As a consequence, increasing numbers of human-associated phylotypes of Escherichia coli, an indicator of fecal contamination, have been found in both aquatic environments and marine mammals considered sentinels for marine health. The objective of this study was to determine the presence and diversity of E. coli in pups of three species of free ranging pinnipeds in Australia. Fecal samples (n = 963) were collected between 2016 and 2019 from Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea), Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusilus doriferus) and long-nosed fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri) pups from eight breeding colonies extending along the Southern Australian coast. E. coli were isolated from 842 (87.3%) samples and molecular screening was applied to assign isolates to E. coli phylotypes and sub-types. The human associated E. coli phylotype B2 was the most frequently isolated in all species at seven of the eight colonies, with 73.7% of all E. coli isolates belonging to this phylotype. Phylotype distribution did not differ significantly within or across species, breeding colonies or breeding seasons. Analysis of B2 isolates into sub-types showed a significant difference in sub-type distribution across breeding seasons at two colonies (Seal Rocks and Cape Gantheaume). The predominance of the B2 phylotype could indicate that all colonies are exposed to similar levels of anthropogenic pollution. This widespread occurrence of the human-associated E. coli phylotypes highlights the imperative for ongoing monitoring and surveillance of microbes in both the marine environment and sentinel species.

T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) and its relationship with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are significantly considered in environmental study. The aim of this study was to retrieve the LST of Raipur City of tropical India and to explore its seasonal relationships with NDVI. Landsat images of four specific seasons for three particular years with fourteen years time interval were analyzed. The result showed a gradual rising (3.63 degrees C during 1991-2004 and 1.54 degrees C during 2004-2018) of LST during the whole period of study. The mean LST value of three particular years was the lowest (27.21 degrees C) on green vegetation and the highest (29.81 degrees C) on bare land and built-up areas. The spatial distribution of NDVI and LST reflects an inverse relationship. The best (-0.63) and the least (-0.17) correlation were noticed in the post-monsoon and winter seasons, respectively, whereas a moderate (-0.45) correlation were found both in the monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons. This LST-NDVI correlation was strong negative (-0.51) on vegetation surface, moderate positive on water bodies (0.45), and weak positive on the built-up area and bare land (0.14). In summary, the LST is greatly controlled by surface characteristics. This study can be used as a reference for land use and environmental planning in a tropical city.

TI  - Monitoring of<i>aerosols</i>and studying its effects on the environment and humans health in Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural hazards affect different parts of living organisms. One of these hazards is aerosols. Addressing this issue in areas that suffer from this hazard is of critical importance. Scientific research over the past two decades has shown that aerosol particles are one of the main pollutants from the perspective of public health and health. The purpose of the present study is to monitor and model aerosol temporal and spatial variations in Iran. Aerosols or airborne particles with health effects such as heart, vascular and respiratory diseases are associated. For this purpose, MODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and NOAA (or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) satellite data and BTD (or Brightness Temperature Difference) were used. Given the 20-year study period (2000-2019), the output of much satellite data was divided into four five-year periods to monitor aerosols with high accuracy. The results showed that aerosol values in terms of intensity and frequency of optical depth (AOD) increased over the 20-year time series, and its intensity was higher in the last 5 years. According to the results obtained from the NODIS and NOAA satellite data and comparing their outputs, NOAA satellite data were associated with outliers, which was significantly different from the other cohort data. For this reason, the MODIS satellite image output was used to monitor aerosol images. The innovation of the present study is the use of remote sensing science to monitor the effects of aerosols on the environment and human's health. According to the results from MODIS satellite data, the maximum optical depth (AOD) of the aerosols is for July 2003 with a value of 0.63, but according to the NOAA satellite data output, the maximum optical depth (AOD) of the aerosols is for March 2013 with a value of 2.54. As the values of aerosols increase in frequency and intensity and the areas with the highest intensity of aerosols have been identified, it can be overcome by careful planning of their problems. Areas, where the amount and volume of aerosols were higher, should be observed in health protocols. By preventing and maintaining good hygiene, the negative effects of aerosols can be reduced.

T2  - CLINICAL TEACHER
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2001, more than 3.3 million US service members have been deployed to operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, New Dawn, Inherent Resolve and Freedom's Sentinel. Visible and invisible war wounds from direct combat experiences, coupled with environmental exposures to harmful substances, can complicate veterans' health throughout their lifespan. While promoting a holistic view of health, health professionals should be attentive for potential risks associated with environmental or animal exposures (One Health concept). During deployment, infectious and non-infectious environmental exposures and harmful substances in the air, on the land and in the water may result in immediate- or long-term health effects. Veterans can also face psychosocial health risks when home that may impact their concentration, emotional responses and social interactions. To strengthen health professions education, the authors recommend that curricula incorporate a comprehensive overview of veterans' physical and psychosocial health risks as a result of their deployment. They describe four specific curriculum topics, competencies and didactic methods that can reinforce veteran-specific content for clinical education and training. By applying the One Health concept, health professionals can document harmful environmental exposures during deployment, report gaps in clinical practice, and provide support for veterans' physical and psychosocial health needs when returning to civilian life.Military service experience, overseas deployment and post-deployment reintegration to civilian life are recognised chapters in the lives of military service members

TI  - Application of 30-meter global digital elevation models for compensating rational polynomial coefficients biases
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Generation of precise digital elevation models (DEMs) from stereo satellite images by using rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) usually needs several ground control points (GCPs). This is mainly due to RPCs biases. However, since GCPs collection is a time consuming and expensive process, global DEMs (GDEMs), as the most inexpensive geospatial information, can be used to improve stereo satellite imagery-based DEMs (IB-DEMs). In this study, a 2.5 D mutual information based DEM matching, between a GDEM and an IB-DEM, was introduced for bias correction of satellite stereo images. Three well-known 30-meter GDEMs, namely, SRTM, ASTER, and AW3D30, were used and compared to assess the efficiency of this approach. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by processing the stereo images acquired by CARTOSAT-1 satellite from two regions with flat, hilly, and mountainous topography. Evaluation results revealed that the proposed method could significantly improve the geometric accuracy of IB-DEM using all GDEMs.

TI  - Analysis of land use land cover change using a new and existing spectral indices and its impact on normalized land surface temperature
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, a new spectral index named as Normalized Ratio Urban Index (NRUI(ms))has been proposed for multi-sensor Landsat satellite data. The new index along with other existing indices, has been used as additional feature for image classification to assess Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes for Dehradun, India. It has been found that use of indices, increases separability between different LULC class-pairs. However, for fallow-urban class pair, NRUI(ms)shows better separability in comparison to other indices. Significant LULC changes have been analysed using Man Kendall (MK) and Sen's Slope (SS) tests. The change during the period 1991-2019 reveals that an unprecedented urban growth has taken place. Further, conversion of vegetated areas into non-vegetated areas has also been studied in this period. For changed areas, normalized LST difference has been estimated. The LULC conversion from vegetated into non-vegetated areas, leads to an increase in LST and vice-versa.

TI  - Cloud_cci ATSR-2 and AATSR data set version 3: a 17-year climatology of global cloud and radiation properties
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - We present version 3 (V3) of the Cloud_cci Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) and Advanced ATSR (AATSR) data set. The data set was created for the European Space Agency (ESA) Cloud_cci (Climate Change Initiative) programme. The cloud properties were retrieved from the second ATSR (ATSR-2) on board the second European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-2) spanning 1995-2003 and the AATSR on board Envisat, which spanned 2002-2012. The data are comprised of a comprehensive set of cloud properties: cloud top height, temperature, pressure, spectral albedo, cloud effective emissivity, effective radius, and optical thickness, alongside derived liquid and ice water path. Each retrieval is provided with its associated uncertainty. The cloud property retrievals are accompanied by high-resolution top- and bottom-of-atmosphere shortwave and longwave fluxes that have been derived from the retrieved cloud properties using a radiative transfer model. The fluxes were generated for all-sky and clear-sky conditions. V3 differs from the previous version 2 (V2) through development of the retrieval algorithm and attention to the consistency between the ATSR-2 and AATSR instruments. The cloud properties show improved accuracy in validation and better consistency between the two instruments, as demonstrated by a comparison of cloud mask and cloud height with co-located CALIPSO data. The cloud masking has improved significantly, particularly in its ability to detect clear pixels. The Kuiper Skill score has increased from 0.49 to 0.66. The cloud top height accuracy is relatively unchanged. The AATSR liquid water path was compared with the Multisensor Advanced Climatology of Liquid Water Path (MAC-LWP) in regions of stratocumulus cloud and shown to have very good agreement and improved consistency between ATSR-2 and AATSR instruments. The correlation with MAC-LWP increased from 0.4 to over 0.8 for these cloud regions. The flux products are compared with NASA Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data, showing good agreement within the uncertainty. The new data set is well suited to a wide range of climate applications, such as comparison with climate models, investigation of trends in cloud properties, understanding aerosol-cloud interactions, and providing contextual information for co-located ATSR-2/AATSR surface temperature and aerosol products.

TI  - Spatial clustering using neighborhood for multispectral images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial data mining discovers patterns and knowledge in spatial data. The geospatial data analysis plays a decisive role in framing essential policies related to the environment at the national as well as global level. It helps in the prediction of weather, studying the impact of climate change, the effect of global warming, forest fire, deforestation, and other causes of changes in nature. Clustering is a process of assigning similar objects to a group and dissimilar objects to different groups. We proposed a clustering algorithm, spatial clustering using neighborhood (SCN), in which similar neighboring pixels groups together to form a cluster. It is a two-step process: first, identification of clusters of similar neighboring pixels and second, merging of spatially separated similar clusters. Experiments with the implementation of the proposed approach have been carried out on three Landsat 5 thematic mapper images of Delhi, Chilika lake, and Kolkata region. In terms of normalized cluster quality parameters, SCN produced better clusters than other discussed algorithms in the literature. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Chemical oceanographic influences on sediment accumulations of a carbonate ramp: Holocene Yucatan Shelf, Mexico
T2  - SEDIMENTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global controls on the oceanographic influences on the nature of carbonate factories are broadly understood. The details of the influences of changes in temperature and nutrients across individual carbonate shelves are less well constrained, however. This study explores spatial and temporal variations in chemical oceanography along and across the Yucatan Shelf, a modern carbonate ramp, and how these factors relate to variable bottom character, sediment and sediment geochemistry.In-situsensors and remote-sensing data indicate the sporadic presence of cool, upwelled water with low dissolved oxygen and elevated Chlorophyll-a. This current-driven, westward flow of upwelled water is most evident in a zone just offshore of the northern peninsular shoreline, but its influence wanesca75 km offshore and as the shore turns southward. The impacts of this water mass include a transitional photozoan-heterozoan assemblage with biosiliceous components, relict grains and common thin Holocene sediment accumulations nearshore; further offshore are coralgal reefs and expansive sand plains. Geochemical proxies of bulk sediment, including high delta O-18 and elevated HREE/LREE (heavy rare-earth element/light rare-earth element) ratios near, and downcurrent of, the upwelling source, are interpreted to represent the signal of nearshore, westward movement of the cool and nutrient-rich, upwelled water. Collectively, these data emphasize how local processes such as upwelling and longshore transport can variably influence carbonate sediment accumulations and their geochemical signatures, both along and across individual shelves. These data and insights provide an analogue for the influences of spatial variability of water masses in the geological record, and for accurate interpretation of stratigraphic changes of sedimentary and geochemical proxy data in carbonate archives.

TI  - Call order within vocal sequences of meerkats contains temporary contextual and individual information
T2  - BMC BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The ability to recombine smaller units to produce infinite structures of higher-order phrases is unique to human language, yet evidence of animals to combine multiple acoustic units into meaningful combinations increases constantly. Despite increasing evidence for meaningful call combinations across contexts, little attention has been paid to the potential role of temporal variation of call type composition in longer vocal sequences in conveying information about subtle changes in the environment or individual differences. Here, we investigated the composition and information content of sentinel call sequences in meerkats (Suricata suricatta). While being on sentinel guard, a coordinated vigilance behaviour, meerkats produce long sequences composed of six distinct sentinel call types and alarm calls. We analysed recordings of sentinels to test if the order of the call types is graded and whether they contain additional group-, individual-, age- or sex-specific vocal signatures. Results Our results confirmed that the six distinct types of sentinel calls in addition to alarm calls were produced in a highly graded way, likely referring to changes in the perceived predation risk. Transitions between call types one step up or down the a priory assumed gradation were over-represented, while transitions over two or three steps were significantly under-represented. Analysing sequence similarity within and between groups and individuals demonstrated that sequences composed of the most commonly emitted sentinel call types showed high within-individual consistency whereby adults and females had higher consistency scores than subadults and males respectively. Conclusions We present a novel type of combinatoriality where the order of the call types contains temporary contextual information, and also relates to the identity of the caller. By combining different call types in a graded way over long periods, meerkats constantly convey meaningful information about subtle changes in the external environment, while at the same time the temporal pattern of the distinct call types contains stable information about caller identity. Our study demonstrates how complex animal call sequences can be described by simple rules, in this case gradation across acoustically distinct, but functionally related call types, combined with individual-specific call patterns.

TI  - Increased incidence of interstitial pneumonia detected on [<SUP>18</SUP>F]-FDG-PET/CT in asymptomatic cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic in Lombardy: a casualty or COVID-19 infection?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The study aimed to compare the incidence of interstitial pneumonia on [F-18]-FDG PET/CT scans between two 6-month periods: (a) the COVID-19 pandemic peak and (b) control period. Secondly, we compared the incidence of interstitial pneumonia on [F-18]-FDG PET/CT and epidemiological data from the regional registry of COVID-19 cases. Additionally, imaging findings and the intensity of [F-18]-FDG PET/CT uptake in terms of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) were compared. Methods We retrospectively analyzed [F-18]-FDG PET/CT scans performed in cancer patients referred to nuclear medicine of Humanitas Gavazzeni in Bergamo from December 2019 to May 2020 and from December 2018 to May 2019. The per month incidence of interstitial pneumonia at imaging and the epidemiological data were assessed. To evaluate the differences between the two symmetric groups (period of COVID-19 pandemic and control), the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test andttest or Wilcoxon test were performed to compare the distributions of categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Results Overall, 1298 patients were included in the study. The two cohorts-COVID-19 pandemic (n = 575) and control (n = 723)-did not statistically differ in terms of age, disease, or scan indication (p > 0.05). Signs of interstitial pneumonia were observed in 24 (4.2%) and 14 patients (1.9%) in the COVID-19 period and the control period, respectively, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.013). The level of statistical significance improved further when the period from January to May was considered, with a peak in March (7/83 patients, 8.4% vs 3/134 patients, 2.2%,p = 0.001). The curve of interstitial pneumonia diagnosis overlapped with the COVID-19 incidence in the area of Lombardy (Spearman correlation index was equal to 1). Imaging data did not differ among the two cohorts. Conclusions Significant increase of interstitial lung alterations at [F-18]-FDG PET/CT has been demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the incidence curve of imaging abnormalities resulted in resembling the epidemiological data of the general population. These data support the rationale to adopt [F-18]-FDG PET/CT as sentinel modality to identify suspicious COVID-19 cases to be referred for additional confirmatory testing. Nuclear medicine physicians and staff should continue active surveillance of interstitial pneumonia findings, especially when new infection peak is expected.

TI  - Assessing the impact of large barrages on habitat of the Ganga River dolphin
T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Riverine habitats are degrading at an alarming rate due to anthropogenic interventions. Construction of large dams and barrages on the Ganga River has severely fragmented the riverine habitat of dolphins. This study examines the impact of structural barriers on the habitat of the Ganga River dolphin (Platanista gangetica) in a reach between Bijnor and Narora barrage in the middle Ganga and at the Farakka barrage in the lower Ganga Plain. We use time-series remote sensing images and flow discharge data to assess the morphological and ecological impact in the proximity of these barrages. Our result suggests that after the construction of Bijnor barrage in 1985, the total bar area of the Ganga River has reduced from 150 to 45 km(2), but the channel width has remained unchanged during the period between 1980 and 2010. A time-series analysis of the discharge shows a slightly declining trend after the year 1982. However, this observed trend is not adequate to explain the habitat degradation of the Ganga River dolphins. Further width of the Ganga River in the downstream of the Farakka barrage has reduced from 4 to 1 km, and the total bar area has increased from about 5 to 35 km(2)during the period between 1965 and 1980. Also during this period, the pre-monsoon discharge of the Ganga River has reduced by one-third in the downstream of Farakka barrage. This study concludes that the loss of dolphins in the downstream reaches of the Farakka barrage could be associated with the change in hydraulic geometry, flow characteristics, and loss of longitudinal and lateral connectivity. Conversely, the impoundments of water upstream of the Narora barrage have maintained the suitable habitat conditions for the dolphins to thrive. This has resulted in a reported growth in the dolphin population during the years 1993-2010.

TI  - Implementation of a malaria sentinel surveillance system in Togo: a pilot study
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In Togo, the National Malaria Control Programme, in collaboration with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, has implemented a pilot study for malaria sentinel surveillance since 2017, which consists of collecting information in real time and analysing this information for decision-making. The first 20 months of malaria morbidity and mortality trends, and malaria case management in health facilities included in the surveillance were assessed. Methods Since July 2017, 16 health facilities called sentinel sites, 4 hospitals and 12 peripheral care units located in 2 epidemiologically different health regions, have provided weekly data on malaria morbidity and mortality for the following 3 target groups: < 5-years-old children, >= 5-years-old children and adults, and pregnant women. Data from week 29 in 2017 to week 13 in 2019 were analysed. Results Each sentinel site provided complete data and the median time to data entry was 4 days. The number of confirmed malaria cases increased during the rainy seasons both in children under 5 years old and in children over 5 years old and adults. Malaria-related deaths occurred mainly in children under 5 years old and increased during the rainy seasons. The mean percentage of tested cases for malaria among suspected malaria cases was 99.0%. The mean percentage of uncomplicated malaria cases handled in accordance with national guidelines was 99.4%. The mean percentage of severe malaria cases detected in peripheral care units that were referred to a hospital was 100.0%. Rapid diagnostic tests and artemisinin-based combination therapies were out of stock several times, mainly at the beginning and end of the year. No hospital was out of stock of injectable artesunate or injectable artemether. Conclusions These indicators showed good management of malaria cases in the sentinel sites. Real-time availability of data requires a good follow-up of data entry on the online platform. The management of input stocks and the promptness of data need to be improved to meet the objectives of this malaria sentinel surveillance system.

TI  - Intercomparison of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> abundances on regional scales in boreal areas using Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) analysis, COllaborative Carbon Column Observing Network (COCCON) spectrometers, and Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We compare the atmospheric column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (XCO2) and methane (XCH4) measured with a pair of COllaborative Carbon Column Observing Network (COCCON) spectrometers at Kiruna and Sodankyla (boreal areas). We compare model data provided by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) between 2017 and 2019 with XCH4 data from the recently launched Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite between 2018 and 2019. In addition, measured and modeled gradients of XCO2 and XCH4 (Delta XCO2 and Delta XCH4) on regional scales are investigated. Both sites show a similar and very good correlation between COCCON retrievals and the modeled CAMS XCO2 data, while CAMS data are biased high with respect to COCCON by 3.72 ppm (+/- 1.80 ppm) in Kiruna and 3.46 ppm (+/- 1.73 ppm) in Sodankyla on average. For XCH4, CAMS values are higher than the COCCON observations by 0.33 ppb (+/- 11.93 ppb) in Kiruna and 7.39 ppb (+/- 10.92 ppb) in Sodankyla. In contrast, the S5P satellite generally measures lower atmospheric XCH4 than the COCCON spectrometers, with a mean difference of 9.69 ppb (+/- 20.51 ppb) in Kiruna and 3.36 ppb (+/- 17.05 ppb) in So-dankyla. We compare the gradients of XCO2 and XCH4 (Delta XCO2 and Delta XCH4) between Kiruna and Sodankyla derived from CAMS analysis and COCCON and S5P measurements to study the capability of detecting sources and sinks on regional scales. The correlations in Delta XCO2 and Delta XCH4 between the different datasets are generally smaller than the correlations in XCO2 and XCH4 between the datasets at either site. The Delta XCO2 values predicted by CAMS are generally higher than those observed with COCCON with a slope of 0.51. The Delta XCH4 values predicted by CAMS are mostly higher than those observed with COCCON with a slope of 0.65, covering a larger dataset than the comparison between S5P and COCCON. When comparing CAMS Delta XCH4 with COCCON Delta XCH4 only in S5P overpass days (slope = 0.53), the correlation is close to that between S5P and COCCON (slope = 0.51). CAMS, COCCON, and S5P predict gradients in reasonable agreement. However, the small number of observations coinciding with S5P limits our ability to verify the performance of this spaceborne sensor. We detect no significant impact of ground albedo and viewing zenith angle on the S5P results. Both sites show similar situations with the average ratios of XCH4 (S5P/COCCON) of 0.9949 +/- 0.0118 in Kiruna and 0.9953 +/- 0.0089 in Sodankyla. Overall, the results indicate that the COCCON instruments have the capability of measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) gradients on regional scales, and observations performed with the portable spectrometers can contribute to inferring sources and sinks and to validating spaceborne greenhouse gas sensors. To our knowledge, this is the first published study using COCCON spectrometers for the validation of XCH4 measurements collected by S5P.

TI  - Feasibility Study for the Application of Synthetic Aperture Radar for Coastal Erosion Rate Quantification Across the Arctic
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The applicability of optical satellite data to quantify coastal erosion across the Arctic is limited due to frequent cloud cover. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) may provide an alternative. The interpretation of SAR data for coastal erosion monitoring in Arctic regions is, however, challenging due to issues of viewing geometry, ambiguities in scattering behavior and inconsistencies in acquisition strategies. In order to assess SAR applicability, we have investigated data acquired at three different wavelengths (X-, C-, L-band; TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, ALOS PALSAR 1/2). In a first step we developed a pre-processing workflow which considers viewing geometry issues (shoreline orientation, incidence angle relationships with respect to different landcover types). We distinguish between areas with foreshortening along cliffs facing the sensor, radar shadow along cliffs facing away and traditional land-water boundary discrimination. Results are compared to retrievals from Landsat trends. Four regions which feature high erosion rates have been selected. All three wavelengths have been investigated for Kay Point (Canadian Beaufort Sea Coast). C- and L-band have been studied at all sites, including also Herschel Island (Canadian Beaufort Sea Coast), Varandai (Barents Sea Coast, Russia), and Bykovsky Peninsula (Laptev Sea coast, Russia). Erosion rates have been derived for a 1-year period (2017-2018) and in case of L-band also over 11 years (2007-2018). Results indicate applicability of all wavelengths, but acquisitions need to be selected with care to deal with potential ambiguities in scattering behavior. Furthermore, incidence angle dependencies need to be considered for discrimination of the land-water boundary in case of L- and C-band. However, L-band has the lowest sensitivity to wave action and relevant future missions are expected to be of value for coastal erosion monitoring. The utilization of trends derived from Landsat is also promising for efficient long-term trend retrieval. The high spatial resolution of TerraSAR-X staring spot light mode (<1 m) also allows the use of radar shadow for cliff-top monitoring in all seasons. Derived retreat rates agree with rates available from other data sources, but the applicability for automatic retrieval is partially limited. The derived rates suggest an increase of erosion at all four sites in recent years, but uncertainties are also high.

AB  - Background In patients with cutaneous melanoma (CM), the time span between resection of the primary tumour and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as well as the subsequent interval between SLNB and complete lymph node dissection (CLND) varies greatly. Aim To determine whether very early timing of SLNB after resection of the primary tumour, or timing of CLND after SLNB affect the clinical outcome of patients with CM, compared with longer time intervals. Methods We compared the time spans between complete resection of the primary tumour and SLNB, and the interval between SLNB and CLND in a cohort of 896 patients with melanoma who had undergone SLNB. An interval between primary resection and SLNB or between SLNB and CLND of up to 7 days was classified as very early (VE-SLNB and VE-CLND, respectively). This time span was compared with intervals of > 7 days. Univariate and multivariate statistics were performed. Results VE-SLNB was significantly associated with the presence of micrometastases. However, this was probably due to tumour thickness being significantly higher in patients with VE-SLNB compared with patients with later SLNB. Importantly, VE-SLNB was not significantly associated with disease relapse and VE-CLND was not associated with melanoma-specific death. Conclusions VE-SLNB and VE-CLND neither improved nor worsened the clinical outcome of patients. Thus, timing of SLNB and CLND has no influence on the overall clinical outcome of patients with melanoma. Our findings support the rational planning of lymph node surgery after resection of the primary tumour and provide help for effective patient counselling.

TI  - A method for Sentinel-1 DEM outlier removal using 2-D Kalman filter
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The generation of a very accurate and precise digital elevation model (DEM) is one of the main objectives of remote sensing applications. Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry is one of the most common methods for DEM generation. Moreover, one of the most recent Sentinel-1 missions is SAR imagery. Sometimes due to a variety of errors such as interferogram phase error, DEMs based on SAR interferometry contain outliers in the elevation of points. Thus, they need to be modified and updated. In this study, a 2-D Kalman filter-based method is applied to remove outliers from DEM generated from Sentinel-1 images. The proposed method is examined over an area in Iran and the results are compared with a high resolution and precision DEM. The results demonstrate that the efficiency of the proposed method in the outlier removal and root mean square error (RMSE) of the DEM is improved from 11% to 17%.

TI  - Cropland heterogeneity changes on the Northeast China Plain in the last three decades (1980s-2010s)
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The Northeast China Plain is one of the major grain-producing areas of China because of its fertile black soil and large fields adapted for agricultural machinery. It has experienced some land-use changes, such as urbanization, deforestation, and wetland reclamation in recent decades. A comprehensive understanding of these changes in terms of the total cropping land and its heterogeneity during this period is important for policymakers. In this study, we used a series of cropland products at the 30-m resolution for the period 1980-2015. The heterogeneity for dominant cropland decreased slowly over the three decades, especially for the large pieces of cropland, showing a general trend of increased cropland homogeneity. The spatial patterns of the averaged heterogeneity index were nearly the same, varying from 0.5 to 0.6, and the most heterogeneous areas were mainly located in some separate counties. Cropland expansion occurred across most of Northeast China, while cropland shrinking occurred only in the northern and eastern sections of Northeast China and around the capital cities, in the flat areas. Also, changes in land use away from cropland mainly occurred in areas with low elevation (50-200 m) and a gentle slope (less than 1 degree). The predominant changes in cropland were gross gain and homogeneity, occurring across most of the area except capital cities and boundary areas. Possible reasons for the total cropland heterogeneity changes were urbanization, restoration of cropland to forest, and some government land-use policies. Moreover, this study evaluates the effectiveness of cropland policies influencing in Northeast China.

TI  - The Value of Prehospital Early Warning Scores to Predict in-Hospital Clinical Deterioration: A Multicenter, Observational Base-Ambulance Study
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Early warning scores are clinical tools capable of identifying prehospital patients with high risk of deterioration. We sought here to contrast the validity of seven early warning scores in the prehospital setting and specifically, to evaluate the predictive value of each score to determine early deterioration-risk during the hospital stay, including mortality at one, two, three and seven- days since the index event.Methods: A prospective multicenter observational based-ambulance study of patients treated by six advanced life support emergency services and transferred to five Spanish hospitals between October 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019. We collected demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables. Seven risk score were constructed based on the analysis of prehospital variables associated with death within one, two, three and seven days since the index event. The area under the receiver operating characteristics was used to determine the discriminant validity of each early warning score.Results: A total of 3,273 participants with acute diseases were accurately linked. The median age was 69 years (IQR, 54-81 years), 1,348 (41.1%) were females. The overall mortality rate for patients in the study cohort ranged from 3.5% for first-day mortality (114 cases), to 7% for seven-day mortality (228 cases). The scores with the best performances for one-day mortality were Vitalpac Early Warning Score with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.873 (95% CI: 0.81-0.9), for two-day mortality, Triage Early Warning Score with an AUROC of 0.868 (95% CI: 0.83-0.9), for three and seven-days mortality the Modified Rapid Emergency Medicine Score with an AUROC of 0.857 (0.82-0.89) and 0.833 (95% CI: 0.8-0.86). In general, there were no significant differences between the scores analyzed.Conclusions: All the analyzed scores have a good predictive capacity for early mortality, and no statistically significant differences between them were found. The National Early Warning Score 2, at the clinical level, has certain advantages. Early warning scores are clinical tools that can help in the complex decision-making processes during critical moments, so their use should be generalized in all emergency medical services.

TI  - Extending Estimates of Tree and Tree Species Presence-Absence through Space and Time Using Landsat Composites
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a methodology for extending estimates of the presence-absence of trees and several tree species contained in the Canadian National Forest Inventory using nationally consistent Landsat data products. For a prototype boreal forest region of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, we modeled and assessed changes in the presence-absence of trees and tree species distributions over a 25-year period. Random Forest models of presence-absence of trees had an overall classification accuracy of 0.87 +/- 0.019. For five tree species, overall classification accuracies were: 0.74 +/- 0.017 for balsam fir; 0.75 +/- 0.028 for black spruce; 0.64 +/- 0.085 for trembling aspen; 0.64 +/- 0.035 for tamarack; and 0.77 +/- 0.041 for white birch. While the proportion of treed area increased by 8.5% over the 25-year period, the area occupied by black spruce declined by 13.5%. The area of balsam fir and white birch increased by 9.9% and 28.2%, respectively, while trembling aspen and tamarack changed by less than 5%. The map products developed and trends observed offer baseline information in support of long-term monitoring of treed area and tree species distributions. The demonstrated methods encourage development of spatially-explicit map products to complement spatially or temporally limited forest inventory datasets.

TI  - Global chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration estimation from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer using convolutional neural networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of global chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration from the large remote sensing data in a timely manner is crucial for supporting various applications. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) is one of the most widely used earth observation data sources, which has the characteristics of global coverage, high spectral resolution, and short revisit period. So the estimation of global Chla concentration from MODIS imagery in a fast and accurate manner is significant. Nevertheless, the estimation of Chla concentration from MODIS using traditional machine learning approaches is challenging due to their limited modeling capability to capture the complex relationship between MODIS spatial-spectral observations and the Chla concentration, and also their low computational efficiency to address large MODIS data in a timely manner. We, therefore, explore the potential of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for Chla concentration estimation from MODIS imagery. The Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) Chla concentration image is used as ground truth because it is a well-recognized Chla concentration product that is produced by assimilating different satellite data through a complex data processing steps. A total of 12 monthly OC-CCI global Chla concentration maps and the associated MODIS images are used to investigate the CNN approach using a cross-validation approach. The classical machine learning approach, i.e., the supported vector regression (SVR), is used to compare with the proposed CNN approach. Comparing with the SVR, the CNN performs better with the mean log root-mean-square error and R 2 of being 0.129 and 0.901, respectively, indicating that using the MODIS images alone, the CNN approach can achieve results that is close to the OC-CCI Chla concentration images. These results demonstrate that CNNs may provide Chla concentration images that are reliable, stable and timely, and as such CNN constitutes a useful technique for operational Chla concentration estimation from large MODIS data.

TI  - Short-term forecasting of regional biospheric CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in Europe using a light-use-efficiency model (VPRM, MPI-BGC version 1.2)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasting atmospheric CO2 concentrations on synoptic timescales (similar to days) can benefit the planning of field campaigns by better predicting the location of important gradients. One aspect of this, accurately predicting the day-to-day variation in biospheric fluxes, poses a major challenge. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using a diagnostic light-use-efficiency model, the Vegetation Photosynthesis Respiration Model (VPRM), to forecast biospheric CO2 fluxes on the timescale of a few days. As input, the VPRM model requires downward shortwave radiation, 2m temperature, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and land surface water index (LSWI), both of which are calculated from MODIS reflectance measurements. Flux forecasts were performed by extrapolating the model input into the future, i.e., using downward shortwave radiation and temperature from a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, as well as extrapolating the MODIS indices to calculate future biospheric CO2 fluxes with VPRM. A hindcast for biospheric CO2 fluxes in Europe in 2014 has been done and compared to eddy covariance flux measurements to assess the uncertainty from different aspects of the forecasting system. In total the range-normalized mean absolute error (normalized) of the 5 d flux forecast at daily timescales is 7.1 %, while the error for the model itself is 15.9 %. The largest forecast error source comes from the meteorological data, in which error from shortwave radiation contributes slightly more than the error from air temperature. The error contribution from all error sources is similar at each flux observation site and is not significantly dependent on vegetation type.

TI  - Rio Doce State Park buffer zone: forest fragmentation and land use dynamics
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The investigation of land use changes by anthropic processes, spatially and temporally, is a fundamental tool to establish correlations between landscape patterns and processes and management of the buffer zone of Conservation Units. This study aimed to analyze the forest fragmentation and land use dynamics in the buffer zone of the Rio Doce State Park (PERD), located in Minas Gerais, Brazil, for the year 2015. Its buffer zone was delimited to a radius of 10 km, covering a total area of 128.893,36 ha. Land use classification was based on Landsat 8 image, orbit 217, point 73 and 74, and two types of ecosystems were identified: natural and anthropic. In the thematic mapping, the pressure of the anthropic use over the natural was notified, as well as the high number of forest fragments, which is a negative impact on the resilience required for the conservation of biodiversity and the local Atlantic forest. The fragments have different shapes and sizes and are distributed throughout the buffer zone of the PERD. There is a need to adopt conservation strategies, such as environmental education, reforestation techniques, recovery of degraded areas and ecological corridors. Even with a worrying current scenario, this finding makes it possible to establish an optimistic point for biodiversity conservation, associated with a tendency to reduce the forces of direct changes on natural systems.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of urban growth on forest and agricultural land using geospatial techniques and Shannon entropy method in the satellite town of Ethiopia, the western fringe of Addis Ababa city
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid conversion of conserved land and cropland to non-agricultural purposes is threatening the ecological areas and dominant agricultural activities that are the main sources of livelihood in urban fringe areas of Addis Ababa City. The combinations of government policy, socioeconomic, demographic dynamics, and biophysical triggers have driven such transformation. However, the recent fast urban expansion and infrastructural development could have accelerated the severity and rate at which urban growth impacts the ecosystem and fertile agricultural land. Yet, little attention is given about their impacts on forest and farming communities in the western fringe areas of Addis Ababa during the recent past. This study, therefore, aimed at quantifying and analyzing the trends of the urban growth and its impacts on flora and agricultural land in Sebeta-Awas town using an integrated GIS tool, remote sensing technique, and Shannon entropy method. Landsat TM of 1986, ETM+ of 2002, and OLI of 2019 were used to produce land use/land cover (LULC) classes. Object-based classification technique was carried out to generate the LULC and to measure the changes in the urban land-use class within the satellite town in the year 1986, 2002, and 2019. Shannon entropy method was applied to model study area's urban sprawl, growth trend, and spatial change. Over the past three decades (1986-2019), Sebeta-Awas town has experienced severe urban sprawl following lack of proper development control and management. The annual urban growth rates of 1.2, 5.5, and similar to 15% for the periods of 1986, 2002, and 2019, respectively were obtained mainly at the expenses of agricultural land (25.48%) and forest land (16.6%), catalyzed urban sprawl which finally led to serious deforestation and reduction in rural farmland. The findings indicate that the average of entropy index increased from 0.02 in the year 1986 to 0.996 in the year 2019, indicating more dispersed urban growth to the outskirts, and spatially indicating anticlockwise shifting. In this regard, more than 90.2% of forest loss due to agricultural encroachment, built-up area expansion, and construction was widely observed in Sebeta and Alem Gena areas, of course, Northeast zone in this study. It is concluded that deforestation and continual evacuation of farming communities in the urban fringe areas due to rapid urban expansion in the name of investment and infrastructural development is expected to be worsened in the near future unless strong policy revision and management actions are undertaken.

TI  - Meningoencephalitis, coronary artery and keratitis as an onset of brucellosis: a case report
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundBrucellosis is a zoonotic disease caused by brucella. It has been an increasing trend in recent years (Wang H, Xu WM, Zhu KJ, Zhu SJ, Zhang HF, Wang J, Yang Y, Shao FY, Jiang NM, Tao ZY, Jin HY, Tang Y, Huo LL, Dong F, Li ZJ, Ding H, Liu ZG, Emerg Microbes Infect 9:889-99, 2020). Brucellosis is capable to invade multiple systems throughout the body, lacking in typical clinical manifestations, and easily misdiagnosed and mistreated.Case presentationWe report a case of a male, 5-year-and-11-month old child without relevant medical history, who was admitted to hospital for 20days of fever. When admitted to the hospital, we found that he was enervated, irritable and sleepy, accompanied with red eyes phenomenon. After anti-infection treatment with meropenem, no improvement observed. Lumbar puncture revealed normal CSF protein, normal cells, and negative culture. Later, doppler echocardiography suggested coronary aneurysms, and incomplete Kawasaki Disease with coronary aneurysms was proposed. The next day, brucellosis agglutination test was positive. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of cerebrospinal fluid suggested B.melitensis, which was confirmed again by blood culture. The child was finally diagnosed as brucellosis with meningocephalitis, coronary aneurysm and keratitis. According to our preliminary research and review, such case has never been reported in detail before. After diagnosis confirmation, the child was treated with rifampicin, compound sulfamethoxazole, and ceftriaxone for cocktail anti-infection therapy. Aspirin and dipyridamole were also applied for anticoagulant therapy. After medical treatment, body temperature of the child has reached normal level, eye symptoms alleviated, and mental condition gradually turned normal. Re-examination of the doppler echocardiographic indicated that the coronary aneurysm was aggravated, so warfarin was added for amplification of anticoagulation treatment. At present, 3months of follow-up, the coronary artery dilatation gradually assuaged, and the condition is continued to alleviate.ConclusionBrucellosis can invade nervous system, coronary artery, and cornea. Brucellosis lacks specific signs for clinical diagnosis. The traditional agglutination test and the new mNGS are convenient and effective, which can provide the reference for clinical diagnosis.

AB  - Historic natural sanctuaries are an important part of the cultural heritage and play an important role in the creation of (religious) identity as well as in cultural history in general. In addition to intangible, material and natural values, they also contain historical, archaeological, religious as well as folklore, ethnological and environmental values. We can argue that natural sanctuaries and related discourse (s) are one of the most interesting ways and means of understanding the religious worldview of the culture and people around us, and that natural sanctuaries become an integral part of human oral and written history. In the article, I give an overview of the discourse related to natural sanctuaries as traditional monuments in Estonia in the 21st century.

AB  - A small subset of cutaneous melanomas harbor oncogenic gene fusions, which could potentially serve as therapeutic targets for patients with advanced disease as novel therapies are developed. Fusions involvingRAF1are exceedingly rare in melanocytic neoplasms, occurring in less than 1% of melanomas, and usually arise in tumors that are wild type forBRAF,NRAS, andNF1. We describe herein a case of acral melanoma with two satellite metastases and sentinel lymph node involvement. The melanoma had a concomitantKITvariant andLRRFIP2-RAF1fusion. This constellation of molecular findings has not been reported previously in melanoma. We review the existing literature on melanocytic neoplasms withRAF1fusions and discuss the potential clinical implications of this genetic event.

TI  - Changing spring snow cover dynamics and early season forage availability affect the behavior of a large carnivore
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changing climates are altering wildlife habitats and wildlife behavior in complex ways. Here, we examine how changing spring snow cover dynamics and early season forage availability are altering grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) behavior postden emergence. Telemetry data were used to identify spring activity dates for 48 individuals in the Yellowhead region of Alberta, Canada. Spring activity date was related to snow cover dynamics using a daily percent snow cover dataset. Snow melt end date, melt rate, and melt consistency explained 45% of the variation in spring activity date. We applied this activity date model across the entire Yellowhead region from 2000 to 2016 using simulated grizzly bear home ranges. Predicted spring activity date was then compared with a daily spring forage availability date dataset, resulting in "wait time" estimates for four key early season forage species. Temporal changes in both spring activity date and early season forage "wait times" were assessed using non-parametric regression. Grizzly bear activity date was found to have either remained constant (95%) or become earlier (5%) across the study area; virtually no areas with significantly later spring activity dates were detected. Similarly, the majority of "wait times" did not change (85%); however, the majority of significant changes in "wait times" for the four early season forage species indicated that "wait times" were lessening where changes were detected. Our results show that spring activity date is largely dictated by snow melt characteristics and that changing snow melt conditions may result in earlier spring activity. However, early season food stress conditions are likely to remain unchanged or improve as vegetation phenology also becomes earlier. Our findings extend the recent work examining animal movement in response to changing phenology from migratory birds and ungulates to an apex predator, further demonstrating the potential effects of changing climates on wildlife species.

TI  - Langerhans cell sarcoma involving skin and showing epidermotropism: A comprehensive review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Langerhans cell sarcoma (LCS) is rare and aggressive; patients have an overall survival rate of less than 50%. We present a 62-year-old man with a history of superficial spreading melanoma of the upper back with sentinel lymph node metastasis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and LCS. The patient presented with erythematous papules and scaly areas on his face, neck, arms, chest, abdomen, and legs. A skin biopsy revealed a proliferation of large neoplastic cells involving the dermis and with epidermotropism. These cells had atypical bean-shaped nuclei, with ample cytoplasm and abundant mitotic figures including atypical forms. Immunohistochemical studies showed the tumor to be diffusely positive for CD1a, S100 protein, and langerin (CD207) and negative for melanocytic markers. Some tumor cells were positive for cyclin D1. A diagnosis of LCS involving the skin was established. The present study is a very unusual case of LCS showing epidermotropism. The patient's history of metastatic melanoma posed additional challenges for diagnosis, underlying the need of immunophenotyping in these cases. Consensus for optimal standard therapy has not been established in LCS, and thus, early recognition is important since these neoplasms tend to recur and metastasize. LCS in skin is discussed and published cases are comprehensively reviewed.

TI  - Clinical significance of extranodal extension in sentinel lymph node positive breast cancer
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The precise stage of lymph node (LN) metastasis is a strong prognostic factor in breast cancers, and sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first station of nodal metastasis. A number of patients have extranodal extension (ENE) in SLN, whereas the clinical values of ENE in SLN in breast cancers are still in exploration. The aim of our study was to evaluate the predictive and prognostic values of ENE in SLN in breast cancers, and to investigate the feasibility of ENE to predict non-SLN metastasis, nodal burden, disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in clinical practice. 266 cases of primary invasive breast cancer (cT1-2N0 breast cancer) underwent SLN biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) between 2008 and 2015 were extracted from the pathology database of Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. ENE in SLN was defined as extension of neoplastic cells through the lymph-nodal capsule into the peri-nodal adipose tissue, and was classified as no larger than 2 mm and larger than 2 mm group. The associations between ENE and clinicopathological features, non-SLN metastasis, nodal burden, DFS, and OS were analyzed. In the 266 patients with involved SLN, 100(37.6%) were positive for ENE in SLN. 67 (25.2%) cases had ENE no larger than 2 mm in diameter, and 33(12.4%) had ENE larger than 2 mm. Among the clinicopathological characteristics, the presence of ENE in SLN was associated with higher pT and pN stages, PR status, lympho-vascular invasion. Logistic regression analysis indicated that patients with ENE in SLN had higher rate of non-SLN metastasis (OR4.80, 95% CI 2.47-9.34, P<0.001). Meanwhile, in patients with SLN micrometastasis or 1-2 SLNs involvement, ENE positive patients had higher rate of non-SLN metastasis, comparing with ENE negative patients (P<0.001, P=0.004 respectively). The presence of ENE in SLN was correlated with nodal burden, including the pattern and number of involved SLN (P<0.001, P<0.001 respectively), the number of involved non-SLN and total positive LNs (P<0.001, P<0.001 respectively). Patients with ENE had significantly higher frequency of pN2 disease (P<0.001). For the disease recurrence and survival status, Cox regression analysis showed that patients with ENE in SLN had significantly reduced DFS (HR 3.05, 95%CI 1.13-10.48, P=0.008) and OS (HR 3.34, 95%CI 0.74-14.52, P=0.092) in multivariate analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test showed that patients with ENE in SLN had lower DFS and OS (for DFS: P<0.001; and for OS: P<0.001 respectively). Whereas no significant difference was found in nodal burden between ENE<less than or equal to>2 mm and>2 mm groups, except the number of SLN metastasis was higher in patients with ENE>2 mm. Cox regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test indicated that the size of ENE was not an independent factor of DFS and OS. Our study indicated that ENE in SLN was a predictor for non-SLN metastasis, nodal burden and prognosis in breast cancers. Patients with ENE in SLN had a higher rate of non-SLN metastasis, higher frequency of pN2 disease, and poorer prognosis. Patients with ENE in SLN may benefit from additional ALND, even in SLN micrometastasis or 1-2 SLNs involvement patients. The presence of ENE in SLN should be evaluated in clinical practice. Size of ENE which was classified by a 2 mm cutoff value had no significant predictive and prognostic values in this study. The cutoff values of ENE in SLN need further investigation.

TI  - Inflammasome activation by<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>'sExlApore-forming toxin is detrimental for the host
T2  - CELLULAR MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - During acutePseudomonas aeruginosainfection, the inflammatory response is essential for bacterial clearance. Neutrophil recruitment can be initiated following the assembly of an inflammasome within sentinel macrophages, leading to activation of caspase-1, which in turn triggers macrophage pyroptosis and IL-1 beta/IL-18 maturation. Inflammasome formation can be induced by a number of bacterial determinants, including Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) or pore-forming toxins, or, alternatively, by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via caspase-11 activation. Surprisingly, previous studies indicated that a T3SS-induced inflammasome increased pathogenicity in mouse models ofP. aeruginosainfection. Here, we investigated the immune reaction of mice infected with a T3SS-negativeP. aeruginosastrain (IHMA879472). Virulence of this strain relies on ExlA, a secreted pore-forming toxin. IHMA879472 promoted massive neutrophil infiltration in infected lungs, owing to efficient priming of toll-like receptors, and thus enhanced the expression of inflammatory proteins including pro-IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. However, mature-IL-1 beta and IL-18 were undetectable in wild-type mice, suggesting that ExlA failed to effectively activate caspase-1. Nevertheless, caspase-1/11 deficiency improved survival following infection with IHMA879472, as previously described for T3SS+ bacteria. We conclude that the detrimental effect associated with the ExlA-induced inflammasome is probably not due to hyperinflammation, rather it stems from another inflammasome-dependent process.

TI  - Management of the positive sentinel lymph node in the post-MSLT-II era
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives The publication of MSLT-II shifted recommendations for management of sentinel lymph node biopsy positive (SLNB+) melanoma to favor active surveillance. We examined trends in immediate completion lymph node dissection (CLND) following publication of MSLT-II. Methods Using a prospective melanoma database at a high-volume center, we identified a cohort of consecutive SLNB+ patients from July 2016 to April 2019. Patient and disease characteristics were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression to examine factors associated with CLND. Results Two hundred and thirty-five patients were included for analysis. CLND rates were 67%, 33%, and 26% for the year before, year after, and second-year following MSLT-II. Factors associated with undergoing CLND included primary located in the head and neck (59% vs 33%,P = .003 and odds ratio [OR], 5.22,P = .002) and higher sentinel node tumor burden (43% vs 10% for tumor burden >= 0.1 mm,P < .001 and OR, 8.64,P = .002). Conclusions Rates of CLND in SLNB+ melanoma decreased dramatically, albeit not uniformly, following MSLT-II. Factors that increased the likelihood of immediate CLND were primary tumor located in the head and neck and high sentinel node tumor burden. These groups were underrepresented in MSLT-II, suggesting that clinicians are wary of implementing active surveillance recommendations for patients perceived as higher risk.

TI  - Contribution of Substance Use in Acute Injuries With Regards to the Intent, Nature and Context of Injury: A CHIRPP Database Study
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionUsing the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) sentinel surveillance system, the objective of this study was to compare intent, circumstances, injury type and patient demographics in patients who used a substance prior to the injury versus those who did not use any substances.MethodsData were retrospectively collected from November 1st 2016 to October 31st 2017. All patients presenting to the Hopital de l'Enfant-Jesus ED following trauma were included, aside from those who left without seeing a physician or had no physical injury (e.g., overdose without any trauma was excluded). Patients voluntarily completed a standardised form or agreed to be contacted later. Medical charts of all attendances were reviewed by the CHIRPP's program coordinator. Substance use included illicit drugs, medications for recreational purposes, alcohol or other used either by the patient or another person involved.ResultsA total of 12,857 patients were included. Substance use was involved in 701 (5.5%) cases and was associated with injuries sustained by males (p<.001). The mean age of patients injured while using substances was 42.8 years, compared to 45.5 years in those who did not use substances (p<.001). Substance use was involved in 3.6% of unintentional injuries, compared to 26.2% of injuries intentionally inflicted by other and 38.9% for self-inflicted injuries (p<0.0001). When substances were used, the odds of intentional injuries were 7.5 times greater compared to non-intentional injuries (95% CI 6.7, 8.5). Burns, head injuries and polytraumas were more prevalent when drugs or alcohol were involved.ConclusionThis study outlines the significant contribution of substance use in intentional injuries, suggesting that it could potentially be beneficial to specifically target patients who present with deliberate physical injuries in preventive and therapeutic interventions offered in the ED.

TI  - Detection of Coral Reefs Degradation using Geospatial Techniques around Saint Martin's Island, Bay of Bengal
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Saint Martin's is a unique island located in the Bay of Bengal where coral species are abundant due to its favorable and unique environmental conditions. Coral communities are in great danger due to global climate change, direct commercial coral extraction and unplanned tourism around the island. The present study attempts to identify the coral zone and mapping of coral reefs from the period of 1980 to 2018. The study utilized five sets of multi-temporal Landsat satellite images to examine the changes of coral reefs in Saint Martin's Island during the study timeframe. Geospatial and image processing software was used for spatial coral colony mapping and data analysis. Satellite images processed to remove water depth impacts and supervised classification technique using the maximum likelihood decision rule suggested the spatial change of coral colonies over time. The result of the study indicates that coral colonies decreased steadily throughout the study period. A total area of 0.9342 km(2)of coral colonies disappeared during the study period from 1980 to 2018. Field observations around Saint Martin's Island indicates that destruction of coral reef habitat was basically caused by anthropogenic activities like tourism and extraction of coral by fisherman. Analysis of the historical data regarding tourism, population and households, and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) along with field observations of these parameter during 2018, suggests that anthropogenic factors are more significant than natural factors for causing coral reef degradation. It is very crucial to raise consciousness not only in the vicinity of Saint Martin's Island but more widely regarding the significance of the biodiversity of the Island.

AB  - Framed by the concept of biculturalism this study explores how 26 Multiracial faculty members form and use biculturalism to navigate an academy steeped in monoculturalism, or the belief that all people should conform to a dominant white westernized worldview. Findings from this study suggest that many Multiracial faculty members form and use a unique form of biculturalism, borderlands biculturalism, to navigate postsecondary contexts. Study findings encourage the expansion of binary understandings of biculturalism, support the retention and success of a growing Multiracial faculty population in U.S. higher education, and guide implications for institutional transformation.

TI  - Impacts of nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 outbreak on air quality in Bangladesh: a spatiotemporal analysis
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In Bangladesh, a nationwide lockdown was imposed on 26 March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to restricted emissions, it was hypothesized that the air quality has been improved during lockdown throughout the country. The study is intended to assess the impact of nationwide lockdown measures on air quality in Bangladesh. We analyzed satellite data for four different air pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO, and O-3) to assess the changes in the atmospheric concentrations of pollutants in major cities as well as across the country. In this study, the concentrations of NO2, SO2, CO, and O(3)from 1 February to 30 May of the year 2019 and 2020 were analyzed. The average SO(2)and NO(2)concentrations were decreased by 43 and 40%, respectively, while tropospheric O(3)were found to be increased with a maximum of > 7%. Among the major cities, Dhaka, Gazipur, Chattogram, and Narayanganj were found to be more influenced by the restricted emissions. In Dhaka, NO(2)and SO(2)concentrations were decreased approximately by 69 and 67%, respectively. Our analysis reveals that NO(2)concentrations are highly correlated with the regional COVID-19 cases (r= 0.74). The study concludes that the lockdown measures significantly reduced air pollution because of reduced vehicular and industrial emissions in Bangladesh.

TI  - African-Centered Frameworks of Youth Development: Nuanced Implications for Guiding Social Work Practice with Black Youth
T2  - CHILD AND ADOLESCENT SOCIAL WORK JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Literature within social work on African-centered frameworks that can be used to inform research and social work practice has remained limited. Often discussion of African centered frameworks relies solely on broad, generalized models of the African centered worldview. Such limited discussion of African-centered approaches is problematic as it discounts both the diversity of African perspectives of human development, and limits the exploration of models from an African perspective, which may be a more appropriate and effective approach to working with Black youth populations. To assist in addressing this gap within social work literature, the current article critically compares the human developmental schemes of three indigenous African worldviews, and identifies potential implications for positive youth development. The process of assessing and comparing each respective worldview through the perspective of youth development yields insights that are important for both theory and practice. The paper also provides implications for African-centered program development, particularly in considering the need to acknowledge the intersectionality of Black youth identities.

TI  - Investigating the Effect of Lockdown During COVID-19 on Land Surface Temperature: Study of Dehradun City, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban environment imposes challenges due to its dynamics and thermodynamic characteristics of the built environment. The present study aims to study the effect of lockdown during COVID-19 on the spatio-temporal land surface temperature (LST) patterns in Dehradun city. The TIRS sensor data of 14 April 2020 (post-lockdown), 28 April 2019, 25 April 2018 and 08 May 2017 were downloaded, and LST was retrieved using radiative transfer equation. The wardwise change in LST, urban hot spots and thermal comfort was studied as a function of built-up density. It was observed that there was an overall decrease in LST values in Dehradun city in post-COVID lockdown period. Wards with high built-up density had minimum decrease in LST; on the contrary, wards with large proportion of open spaces and having low, medium built-up density had the maximum decrease in LST. Hot spot analysis was carried out using Getis Ord GI* statistic, and the level of thermal comfort was found using the urban thermal field variance index. It was observed that there was an increase in number of hot spots accompanied by a decrease in thermal comfort level post-lockdown. The methodology proposed in the present study can be applied to other Indian cities which exhibit similar growth patterns and will provide a tool for rational decision making.

TI  - Estimation of Total Dissolved Solids in Water Bodies by Spectral Indices Case Study: Shatt al-Arab River
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the problem of rising salinity levels in the Shatt al-Arab river in southern Iraq has been repeated, which has directly affected the living and health situation and the agricultural activity of these areas. Six sampling stations were selected along Shatt al-Arab to estimate the concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS) in the river; these stations included the following: Qurna, Labani, City Centre, Kateban, Corniche, and Sihan. In addition, three Landsat-8 satellite images which were taken at the same time as collected samples also used for detecting the salinity in the river. After processing of atmospheric correction and inserted remote sensing indices, the reflectance of water extracted from satellite images was used to express the spectral characteristics of different TDS concentrations. Correlation and regression were used to obtain accurate models for detecting the salinity depending on the spectral reflectance of Landsat 8 operational land image OLI. The results presented Pearson correlation (r) value of 0.70, 0.97, and 0.71, and correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.56, 0.94, and 0.85 between field data with spectral data of salinity index 2 (SI-2) derived from the green and blue bands of Landsat obtained in 2015, 2017, and 2018 respectively. In conclusion, remote sensing and GIS technologies coupled with spectral modeling are useful tools for providing a solution of future water resources planning and management, and also offer great undertaking as a means to improve knowledge of water quality and support water decision making.

TI  - Analysis of waves observed by synthetic aperture radar across ocean fronts
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging of waves across ocean fronts was investigated using C-band Sentinel-1 VV-polarized SAR imagery collected over the Yangtze and the Zhujiang estuaries. The presence of ocean fronts in the study area was confirmed by collocated sea surface temperature (SST) data provided by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and sea surface current information from the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP) based on the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). The experimental results revealed that as the current speed increased, the cut-off wavelength (lambda(c)) increased as well. The effect of the increasing azimuth cut-off wavelength, however, was relatively weak in terms of variations of the normalized radar cross-section (NRCS), i.e., it was within 2 dB for lambda(c) <= 60 m. Hence, it was weaker than the NRCS variation related to SST. Larger NRCS variations (i.e., within 5 dB) occurred for lambda(c)values up to 120 m. In addition, the experimental results also demonstrated that the parameterized first-guess spectrum method (PFSM) wave retrieval performance was affected by ocean fronts. In particular, overestimations occurred when ocean fronts were present and lambda(c)was < 100 m.

TI  - Satellite imagery and spectral matching for improved estimation of calcium carbonate and iron oxide abundance in mine areas
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study attempts grade-wise mapping in a limestone mine in Ariyalur, Southern India, and in the iron ore mines of Noamundi, Eastern India. After noise removal in the Sentinel 2A (multispectral) and EO-1 Hyperion (hyperspectral) image datasets, spectral matching is performed using the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance, Spectral Correlation Mapper (SCM), and combined JM-SCM measure. Due to the specific absorption spectra for carbonates (1900 nm, 2000 nm, and 2160 nm) and iron oxide (865 nm), it is possible to identify and map such mineral deposits using the multispectral dataset (Sentinel 2A) and hyperspectral dataset (EO-1 Hyperion) respectively. The grade-wise mapping of carbonate in the Ariyalur mine using the Sentinel 2A dataset by the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) approach and Spectral Correlation Mapper (SCM) yieldedR(2)values of 0.44 and 0.77 respectively, whereas the combined JM-SCM approach resulted in a higher correlation with anR(2)value of 0.87. The grade-wise mapping of iron oxide in Noamundi using the EO-1 Hyperion dataset by the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) approach and the Spectral Correlation Mapper (SCM) approach yieldedR(2)values of 0.15 and 0.76, respectively, whereas the combined JM-SCM approach resulted in a higher correlation with anR(2)value of 0.90. Such an improved performance of the combined approach is primarily due to the simultaneous and effective utilization of band-wise information (by JM) and correlation aspects (by SCM) of the reference and target spectra considered in the matching algorithm. Thus, in this study, the proposed algorithm proved its compatibility and utility in extracting information on mineral abundance distribution for mine areas.

TI  - Comparison of Six Machine Learning Methods for Estimating PM2.5 Concentration Using the Himawari-8 Aerosol Optical Depth
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of the PM2.5 concentration based on satellite remote sensing is currently a hot topic for research, with machine learning algorithms starting to be applied to the estimation model. However, there are few comparisons between different machine learning algorithms, and few scholars objectively evaluate the estimation performance of machine learning algorithms under different weather conditions. In this study, PM2.5 concentration was estimated by six commonly used machine learning algorithms, and their performances were compared in four different weather conditions in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. The results showed that decision tree and random forest consistently performed well in different weather conditions, while SVM performed poorly. When the PM2.5 concentration was greater than 150 mu g/m(3), the R and RMSE values for decision tree were 0.854 and 31.53 mu g/m(3), respectively, while the evaluation coefficient of SVM algorithm was only 0.597 and 49.31 mu g/m(3), it was worth noting that all algorithms performed better in this interval than in others. This study also focused on the development of an optimal combination algorithm to estimate PM2.5 concentration under different weather conditions and got a good application effect. The results of this research may provide a theoretical basis and an important reference for the application of machine learning algorithms in the field of remote sensing.

TI  - Mix-up of Skin Biopsies as a Fully Controllable Risk
T2  - AKTUELLE DERMATOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - A dermatologist performed biopsies on a patient because of suspicious skin changes on the right shoulder and in the neck area. The pathology report revealed an advanced and ulcerated invasive superficial spreading malignant melanoma (SSM) for the right shoulder and an advanced solid adenoidal basal cell carcinoma for the neck area. The patient then underwent surgery under general anesthesia on the shoulder (re-excision with a safety margin of 2cm and axillary sentinel lymphonodectomy). Since the patient suspected at this point that the tissue samples taken previously had been mixed up, a re-biopsy in the neck area was performed at his express request. While the excision in the shoulder area was tumor-free, the re-biopsy in the neck confirmed the detection of malignant melanoma tumor cells and thus his suspicion of mix-up of the biopsy specimen. The regional court upheld his claim for damages for pain and suffering and held that the confusion-proof storage, labelling and dispatch of tissue samples taken from patients is a so-called fully controllable risk. A reversal of the burden of proof applies to fully controllable risks, i.e. a physician must prove that there was no treatment error. In order to avoid mix-ups of dermatopathological specimen, all process steps of biopsy taking, dispatch and processing should be analysed and recorded in a quality management document.

TI  - Spatial and temporal gradients in the rate of dust deposition and aerosol optical thickness in southwestern Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The southwestern Iran is one of the regions that are most prone to dust events. The objective of this study is the analysis of the spatial and temporal distributions of dust deposition rate as a key factor for finding the relative impact of the dust. First, the monthly mean aerosol optical thickness (AOT) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was analyzed and compared with the dust amount variations from ground deposition rate (GDR), and the results were further used to investigate the spatial and temporal distributions of dust events in southwestern Iran for the period between 2014 and 2015. Moving air mass trajectories, using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, were proven to be a discriminator of their local and regional origin. The results from GDR analysis produced a correlation coefficient between dust event history and deposition rates at dust magnitudes of >0.93 that is meaningful at the 95% confidence level. Furthermore, the deposition rates varied from 3 g/m(2)per month in summer to 10 g/m(2)per month in spring and gave insight into the transport direction of the dust. Within the same time series, AOT correspondences with MODIS on Terra in four aerosol thickness layers (clean, thin, thick, and strong thick) were shown in relation to each other. The deepest mixed layers were observed in spring and summer with a thickness of approximately 3500 m above ground level in the study area. Investigations of ground-based observations were correlated with the same variations for each aerosol thickness layer from MODIS images and they can be applied to discriminate layers of aeolian dust from layers of other aerosols. Together, dust distribution plots from AOT participated to enhance mass calculations and estimation deposition rates from the thick and strong thick aerosol thickness layers using the results from GDR. Despite all the advances of AOT, under certain circumstances, ground-based observations are better able to represent aerosol conditions over the study area, which were tested in southwestern Iran, even though the low number of observations is a commonly acknowledged drawback of GDR.

TI  - Toward Snow Cover Estimation in Mountainous Areas Using Modern Data Assimilation Methods: A Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The snow cover is a key component of land surface hydrology, especially in mountain areas where it governs the amount and timing of water availability in downstream areas. It is involved in relevant climate feedbacks and natural hazards such as avalanches and floods. Monitoring and forecasting snow cover characteristics is challenging. While snow cover extent is relatively easy to retrieve from satellite data, remote sensing retrievals of the snow water equivalent (SWE) is often inaccurate, particularly in complex mountainous terrain. Model-based snow cover estimates, driven by meteorological data, often bear significant uncertainties due to both input data and model errors. Data assimilation can combine both approaches to improve SWE estimates. In this paper, we review current state-of-the-art data assimilation methodologies used to optimally combine measurements with snow cover models in order to reduce uncertainties. The suitability of a given data assimilation method varies with the numerical complexity of snow models as well as the availability and the type of observations. This review describes the issues and challenges associated with data assimilation applied to the mountain snow cover, providing recommendations for existing and upcoming monitoring and prediction systems of snow hydrology in mountainous regions.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of mosquito population density and community structure in Hainan Island, China
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMosquitoes are vectors of many tropical diseases. Understanding the ecology of local mosquito vectors, such as species composition, distributions, population dynamics, and species diversity is important for designing the optimal strategy to control the mosquito-borne diseases.MethodsEntomological surveillance of adult mosquitoes was conducted in five sites representing different ecological settings across Hainan Island from January to December of 2018 using BG Sentinel (BGS) traps and Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) light traps. In each site, we selected three areas representing urban, suburban and rural settings. Eighteen trap-days were sampled in each setting at each site, and CDC light traps and BGS traps were setup simultaneously. Mosquito species composition, distribution, population dynamics, and species diversity were analyzed. Mosquito densities were compared between different study sites and between different settings.ResultsNine species of mosquitoes belonging to four genera were identified. Culex quinquefasciatus (80.8%), Armigeres subalbatus (13.0%) and Anopheles sinensis (3.1%) were the top three species collected by CDC light traps; Cx. quinquefasciatus (91.9%), Ae. albopictus (5.1%), and Ar. subalbatus (2.8%) were the top three species collected by BGS traps. Predominant species varied among study sites. The population dynamics of Ae. albopictus, An. sinensis and Cx. quinquefasciatus showed clear seasonal variation regardless of study sites with a varied peak season for different species. Mosquito abundance of all species showed significant differences among different study sites and among urban, suburban and rural areas. Danzhou had the highest mosquito biodiversity, with an alpha, beta, and Gini-Simpson biodiversity index of 8, 1.13 and 0.42, respectively. BGS traps captured Aedes mosquito at a higher efficiency than CDC light traps, whereas CDC light traps captured significantly more Anopheles and Armigeres mosquitoes than BGS traps.ConclusionsMosquitoes were abundant on Hainan Island with clear seasonality and spatial heterogeneity. Population density, species composition, distribution, and species diversity were strongly affected by the natural environment. Different tools are required for the surveillance of different mosquito species.

TI  - Investigation of bovine abortion and stillbirth/perinatal mortality - similar diagnostic challenges, different approaches.
T2  - Irish veterinary journal
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - This pracademic paper reviews current bovine foetopathy (abortion and stillbirth) case definitions, reporting and triage, and causes and time-of-death and proposes veterinary practitioner-focused investigative standard operating procedures (SOPs). Issues of under- and over-triage and intra-institutional SOP harmonisation are also discussed. It is proposed that an 'observable abortion' (120-260days of gestation) is a more practitioner-friendly definition of abortion for reporting and benchmarking purposes and that the term 'peristillbirth' can replace stillbirth and perinatal mortality. Diagnosis of bovine foetopathy involves an investigative triad of the farmer, veterinary practitioner and the veterinary diagnostic laboratory. However, the poor sensitivity of abortion reporting undermines the value of currently adopted scanning/passive surveillance; parallel active surveillance/sentinel herd models should also be employed. The approach to abortion investigation differs from that of peristillbirth. The former should include collecting a herd and case history, examination and sampling of dam and cohorts and sampling of the foetus and placenta. A sample selection decision tree is provided to assist test selection. In peristillbirths, non-infectious and periparturient causes-of-death are more important hence the anamnesis must focus on peristillbirth risk factors and calving management. The foetopsy, while including the sampling menu appropriate to aborted foetuses, must also include a detailed internal and external examination of the carcass for lesions indicative of periparturient causes-of-death. In addition, for aborted foetuses the time-of-death is not important as the foetus is generally not viable; however, for the peristillbirth the time-of-death is critical as it provides useful information for the farmer to address modifiable risk factors and to alter their perinatal management. Reporting of the ultimate cause-of-death is more useful to prevent future abortions and peristillbirths though the proximate cause-of-death is often reported in the absence of a complete clinical anamnesis. Finally, the common reasons for diagnosis not reached (DNR) and the limitations of current investigative approaches are discussed.

TI  - A Review on Estimation of Particulate Matter from Satellite-Based Aerosol Optical Depth: Data, Methods, and Challenges
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Detailed, reliable, and continuous monitoring of aerosol optical depth (AOD) is essential for air quality management and protection of human health. The satellite-based AOD datasets have been typically used in many studies for the estimation of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) concentration in the tropospheric region. The prime focus of this study is to review the past studies to analyze the performance of various satellite-based AOD datasets and models used for PM estimation. The review results suggest that every satellite sensors data have some specific capabilities as well as some drawbacks. Multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) and visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) datasets showed better consistency in AOD and PM estimation in comparison to the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets. In the context of PM estimation models' accuracy, the mixed-effect model (MEM) has been extensively used and found to be more consistent in general, whereas, geographically weighted regression (GWR) model outperforms other statistical regression models in regional scale. Incorporation of land use parameters along with meteorological parameters improves the PM estimation accuracy at various spatial scale. The review suggests that in the near future, high resolution (spatial and temporal) satellite data with the improved algorithms will be highly appreciable for accurate estimation of AOD and PM.

TI  - Comparing prioritization strategies for delivering indoor residual spray (IRS) implementation, using a network approach
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIndoor residual spraying (IRS) is an effective method to control malaria-transmitting Anopheles mosquitoes and often complements insecticide-treated mosquito nets, the predominant malaria vector control intervention. With insufficient funds to cover every household, malaria control programs must balance the malaria risk to a particular human community against the financial cost of spraying that community. This study creates a framework for modelling the distance to households for targeting IRS implementation, and applies it to potential risk prioritization strategies in four provinces (Luapula, Muchinga, Eastern, and Northern) in Zambia.MethodsOptimal network models were used to assess the travel distance of routes between operations bases and human communities identified through remote sensing. Network travel distances were compared to Euclidean distances, to demonstrate the importance of accounting for road routes. The distance to reaching communities for different risk prioritization strategies were then compared assuming sufficient funds to spray 50% of households, using four underlying malarial risk maps: (a) predicted Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate in 2-10 years olds (PfPR), or (b) predicted probability of the presence of each of three main malaria transmitting anopheline vectors (Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles funestus, Anopheles gambiae).ResultsThe estimated one-way network route distance to reach communities to deliver IRS ranged from 0.05 to 115.69 km. Euclidean distance over and under-estimated these routes by -101.21 to 41.79 km per trip, as compared to the network route method. There was little overlap between risk map prioritization strategies, both at a district-by-district scale, and across all four provinces. At both scales, agreement for inclusion or exclusion from IRS across all four prioritization strategies occurred in less than 10% of houses. The distances to reaching prioritized communities were either lower, or not statistically different from non-prioritized communities, at both scales of strategy.ConclusionVariation in distance to targeted communities differed depending on risk prioritization strategy used, and higher risk prioritization did not necessarily translate into greater distances in reaching a human community. These findings from Zambia suggest that areas with higher malaria burden may not necessarily be more remote than areas with lower malaria burden.

TI  - Polypharmacy and frailty among persons with HIV
T2  - AIDS CARE-PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AIDS/HIV
M3  - Article
AB  - Polypharmacy is associated with frailty in the general population, but little is known about polypharmacy among persons living with HIV (PLWH) on antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. We determined the association between polypharmacy and an adapted frailty-related phenotype (aFRP) via a cross-sectional study in FY 2009 of 1762 PLWH on ARV with suppressed viral load and 2679 uninfected participants in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study. The primary predictor was number of chronic outpatient non-ARV medications using pharmacy fill/refill data. The outcome was self-report of four aFRP domains: shrinking, exhaustion, slowness, low physical activity. Frailty was defined as reporting 3-4 domains while pre-frailty was 1-2. Frailty was uncommon (2% PLWH, 3% uninfected); a larger proportion demonstrated any aFRP domain (31% PLWH, 41% uninfected). Among PLWH and uninfected, median chronic non-ARV medications was 6 and 16 respectively if having any aFRP domain, and 4 and 10 when without aFRP domains. In adjusted analyses, each additional chronic non-ARV medication conferred an 11% increased odds of having any aFRP domain in PLWH (OR [95% CI] = 1.11 [1.08, 1.14]), and a 4% increase in those uninfected (OR [95% CI] = 1.04 [1.03, 1.04]). The stronger association between polypharmacy and frailty in PLWH warrants further study and potential deprescribing of medications.

TI  - Flood susceptibility modeling in Teesta River basin, Bangladesh using novel ensembles of bagging algorithms
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The flooding in Bangladesh during monsoon season is very common and frequently happens. Consequently, people have been experiencing tremendous damage to properties, infrastructures, and human casualties. Usually, floods are one of the devastating disasters from nature, but for developing nations like Bangladesh, flooding becomes worse. Due to the dynamic and complex nature of the flooding, the prediction of flooding sites was usually very difficult for flood management. But the artificial intelligence and advanced remote sensing techniques together could predict and identify the possible sites, which are vulnerable to flooding. The present work aimed to predict and identify the flooding sites or flood susceptible zones in the Teesta River basin by employing state-of-the-art novel ensemble machine learning algorithms. We developed ensembles of bagging with REPtree, random forest (RF), M5P, and random tree (RT) algorithms for obtaining reliable and highly accurate results. Twelve factors, which are considered as the conditioning factors, and 413 current and former flooding points were identified for flooding susceptibility modelling. The Information Gain ratio statistical technique was utilized to determine the influence of the factors for flooding. We applied receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for validation of the flood susceptible models. The Freidman test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Kruskal-Wallis test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were applied together for the first time in flood susceptibility modelling to compare the models with each other. Results showed that more than 800 km(2)area was predicted as the very high flood susceptibility zones by all algorithms. The ROC curve showed that all models achieved more than 0.85 area under the curve indicating highly accurate flood models. For flood susceptibility modelling, the bagging with M5P performed superior, followed by bagging with RF, bagging with REPtree and bagging with RT. The methodology and solution-oriented results presented in this paper will assist the regional as well as local authorities and the policy-makers for mitigating the risks related to floods and also help in developing appropriate measures to avoid potential damages.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Political borders impact associations between habitat suitability predictions and resource availability
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context By linking species of conservation concern to their abiotic and biotic requirements, habitat suitability models (HSM) can assist targeted conservation measures. Yet, conservation measures may fail if HSM are unable to predict crucial resources. HSM are typically developed using remotely sensed land-cover classification data but not information on resources per se. Objectives While a certain land-cover class may correlate with crucial resources in the area of calibration, political boundaries can abruptly alter these associations. We investigate this potential discrepancy in a well-known study system highly relevant for farmland bird conservation. Methods We compared land cover, land-use intensity and resource availability between plots of highest habitat suitability for little owls (Athene noctua) among two neighbouring, but politically separated areas (i.e. south-western Germany vs. northern Switzerland). Results Land cover and land-use richness did not differ between German and Swiss plots. Yet there were marked differences in terms of land-use intensity and the availability of resources. Land-use intensity was significantly higher and resource availability lower in Swiss compared to German plots. Conclusions While accounting well for remotely sensed data such as land cover, HSM may fail to predict land-use intensity and resources across borders. The relationship between geodata used as proxies and ecologically relevant resources may differ according to history, policies and socio-cultural context, constraining the viability of HSM across political borders. This study emphasises the need for fine-scale resource assessments complementing landscape-scale suitability models. Conservation measures need to consider the availability of crucial resources and their socio-economic moderators to be effective.

TI  - Examining the link between vegetation leaf area and land-atmosphere exchange of water, energy, and carbon fluxes using FLUXNET data
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation regulates the exchange of water, energy, and carbon fluxes between the land and the atmosphere. This regulation of surface fluxes differs with vegetation type and climate, but the effect of vegetation on surface fluxes is not well understood. A better knowledge of how and when vegetation influences surface fluxes could improve climate models and the extrapolation of ground-based water, energy, and carbon fluxes. We aim to study the link between vegetation and surface fluxes by combining the yearly average MODIS leaf area index (LAI) with flux tower measurements of water (latent heat), energy (sensible heat), and carbon (gross primary productivity and net ecosystem exchange). We show that the correlation of the LAI with water and energy fluxes depends on the vegetation type and aridity. Under water-limited conditions, the link between the LAI and the water and energy fluxes is strong, which is in line with a strong stomatal or vegetation control found in earlier studies. In energy-limited forest we found no link between the LAI and water and energy fluxes. In contrast to water and energy fluxes, we found a strong spatial correlation between the LAI and gross primary productivity that was independent of vegetation type and aridity. This study provides insight into the link between vegetation and surface fluxes. It indicates that for modelling or extrapolating surface fluxes, the LAI can be useful in savanna and grassland, but it is only of limited use in deciduous broadleaf forest and evergreen needleleaf forest to model variability in water and energy fluxes.

TI  - Analyzing ice dynamics using Sentinel-1 data at the Solheimajokull Glacier, Iceland
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate in southern Iceland has warmed over the last 70 years, resulting in accelerated glacier dynamics at the Solheimajokull glacier. In this study, we compare glacier terminus locations from 1973 to 2018, to changes in climate across the study area, and we derive ice-surface velocities (2015-2018) from satellite remote-sensing imagery (Sentinel-1) using the offset-tracking method. There have been two regional temperature trends in the study period: cooling (1973-1979) and warming (1980-2018). Our results indicate a time lag of about 20 years between the onset of glacier retreat (-53 m/year since 2000) and the inception of the warming period. Seasonally, the velocity time series suggest acceleration during the summer melt season since 2016, whereas glacier velocities during accumulation months were constant. The highest velocities were observed at high elevations where the ice-surface slope is the steepest. We tested several scenarios to assess the hydrological time response to glacier accelerations, with the highest correlations being found between one and 30 days after the velocity estimates. Monthly correlation analyses indicated inter-annual and intra-annual variability in the glacier dynamics. Additionally, we investigate the linkage between glacier velocities and meltwater outflow parameters as they provide useful information about internal processes in the glacier. Velocity estimates positively correlate with water level and negatively correlate with water conductivity between April and August. There is also a disruption in the correlation trend between water conductivity and ice velocity in June, potentially due to a seasonal release of geothermal water.

TI  - Anticipating the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak was first declared an international public health, and it was later deemed a pandemic. In most countries, the COVID-19 incidence curve rises sharply over a short period of time, suggesting a transition from a disease-free (or low-burden disease) equilibrium state to a sustained infected (or high-burden disease) state. Such a transition is often known to exhibit characteristics of "critical slowing down." Critical slowing down can be, in general, successfully detected using many statistical measures, such as variance, lag-1 autocorrelation, density ratio, and skewness. Here, we report an empirical test of this phenomena on the COVID-19 datasets of nine countries, including India, China, and the United States. For most of the datasets, increases in variance and autocorrelation predict the onset of a critical transition. Our analysis suggests two key features in predicting the COVID-19 incidence curve for a specific country: (a) the timing of strict social distancing and/or lockdown interventions implemented and (b) the fraction of a nation's population being affected by COVID-19 at that time. Furthermore, using satellite data of nitrogen dioxide as an indicator of lockdown efficacy, we found that countries where lockdown was implemented early and firmly have been successful in reducing COVID-19 spread. These results are essential for designing effective strategies to control the spread/resurgence of infectious pandemics.

TI  - Influence of human activity on landslide susceptibility development in the Three Gorges area
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities are important factors that trigger frequent occurrences of landslides; thus, for landslide control, it is critical to determine the influence of human activity on landslide occurrence probability. The Three Gorges area is a region in the world that typically experiences serious landslide disasters and frequent human activities. The objective of this work is to employ the Three Gorges area as an example to reveal the impact of human activity on the dynamic development of landslide susceptibility from 2010 to 2019. Some new viewpoints are suggested for the five aspects: (1) High-precision landslide susceptibility maps are generated by a combination of multiresolution segmentation and convolutional neural network algorithms. Moreover, the dynamic development rules of landslide susceptibility from 2010 to 2019 are revealed. (2) The change in landslide susceptibility in the study area from 2010 to 2019 was mainly caused by the combined action of rainfall and human activity. The fluctuation of reservoir water level had a less influence on the development of landslide susceptibility. (3) Some human activities, especially road construction, farmland appropriation for building construction, agricultural reclamation, farmland cultivation and irrigation, initiation of commercial planting, urban expansion, and large-scale deforestation, may dramatically increase landslide occurrence probability. (4) Human activities, e.g., conversion of farmland to forestry, artificial recovery of natural vegetation, and later periods of artificial planting, may obviously reduce landslide susceptibility. (5) The human activity causes and mechanisms influencing landslide susceptibility in the study area are proposed, including transpiration and anchorage of plants, slope reinforcement by plant roots, destruction of slope stress equilibrium, and soil erosion.

TI  - Deep Learning for Air Quality Forecasts: a Review
T2  - CURRENT POLLUTION REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Air pollution is one of major environmental issues in the twenty-first century due to global industrialization and urbanization. Its mitigation necessitates accurate air quality forecasts. However, current state-of-the-art air quality forecasts are limited from highly uncertain chemistry-transport models (CTMs), shallow statistical methods, and heterogeneous and incomplete observing networks. Recently, deep learning has emerged as a general-purpose technology to extract complex knowledge using massive amount of data and very large networks of neurons and thus has the potential to break the limits of air quality forecasts. Here, we provide a brief review of recent attempts on using deep learning techniques in air quality forecasts. We first introduce architectures of deep networks (e.g., convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory neural networks, and spatiotemporal deep network) and their relevance to explore the nonlinear spatiotemporal features across multiple scales of air pollution. We then examine the potential of deep learning techniques for air quality forecasts in diverse aspects, namely, data gap filling, prediction algorithms, improvements of CTMs, estimations with satellite data, and source estimations for atmospheric dispersion forecasts. Finally, we point out some prospects and challenges for future attempts on improving air quality forecasts using deep learning techniques.

TI  - Impact of sentinel lymph-node biopsy and FDG-PET in staging and radiation treatment of anal cancer patients
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the role of sentinel lymph-node biopsy (SLNB) and FDG-PET in staging and radiation treatment (RT) of anal cancer patients. This retrospective study was performed on 80 patients (male: 32, female: 48) with a median age of 60 years (39-89 years) with anal squamous cell carcinoma who were treated from March 2008 to March 2018 at the IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital. Patients without clinical evidence of inguinal LNs metastases and/or with discordance between clinical evidence and imaging features were considered for SLNB. FDG-PET was performed in 69/80 patients. Patients with negative imaging in inguinal region and negative SLNB could avoid RT on groin to spare inguinal toxicity. CTV included GTV (primary tumour and positive LNs) and pelvic +/- inguinal LNs. PTV1 and PTV2 corresponded to GTV and CTV, respectively, adding 0.5 cm. RT dose was 50.4 Gy/28 fractions to PTV2 and 64.8 Gy/36 fractions to PTV1, delivered with 3DCRT (n=24) or IMRT (n=56), concomitant to Mitomycin-C and 5-FU chemotherapy. FDG-PET showed inguinal uptake in 21/69 patients (30%) and was negative in 48/69 patients (70%). Lymphoscintigraphy was performed in 11/21 positive patients (4 patients SLNB confirmed inguinal metastases, 6 patients false positive and 1 patient SLN not found), and in 29/48 negative patients (5/29 showed metastases, 23/29 true negative and 1 SLN not found). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of FDG-PET were 62%, 79%, 40% and 82%, respectively. Median follow-up time from diagnosis was 40.3 months (range: 4.6-136.4 months): 69 patients (86%) showed a complete response, 10 patients (13%) a partial response, 1 patient (1%) a stable disease. Patients treated on groin (n=54) versus not treated (n=26) showed more inguinal dermatitis (G1-G2: 50% vs. 12%; G3-G4: 17% vs. 0%, p<0.05). For patients treated on groin, G3-G4 inguinal dermatitis, stomatitis and neutropenia were significantly reduced with IMRT against 3DCRT techniques (13% vs. 36%, p=0.10; 3% vs. 36%, p=0.003; 8% vs. 29%, p=0.02, respectively). SLNB improves the FDG-PET inguinal LNs staging in guiding the decision to treat inguinal nodes. IMRT technique significantly reduced G3-G4 toxicities when patients are treated on groin.

TI  - Early Warning from Space for a Few Key Tipping Points in Physical, Biological, and Social-Ecological Systems
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this review paper, we explore latest results concerning a few key tipping elements of the Earth system in the ocean, cryosphere, and land realms, namely the Atlantic overturning circulation and the subpolar gyre system, the marine ecosystems, the permafrost, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and in terrestrial resource use systems. All these different tipping elements share common characteristics related to their nonlinear nature. They can also interact with each other leading to synergies that can lead to cascading tipping points. Even if the probability of each tipping event is low, they can happen relatively rapidly, involve multiple variables, and have large societal impacts. Therefore, adaptation measures and management in general should extend their focus beyond slow and continuous changes, into abrupt, nonlinear, possibly cascading, high impact phenomena. Remote sensing observations are found to be decisive in the understanding and determination of early warning signals of many tipping elements. Nevertheless, considerable research still remains to properly incorporate these data in the current generation of coupled Earth system models. This is a key prerequisite to correctly develop robust decadal prediction systems that may help to assess the risk of crossing thresholds potentially crucial for society. The prediction of tipping points remains difficult, notably due to stochastic resonance, i.e. the interaction between natural variability and anthropogenic forcing, asking for large ensembles of predictions to correctly assess the risks. Furthermore, evaluating the proximity to crucial thresholds using process-based understanding of each system remains a key aspect to be developed for an improved assessment of such risks. This paper finally proposes a few research avenues concerning the use of remote sensing data and the need for combining different sources of data, and having long and precise-enough time series of the key variables needed to monitor Earth system tipping elements.

TI  - Satellite-Based Study of Seasonal Variability in Water Quality Parameters in a Tropical Estuary along the Southwest Coast of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To sustain a healthy ecosystem, continuous monitoring of the water quality is vital. Ocean colour remote sensing is an important tool to carry out such studies. Thus, chlorophyll-a(Chl-a), chromophoric dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)440), turbidity (T) and sea surface temperature (SST), among others, have been considered in the present study to evaluate the water quality of the Cochin Backwaters, a tropical estuary along the southwest coast of India. Landsat 8/OLI data have been used to derive the water quality parameters (WQP), and seasonal averages have been estimated to study the variations occurring in the area during 2014-2018. These were then plotted against the river runoff occurring in the area to find out its impact upon the said parameters. The results showed that thea(CDOM)440 and Chl-aconcentrations were related to the runoff of the area as both the parameters were at their peaks during the southwest monsoon season with values approximately more than 1.6 m(-1)and 5.6 mg/m(3), respectively. However, in the other seasons,a(CDOM)440 was not seen to directly correspond with the runoff in the area. Turbidity was observed to be the highest during the spring inter-monsoon season (SIM) with values reaching more than 60 FNU. As far as the surface temperature of the estuary is concerned, it was found to be around similar to 25 degrees C for most parts of the year, except for the southwest monsoon season when the temperature dropped below 25 degrees C. Interannual variability of the WQP showed that they were at their highest in 2014 followed by 2016, 2017 and 2018, while the year 2015 had the lowest concentration. The study also brings out the utility of ocean colour remote sensing products as an alternative to study the Indian coastal and estuarine waters.

TI  - Aerosol data assimilation in the MOCAGE chemical transport model during the TRAQA/ChArMEx campaign: lidar observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the first results about the assimilation of CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) extinction coefficient measurements onboard the CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) satellite in the MOCAGE (MOdele de Chimie Atmospherique a Grande Echelle) chemistry transport model of Meteo-France. This assimilation module is an extension of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) assimilation system already presented by Sic et al. (2016). We focus on the period of the TRAQA (TRAnsport a longue distance et Qualite de l'Air dans le bassin mediterraneen) field campaign that took place during summer 2012. This period offers the opportunity to have access to a large set of aerosol observations from instrumented aircraft, balloons, satellite and ground-based stations. We evaluate the added value of CALIOP assimilation with respect to the model free run by comparing both fields to independent observations issued from the TRAQA field campaign.In this study we focus on the desert dust outbreak which happened during late June 2012 over the Mediterranean Basin (MB) during the TRAQA campaign. The comparison with the AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) AOD measurements shows that the assimilation of CALIOP lidar observations improves the statistics compared to the model free run. The correlation between AERONET and the model (assimilation) is 0.682 (0.753); the bias and the root mean square error (RMSE), due to CALIOP assimilation, are reduced from -0.063 to 0.048 and from 0.183 to 0.148, respectively.Compared to MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) AOD observations, the model free run shows an underestimation of the AOD values, whereas the CALIOP assimilation corrects this underestimation and shows a quantitative good improvement in terms of AOD maps over the MB. The correlation between MODIS and the model (assimilation) during the dust outbreak is 0.47 (0.52), whereas the bias is -0.18 (-0.02) and the RMSE is 0.36 (0.30).The comparison of in situ aircraft and balloon measurements to both modelled and assimilated outputs shows that the CALIOP lidar assimilation highly improves the model aerosol field. The evaluation with the LOAC (Light Optical Particle Counter) measurements indicates that the aerosol vertical profiles are well simulated by the direct model but with a general underestimation of the aerosol number concentration, especially in the altitude range 2-5 km. The CALIOP assimilation improves these results by a factor of 2.5 to 5.Analysis of the vertical distribution of the desert aerosol concentration shows that the aerosol dust transport event is well captured by the model but with an underestimated intensity. The assimilation of CALIOP observations allows the improvement of the geographical representation of the event within the model as well as its intensity by a factor of 2 in the altitude range 1-5 km.

TI  - Earth's Outgoing Longwave Radiation Variability Prior to <i>M</i> ≥6.0 Earthquakes in the Taiwan Area During 2009-2019
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an analysis method, using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite data, to trace variations in outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) for finding the precursors of earthquakes. The significance of these observations is investigated using data sets of recentM >= 6.0 earthquakes around the Taiwan area from 2009 to 2019. We suggest that the precursory signal could be anE(Index)anomaly (EA) in the form of substantial thermal releases distributed near the epicenter. The consecutive appearances of OLR EAs are observed as precursors 2-15 days before significant earthquakes, and we refer to this as a pre-earthquake OLR E(Index)anomaly (POEA). We interpret these thermal sources as possibly originating from electromagnetics together with gas emissions associated with pre-seismic processes. This study highlights the potential of OLR anomalous changes in earthquake precursor studies, at least in the Taiwan region.

TI  - Modification on optical trapezoid model for accurate estimation of soil moisture content in a maize growing field
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM) as a method has been proposed to retrieve soil moisture from remote sensing data. It is based on the assumption that a trapezoidal shape would be derived from plotting of vegetation index (VI) versus shortwave-infrared transformed reflectance (STR) data assuming a linear relationship between VI and STR. A literature review and the present study indicate that the relationship between VI and STR under both dry and wet conditions, especially in the wide range of vegetation cover, is nonlinear. Therefore, we modified the OPTRAM model by introducing nonlinear edges to the VI-STR space and then employed the modified OPTRAM (denoted as MOPTRAM) using Sentinel-2 observations to predict surface (theta(surf)) and root zone (theta(rz)) soil moistures. Soil moisture predicted by MOPTRAM and OPTRAM methods were compared with ground truth volumetric soil moisture data of a maize field. Accuracy of the predictions from the MOPTRAM increased as compared to that from the OPTRAM for both theta(surf) and theta(rz), with a wide range of vegetation cover. The root-mean-square error and R-2 for the theta(surf) estimates from MOPTRAM were 0.036 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.748, respectively, with corresponding figures of 0.047 and 0.692 from OPTRAM, implying greater prediction accuracy for the modified model in the studied area.

TI  - Loss and lastingness? Further exploring the relationship between the death of a close other, belief in an everlasting soul, and terror management processes
T2  - DEATH STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This research explored the relationship between the death of a close other (DOCO) and terror management processes. In Study 1 (n = 810), university students who experienced DOCO (vs. not) reported higher university and American identification; greater self-esteem and meaning in life; lower death-thought accessibility; greater "death-as-passage" representations; and higher belief in an everlasting soul. We pre-registered Study 2 (n = 497) as an attempt to replicate these findings; although the patterns of means were consistent with Study 1, the tests did not reach statistical significance. However, analyses on the merged data (N = 1,307) supported the present theoretical analysis.

T2  - Light, science & applications
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Space communication for deep-space missions, inter-satellite data transfer and Earth monitoring requires high-speed data connectivity. The reach is fundamentally dictated by the available transmission power, the aperture size, and the receiver sensitivity. A transition from radio-frequency links to optical links is now seriously being considered, as this greatly reduces the channel loss caused by diffraction. A widely studied approach uses power-efficient formats along with nanowire-based photon-counting receivers cooled to a few Kelvins operating at speeds below 1Gb/s. However, to achieve the multi-Gb/s data rates that will be required in the future, systems relying on pre-amplified receivers together with advanced signal generation and processing techniques from fibre communications are also considered. The sensitivity of such systems is largely determined by the noise figure (NF) of the pre-amplifier, which is theoretically 3dB for almost all amplifiers. Phase-sensitive optical amplifiers (PSAs) with their uniquely low NF of 0dB promise to provide the best possible sensitivity for Gb/s-rate long-haul free-space links. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach using a PSA-based receiver in a free-space transmission experiment with an unprecedented bit-error-free, black-box sensitivity of 1 photon-per-information-bit (PPB) at an information rate of 10.5Gb/s. The system adopts a simple modulation format (quadrature-phase-shift keying, QPSK), standard digital signal processing for signal recovery and forward-error correction and is straightforwardly scalable to higher data rates.

Peter Andrekson and colleagues at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden developed the system and demonstrated its potential in laboratory scale experiments. It relies on a technology known as phase-sensitive optical amplification. The researchers transmitted signals across only a one meter, but they believe their work proves the validity of a process that could readily be scaled up for communication across space. Replacing current radio-frequency technology with more effective optical systems could meet the demands of future space communications systems, which will need to operate at higher data rates and across greater distances.

TI  - Impact of spatiotemporal land-use and land-cover changes on surface urban heat islands in a semiarid region using Landsat data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many factors are involved in urban heat island development, such as lack of green spaces, improper choice of building materials, densification, and other human activities. The aim of this research was to quantify the effects of land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) changes on urban land surface temperature (LST) during a 25-year period (1993-2018) for the semiarid Shiraz City in southern Iran using Landsat data (TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS) and machine learning algorithms. Five main LU/LC classes, such as orchard, vegetation, bare surface, asphalt cover, and built-up areas, were identified using a support vector machine algorithm. Landsat images were used to retrieve normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI). The results showed that the mean LST over the entire study domain increased considerably between 1993 and 2018, due to urbanization, decrease of green areas, and increasing industrial areas. Built-up areas increased considerably by 25.8% from 80 to 100.6 km(2)between 1993 and 2018, while vegetation cover decreased dramatically by 69.3%. Mean LST increased from 38.4 to 40.2 degrees C during the 25-year period with a significant increase of 3.9 degrees C between 2013 and 2018. In addition, the Urban heat island Ratio Index (URI) displayed a substantial upward trend during the 25-year period.

TI  - Remote Sensing for National Development: The Legacy of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Dr. Vikram Sarabhai was a great visionary, and we are celebrating his Centenary birth anniversary, this year. It was amazing to see, 50 years back, he had planned meticulously various possible remote sensing applications that materialised in the fields of weather and oceans, coastal zone management, geoscience, hydrology, forestry, land use and agriculture and contributed significantly towards national development. Not only that, he had thought about the kinds of sensors, processing and communicating technologies that would be required. He had stressed need for the domain expertise in different disciplines and collaboration with various stakeholders for developing various remote sensing-based products and services and their utilisation. The concept of the National Natural Resources Management System had born out this vision. Such approach has really paid rich dividends. Today, because of such approach, India is in forefront of operational utilisation of remote sensing data and provides weather services for farmers, potential fishery zone advisories to fishermen, accurate and reliable forecast on cyclones and droughts, groundwater targeting for drinking water, condition and status of forest and glaciers, annual forecast of production of major food grains, to name a few. The time is now appropriate to transform this world-class technology into a national system of remote sensing in collaboration with industries to provide operational services to not only users in India, but also all developing countries. Such approach will pave way in translating technology development into innovation for the benefit of all stakeholders. These benefits will help in improving particularly social and economic conditions of developing societies, and is the best way to pay tribute to him. In this article, the vision of Dr. Sarabhai vis-a-vis the status of utilisation of remote sensing in the country has been discussed.

TI  - Machine learning and generalized linear model techniques to predict aboveground biomass in Amazon rainforest using LiDAR data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - LiDAR remote sensing data combined with machine learning (ML) techniques have presented great potential for large-scale modeling of tropical forest attributes. However, the large amount of information that can be derived from an aerial LiDAR survey, summed with the intrinsic heterogeneity of tropical environments (e.g., the Amazon), makes it a challenge to accurately estimate forest biophysical variables. The aim of our work is to investigate the potential and accuracy of different ML techniques and a generalized linear model (GLM) to learn the relationships between LiDAR-derived metrics and forest inventory data for aboveground biomass (AGB) prediction in Amazon forest sites under selective logging regimes. The predictive performance of three ML techniques, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN), was compared against result from the GLM technique, across 85 sample plots. Interestingly, the GLM retrieved the most accurate estimations of forest AGB (rho Spearman's coefficient = 0.87), compared with the ML techniques (RF = 0.77, SVM = 0.67, and ANN = 0.50). A number of possible factors affecting such results are listed and discussed in the text, including sample size and number of predictor variables. Continued research is necessary to improve the confidence of AGB estimation, especially over complex forest structures. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Improved modeling and analysis of the patch size-frequency distribution of forest disturbances in China based on a Landsat forest cover change product
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbances have been altering the ecological properties of ecosystems; meanwhile, disturbance events of varying sizes create different structures and functions for a forest landscape. Therefore, size and frequency are important attributes of disturbances, and their relationship should be studied. We present a hierarchical method through the modeling of the overall trend of the size-frequency distribution and the characterization of the non-constant variances of disturbance sizes at each frequency level. This method was demonstrated to accurately model the sizes as well as the corresponding frequencies; thus, the total disturbed area and number of disturbance patches were both accurately estimated. By applying the method to 13 provinces in China, consistent patterns were revealed by the modeling results and remote-sensing-based product, showing that between 2000 and 2005, forests in most provinces were dominated by moderate disturbances (10 ha < size < 100 ha). Southeastern provinces contain the largest proportion of small disturbances (size < 10 ha), whereas most of the very large disturbances (size > 1000 ha) occurred in the northeastern and northwestern provinces. This study concludes that the proposed method can improve the representation of the size-frequency distribution of forest disturbances.

TI  - Simulating highly disturbed vegetation distribution: the case of China's Jing-Jin-Ji region
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Simulating vegetation distribution is an effective method for identifying vegetation distribution patterns and trends. The primary goal of this study was to determine the best simulation method for a vegetation in an area that is heavily affected by human disturbance.Methods. We used climate, topographic, and spectral data as the input variables for four machine learning models (random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and maximum likelihood classification (MLC)) on three vegetation classification units (vegetation group (I), vegetation type (II), and formation and subformation (III)) in Jing-Jin-Ji, one of China's most developed regions. We used a total of 2,789 vegetation points for model training and 974 vegetation points for model assessment.Results. Our results showed that the RF method was the best of the four models, as it could effectively simulate vegetation distribution in all three classification units. The DT method could only simulate vegetation distribution in units I and II, while the other two models could not simulate vegetation distribution in any of the units. Kappa coefficients indicated that the DT and RF methods had more accurate predictions for units I and II than for unit III. The three vegetation classification units were most affected by six variables: three climate variables (annual mean temperature, mean diurnal range, and annual precipitation), one geospatial variable (slope), and two spectral variables (Mid-infrared ratio of winter vegetation index and brightness index of summer vegetation index). Variables Combination 7, including annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, mean diurnal range and precipitation of driest month, produced the highest simulation accuracy.Conclusions. We determined that the RF model was the most effective for simulating vegetation distribution in all classification units present in the Jing-Jin-Ji region. The RF model produced high accuracy vegetation distributions in classification units I and II, but relatively low accuracy in classification unit III. Four climate variables were sufficient for vegetation distribution simulation in such region.

M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and rapid cloud detection is exceedingly significant for improving the downlink efficiency of on-orbit data, especially for the microsatellites with limited power and computational ability. However, the inference speed and large model limit the potential of on-orbit implementation of deep-learning-based cloud detection method. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a lightweight network based on depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the size of model and computational cost of pixel-wise cloud detection methods. The network achieves lightweight end-to-end cloud detection through extracting feature maps from the images to generate the mask with the obtained maps. For the visible and thermal infrared bands of the Landsat 8 cloud cover assessment validation dataset, the experimental results show that the pixel accuracy of the proposed method for cloud detection is higher than 90%, the inference speed is about 5 times faster than that of U-Net, and the model parameters and floating-point operations are reduced to 12.4% and 12.8% of U-Net, respectively.

TI  - Multivariate Analysis for Assessing Irrigation Water Quality: A Case Study of the Bahr Mouise Canal, Eastern Nile Delta
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Water scarcity and suitable irrigation water management in arid regions represent tangible challenges for sustainable agriculture. The current study aimed to apply multivariate analysis and to develop a simplified water quality assessment using principal component analysis (PCA) and the agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) technique to assess the water quality of the Bahr Mouise canal in El-Sharkia Governorate, Egypt. The proposed methods depended on the monitored water chemical composition (e.g., pH, water electrical conductivity (ECiw), Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, Cl-, and SO42-) during 2019. Based on the supervised classification of satellite images (Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)), the distinguished land use/land cover types around the Bahr Mouise canal were agriculture, urban, and water bodies, while the dominating land use was agriculture. The water quality of the Bahr Mouise canal was classified into two classes based on the application of the irrigation water quality index (IWQI), while the water quality was classified into three classes using the PCA and AHC methods. Temporal variations in water quality were investigated, where the water qualities in winter, autumn, and spring (January, February, March, April, November, and December) were classified as class I (no restrictions) based on IWQI application, and the water salinity, sodicity, and/or alkalinity did not represent limiting factors for irrigation water quality. On the other hand, in the summer season (May, June, July, August, and October), the irrigation water was classified as class II (low restrictions); therefore, irrigation processes during summer may lead to an increase in the alkalinity hazard. The PCA classifications were compared with the IWQI results; the PCA classifications had similar assessment results during the year, except in September, while the water quality was assigned to class II using the PCA method and class I by applying the IWQI. Furthermore, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) around the Bahr Mouise canal over eight months and climatic data assisted in explaining the fluctuations in water quality during 2019 as a result of changing the crop season and agriculture management. Assessments of water quality help to conserve soil, reduce degradation risk, and support decision makers in order to obtain sustainable agriculture, especially under water irrigation scarcity and the limited agricultural land in such an arid region.

TI  - Laboratory and UAV-Based Identification and Classification of Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl, Bacterial Spot, and Target Spot Diseases in Tomato Utilizing Hyperspectral Imaging and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tomato crops are susceptible to multiple diseases, several of which may be present during the same season. Therefore, rapid disease identification could enhance crop management consequently increasing the yield. In this study, nondestructive methods were developed to detect diseases that affect tomato crops, such as bacterial spot (BS), target spot (TS), and tomato yellow leaf curl (TYLC) for two varieties of tomato (susceptible and tolerant to TYLC only) by using hyperspectral sensing in two conditions: a) laboratory (benchtop scanning), and b) in field using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV-based). The stepwise discriminant analysis (STDA) and the radial basis function were applied to classify the infected plants and distinguish them from noninfected or healthy (H) plants. Multiple vegetation indices (VIs) and the M statistic method were utilized to distinguish and classify the diseased plants. In general, the classification results between healthy and diseased plants were highly accurate for all diseases; for instance, when comparing H vs. BS, TS, and TYLC in the asymptomatic stage and laboratory conditions, the classification rates were 94%, 95%, and 100%, respectively. Similarly, in the symptomatic stage, the classification rates between healthy and infected plants were 98% for BS, and 99-100% for TS and TYLC diseases. The classification results in the field conditions also showed high values of 98%, 96%, and 100%, for BS, TS, and TYLC, respectively. The VIs that could best identify these diseases were the renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI), and the modified triangular vegetation index 1 (MTVI 1) in both laboratory and field. The results were promising and suggest the possibility to identify these diseases using remote sensing.

TI  - Prospective Comparison of Intraoperative Touch Imprint Cytology and Frozen Section Histology on Axillary Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Early Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - ACTA CYTOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction:Since the late 1970s, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been used for several solid malignancies to identify lymph node metastases. This procedure is associated with less surgical morbidity than complete lymphadenectomy. Recent evidence suggests that axillary lymphadenectomy is not required for breast sentinel nodes with micrometastases (<= 2 mm). Current clinical management of sentinel nodes indicates that only macrometastases (>2 mm) should be detected intraoperatively. In Japan, an intraoperative histopathological frozen section (FS) method is used to identify lymph node metastases, but this method takes more than 30 min and requires complex techniques and expensive equipment. Touch imprint cytology (TIC) is an easier, less expensive, and faster method, but its sensitivity has been shown to be low.Objective:The purpose of this study was to determine if TIC is more useful than FS in identifying macrometastases in sentinel lymph nodes in preoperative node-negative breast cancer operations.Methods:A prospective review of 49 consecutive patients with node-negative breast cancer treated with SLNB and intraoperative TIC and FS between November 2017 and June 2019 was performed. TIC samples were stained using Papanicolaou and Diff-Quick stains. Results were compared with routine postoperative paraffin sections.Results:With TIC, the Papanicolaou stain took a mean of 12 min, and the Diff-Quick stain took a mean of 10 min. Results of both TIC stain methods were the same. In contrast, the FS method took a mean of 80 min (including the transfer of specimens to a different hospital with the necessary equipment). TIC confirmed macrometastases in 5 cases. All macrometastases were diagnosed equally by the 2 techniques. Both the sensitivity and specificity of TIC were 100% for detection of macrometastases.Conclusion:TIC of SLNB for breast cancer is an easy and useful method for the detection of macrometastases of breast sentinel nodes.

TI  - Remotely-Sensed Surface Temperature and Vegetation Status for the Assessment of Decadal Change in the Irrigated Land Cover of North-Central Victoria, Australia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of irrigated land cover is important for both resource managers and farmers. An operational approach is presented to use the satellite-derived surface temperature and vegetation cover in order to distinguish between irrigated and non-irrigated land. Using an iterative thresholding procedure to minimize within-class variance, the bilevel segmentation of surface temperature and vegetation cover was achieved for each irrigation period (Spring, Summer and Autumn). The three periodic profiles were used to define irrigation land covers from 2008-2009 to 2018-2019 in a key agricultural region of Australia. The overall accuracy of identifying farms with irrigated land cover amounted to 95.7%. Total irrigated land cover was the lowest (approximately 200,000 ha) in the 2008-2009 crop year which increased more than three-fold in 2012-2013, followed by a gradual decline in the following years. Satellite images from Landsat series (L-5, L-7 and L-8), Sentinel-2 and ASTER were found suitable for land cover classification, which is scalable from farm to regional levels. For this reason, the results are desirable for a range of stakeholders.

TI  - Wildfire Risk Assessment Based on Geospatial Open Data: Application on Chios, Greece
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires burn tens of thousands of hectares of forest, chaparral and grassland in Mediterranean countries every year, giving rise to landscape, ecologic, economic, and public safety concerns. On the Greek island of Chios and in many other Mediterranean landscapes, areas affected by fire are difficult to access and control due to rugged terrain, requiring wildfire preparedness and response plans that support fire fighting. This study utilized open source data and a weighted linear combination to extract factors that determine wildfire risk. Landsat satellite imagery and publicly available geospatial data were used to create a Geographic Information System and a multi-criteria analysis to develop a methodology for spatially modeling fire risk on Chios, a Greek island with frequent fire occurrence. This study focused on the static, structural component of the risk assessment to produce a spatial distribution of fire risk as a thematic map. Fire weather conditions were accounted for using Fuel Moisture Content, which reflected dryness of dead fuels and water deficit of live biomass. To assess the results, historic fire data representing actual occurrence of fire incidents were compared with probable fire locations predicted by our GIS model. It was found that there was a good agreement between the ground reference data and the results of the created fire risk model. The findings will help fire authorities identify areas of high risk for wildfire and plan the allocation of resources accordingly. This is because the outputs of the designed fire risk model are not complex or challenging to use in Chios, Greece and other landscapes.

TI  - The joint effect of natural and human-induced environmental factors on surface water quality in the Birim North District of Ghana
T2  - WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities threaten surface water quality across the globe, especially in contexts where monitoring is non-existent or weak. Our understanding of the effect, order and magnitude of natural and human-induced environmental factors on surface water quality is limited. This study assessed the effect, predictive order and magnitude of natural and human-induced environmental variables on surface water quality in the Birim North District of Ghana. Approximately 540 samples were collected from 15 rivers and streams in 2018 and analysed using 31 indicators. Landsat satellite images (2018 and 2019) of the study area were analysed for land use land cover data. The data were fitted to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model. Season (50%) most accounted for variability in the surface water quality whereas elevation and forest cover accounted for 28% and 21%, respectively. Surface water quality in the Akoase and Nyafoman/Noyem clusters were 30% and 10% respectively better in quality than the Adofokrom/Amenam cluster. The increasing order of magnitude of variables in predicting surface water quality was Buffer, Cultivated area, Built-up, Forest, Rivers and streams cluster, Elevation, and Season. Consequently, management interventions for surface water ecosystems should account for spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the factors that influence surface water quality.

TI  - Assessment of Interventions in Fuel Management Zones Using Remote Sensing
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Every year, wildfires strike the Portuguese territory and are a concern for public entities and the population. To prevent a wildfire progression and minimize its impact, Fuel Management Zones (FMZs) have been stipulated, by law, around buildings, settlements, along national roads, and other infrastructures. FMZs require monitoring of the vegetation condition to promptly proceed with the maintenance and cleaning of these zones. To improve FMZ monitoring, this paper proposes the use of satellite images, such as the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, along with vegetation indices and extracted temporal characteristics (max, min, mean and standard deviation) associated with the vegetation within and outside the FMZs and to determine if they were treated. These characteristics feed machine-learning algorithms, such as XGBoost, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighbors and Random Forest. The results show that it is possible to detect an intervention in an FMZ with high accuracy, namely with an F1-score ranging from 90% up to 94% and a Kappa ranging from 0.80 up to 0.89.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Methods for Mapping the Stand Characteristics of Temperate Forests Using Multi-Spectral Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation and mapping of forest stand characteristics are vital because this information is necessary for sustainable forest management. The present study considers the use of a Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) algorithm as a non-parametric classifier using Sentinel-2A data and topographic variables to estimate the forest stand characteristics, namely the basal area (m(2)/ha), stem volume (m(3)/ha), and stem density (number/ha). These results were compared with those of three other popular machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as generalised linear model (GLM), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM). A feature selection was done on 28 variables including the multi-spectral bands on Sentinel-2 satellite, related vegetation indices, and ancillary data (elevation, slope, and topographic solar-radiation index derived from digital elevation model (DEM)) and then the most insignificant variables were removed from the datasets by recursive feature elimination (RFE). The study area was a mountainous forest with high biodiversity and an elevation gradient from 26 to 1636 m. An inventory dataset of 1200 sample plots was provided for training and testing the algorithms, and the predictors were fed into the ML models to compute and predict the forest stand characteristics. The accuracies and certainties of the ML models were assessed by their root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (R-2) values. The results demonstrated that BART generated the best basal area and stem volume predictions, followed by GLM, SVM, and KNN. The best RMSE values for both basal area (8.12 m(2)/ha) and stem volume (29.28 m(3)/ha) estimation were obtained by BART. Thus, the ability of the BART model for forestry application was established. On the other hand, KNN exhibited the highest RMSE values for all stand variable predictions, thereby exhibiting the least accuracy for this specific application. Moreover, the effectiveness of the narrow Sentinel-2 bands around the red edge and elevation was highlighted for predicting the forest stand characteristics. Therefore, we concluded that the combination of the Sentinel-2 products and topographic variables derived from the PALSAR data used in this study improved the estimation of the forest attributes in temperate forests.

TI  - Quantitative Assessment of Land Cover Sensitivity to Desertification in Maigatari Local Government Area, Jigawa State, Nigeria
T2  - Journal of Applied Sciences & Environmental Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification alludes to land degradation in arid, semi-arid and sub-humid regions resulting from various variables, counting climatic variations and human activities. When land degradation transpire within the world's drylands. It regularly makes desert-like conditions. Land degradation occurs all over, but is characterized as desertification when it occurs within the drylands. The study employed adjusted MEDALUS methodology using eleven indicators rainfall, evapotranspiration, aridity, soil texture, soil depth, slope gradient, drainage density, plant cover, erosion protection, sensitivity desertification index and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Remote Sensing and GIS were the main techniques used in the indices computations and mapping. Thus, Shuttle Rader Topographic Map (SRTM) and Landsat 8 satellite imagery for the year 2019 with 30 meter resolution, captured in the month of August (rainy season), covering the study area were acquired from Global Land cover Facility (GLCF) University of Maryland. The study finds that the duration and intensity of rainfall is declining especially at the edge of the desert, extreme north and western part of the area. Rain quickly drained through infiltration and surface runoff which carried the little nutrients attached to the soil. Rainfall and climate is of arid type recording about 300-400mm of rainfall and the soil is low in organic matter content making it weak and less fertile and support only the cultivation of cereals and legumes. The study recommends that there is need to strengthen the laws and policies in controlling desertification and land degradation, establishment of shelterbelts to control desertification and act also as wind breakers and encourage the use of modern techniques such as drip irrigation to check the rate of infiltration and runoff.

TI  - Water supply and effective rainfall impacts on major crops across irrigated areas of Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An integrated approach is developed to assess major crops water productivity (CWP) in relation to water supply across the irrigated areas of Punjab province in central Pakistan during 1982-2015. The role of precipitation (effective rainfall) in term of add on to water supply and impacts on wheat yield is also studied. The water supply from canals displayed a significant declining trend for Rabi season (wheat mainly) during 1996-2015. Crop water productivity for harvestable area (CWPA) has decreased; however, it has increased in case of production (CWPP) and yield (CWPY). The role of tube wells is analyzed to assess the improved CWP even under decreased canal water supply. Contribution of water supply through effective rainfall showed a significant add on of 7.6 mm to 291.8 mm to water supply and 0.48 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) to 8.19 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) towards CWP(Y)during the studied 34-year period. The precipitation (effective rainfall) contribute water supply of 10.6 mm (6.64 mm), 23.4 mm (14.6 mm), and 25.5 mm (16.0 mm) for January, February, and March, respectively. Average canal water supply for irrigation is observed to be 254.9 mm against irrigation need of 418.6 mm with a deficit of 39.1%, across irrigated areas. The multiple regression models are developed with seasonal predictive capacity for wheat harvestable area and yields with an explained variability of similar to 81% and similar to 78%, respectively. A decrease in temporal satellite-based weekly composite NDVI profile during 1986, 1992, 1994, 1997, 2002, and 2010 corresponded to El Nino episodes, since negative phases of ENSO are known to cause droughts across Punjab province. The synthesized information calls for a more comprehensive management of declining canal water supply for sustainable major crops water productivity such as wheat which is a staple food crop.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to analyse the effect of spatio-temporal urban dynamics of Bursa city in terms of urban development trends and landscape metrics on the land use/cover change. Four different remotely sensed data recorded in 1979, 1989, 2000, 2013 and future simulation map of 2040 were used for the analysis. SLEUTH model in the frame of cellular automata was adopted for the future development. Object-based classification approach was used to extract the land use/cover maps and determine the quantity and quality of change in order to identify the land degradation. Eight urban landscape metrics were calculated from current and future land use/cover classification data. General phases of diffusion and coalescence in urban sprawl were revealed through the metric calculations. The most devastating change was defined on the agricultural lands. Metric results indicated that the irregular urban growth leads to an increase in patch number which ended up with the land degradation. Although the urbanization pattern mostly moved from the "seed" area to outwards for different time periods, the new spreading centres for the individual patches were observed for the future urban development. The empirical results and findings for historical and future land use/cover provided an insight to urban sprawl characteristics and further development of sustainable urban planning studies.

TI  - Seasonal representation of extreme precipitation indices over the United States in CMIP6 present-day simulations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Realistically representing the present-day characteristics of extreme precipitation has been a challenge for global climate models, which is due in part to deficiencies in model resolution and physics, but is also due to a lack of consistency in gridded observations. In this study, we use three observation datasets, including gridded rain gauge and satellite data, to assess historical simulations from sixteen Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models. We separately evaluate summer and winter precipitation over the United States (US) with a comprehensive set of extreme precipitation indices, including an assessment of precipitation frequency, intensity and spatial structure. The observations exhibit significant differences in their estimates of area-average intensity distributions and spatial patterns of the mean and extremes of precipitation over the US. In general, the CMIP6 multi-model mean performs better than most individual models at capturing daily precipitation distributions and extreme precipitation indices, particularly in comparison to gauge-based data. Also, the representation of the extreme precipitation indices by the CMIP6 models is better in the summer than winter. Although the 'standard' horizontal-resolution can vary significantly across CMIP6 models, from similar to 0.7 degrees to similar to 2.8 degrees, we find that resolution is not a good indicator of model performance. Overall, our results highlight common biases in CMIP6 models and demonstrate that no single model is consistently the most reliable across all indices.

TI  - Mapping of Cotton Fields Within-Season Using Phenology-Based Metrics Derived from a Time Series of Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A phenology-based crop type mapping approach was carried out to map cotton fields throughout the cotton-growing areas of eastern Australia. The workflow was implemented in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, as it is time efficient and does not require processing in multiple platforms to complete the classification steps. A time series of Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery were generated from Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance Tier 1 (L8SR) and processed using Fourier transformation. This was used to produce the harmonised-NDVI (H-NDVI) from the original NDVI, and then phase and amplitude values were generated from the H-NDVI to visualise active cotton in the targeted fields. Random Forest (RF) models were built to classify cotton at early, mid and late growth stages to assess the ability of the model to classify cotton as the season progresses, with phase, amplitude and other individual bands as predictors. Results obtained from leave-one-season-out cross validation (LOSOCV) indicated that Overall Accuracy (OA), Kappa, Producer's Accuracies (PA) and User's Accuracy (UA), increased significantly when adding amplitude and phase as predictor variables to the model, than prediction using H-NDVI or raw bands only. Commission and omission errors were reduced significantly as the season progressed and more in-season imagery was available. The methodology proposed in this study can map cotton crops accurately based on the reconstruction of the unique cotton reflectance trajectory through time. This study confirms the importance of phenological metrics in improving in-season cotton fields mapping across eastern Australia. This model can be used in conjunction with other datasets to forecast yield based on the mapped crop type for improved decision making related to supply chain logistics and seasonal outlooks for production.

TI  - ASSESSING THE RELATIONSHIP OF LST, NDVI AND EVI WITH LAND COVER CHANGES IN THE LAGOS LAGOON ENVIRONMENT
T2  - QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPHICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lagos Lagoon is under increased pressure from growth in human population, growing demands for natural resources, human activities, and socioeconomic factors. The degree of these activities and the impacts are directly proportional to urban expansion and growth. In the light of this situation, the objectives of this study were: (i) to estimate through satellite imagery analysis the extent of changes in the Lagos Lagoon environment for the periods 1984, 2002, 2013 and 2019 using Landsat-derived data on land cover, Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI); and (ii) to evaluate the relationship between the derived data and determine their relative influence on the lagoon environment. The derived data were subjected to descriptive statistics, and relationships were explored using Pearson's correlation and regression analysis. The effect of land cover on LST was measured using the Contribution Index and a trend analysis was carried out. From the results, the mean LSTs for the four years were 22.68 degrees C (1984), 24.34 degrees C (2002), 26.46 degrees C (2013) and 28.40 degrees C (2019). Generally, the mean LSTs is in opposite trend with the mean NDVIs and EVIs as associated with their dominant land cover type. The strongest positive correlations were observed between NDVI and EVI while NDVI had the closest fit with LST in the regression. Built-up areas have the highest contributions to LST while vegetation had a cooling influence. The depletion in vegetative cover has compromised the biodiversity of this environment and efforts are required to reverse this trend.

TI  - Validation of MODIS C6.1 and MERRA-2 AOD Using AERONET Observations: A Comparative Study over Turkey
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study validated MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) of the National Aeronautics and Space Agency, USA, Aqua and Terra Collection 6.1, and MERRA-2 (Modern-ERA Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application) Version 2 of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm against AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) ground-based sunphotometer observations over Turkey. AERONET AOD data were collected from three sites during the period between 2013 and 2017. Regression analysis showed that overall, seasonally and daily statistics of MODIS are better than MERRA-2 by the mean of coefficient of determination (R-2), mean absolute error (MAE), and relative root mean square deviation (RMSDrel). MODIS combined Terra/Aqua AOD and MERRA-2 AOD corresponding to morning and noon hours resulted in better results than individual sub datasets. A clear annual cycle in AOD was detected by the three platforms. However, overall, MODIS and MERRA-2 tend to overestimate and underestimate AOD, respectively, in comparison with AERONET. MODIS showed higher efficiency in detecting extreme events than MERRA-2. There was no clear relation found between the accuracy in MODIS/MERRA-2 AOD and surface relative humidity (RH).

TI  - What's new in pediatric melanoma: An update from the APSA cancer committee
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Purpose: Melanoma is the most common skin cancer in children and often presents in an atypical fashion when compared to adults. The purpose of this review is to present an update on the epidemiology, surgical and medical management and prevention strategies in pediatric melanoma.Methods: A comprehensive review of the current literature on the epidemiology, surgical and medical management and prevention of adult and pediatric melanoma was performed by the authors and the results of this review are summarized in the manuscript.Results: Most recently, the incidence of melanoma in children has been declining, possibly owing to increased awareness and sun exposure prevention. The mainstay of therapy is surgical resection, often with sentinel lymph node biopsy. A positive sentinel node has prognostic' value; however, completion node dissection is no longer recommended in the absence of clinically or radiographically positive nodes. Those with advanced disease also receive adjuvant systemic therapy using increasingly targeted immunologic therapies.Conclusions: Sentinel lymph node positive patients no longer require completion lymph node dissection and instead may be followed by ultrasound. However, it is important to note that children have been excluded from most melanoma clinical trials to dale, and therefore, recommendations for management are based on existing pediatric retrospective data and extrapolation from adult studies.

TI  - Graph-Based Data Fusion Applied to: Change Detection and Biomass Estimation in Rice Crops
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The complementary nature of different modalities and multiple bands used in remote sensing data is helpful for tasks such as change detection and the prediction of agricultural variables. Nonetheless, correctly processing a multi-modal dataset is not a simple task, owing to the presence of different data resolutions and formats. In the past few years, graph-based methods have proven to be a useful tool in capturing inherent data similarity, in spite of different data formats, and preserving relevant topological and geometric information. In this paper, we propose a graph-based data fusion algorithm for remotely sensed images applied to (i) data-driven semi-unsupervised change detection and (ii) biomass estimation in rice crops. In order to detect the change, we evaluated the performance of four competing algorithms on fourteen datasets. To estimate biomass in rice crops, we compared our proposal in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) concerning a recent approach based on vegetation indices as features. The results confirm that the proposed graph-based data fusion algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods for change detection and biomass estimation in rice crops.

TI  - Fish as bio indicators to determine the effects of pollution in river by using the micronucleus and alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis assay
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The unpolluted freshwater is an essential ingredient for the healthy life of animals and humans. Aquatic pollution is the most important problem for living organisms. The main source of water pollution is industrial sewages. In the current study bioaccumulation and genotoxic effects of different metals e.g. Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu were determined in various tissues of Puntius sophore (P. sophore).Methods: The water sample and fish P. sophore were brought from different sites of the Gomati river (coordinates: 25 degrees 3002900N 83 degrees 1001100E), India. The heavy metals in water and fish tissues were determined by using ICP-MS. The mutagenic and genotoxic potential of the river water in P. sophore were evaluated using micronucleus and single-cell gel electrophoresis techniques.Results: We have observed that the concentration of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu) in the river water and bioaccumulation of these metals in P. sophore are equal in order. Thus it was confirmed that fish act as a sentinel indicator of metal pollution of the surrounding environment. The formation of micronuclei, as well as fragmentation of DNA, were significantly increased (p < 0.05, 0.01) in river fish as compared to the control.Conclusions: Thus we might consider the fish for biomonitoring of aquatic ecosystems. Also, these findings confirmed that water of the Gomati river was contaminated with heavy metals. So, it is important to prevent the inflow of domestic and industrial sewage in the river.

TI  - Changes in Snow Cover Dynamics over the Indus Basin: Evidences from 2008 to 2018 MODIS NDSI Trends Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The frozen water reserves on the Earth are not only very dynamic in their nature, but also have significant effects on hydrological response of complex and dynamic river basins. The Indus basin is one of the most complex river basins in the world and receives most of its share from the Asian Water Tower (Himalayas). In such a huge river basin with high-altitude mountains, the regular quantification of snow cover is a great challenge to researchers for the management of downstream ecosystems. In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily (MOD09GA) and 8-day (MOD09A1) products were used for the spatiotemporal quantification of snow cover over the Indus basin and the western rivers' catchments from 2008 to 2018. The high-resolution Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) was used as a standard product with a minimum Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) threshold (0.4) to delineate the snow cover for 120 scenes over the Indus basin on different days. All types of errors of commission/omission were masked out using water, sand, cloud, and forest masks at different spatiotemporal resolutions. The snow cover comparison of MODIS products with Landsat ETM+, in situ snow data and Google Earth imagery indicated that the minimum NDSI threshold of 0.34 fits well compared to the globally accepted threshold of 0.4 due to the coarser resolution of MODIS products. The intercomparison of the time series snow cover area of MODIS products indicated R(2)values of 0.96, 0.95, 0.97, 0.96 and 0.98, for the Chenab, Jhelum, Indus and eastern rivers' catchments and Indus basin, respectively. A linear least squares regression analysis of the snow cover area of the Indus basin indicated a declining trend of about 3358 and 2459 km(2)per year for MOD09A1 and MOD09GA products, respectively. The results also revealed a decrease in snow cover area over all the parts of the Indus basin and its sub-catchments. Our results suggest that MODIS time series NDSI analysis is a useful technique to estimate snow cover over the mountainous areas of complex river basins.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of the links between forest structure and land surface albedo on a global scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are critical in regulating climate by altering the Earth's surface albedo. Therefore, there is an urgent need to enhance our knowledge about the effects of forest structure on albedo. Here, we present a global assessment of the links between forest structure and albedo at a 1-km spatial resolution using generalized additive models (GAMs). We used remotely sensed data to obtain variables representing forest structure, including forest density, leaf area index, and tree cover, during the peak growing season in 2005 with pure forest pixels that cover similar to 7% of the Earth's surface. Furthermore, we estimated black-sky albedo at a solar zenith angle of 38 degrees using the most recent collection of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS; version 6) at shortwave, near-infrared, and visible spectral regions. In addition, for the first time, we mapped the magnitude of the relationship between forest structure and albedo at each pixel with a 0.5-degree spatial resolution. Our results suggested that forest structure may modulate albedo in most of the sub-biomes. The response of shortwave albedo was always positive to the leaf area index and negative to the tree cover (except for deciduous broadleaf forests in mediterranean and temperate regions), while the response to forest density varied across space in 2005. The spatial map affirmed that the links between forest structure and albedo vary over geographical locations. In sum, our study emphasized the importance of forest structure in the surface albedo regulation. This paper provides the first spatially explicit evidence of the magnitude of relationships between forest structure and albedo on a global scale.

TI  - Measuring phenology uncertainty with large scale image processing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - One standard method to capture data for phenological studies is with digital cameras, taking periodic pictures of vegetation. The large volume of digital images introduces the opportunity to enrich these studies by incorporating big data techniques. The new challenges, then, are to efficiently process large datasets and produce insightful information by controlling noise and variability. On these grounds, the contributions of this paper are the following. (a) A histogram-based visualization for large scale phenological data. (b) Phenological metrics based on the HSV color space, that enhance such histogram-based visualization. (c) A mathematical model to tackle the natural variability and uncertainty of phenological images. (d) The implementation of a parallel workflow to process a large amount of collected data efficiently. We validate these contributions with datasets taken from the Phenological Eyes Network (PEN), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The experiments presented here are reproducible with the provided companion material.

TI  - ERS-1/2 and Sentinel-1 SAR Data Mining for Flood Hazard and Risk Assessment in Lima, Peru
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastline environment and urban areas of Peru overlooking the Pacific Ocean are among the most affected by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, and its cascading hazards such as floods, landslides and avalanches. In this work, the complete archives of the European Space Agency (ESA)'s European Remote-Sensing (ERS-1/2) missions and European Commission's Copernicus Sentinel-1 constellation were screened to select synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images covering the most severe and recent ENSO-related flooding events that affected Lima, the capital and largest city of Peru, in 1997-1998 and 2017-2018. Based on SAR backscatter color composites and ratio maps retrieved from a series of pre-, cross- and post-event SAR pairs, flooded areas were delineated within the Rimac River watershed. These are mostly concentrated along the riverbanks and plain, where low-lying topography and gentle slopes (<= 5 degrees), together with the presence of alluvial deposits, also indicate greater susceptibility to flooding. A total of 409 areas (58.50 km(2)) revealing change were mapped, including 197 changes (32.10 km(2)) due to flooding-related backscatter variations (flooded areas, increased water flow in the riverbed, and riverbank collapses and damage), and 212 (26.40 km(2)) due to other processes (e.g., new urban developments, construction of river embankments, other engineering works, vegetation changes). Urban and landscape changes potentially contributing, either detrimentally or beneficially, to flooding susceptibility were identified and considered in the overall assessment of risk. The extent of built-up areas within the basin was mapped by combining information from the 2011 Global Urban Footprint (GUF) produced by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the Open Street Map (OSM) accessed from the Quantum GIS (QGIS) service, and 2011-2019 very high-resolution optical imagery from Google Earth. The resulting flooding risk map highlights the sectors of potential concern along the Rimac River, should flooding events of equal severity as those captured by SAR images occur in the future.

TI  - The Conversion of Terrence Malick: A Worldview Translated into the Film Medium
T2  - AREA ABIERTA
M3  - Article
AB  - The fact that American filmmaker Terrence Malick devoted some years of his life to academic philosophy and translated into English Martin Heiddegger's The Essence of Reasons is understood by some authors as an interpretive key to his body of work. This article draws upon the German philosopher's concept of world, which lies at the core of the aforesaid text, and its presumed influences in the director's filmography with the objective of questioning this connection and suggesting, in turn, the hypothesis that Malick's films are nurtured by a worldview of Christian roots. The feasibility of this hypothesis will be supported in a negative way, by identifying some deficiencies in the studies that connect Heidegger with Malick, and in a subsequent positive way, by analysing the meaning of his films from the experience of religious conversion that they seem to elicit in their viewers.

TI  - Land Cover Classification by Integrating NDVI Time Series and GIS Data to Evaluate Water Circulation in Aso Caldera, Japan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands in Aso caldera, Japan, are a type of land cover that is integral for biodiversity, tourist attractions, agriculture, and groundwater recharge. However, the area of grasslands has been decreasing in recent years as a result of natural disasters and changes in social conditions surrounding agriculture. The question of whether the decrease in spring water discharge in Aso caldera is related to the decrease in grasslands remains unanswered. To clarify this relationship, a water circulation model that considers land covers with different hydrological features is needed. In this study, by integrating Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and Geographic Information System (GIS) data, we generated land cover maps from the past (in 1981 and 1991) to the present (in 2015 and 2016), before and after the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, and then for the future (in the 2040s); these maps formed the dataset for building a water circulation model. The results show that the area of grasslands, which are reported to have a higher groundwater recharge rate than that of forests, in 2016 had decreased to 68% of the area in 1981 as a result of afforestation and transformation into forests, as well as landslides induced by the earthquake. The area of grasslands is predicted to further drop to 60% by the 2040s. On the other hand, the area of forests (conifers and hardwoods) in 2016 had increased by 119% relative to that in 1981 because of the transformation of grasslands into forests, although these areas decreased as a result of landslides due to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake. Quantification of groundwater recharge from grasslands and forests using the land cover maps generated for 1981, 1996, 2015, and 2016 shows that the annual increase in precipitation in these years significantly affected groundwater recharge; these effects were greater than those associated with the type of land cover. Thus, the groundwater recharge increased, despite the decrease in grasslands. However, when constant precipitation was assumed, the groundwater recharge presented a decreasing trend, indicating the importance of maintaining and conserving grasslands from the viewpoint of groundwater conservation.

TI  - Attraction Versus Capture II: Efficiency of the BG-Sentinel Trap Under Semifield Conditions and Characterizing Response Behaviors of Male <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes aegypti (L.) is an important vector of viruses causing dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever and as such presents a serious threat to public health in tropical regions. Control programs involving 'rear and release' of modified male Ae. aegypti are underway and require effective trapping methods for surveillance of both the released insects and the impacted wild mosquito population. The BG-Sentinel trap (BGS) is widely used in Ae. aegypti surveillance but its level of efficiency, that is, what proportion of the mosquitoes encountering the trap are captured, is unknown. This is especially true for male mosquitoes, the behavior of which is incompletely understood. We tested the efficiency of two versions of the BGS for capturing male Ae. aegypti under semifield conditions with and without CO2 and a human skin odor mimic lure and with these baits combined. A navy-blue BGS trap emitting CO2 and a human skin odor mimic captured 18% of the released male Ae. aegypti, with a capture efficiency of 9 % (of the total encounters with the trap). Male Ae. aegypti had multiple encounters with the BGS that did not result in capture; they crossed over the trap entrance without being captured or landed on the sides of the trap. Swarming behavior around the BGS was also recorded, even when only a visual cue was present. Understanding male Ae. aegypti behaviors during an encounter with the BGS can inform improvement of trap design and therefore capture efficiency for surveillance in control programs.

TI  - Using Machine Learning for Estimating Rice Chlorophyll Content from In Situ Hyperspectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll is an essential pigment for photosynthesis in crops, and leaf chlorophyll content can be used as an indicator for crop growth status and help guide nitrogen fertilizer applications. Estimating crop chlorophyll content plays an important role in precision agriculture. In this study, a variable, rate of change in reflectance between wavelengths 'a' and 'b' (RCRWa-b), derived from in situ hyperspectral remote sensing data combined with four advanced machine learning techniques, Gaussian process regression (GPR), random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), and gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), were used to estimate the chlorophyll content (measured by a portable soil-plant analysis development meter) of rice. The performances of the four machine learning models were assessed and compared using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R-2). The results revealed that four features of RCRWa-b, RCRW551.0-565.6, RCRW739.5-743.5, RCRW684.4-687.1 and RCRW667.9-672.0, were effective in estimating the chlorophyll content of rice, and the RFR model generated the highest prediction accuracy (training set: RMSE = 1.54, MAE =1.23 and R-2 = 0.95; validation set: RMSE = 2.64, MAE = 1.99 and R-2 = 0.80). The GPR model was found to have the strongest generalization (training set: RMSE = 2.83, MAE = 2.16 and R-2 = 0.77; validation set: RMSE = 2.97, MAE = 2.30 and R-2 = 0.76). We conclude that RCRWa-b is a useful variable to estimate chlorophyll content of rice, and RFR and GPR are powerful machine learning algorithms for estimating the chlorophyll content of rice.

TI  - Selective Neck Dissection in Oral Cavity Cancer Is Not Without Morbidity
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to analyze the morbidity of selective neck dissection (SND) in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC). This is a cross-sectional study of 106 consecutive patients with T1 and T2 (AJCC seventh edition) stage cancers. Morbidity in terms of scar characteristics, cervical lymphedema, sensation, shoulder dysfunction, and smile asymmetry were analyzed. Scar outcomes were inferior in terms of poor complexion in 15 patients (14.2%), poor texture in 25 patients (23.6%), limited skin movement in 9 patients (8.5%), soft tissue deficit in 13 patients (12.3%), and lymphedema in 14 patients (13.2%). Smile asymmetry was seen in 29.2%. Shoulder dysfunction was seen in 7.5%. Patients who received adjuvant treatment had significant scar issues (p = 0.001), lymphedema (p < 0.001), and sensory issues (p = 0.003). SND in OCSCC is not without morbidity. Smile asymmetry was the commonest problem. Patients who got adjuvant treatment had significantly more morbidity.

TI  - Changes in Morphometric Meander Parameters and Prediction of Meander Channel Migration for the Alluvial Part of the Barak River
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - A common phenomenon associated with the alluvial river is its meandering action which leads to lateral migration and thus geomorphic hazards. Predicting and preventing this migration is both difficult and necessary. Barak river is one of the highly meandering rivers flowing through the alluvial plains of Assam, India. It is observed that there is a regular shifting of the river banks and development of cutoffs which create uncertainty to the people residing nearby. Therefore, in this study planform geometry and migration behaviour of the Barak river is examined considering 12 representative meandering reaches using multiperiod Landsat remote sensing images, field investigations of channel bed and bank properties and riparian vegetation cover. An attempt is made to describe and evaluate the empirical approach and time sequence extrapolation method to predict channel migration. Channel wavelength to channel width ratio ranges between 5.53 to 12.9, and the bend curvature ranges between 1.1 to 3.93. Rate of river migration varies between 0.54to 85.69 m/year. Sinuosity in most of the meandering reaches is greater than 1.5. Results show that lack of significant riparian vegetative cover, high precipitation and presence of fine sands with very low clay content are probably the main elements responsible for the planform changes. The results of the prediction of meander migration obtained from selected empirical methods show that only Nanson and Hickin method shows a moderate correlation with R-2=0.50. Time sequence extrapolation method was used to predict the radius of the best-fit circle for the year 2025 and 2030. Results of the time sequence extrapolation method indicate that the maximum and minimum radius of the best circle fit for the year 2025 is 1254m at reach-8 and 462m at reach-7 respectively, and maximum and minimum radius of the best circle fit for the year 2030 is 1319m at reach-8 and 387m at reach-12 respectively. It is believed that the outcomes of this study could form a base in river training works and in understanding and predicting the future dynamics and bank migration of this alluvial river and other river of similar geomorphic setting.

TI  - Development and function of human dendritic cells in humanized mice models
T2  - MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are sentinel cells of the immune system arising from hematopoietic stem cells. DCs play a key role in the regulation of both adaptive and innate lymphocyte responses. As such, experimental models enabling a thorough analysis of human DCs development and function are needed. Humanized mice models (termed collectively as HIS mice, or human immune system mice models) provide unique opportunities to model human hematopoiesis and tackle the function of human immune cell types in vivo. Here, we review experimental approaches enabling to recapitulate the ontogeny of DC subsets in HIS mice and discuss studies addressing the biology of human DC subsets implementing HIS mice models.

TI  - Maximum Likelihood Classification based on Classified Result of Boundary Mixed Pixels for High Spatial Resolution of Satellite Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Maximum Likelihood Classification: MLC based on classified result of boundary Mixed Pixels (Mixel) for high spatial resolution of remote sensing satellite images is proposed and evaluated with Landsat Thematic Mapper: TM images. Optimum threshold indicates different results for TM and Multi Spectral Scanner: MSS data. This may since the TM spatial resolution is 2.7 times finer than MSS, and consequently, TM imagery has more spectral variability for a class. The increase of the spectral heterogeneity in a class and the higher number of channels being used in the classification process may play significant role. For example, the optimum threshold for classifying an agricultural scene using MSS data is about 2.5 standard deviations, while that for TM corresponds to more than four standard deviations. This paper compares the optimum threshold between MSS and TM and suggests a method of using unassigned boundary pixels to determine the optimum threshold. Further, it describes the relationship of the optimum threshold to the class variance with a full illustration of TM data. The experimental conclusions suggest to the user some systematic methods for obtaining an optimal classification with MLC.

TI  - Evaluating Variable Selection and Machine Learning Algorithms for Estimating Forest Heights by Combining Lidar and Hyperspectral Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning has been employed for various mapping and modeling tasks using input variables from different sources of remote sensing data. For feature selection involving high- spatial and spectral dimensionality data, various methods have been developed and incorporated into the machine learning framework to ensure an efficient and optimal computational process. This research aims to assess the accuracy of various feature selection and machine learning methods for estimating forest height using AISA (airborne imaging spectrometer for applications) hyperspectral bands (479 bands) and airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) height metrics (36 metrics), alone and combined. Feature selection and dimensionality reduction using Boruta (BO), principal component analysis (PCA), simulated annealing (SA), and genetic algorithm (GA) in combination with machine learning algorithms such as multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), extra trees (ET), support vector regression (SVR) with radial basis function, and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) with trees (XGbtree and XGBdart) and linear (XGBlin) classifiers were evaluated. The results demonstrated that the combinations of BO-XGBdart and BO-SVR delivered the best model performance for estimating tropical forest height by combining lidar and hyperspectral data, with R-2 = 0.53 and RMSE = 1.7 m (18.4% of nRMSE and 0.046 m of bias) for BO-XGBdart and R-2 = 0.51 and RMSE = 1.8 m (15.8% of nRMSE and -0.244 m of bias) for BO-SVR. Our study also demonstrated the effectiveness of BO for variables selection; it could reduce 95% of the data to select the 29 most important variables from the initial 516 variables from lidar metrics and hyperspectral data.

TI  - Modernity and Prophetic Speech: The Ethical as <i>the</i> Impossible in the Post-Religious Vision of Kahlil Gibran
T2  - CONCENTRIC-LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper argues that an essential aspect of the bilingual oeuvre of Kahlil Gibran (1883-1931), the eminent Arab-American writer, lies in reinventing the religious in and against modernity by reclaiming its Abrahamic, prophetic mode of speech as a poetic form of enunciation. This literary and ethical enterprise is at once post-religious and post-Nietzschean in that it re-imagines the notion of God, in evolutionist terms, as a horizontal form of transcendence beyond the vertical metaphysics of creation, fatherhood and morality. This horizontalization of transcendence reclaims religion, with a particular focus on Islamic-Sufi concepts, beyond monotheism's worldview and eschatology. Hence the post in post-religious. Gibran's re-imagining, with and "after" Nietzsche, of God, the self and the world is much occasioned by modernity as it seeks to interrogate and disrupt its calculative and identitarian reason. Ultimately, this Gibranian prophetic vision is a poetic attempt to posit the impossible-not the nonpossible, but the utmost horizon of the possible-as an ethical alternative both to traditional morality and to modernity's calculative and rationalist reason.

TI  - Parameters of Different Cloud Types over the Natural Zones of Western Siberia According to MODIS Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The technique of studying seasonal variations in cloud parameters over regions of Western Siberia according to satellite data is presented. Five natural zones have been identified: tundra, forest tundra, swamps, taiga, and forest steppe. A combined "summer" and "winter" classification of cloudiness is introduced; the classification includes 16 and 12 cloud types, respectively. Cloudiness images are classified using an algorithm based on neural network technologies and fuzzy logic methods. Results of analysis of seasonal variations in some parameters of different types of cloudiness and their repeatability over the considered regions of western Siberia based on MODIS satellite data for 2017 are discussed. The dependences of the seasonal variability of cloudiness parameters agree well with known literature data on ground-based observations, which corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

TI  - Fully Automated Countrywide Monitoring of Fuel Break Maintenance Operations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fuel break (FB) networks are strategic locations for fire control and suppression. In order to be effective for wildfire control, they need to be maintained through regular interventions to reduce fuel loads. In this paper, we describe a monitoring system relying on Earth observations to detect fuel reduction inside the FB network being implemented in Portugal. Two fast automated pixel-based methodologies for monthly monitoring of fuel removals in FB are developed and compared. The first method (M1) is a classical supervised classification using the difference and postdisturbance image of monthly image composites. To take into account the impact of different land cover and phenology in the detection of fuel treatments, a second method (M2) based on an innovative statistical change detection approach was developed. M2 explores time series of vegetation indices and does not require training data or user-defined thresholds. The two algorithms were applied to Sentinel-2 10 m bands and fully processed in the cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine. Overall, the unsupervised M2, which is based on a Welch t-test of two moving window averages, gives better results than the supervised M1 and is suitable for an automated countrywide fuel treatment detection. For both methods, two vegetation indices, the Modified Excess of Green and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, were compared and exhibited similar performances.

TI  - Did the COVID-19 Lockdown-Induced Hydrological Residence Time Intensify the Primary Productivity in Lakes? Observational Results Based on Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has brought countries around the world to a standstill in the early part of 2020. Several nations and territories around the world insisted their population stay indoors for practicing social distance in order to avoid infecting the disease. Consequently, industrial activities, businesses, and all modes of traveling have halted. On the other hand, the pollution level decreased 'temporarily' in our living environment. As fewer pollutants are supplied in to the hydrosphere, and human recreational activities are stopped completely during the lockdown period, we hypothesize that the hydrological residence time (HRT) has increased in the semi-enclosed or closed lake bodies, which can in turn increase the primary productivity. To validate our hypothesis, and to understand the effect of lockdown on primary productivity in aquatic systems, we quantitatively estimated the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in different lake bodies using established Chl-a retrieval algorithm. The Chl-a monitored using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 sensor in the lake bodies of Wuhan, China, showed an elevated concentration of Chl-a. In contrast, no significant changes in Chl-a are observed for Vembanad Lake in India. Further analysis of different geo-environments is necessary to validate the hypothesis.

TI  - Carbon Storage Potential of Silvopastoral Systems of Colombia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Nine Latin American countries plan to use silvopastoral practices-incorporating trees into grazing lands-to mitigate climate change. However, the cumulative potential of scaling up silvopastoral systems at national levels is not well quantified. Here, we combined previously published tree cover data based on 250 m resolution MODIS satellite remote sensing imagery for 2000-2017 with ecofloristic zone carbon stock estimates to calculate historical and potential future tree biomass carbon storage in Colombian grasslands. Between 2000 and 2017, tree cover across all Colombian grasslands increased from 15% to 18%, with total biomass carbon (TBC) stocks increasing from 0.41 to 0.48 Pg. The range in 2017 carbon stock values in grasslands based on ecofloristic zones (5 to 122 Mg ha(-1)) suggests a potential for further increase. Increasing all carbon stocks to the current median and 75th percentile levels for the respective eco-floristic zone would increase TBC stocks by about 0.06 and 0.15 Pg, respectively. Incorporated into national C accounting, such Tier 2 estimates can set realistic targets for silvopastoral systems in nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) implementation plans in Colombia and other Latin American countries with similar contexts.

A sentinel paper showed that the use of intravenous (IV) cefazolin and metronidazole was associated with decreased rates of SSI compared with cefoxitin (6% vs 13%). We reviewed the association of SSI with prophylactic antibiotic choice. We specifically investigated the regimens of ceftriaxone and metronidazole IV, cefoxitin IV, or ertapenem.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective review of 532 colon surgeries between 2016 and 2018. Inclusion criteria were patients 18-89 years of age undergoing elective colon surgery who received ceftriaxone/metronidazole, cefoxitin, or ertapenem for prophylaxis. All emergent cases were excluded. This resulted in 241 elective colon cases for review. The primary endpoint was to determine if the use of ceftriaxone/metronidazole decreased the rate of SSI.ResultsIn total, there were 241 elective colon cases with 21 SSI. We compared SSI rates in the ceftriaxone/metronidazole group to those patients receiving either cefoxitin or ertapenem (4.5% vs 12.2%; P = .035). We then compared SSI in ceftriaxone/metronidazole to SSI in cefoxitin (4.5% vs 10%; P = .13). Finally, we compared SSI in the ceftriaxone/metronidazole group to SSI in the ertapenem group (4.5% vs 14%; P = .03). Comorbidities and underlying factors were similar across all antibiotic groups.ConclusionIn our experience, the use of ceftriaxone/metronidazole is associated with a decreased SSI rate. Furthermore, ceftriaxone/metronidazole use is superior to the use of ertapenem, with a trend toward superiority over cefoxitin. Based on this study, we recommend ceftriaxone/metronidazole as antibiotic prophylaxis for elective colon surgery.

TI  - Evaluation of Methods for Mapping the Snow Cover Area at High Spatio-Temporal Resolution with VENμS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The VEN mu S mission launched in 2017 provides multispectral optical images of the land surface with a 2-day revisit time at 5 m resolution for over 100 selected sites. A few sites are subject to seasonal snow accumulation, which gives the opportunity to monitor the variations of the snow cover area at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. However, the 12 spectral bands of VEN mu S only cover the visible and near-infrared region of the spectra while existing snow detection algorithms typically make use of a shortwave infrared band to determine the presence of snow. Here, we evaluate two alternative snow detection algorithms. The first one is based on a normalized difference index between the near-infrared and the visible bands, and the second one is based on a machine learning approach using the Theia Sentinel-2 snow products as training data. Both approaches are tested using Sentinel-2 data (as surrogate of VEN mu S data) as well as actual VEN mu S in the Pyrenees and the High Atlas. The results confirm the possibility of retrieving snow cover without SWIR with a slight loss in performance. As expected, the results confirm that the machine learning method provides better results than the index-based approach (e.g., an RMSE equal to the learning method 1.35% and for the index-based method 10.80% in the High Atlas.). The improvement is more evident in the Pyrenees probably due to the presence of vegetation which complicates the spectral signature of the snow cover area in VEN mu S images.

TI  - Oil Spill Detection of Kerch Strait in November 2007 from Dual-Polarized TerraSAR-X Image Using Artificial and Convolutional Neural Network Regression Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The oil spill is the main marine disaster. It is known that the data mining based method performs better in detecting oil than the traditional SAR based method to distinguish from lookalikes. Recently, artificial neural networks were employed to detect the oil spill. For that synthetic aperture radar intensity map, intensity texture map, co-polarized coherence map, co-polarized phase difference texture map, and digital elevation model was employed as input. The detection performance based on data mining largely depends on the used data, the characteristics of the study area, and the used model. Improving detection performance through various existing data mining models is a very important task since minor improvements in detection can have a significant impact on disaster damage mitigation. Artificial and convolutional neural network regression models were applied to detect the oil spill of Kerch strait in November 2007. The two models showed F1-scores of 0.832 and 0.823 respectively. The results of this study would contribute to monitor oil spill dynamic and mitigate damages caused by the oil spill.

T2  - ALTERNATIVE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article contextualises my perspectives of Indigenous knowledge within a cultural cosmology, used to address the suicide epidemic in an Indigenous Community in the Far North Queensland Tropics of Australia. I use my personal narrative from the philosophical standpoint theory of an Indigenous female with first-hand experience of living under the residues of the Queensland Government Act (1897). Through the lens of a social constructivist worldview and theoretical underpinnings of Indigenist research, I give honour to Indigenous knowledge, cultural values and privilege the voices of local people. As a PhD researcher at James Cook University, I apply to my research, "Healing after experiencing the suicide of a young person-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives informed by Indigenous Knowledges" with three Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities. This research also aligns itself to the JCU Strategic Intent, Peoples and Society in the Tropics.

TI  - Robust algorithm for estimating total suspended solids (TSS) in inland and nearshore coastal waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the challenging tasks in modern aquatic remote sensing is the retrieval of near-surface concentrations of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). This study aims to present a Statistical, inherent Optical property (IOP)-based, and muLti-conditional Inversion proceDure (SOLID) for enhanced retrievals of satellite-derived TSS under a wide range of in-water bio-optical conditions in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal waters. In this study, using a large in situ database (N > 3500), the SOLID model is devised using a three-step procedure: (a) water-type classification of the input remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), (b) retrieval of particulate backscattering (b(bp)) in the red or near-infrared (NIR) regions using semi-analytical, machine-learning, and empirical models, and (c) estimation of TSS from b(bp) via water-type-specific empirical models. Using an independent subset of our in situ data (N = 2729) with TSS ranging from 0.1 to 2626.8 [g/m(3)], the SOLID model is thoroughly examined and compared against several state-of-the-art algorithms (Miller and McKee, 2004; Nechad et al., 2010; Novoa et al., 2017; Ondrusek et al., 2012; Petus et al., 2010). We show that SOLID outperforms all the other models to varying degrees, i.e.,from 10 to> 100%, depending on the statistical attributes (e.g., global versus water-type-specific metrics). For demonstration purposes, the model is implemented for images acquired by the MultiSpectral Imager aboard Sentinel-2A/B over the Chesapeake Bay, San-Francisco-Bay-Delta Estuary, Lake Okeechobee, and Lake Taihu. To enable generating consistent, multimission TSS products, its performance is further extended to, and evaluated for, other missions, such as the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Sensitivity analyses on uncertainties induced by the atmospheric correction indicate that 10% uncertainty in R-rs leads to< 20% uncertainty in TSS retrievals from SOLID. While this study suggests that SOLID has a potential for producing TSS products in global coastal and inland waters, our statistical analysis certainly verifies that there is still a need for improving retrievals across a wide spectrum of particle loads.

TI  - Diagnostic value of frozen section examination of sentinel lymph nodes in early-stage cervical cancer at the time of ultrastaging
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. We aimed to assess the diagnostic value of frozen-section pathologic examination (FSE) of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in patients with early-stage cervical cancer.Methods. Two French prospective multicentric database on SLN biopsy for cervical cancer (SENTICOL I and II) were analysed. Patients with IA to IIA1 2018 FIGO stage, who underwent SLN biopsy with both FSE and ultrastaging examination were included.Results and discussion. Between 2005 and 2012, 313 patients from 25 centers fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Metastatic involvement of SLN was diagnosed in 52 patients (16.6%). Macrometastases, micrometastases and iso-lated tumor cells (ITCs) were found in 27,12 and 13 patients respectively. Among the 928 SLNs analysed, FSE identified 23 SLNs with macrometastases in 20 patients and 5 SLNs with micrometastases in 2 patients whereas no ITCs were identified. Ultrastaging of negative SLNs by FSE found macrometastases, micrometastases and ITCs in additional 7, 11 and 17 SLNs. Ultrastaging increased significantly the rate of patients with positive SLN from 7% to 16.6% (p b 0.0001).The sensitivity and the negative predictive value of FSE were 42.3% and 89.7% respectively or 56.4% and 94.1% if ITCs were excluded. False-negative cases were more frequent with tumor size >= 20 mm (OR = 4.46, 95%IC = [1.45-13.66], p = 0.01) and preoperative brachytherapy (OR = 4.47, 95%IC = [1.37-14.63], p = 0.01) and less frequent with patients included in higher volume center (N5 patients/year) (OR = 0.09, 95%IC = [0.02-0.51], p = 0.01).Conclusions. FSE of SLN had a low sensitivity for detecting micrometastases and ITCs and a high negative predictive value for SLN status. Clinical impact of false-negative cases has to be assessed by further studies. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Pre-operative surgical algorithm: sentinel lymph node biopsy as predictor of parametrial involvement in early-stage cervical cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Radical hysterectomy is the gold standard in the management of early-stage cervical cancer. Parametrectomy aims to remove occult disease but is associated with significant surgical morbidity. Avoiding unnecessary parametrectomy in a subset of patients at low risk of parametrial involvement may decrease the incidence of such morbidity. The purpose of this study was to identify patients at low risk of parametrial involvement in early-stage cervical cancer potentially eligible for less radical surgery based on pre-operative criteria and sentinel lymph node (SLN) status. Methods We performed an ancillary analysis of data from two prospective trials on sentinel node biopsy for cervical cancer (SENTICOL I and II). Patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) IA-IIA cervical cancer who underwent primary radical surgery and bilateral SLN mapping were identified between 2005 and 2012 from 25 French oncologic centers. Patients who underwent pre-operative brachytherapy or did not undergo radical surgery (simple trachelectomy, simple hysterectomy, or lymph node staging only) were excluded. Results Of 174 patients who fullfiled the inclusion criteria, 9 patients (5.2%) had parametrial involvement and 24 patients (13.8%) had positive SLN. Most patients had 2018 FIGO stage IB1 disease (86.1%) and squamous cell carcinomas (68.9%). Parametrial involvement was significantly associated with tumor size >= 20 mm on pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (adjusted odds ratio (ORa) 9.30, 95% CI 1.71 to 50.57, p=0.01) and micrometastic or macrometastatic SLN (ORa 8.98, 95% CI 1.59 to 50.84, p=0.01). Of 114 patients with tumors <20 mm on pre-operative MRI and negative SLN after ultrastaging, only one patient had parametrial involvement (0.9%). By triaging patients with both of these criteria in a two-step surgical procedure, unjustified and contra-indicated radical hysterectomy would have been avoided in 65.5% and 8.6% of cases, respectively. Conclusions Less radical surgery may be an option for patients with bilateral negative SLN after ultrastaging and tumors <20 mm. SLN status should be integrated into the decision-making process for tailored surgery in early-stage cervical cancer.

TI  - Assessing Climate Change Impact on Soil Salinity Dynamics between 1987-2017 in Arid Landscape Using Landsat TM, ETM plus and OLI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the climate change impact on the spatiotemporal soil salinity dynamics during the last 30 years (1987-2017) in the arid landscape. The state of Kuwait, located at the northwest Arabian Peninsula, was selected as a pilot study area. To achieve this, a Landsat- Operational Land Imager (OLI) image acquired thereabouts simultaneously to a field survey was preprocessed and processed to derive a soil salinity map using a previously developed semi-empirical predictive model (SEPM). During the field survey, 100 geo-referenced soil samples were collected representing different soil salinity classes (non-saline, low, moderate, high, very high and extreme salinity). The laboratory analysis of soil samples was accomplished to measure the electrical conductivity (EC-Lab) to validate the selected and used SEPM. The results are statistically analyzed (p< 0.05) to determine whether the differences are significant between the predicted salinity (EC-Predicted) and the measured ground truth (EC-Lab). Subsequently, the Landsat serial time's datasets acquired over the study area with the Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and OLI sensors during the last three decades over the intervals (1987, 1992, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 and 2017) were radiometrically calibrated. Likewise, the datasets were atmospherically and spectrally normalized by applying a semi-empirical line approach (SELA) based on the pseudo-invariant targets. Afterwards, a series of soil salinity maps were derived through the application of the SEPM on the images sequence. The trend of salinity changes was statistically tested according to climatic variables (temperatures and precipitations). The results revealed that the EC(-Predicted)validation display a best fits in comparison to the EC(-Lab)by indicating a good index of agreement (D= 0.84), an excellent correlation coefficient (R-2= 0.97) and low overall root mean square error (RMSE) (13%). This also demonstrates the validity of SEPM to be applicable to the other images acquired multi-temporally. For cross-calibration among the Landsat serial time's datasets, the SELA performed significantly with an RMSE <= +/- 5% between all homologous spectral reflectances bands of the considered sensors. This accuracy is considered suitable and fits well the calibration standards of TM, ETM+ and OLI sensors for multi-temporal studies. Moreover, remarkable changes of soil salinity were observed in response to changes in climate that have warmed by more than 1.1 degrees C with a drastic decrease in precipitations during the last 30 years over the study area. Thus, salinized soils have expanded continuously in space and time and significantly correlated to precipitation rates (R-2= 0.73 and D = 0.85).

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To discriminate between malignant or benign axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer using MRI, PET-CT, and sentinel lymph node biopsy.Study Design: Observational study.Place and Duration of Study: Department of General Surgery, Recep Tayyip Erdogan University School of Medicine, from January 2014 to March 2019.Methodology: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was carried out on 102 patients, who had locally advanced cases and had not previously received neoadjuvant therapy. Axillary lymph nodes pathology results were evaluated and compared with PET-CT and MRI findings.Results: PET-CT specificity was 93.18%, MRI specificity was 93.75%, and combined PET-CT and MRI specificity was 97.67%. PET-CT sensitivity was 81.03%, MRI sensitivity was 68.57%, and combined PET-CT and MRI sensitivity was 83.05%. For detecting the presence of axillary lymph node metastasis, there was a good correlation between histopathological results and the combined evaluation with PET-CT and MRI (kappa: 0.785, p <0.001). In combined PET-CT and MRI, short diamater mean values of lymph nodes in 10 patients, which could not detect lymph node metastases, were determined to be 5.2 +/- 0.9 mm.Conclusion: Combining PET-CT and MRI is superior to PET-CT or MRI imaging alone in distinguishing benign and malignant axillary lymph node; and contributes to deciding the approach to axillary lymph node surgery. Lymph node size is also important for this imaging method to determine benign and malignant nodes correctly.

TI  - Assessing reproductive effects on fish populations: an evaluation of methods to predict the reproductive strategy of fishes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many environmental monitoring programs include an assessment of the health of fish populations using a sentinel species and include an indicator of reproductive potential. Knowledge of the reproductive strategy of the fish species is critical for data interpretation but is not always known. The reproductive strategy of a species can be determined from detailed histological analyses of ovaries throughout the reproductive cycle; however, these studies can be costly and can delay the implementation of a monitoring program. Three quick and cost-effective methods of predicting the reproductive strategy (annual single spawning or annual multiple spawning) are evaluated in this study using predicted probabilities from binary logistic regression models as a means of classifying the reproductive strategies of 18 different fish species in Atlantic Canada. The first method was based on the hypothesis that the variability in the ovary weight-body weight relationship in prespawning females is higher in multiple spawners. This method did not have a good classification rate due to some multiple spawners having low variability. The other two methods involved predictor variables representing the proportion of oocytes in different stages of development and predictor variables representing the distribution of oocyte sizes during the prespawning season for 111 fish (25 different samples for species). Predicted probabilities from these regression models could be used to correctly classify the reproductive strategies of all 25 samples (development stage model) and all but one sample (oocyte size distribution model). These models can be used to estimate the reproductive strategy of a species from a single sample of fish collected during the prespawning period to support species selection and data interpretation in environmental monitoring programs.

TI  - Countertransference, Defense Mechanisms, and Vicarious Trauma in Work With Sexual Offenders
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PSYCHIATRY AND THE LAW
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to examine the associations between countertransference induced by sex offenders, defense mechanisms, and manifestations of vicarious trauma in forensic psychiatrists and psychologists. A cross-sectional study using a mixed-methods design was performed with 56 Brazilian forensic psychiatrists and psychologists from October 2016 to May 2017. Countertransference, defense mechanisms, and vicarious trauma were assessed with the Assessment of Countertransference Scale, the Defense Style Questionnaire-40, and the Trauma and Attachment Belief Scale (TABS), respectively. Qualitative data analysis based on grounded theory was also performed to explore the influence of sex-offender assessments on the experts' personal and professional lives. Positive and moderate correlations were found between feelings of indifference and the Other-Safety TABS subscale (rho .43, P < .01) and between immature defense mechanisms and TABS total score (rho .45, P < .01). Qualitative data revealed changes in the professionals' identity, worldview, and beliefs related to safety and trust. Specific maladaptive coping strategies, such as feelings of indifference and immature defenses, during the assessment of sex offenders were associated with manifestations of vicarious trauma in forensic psychiatrists and psychologists. These findings indicate the need for awareness and care about the forensic expert's mental health.

AB  - Copernicus is the European Union's Earth observation and monitoring programme that delivers data and information to better understand the Earth and sustainable manage the environment. Based on the processing of environmental data collected from Earth observation Sentinel satellites, contributing missions and in situ sensors, Copernicus services provide near-real-time data on a global level. From 2008 up to 2020, the expected investment of the European Commission and the European Space Agency in the Copernicus programme is EUR 8.2 billion. Copernicus services transform satellite and in situ data into value-added information by processing and analysing data - data sets that have been collected over the years have become comparable and searchable. The Copernicus programme has six services (land, marine, atmosphere, climate change, emergency, and security) that support the development of many applications by offering products to users in the geoinformatics sector through Geographic Information System (GIS). As of June 2018, Copernicus Data and Information Access Services are operational through five access platforms known as DIAS. Cloud-based platforms have been developed to facilitate and standardize access to Copernicus data and information. Because DIAS platforms provide mass storage and data processing services, users can access information from a singleentry point. The Copernicus programme provides and, in the future, will provide even more new business opportunities for development in many areas such as environmental protection, urban management, spatial planning, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, transport, climate change, tourism, etc.

TI  - <i>Nepantla</i> Environmentalism: Challenging Dominant Frameworks for Green Religion
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholarship on religious environmentalism and green religion in the United States has privileged the actions of progressive white activists who view nature through an Enlightenment framework. In response to a call in the 2015 JAAR's roundtable on climate destabilization and religion to engage in discourse about "the myriad causes and myriad possible solutions to our environmental crisis," this article examines religious environmentalism from a nondominant perspective. Based on ethnographic research among Latinx churchgoing Catholics in Los Angeles, I have identified a widespread ethic of living lightly on the earth, which I call nepantla environmentalism. It is grounded in an immanent, relational worldview in which God is present in the material and the human-nature boundary is porous. A focus on nepantla environmentalism calls attention to the raced and classed biases embedded in dominant understandings of green religion in the United States. It demonstrates that there are different ways of being a religious environmentalist.

TI  - Recent trends and remaining challenges for optical remote sensing of Arctic tundra vegetation: A review and outlook
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - A systematic review and inventory of recent research relating to optical remote sensing of Arctic vegetation was conducted, and thematic and geographical trends were summarized. Research was broadly categorized into four major themes of (1) time series, including NDVI trends and shrub expansion; (2) disturbance and recovery, including tundra fires, winter warming, herbivory, permafrost disturbance, and anthropogenic change; (3) vegetation properties, including biomass, primary productivity, seasonality, phenology, and pigments; and (4) classification and mapping. Remaining challenges associated with remote sensing of Arctic vegetation were divided into three categories and discussed. The first are issues related to environmental controls including disturbance, hydrology, plant functional types, phenology and the tundra-taiga ecotone, and understanding their influence on interpretation and validation of derived remote sensing trends. The second are issues of upscaling and extrapolation related to sensor physics and the comparability of data from multiple spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. The final category identifies more philosophical challenges surrounding the future of data accessibility, big data analysis, sharing and funding policies among major data providers such as national space agencies and private companies, as well as user groups in the public and private sectors. The review concludes that the best practices for the advancement of optical remote sensing of Arctic vegetation include (1) a continued effort to share and improve in situ-validated datasets using camera networks and small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, (2) data fusion with non-optical data, (3) sensor continuity, consistency, and comparability, and (4) free availability and increased sharing of data. These efforts are necessary to generate high quality, temporally dense datasets for identifying trends in Arctic tundra vegetation.

TI  - Potential strategies for prevention of tumor spillage in minimally invasive radical hysterectomy
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The publication of a prospective [1] and several retrospective [2,3] studies describing a worse prognosis in patients affected with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent a minimally invasive radical hysterectomy has raised a high concern in what measures should be undertaken in order to revert these results. Potential strategies [4] to prevent tumor spillage have been previously proposed.Methods: In this video, we describe nine strategies that should be addressed in future trials regarding this procedure.Results: These strategies are:1. Fallopian tubes should be coagulated prior to start the surgery.2. All sentinel lymph nodes and lymphadenectomy specimens should be obtained without lymph nodes fragmentation.3. All surgical specimens should be extracted within a containment bag.4. Uterine manipulators must never be used.5. Prior to vaginal section, a closed knotted ligature should be placed around the vagina, proximal to the section line, and the remaining vaginal cavity profusely washed.6. Once the vagina is opened, the surgical specimen should be extracted vaginally within a specimen retrieval bag.7. After surgery, the pelvic cavity is profusely washed with physiological serum, and the vagina should be washed with iodopovidone diluted to 10% [5].8. Port-site metastasis prevention measures should be performed.9. Every action made to prevent tumor spillage should be recorded in the surgical report.Conclusion: As there is a biological rationale in these measures that would prevent tumor spillage and seeding, there is a need of prospectively exploring them within appropriate studies in order to determine their own oncological outcome.

TI  - Automating Drone Image Processing to Map Coral Reef Substrates Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - While coral reef ecosystems hold immense biological, ecological, and economic value, frequent anthropogenic and environmental disturbances have caused these ecosystems to decline globally. Current coral reef monitoring methods include in situ surveys and analyzing remotely sensed data from satellites. However, in situ methods are often expensive and inconsistent in terms of time and space. High-resolution satellite imagery can also be expensive to acquire and subject to environmental conditions that conceal target features. High-resolution imagery gathered from remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS or drones) is an inexpensive alternative; however, processing drone imagery for analysis is time-consuming and complex. This study presents the first semi-automatic workflow for drone image processing with Google Earth Engine (GEE) and free and open source software (FOSS). With this workflow, we processed 230 drone images of Heron Reef, Australia and classified coral, sand, and rock/dead coral substrates with the Random Forest classifier. Our classification achieved an overall accuracy of 86% and mapped live coral cover with 92% accuracy. The presented methods enable efficient processing of drone imagery of any environment and can be useful when processing drone imagery for calibrating and validating satellite imagery.

M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this article is to contextualize analytically and critically the emergence of Martin Heidegger's work, Being and Time. The peculiarity of the task in question will be that this contextualization, far from being constructed from exogenous data of this work, will be carried out from the analytical and critical considerations that Heidegger made explicit or allowed to glimpse in that text. Through this approach, not only is it intended to show what happened around the epoch of the author in question, but also how his knowledge of the social, political and scientific problematics of his time contributed to the selection of his object of study and the issues to treat its proper treatment.

TI  - Deriving a Frozen Area Fraction From Metop ASCAT Backscatter Based on Sentinel-1
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface state data derived from spaceborne microwave sensors with suitable temporal sampling are to date only available in low spatial resolution (25-50 km). Current approaches do not adequately resolve spatial heterogeneity in landscape-scale freeze-thaw processes. We propose to derive a frozen fraction instead of binary freeze-thaw information. This introduces the possibility to monitor the gradual freezing and thawing of complex landscapes. Frozen fractions were retrieved from Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT, C-band) backscatter on a 12.5-km grid for three sites in noncontinuous permafrost areas in northern Finland and the Austrian Alps. To calibrate the retrieval approach, frozen fractions based on Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR, C-band) were derived for all sites and compared to ASCAT backscatter. We found strong relationships for ASCAT backscatter with Sentinel-1 derived frozen fractions (Pearson correlations of -0.85 to -0.96) for the sites in northern Finland and less strong relationships for the Alpine site (Pearson correlations -0.579 and -0.611, including and excluding forested areas). Applying the derived linear relationships, predicted frozen fractions using ASCAT backscatter values showed root mean square error (RMSE) values between 7.26% and 16.87% when compared with Sentinel-1 frozen fractions. The validation of the Sentinel-1 derived freeze-thaw classifications showed high accuracy when compared to in situ near-surface soil temperature (84.7%-94%). Results are discussed with regard to landscape type, differences between spring and autumn, and gridding. This article serves as a proof of concept, showcasing the possibility to derive frozen fraction from coarse spatial resolution scatterometer time series to improve the representation of spatial heterogeneity in landscape-scale surface state.

TI  - Hindcasting the 2017 dispersal of <i>Sargassum</i> algae in the Tropical North Atlantic
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2011, huge amounts of Sargassum algae are detected in the equatorial Atlantic, causing large strandings events on the coasts of the West Indies, Brazil and West Africa. The distribution of this stock shows strong annual and interannual variability, whose drivers are not settled yet. Here we use satellite Sargassum observations from MODIS and currents from an ocean reanalysis to simulate the passive transport of algae in 2017. Wind effect was necessary to fit the observed distribution. Simulations reasonably reproduce the satellite monthly distribution for up to seven months, confirming the prominent role of transport in the distribution cycle. Annual cycle appears as a zonal exchange between eastern (EAR) and western accumulation regions (WAR). EAR is well explained by advection alone, with sharp meridional distribution controlled by converging currents below the inter-tropical Convergence Zone. Instead, WAR is not explained by advection alone, suggesting local growth.

TI  - Deforestation and economic growth trends on oceanic islands highlight the need for meso-scale analysis and improved mid-range theory in conservation
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests both support biodiversity and provide a wide range of benefits to people at multiple scales. Global and national remote sensing analyses of drivers of forest change generally focus on broad-scale influences on area (composition), ignoring arrangement (configuration). To explore meso-scale relationships, we compared forest composition and configuration to six indicators of economic growth over 23 years (1992-2015) of satellite data for 23 island nations. Based on global analyses, we expected to find clear relationships between economic growth and forest cover. Eleven islands lost 1 to 50% of forest cover, eight gained 1 to 28%, and four remained steady. Surprisingly, we found no clear relationship between economic growth trends and forest-cover change trajectories. These results differ from those of global land-cover change analyses and suggest that conservation-oriented policy and management approaches developed at both national and local scales are ignoring key meso-scale processes.

TI  - Impact of Catchment Discretization and Imputed Radiation on Model Response: A Case Study from Central Himalayan Catchment
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Distributed and semi-distributed hydrological modeling approaches commonly involve the discretization of a catchment into several modeling elements. Although some modeling studies were conducted using triangulated irregular networks (TINs) previously, little attention has been given to assess the impact of TINs as compared to the standard catchment discretization techniques. Here, we examine how different catchment discretization approaches and radiation forcings influence hydrological simulation results. Three catchment discretization methods, i.e., elevation zones (Hypsograph) (HYP), regular square grid (SqGrid), and TIN, were evaluated in a highly steep and glacierized Marsyangdi-2 river catchment, central Himalaya, Nepal. To evaluate the impact of radiation on model response, shortwave radiation was converted using two approaches: one with the measured solar radiation assuming a horizontal surface and another with a translation to slopes. The results indicate that the catchment discretization has a great impact on simulation results. Evaluation of the simulated streamflow value using Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and log-transformed Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (LnNSE) shows that highest model performance was obtained when using TIN followed by HYP (during the high flow condition) and SqGrid (during the low flow condition). Similar order of precedence in relative model performance was obtained both during the calibration and validation periods. Snow simulated from the TIN-based discretized models was validated with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow products. Critical Success Indexes (CSI) between TIN-based discretized model snow simulation and MODIS snow were found satisfactory. Bias in catchment average snow cover area from the models with and without using imputed radiation is less than two percent, but implementation of imputed radiation into the Statkraft Hydrological Forecasting Toolbox (Shyft) gives better CSI with MODIS snow.

TI  - Understanding the Effects of Optimal Combination of Spectral Bands on Deep Learning Model Predictions: A Case Study Based on Permafrost Tundra Landform Mapping Using High Resolution Multispectral Satellite Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning (DL) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been rapidly adapted in very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite image analysis. DLCNN-based computer visions (CV) applications primarily aim for everyday object detection from standard red, green, blue (RGB) imagery, while earth science remote sensing applications focus on geo object detection and classification from multispectral (MS) imagery. MS imagery includes RGB and narrow spectral channels from near- and/or middle-infrared regions of reflectance spectra. The central objective of this exploratory study is to understand to what degree MS band statistics govern DLCNN model predictions. We scaffold our analysis on a case study that uses Arctic tundra permafrost landform features called ice-wedge polygons (IWPs) as candidate geo objects. We choose Mask RCNN as the DLCNN architecture to detect IWPs from eight-band Worldview-02 VHSR satellite imagery. A systematic experiment was designed to understand the impact on choosing the optimal three-band combination in model prediction. We tasked five cohorts of three-band combinations coupled with statistical measures to gauge the spectral variability of input MS bands. The candidate scenes produced high model detection accuracies for the F1 score, ranging between 0.89 to 0.95, for two different band combinations (coastal blue, blue, green (1,2,3) and green, yellow, red (3,4,5)). The mapping workflow discerned the IWPs by exhibiting low random and systematic error in the order of 0.17-0.19 and 0.20-0.21, respectively, for band combinations (1,2,3). Results suggest that the prediction accuracy of the Mask-RCNN model is significantly influenced by the input MS bands. Overall, our findings accentuate the importance of considering the image statistics of input MS bands and careful selection of optimal bands for DLCNN predictions when DLCNN architectures are restricted to three spectral channels.

TI  - Predicting Channel Conveyance and Characterizing Planform Using River Bathymetry via Satellite Image Compilation (RiBaSIC) Algorithm for DEM-Based Hydrodynamic Modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are widely used as a proxy for bathymetric data and several studies have attempted to improve DEM accuracy for hydrodynamic (HD) modeling. Most of these studies attempted to quantitatively improve estimates of channel conveyance (assuming a non-braided morphology) rather than accounting for the actual channel planform. Accurate representation of river conveyance and planform in a DEM is critical to HD modeling and can be achieved with a combination of remote sensing (e.g., satellite image) and field data, such as water surface elevation (WSE). Therefore, the objectives of this study are (i) to develop an algorithm for predicting channel conveyance and characterizing planform via satellite images and in situ WSE and (ii) to estimate discharge using the predicted conveyance via an HD model. The algorithm is named River Bathymetry via Satellite Image Compilation (RiBaSIC) and uses Landsat satellite imagery, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM, Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain (MERIT) DEM, and observed WSE. The algorithm is tested on four study areas along the Willamette River, Kushiyara River, Jamuna River, and Solimoes River. Channel slope and predicted hydraulic radius are subsequently estimated for approximating Manning's roughness factor. Two-dimensional HD models using DEMs modified by the RiBaSIC algorithm and corresponding Manning's roughness factors are employed for discharge estimation. The proposed algorithm can represent river planform and conveyance in single-channeled, meandering, wandering, and braided river reaches. Additionally, the HD models estimated discharge within 14-19% relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) in simulation of five years period.

TI  - Woody Aboveground Biomass Mapping of the Brazilian Savanna with a Multi-Sensor and Machine Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical savanna in Brazil known as the Cerrado covers circa 23% of the Brazilian territory, but only 3% of this area is protected. High rates of deforestation and degradation in the woodland and forest areas have made the Cerrado the second-largest source of carbon emissions in Brazil. However, data on these emissions are highly uncertain because of the spatial and temporal variability of the aboveground biomass (AGB) in this biome. Remote-sensing data combined with local vegetation inventories provide the means to quantify the AGB at large scales. Here, we quantify the spatial distribution of woody AGB in the Rio Vermelho watershed, located in the centre of the Cerrado, at a high spatial resolution of 30 metres, with a random forest (RF) machine-learning approach. We produced the first high-resolution map of the AGB for a region in the Brazilian Cerrado using a combination of vegetation inventory plots, airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, and multispectral and radar satellite images (Landsat 8 and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2). A combination of random forest (RF) models and jackknife analyses enabled us to select the best remote-sensing variables to quantify the AGB on a large scale. Overall, the relationship between the ground data from vegetation inventories and remote-sensing variables was strong (R-2= 0.89), with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 7.58 Mg ha(-1)and a bias of 0.43 Mg ha(-1).

TI  - Development and evaluation of an osteoarthritis risk model for integration into primary care health information technology
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We developed and evaluated a prognostic prediction model that estimates osteoarthritis risk for use by patients and practitioners that is designed to be appropriate for integration into primary care health information technology systems. Osteoarthritis, a joint disorder characterized by pain and stiffness, causes significant morbidity among older Canadians. Because our prognostic prediction model for osteoarthritis risk uses data that are readily available in primary care settings, it supports targeting of interventions delivered as part of clinical practice that are aimed at risk reduction.Methods: We used the CPCSSN (Canadian Primary Sentinel Surveillance Network) database, which contains aggregated electronic health information from a cohort of primary care practices, to develop and evaluate a prognostic prediction model to estimate 5-year osteoarthritis risk, addressing contextual challenges of data availability and missingness. We constructed a retrospective cohort of 383,117 eligible primary care patients who were included in the cohort if they had an encounter with their primary care practitioner between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010. Patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis of osteoarthritis prior to their first visit in this time period. Incident cases of osteoarthritis were observed. The model was constructed to predict incident osteoarthritis based on age, sex, BMI, previous leg injury, and osteoporosis. Evaluation of the model used internal 10-fold cross-validation; we argue that internal validation is particularly appropriate for a model that is to be integrated into the same context from which the data were derived.Results: The resulting prediction model for 5-year risk of osteoarthritis diagnosis demonstrated state-of-the-art discrimination (estimated AUROC 0.84) and good calibration (assessed visually.) The model relies only on information that is readily available in Canadian primary care settings, and hence is appropriate for integration into Canadian primary care health information technology.Conclusions: If the contextual challenges arising when using primary care electronic medical record data are appropriately addressed, highly discriminative models for osteoarthritis risk may be constructed using only data commonly available in primary care. Because the models are constructed from data in the same setting where the model is to be applied, internal validation provides strong evidence that the resulting model will perform well in its intended application.

TI  - Influence of Spatial Resolution on Remote Sensing-Based Irrigation Performance Assessment Using WaPOR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyses the effect of the spatial assessment scale on irrigation performance indicators in small and medium-scale agriculture. Three performance indicators-adequacy (i.e., sufficiency of water use to meet the crop water requirement), equity (i.e., fairness of irrigation distribution), and productivity (i.e., unit of physical crop production/yield per unit water consumption)-are evaluated in five irrigation schemes for three spatial resolutions-250 m, 100 m, and 30 m. Each scheme has varying plot sizes and distributions, with average plot sizes ranging from 0.2 ha to 13 ha. The datasets are derived from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) water productivity through open access of remotely sensed-derived data (the Water Productivity Open Access Portal-WaPOR) database. Irrigation indicators performed differently in different aspects; for adequacy, all three resolutions show similar spatial trends for relative evapotranspiration (ET) across levels for all years. However, the estimation of relative ET is often higher at higher resolution. In terms of equity, all resolutions show similar inter-annual trends in the coefficient of variation (CV); higher resolutions usually have a higher CV of the annual evapotranspiration and interception (ETIa) while capturing more spatial variability. For productivity, higher resolutions show lower crop water productivity (CWP) due to higher aboveground biomass productivity (AGBP) estimations in lower resolutions; they always have a higher CV of CWP. We find all resolutions of 250 m, 100 m, and 30 m suitable for inter-annual and inter-scheme assessments regardless of plot size. While each resolution shows consistent temporal trends, the magnitude of the trend in both space and time is smoothed by the 100 m and 250 m resolution datasets. This frequently results in substantial differences in the irrigation performance assessment criteria for inter-plot comparisons; therefore, 250 m and 100 m are not recommended for inter-plot comparison for all plot sizes, particularly small plots (<2 ha). Our findings highlight the importance of selecting the spatial resolution appropriate to scheme characteristics when undertaking irrigation performance assessment using remote sensing.

TI  - Science-Driven Societal Transformation, Part I: Worldview
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Humanity faces serious social and environmental problems, including climate change and biodiversity loss. Increasingly, scientists, global policy experts, and the general public conclude that incremental approaches to reduce risk are insufficient and transformative change is needed across all sectors of society. However, the meaning of transformation is still unsettled in the literature, as is the proper role of science in fostering it. This paper is the first in a three-part series that adds to the discussion by proposing a novel science-driven research-and-development program aimed at societal transformation. More than a proposal, it offers a perspective and conceptual framework from which societal transformation might be approached. As part of this, it advances a formal mechanics with which to model and understand self-organizing societies of individuals. While acknowledging the necessity of reform to existing societal systems (e.g., governance, economic, and financial systems), the focus of the series is on transformation understood as systems change or systems migration-the de novo development of and migration to new societal systems. The series provides definitions, aims, reasoning, worldview, and a theory of change, and discusses fitness metrics and design principles for new systems. This first paper proposes a worldview, built using ideas from evolutionary biology, complex systems science, cognitive sciences, and information theory, which is intended to serve as the foundation for the R&D program. Subsequent papers in the series build on the worldview to address fitness metrics, system design, and other topics.

TI  - Albedo Retrieval From Sentinel-2 by New Narrow-to-Broadband Conversion Coefficients
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo in the rural and urban environment is one of the most influencing parameters in the evaluation of the radiative forcing of the land surface. Satellite remote sensing is an efficient tool for surface broadband albedo estimation with various spatial resolutions. Different retrieval algorithms were proposed and tested in the literature. This letter focuses on the narrow-to-broadband conversion algorithm applied to Sentinel-2 reflective data, using its best spatial resolution (10 m). New narrow-to-broadband coefficients for albedo retrieval were computed. Their accuracy was tested with ground-based measurements in two different environments and compared with another algorithm introduced in the literature. The application of these coefficients for the albedo estimation requires the assumption of Lambertian surface and clear sky conditions. The first test was performed on six field stations of the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD), and the second test was carried out within an urban area (Perugia, Central Italy), to better evaluate the impact of the spatial resolution on the albedo estimation from spaceborne sensors. The obtained root mean square error (RMSE) for the two tests presented very good values for both algorithms (around 0.02), with a slightly better performance of the proposed coefficients, especially for the higher albedo values. In the urban test, the retrieved albedo from Sentinel-2 with a 10-m pixel size provided considerably better results than the Landsat 8 estimation (30-m), highlighting the benefit of using a finer resolution in heterogeneous environments.

TI  - Assessment of riverbank erosion and erosion probability using geospatial approach: a case study of the Subansiri River, Assam, India
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Riverbank erosion is one of the key geomorphological problems encountered in the floodplains of the alluvial rivers. Many recent studies on fluvial dynamics have indicated advantages of geospatial technology over traditional techniques in terms of time, cost, and practical usability by the end-users. This study aims to assess the riverbank erosion and erosion probability in a highly dynamic and unstable stretch of the Subansiri River in Assam (India) using geospatial approach along with the Graf's model. Temporal Landsat datasets for a period of 29 years (1989 to 2017) in time step of 4-5 years are used for mapping the river channels (active floodplains) of the Subansiri River. These river channel datasets were then analyzed to spatially quantify the erosion/aggradation and identify the high riverbank erosion zones. Identification and analysis of the high riverbank erosion zones revealed a general westward shift of the Subansiri River during the studied period. The Graf's model, used for estimating the riverbank erosion probability, is implemented in geographical information system (GIS). The transition probability matrices for riverbank erosion were generated for different time spans (1989-1994, 1994-1998, 1998-2002, 2002-2006, 2006-2010, and 2010-2014) using the distance to river channel and erosion/aggradation maps prepared using remote sensing data. Flood recurrence intervals of the annual floods from 1988 to 2017 were estimated using observed discharge data. The transition matrices and flood recurrence intervals were then used to calibrate the Graf's model for estimating the probability of riverbank erosion of the Subansiri River. The results were validated with observed erosion/aggradation map of 2014-2017 time period. The study demonstrates the strength of geospatial approach for rapid assessment of riverbank erosion of alluvial channels. The calibrated Graf's model developed in this study along with understanding of the migration behavior of the Subansiri River will be useful for taking mitigation measures and planning river management strategies.

TI  - Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Canopy Water Content Estimation in Croplands through Radiative Transfer Model Inversion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the potential implications of a cropland canopy water content (CCWC) thematic product, no global remotely sensed CCWC product is currently generated. The successful launch of the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) in 2012, Sentinel-2A Multispectral Instrument (MSI) in 2015, followed by Sentinel-2B in 2017, make possible the opportunity for CCWC estimation at a spatial and temporal scale that can meet the demands of potential operational users. In this study, we designed and tested a novel radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion technique to combine multiple sources ofa prioridata in a look-up table (LUT) for inverting the NASA Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) product for CCWC estimation. This study directly builds on previous research for testing the constraint of the leaf parameter (N-s) in PROSPECT, by applying those constraints in PRO4SAIL in an agricultural setting where the variability of canopy parameters are relatively minimal. In total, 225 independent leaf measurements were used to train the LUTs, and 102 field data points were collected over the 2015-2017 growing seasons for validating the inversions. The results confirm increasinga prioriinformation and regularization yielded the best performance for CCWC estimation. Despite the relatively low variable canopy conditions, the inclusion ofN(s)constraints did not improve the LUT inversion. Finally, the inversion of Sentinel-2 data outperformed the inversion of Landsat-8 in the HLS product. The method demonstrated ability for HLS inversion for CCWC estimation, resulting in the first HLS-based CCWC product generated through RTM inversion.

TI  - Clinicopathological Features and Prognostic Factors of Primary Acral Melanomas in Caucasians
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Cutaneous melanomas located on the acral part of extremities (hand and foot melanoma; HFM) comprise a rare group within all melanomas in Caucasians. HFM is associated with a poor prognosis. We aimed to evaluate clinicopathological features, long-term outcomes, and prognostic factors in primary HFM in Caucasians. Methods: Medical records of all consecutive patients treated between 1997 and 2014 were revised. Patients were diagnosed with primary cutaneous melanoma at I-II clinical stage, and sentinel lymph node biopsy was conducted. The analysis was performed to define the clinicopathological factors influencing outcomes in the HFM and subungual cohort. Among 2537 consecutive patients diagnosed with primary cutaneous melanoma, 247 cases of HFM (9.7%) were found, with a median follow-up time of 7.8 years. Results: Median primary tumor Breslow thickness in subungual melanomas and HFMs was 4.0 mm and 3.3 mm, respectively, significantly higher than in the entire population (median 2.2 mm;p< 0.01). In the HFM group, 37.6% of tumors were ulcerated. Metastases to sentinel lymph node (SLN) were found in 28.3% of HFMs. The 10-year overall survival rate in the HFM group and subungual melanomas was 48.1% and 49.3%, respectively, compared to 63.0% in non-HFM melanomas. Conclusions: Our results confirm that patients with HFMs display worse overall survival compared to the entire melanoma population, with male gender and positive SLN biopsy status acting as independent negative prognostic factors.

TI  - Investigating the Impact of Digital Elevation Models on Sentinel-1 Backscatter and Coherence Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne remote sensing can track ecosystems changes thanks to continuous and systematic coverage at short revisit intervals. Active remote sensing from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors allows day and night imaging as they are not affected by cloud cover and solar illumination and can capture unique information about its targets. However, SAR observations are affected by the coupled effect of viewing geometry and terrain topography. The study aims to assess the impact of global digital elevation models (DEMs) on the normalization of Sentinel-1 backscattered intensity and interferometric coherence. For each DEM, we analyzed the difference between orbit tracks, the difference with results obtained with a high-resolution local DEM, and the impact on land cover classification. Tests were carried out at two sites located in mountainous regions in Romania and Spain using the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, 30 m), AW3D (ALOS (Advanced Land Observation Satellite) World 3D, 30 m), TanDEM-X (12.5, 30, 90 m), and Spain national ALS (aerial laser scanning) based DEM (5 m resolution). The TanDEM-X DEM was the global DEM most suitable for topographic normalization, since it provided the smallest differences between orbital tracks, up to 3.5 dB smaller than with other DEMs for peak landform, and 1.4-1.9 dB for pit and valley landforms.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality retrieval of land surface phenology (LSP) is increasingly important for understanding the effects of climate change on ecosystem function and biosphere-atmosphere interactions. We analyzed four state-of-the-art phenology methods: threshold, logistic-function, moving-average and first derivative based approaches, and retrieved LSP in the North Hemisphere for the period 1999-2017 from Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) SPOT-VEGETATION and PROBA-V leaf area index (LAI) 1 km V2.0 time series. We validated the LSP estimates with near-surface PhenoCam and eddy covariance FLUXNET data over 80 sites of deciduous forests. Results showed a strong correlation (R-2 > 0.7) between the satellite LSP and ground-based observations from both PhenoCam and FLUXNET for the timing of the start (SoS) and R-2 > 0.5 for the end of season (EoS). The threshold-based method performed the best with a root mean square error of similar to 9 d with PhenoCam and similar to 7 d with FLUXNET for the timing of SoS (30th percentile of the annual amplitude), and similar to 12 d and similar to 10 d, respectively, for the timing of EoS (40th percentile).

TI  - Desiccating Lake Urmia: A New Dust Source of Regional Importance
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Urmia (LU) in northwestern Iran has largely shrunk over the last two decades. The emerged bare, salty soil could turn into a threatening new dust source for the densely populated region around it. To quantify LU as a dust source, we examined the satellite data for 2000-2017 using an extended dust source enhancement technique. Our results indicate that the number of dust events increased with a significant inverse correlation to the lake area. We investigated over 2000 satellite images encompassing LU to find the sources of the dust. We present new satellite images showing the first strong evidence that the dried area of the lake has become an active dust source of regional importance. The critical dust sources were found close to LU. If the negative trend of LU surface area remains unchanged, more intensive and frequent dust events are expected, which will negatively impact a larger area surrounding LU.

TI  - Nanoparticles for Cerenkov and Radioluminescent Light Enhancement for Imaging and Radiotherapy
T2  - NANOMATERIALS
M3  - Review
AB  - Cerenkov luminescence imaging and Cerenkov photodynamic therapy have been developed in recent years to exploit the Cerenkov radiation (CR) generated by radioisotopes, frequently used in Nuclear Medicine, to diagnose and fight cancer lesions. For in vivo detection, the endpoint energy of the radioisotope and, thus, the total number of the emitted Cerenkov photons, represents a very important variable and explains why, for example,Ga-68 is better than(18)F. However, it was also found that the scintillation process is an important mechanism for light production. Nanotechnology represents the most important field, providing nanosctructures which are able to shift the UV-blue emission into a more suitable wavelength, with reduced absorption, which is useful especially for in vivo imaging and therapy applications. Nanoparticles can be made, loaded or linked to fluorescent dyes to modify the optical properties of CR radiation. They also represent a useful platform for therapeutic agents, such as photosensitizer drugs for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Generally, NPs can be spaced by CR sources; however, for in vivo imaging applications, NPs bound to or incorporating radioisotopes are the most interesting nanocomplexes thanks to their high degree of mutual colocalization and the reduced problem of false uptake detection. Moreover, the distance between the NPs and CR source is crucial for energy conversion. Here, we review the principal NPs proposed in the literature, discussing their properties and the main results obtained by the proponent experimental groups.

TI  - Classification of Australian Waterbodies across a Wide Range of Optical Water Types
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Baseline determination and operational continental scale monitoring of water quality are required for reporting on marine and inland water progress to Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). This study aims to improve our knowledge of the optical complexity of Australian waters. A workflow was developed to cluster the modelled spectral response of a range of in situ bio-optical observations collected in Australian coastal and continental waters into distinct optical water types (OWTs). Following clustering and merging, most of the modelled spectra and modelled specific inherent optical properties (SIOP) sets were clustered in 11 OWTs, ranging from clear blue coastal waters to very turbid inland lakes. The resulting OWTs were used to classify Sentinel-2 MSI surface reflectance observations extracted over relatively permanent water bodies in three drainage regions in Eastern Australia. The satellite data classification demonstrated clear limnological and seasonal differences in water types within and between the drainage divisions congruent with general limnological, topographical, and climatological factors. Locations of unclassified observations can be used to inform where in situ bio-optical data acquisition may be targeted to capture a more comprehensive characterization of all Australian waters. This can contribute to global initiatives like the SDGs and increases the diversity of natural water in global databases.

TI  - Evaluation and validation of TAMSAT-ALERT soil moisture and WRSI for use in drought anticipatory action
T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable information on the likelihood of drought is of crucial importance in agricultural planning and humanitarian decision-making. Acting based upon probabilistic forecasts of drought, rather than responding to prevailing drought conditions, has the potential to save lives, livelihoods and resources, but is accompanied by the risk of acting in vain. The suitability of a novel forecasting tool is assessed in the present paper in terms of its ability to provide skilful information of the likelihood of drought impacts on crops and pasture within a timeframe that allows for anticipatory action. The Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data-AgriculturaL Early waRning sysTem (TAMSAT-ALERT) tool provides forecasts of seasonal mean soil moisture and the water requirement satisfaction index (WRSI). TAMSAT-ALERT metrics were found to be strongly correlated with pasture availability and maize yield in Kenya and provided skilful forecasts early in key seasons, allowing sufficient time for preparatory actions. Incorporating TAMSAT-ALERT forecasts in a layered approach, with actions triggered by spatiotemporally varying triggers and fundamentally informed by humanitarian actors, will provide reliable information on the likelihood of drought, ultimately mitigating food insecurity.

TI  - Combat Facial Fractures Sustained During Operation Resolute Support and Operation Freedom's Sentinel in Afghanistan
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionFacial fractures sustained in combat are generally unrepresentative of those commonly experienced in civilian practice. In the US military, acute trauma patient care is guided by the Joint Trauma System Clinical Practice Guidelines but currently none exists for facial trauma.Materials and methodsAll casualties that underwent surgery to facial fractures between January 01, 2016 and September 15, 2019 at a US deployed Military Treatment Facility in Afghanistan were identified using the operating room database. Surgical operative records and outpatient records for local Afghan nationals returning for follow-up were reviewed to determine outcomes.Results55 casualties underwent treatment of facial fractures; these were predominantly from explosive devices (27/55, 49%). About 46/55 (84%) were local nationals, of which 32 (70%) were followed up. Length of follow-up ranged between 1 and 25 months. About 36/93 (39%) of all planned procedures developed complications, with the highest being from ORIF mandible (18/23, 78%). About 8/23 (35%) casualties undergoing ORIF mandible developed osteomyelitis, of which 5 developed nonunion. Complications were equally likely to occur in those procedures for "battlefield type" events such as explosive devices and gunshot wounds (31/68, 46%) as those from "civilian type" events such as falls or motor vehicle collisions (5/11, 45%).ConclusionsComplications Rates from facial fractures were higher than that reported in civilian trauma. This likely reflects factors such as energy deposition, bacterial load, and time to treatment. Load sharing osteosynthesis should be the default modality for fracture fixation. External fixation should be considered in particular for complex high-energy or infected mandible fractures where follow-up is possible.

AB  - The severe accident at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (ChNPP) in 1986 resulted in extraordinary contamination of the surrounding territory, which necessitated the creation of the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone (ChEZ). During the accident, liquidation materials contaminated by radioactive fallout (e.g., contaminated soil and trees) were buried in so-called Radioactive Waste Temporary Storage Places (RWTSPs). The exact locations of these burials were not always sufficiently documented. However, for safety management, including eventual remediation works, it is crucial to know their locations and rely on precise hazard maps. Over the past 34 years, most of these so-called trenches and clamps have been exposed to natural processes. In addition to settlement and erosion, they have been overgrown with dense vegetation. To date, more than 700 burials have been thoroughly investigated, but a large number of burial sites (approximately 300) are still unknown. In the past, numerous burials were identified based on settlement or elevation in the decimeter range, and vegetation anomalies that tend to appear in the immediate vicinity. Nevertheless, conventional detection methods are time-, effort- and radiation dose-intensive. Airborne gamma spectrometry and visual ground inspection of morphology and vegetation can provide useful complementary information, but it is insufficient for precisely localizing unknown burial sites in many cases. Therefore, sensor technologies, such as UAV-based lidar and multispectral imagery, have been identified as potential alternative solutions. This paper presents a novel method to detect radioactive waste sites based on a set of prominent features generated from high-resolution remote sensing data in combination with a random forest (RF) classifier. Initially, we generate a digital terrain model (DTM) and 3D vegetation map from the data and derive tree-based features, including tree density, tree height, and tree species. Feature subsets compiled from normalized DTM height, fast point feature histograms (FPFH), and lidar metrics are then incorporated. Next, an RF classifier is trained on reference areas defined by visual interpretation of the DTM grid. A backward feature selection strategy reduces the feature space significantly and avoids overfitting. Feature relevance assessment clearly demonstrates that the members of all feature subsets represent a final list of the most prominent features. For three representative study areas, the mean overall accuracy (OA) is 98.2% when using area-wide test data. Cohens' kappa coefficient kappa ranges from 0.609 to 0.758. Additionally, we demonstrate the transferability of a trained classifier to an adjacent study area (OA = 93.6%, kappa = 0.452). As expected, when utilizing the classifier on geometrically incorrect and incomplete reference data, which were generated from old maps and orthophotos based on visual inspection, the OA decreases significantly to 65.1% (kappa = 0.481). Finally, detection is verified through 38 borings that successfully confirm the existence of previously unknown buried nuclear materials in classified areas. These results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is applicable to detecting area-wide unknown radioactive biomass burials in the ChEZ.

TI  - An up-to-date catalogue of urinary markers for the management of prostate cancer
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men. Poor specificity and sensitivity of total PSA often results in over and sometimes underdetection/treatment. Therefore, more specific and sensitive biomarkers for the detection and monitoring especially of clinically significant PCa as well as treatment-specific markers are much sought after. In this field, urine has emerged as a promising noninvasive source of biomarkers. Recent findings RNA-based biomarkers are the most extensively studied type of urinary nucleic acids. ERG-Score/MiPS (Mi-Prostate Score) and SelectMDx might be considered as additional parameters together with clinical and imaging modalities to decrease unnecessary biopsies. miR Sentinel Tests could make it possible to accurately detect the presence of cancer and to distinguish low-grade from high-grade disease. In men with previous negative biopsies, PCA3 may suggest the need to repeat biopsy. The definitive role of these markers and their clinical benefit needs future validation.

TI  - High Numbers and Densities of PD1<SUP>+</SUP>T-Follicular Helper Cells in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Draining Lymph Nodes Are Associated with Lower Survival
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) display distinct morphologic changes depending on the breast cancer subtype. For triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), draining LNs display a higher amount of secondary lymphoid follicles, which can be regarded as a surrogate marker for an activated humoral immune response. In the present study, we focus on PD1(+)T-follicular helper cells (Tfh) in TDLNs of TNBC, since PD1(+)Tfh are drivers of the germinal center (GC) reaction. We quantified PD1(+)Tfh in 22 sentinel LNs with 853 GCs and interfollicular areas from 19 patients with TNBC by morphometry from digitalized immunostained tissue sections. Overall survival was significantly worse for patients with a higher number and area density of PD1(+)Tfh within GCs of TDLNs. Further, we performed T-cell receptor gamma chain (TRG) analysis from microdissected tissue in the primary tumor and TDLNs. Eleven patients showed the same TRG clones in the tumor and the LN. Five patients shared the same TRG clones in the tumor and the GCs. In two patients, those clones were highly enriched inside the GCs. Enrichment of identical TRG clones at the tumor site vs. the TDLN was associated with improved overall survival. TDLNs are important relays of cancer immunity and enable surrogate approaches to predict the outcome of TNBC itself.

TI  - Nature tourism and mental health: parks, happiness, and causation
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Poor mental health costs about a tenth of global GNP. For many people, nature exposure improves mental health. This generates a newly recognised health service value for national parks worldwide, estimated at trillions of dollars annually. It creates a correspondingly large potential new market for commercial nature tourism, as a provider of nature therapies, especially in national parks. Before this opportunity can be realised, however, we must establish whether voluntary park visits generate mental health gains for everyone. Currently, psychology researchers and protected area managers hold opposing views. I therefore interviewed 238 outdoor nature and adventure tourists of all ages and backgrounds, at subtropical national parks in Queensland, Australia, to determine whether they visit parks because they are happy, or they are happy because they visit parks. A large majority, 82%, picked the latter. Of those asked, 87.5% reported short-term emotional benefits; 60%, medium-term recovery from stress; and 20%, long-term changes in worldview. Each timescale corresponds to a different opportunity for commercial nature tourism. Future research priorities include: economic scale; experiential components and commercial design for different market segments; comparisons of individual benefits for people with different personalities; and tests of mental health benefits for other types of tourism.

TI  - Spatial Agreement among Vegetation Disturbance Maps in Tropical Domains Using Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting disturbances in native vegetation is a crucial component of many environmental management strategies, and remote sensing-based methods are the most efficient way to collect multi-temporal disturbance data over large areas. Given that there is a large range of datasets for monitoring, analyzing, and detecting disturbances, many methods have been well-studied and successfully implemented. However, factors such as the vegetation type, input data, and change detection method can significantly alter the outcomes of a disturbance-detection study. We evaluated the spatial agreement of disturbance maps provided by the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm, evaluating seven spectral indices in three distinct vegetation domains in Brazil: Atlantic forest, savanna, and semi-arid woodland, by assessing levels of agreement between the outputs. We computed individual map accuracies based on a reference dataset, then ranked their performance, while also observing their relationships with specific vegetation domains. Our results indicated a low rate of spatial agreement among index-based disturbance maps, which itself was minimally influenced by vegetation domain. Wetness indices produced greater detection accuracies in comparison to greenness-related indices free of saturation. The normalized difference moisture index performed best in the Atlantic forest domains, yet performed poorest in semi-arid woodland, reflecting its specific sensitivity to vegetation and its water content. The normalized difference vegetation index led to high disturbance detection accuracies in the savanna and semi-arid woodland domains. This study offered novel insight into vegetation disturbance maps, their relationship to different ecosystem types, and corresponding accuracies. Distinct input data can produce non-spatially correlated disturbance maps and reflect site-specific sensitivity. Future research should explore algorithm limitations presented in this study, as well as the expansion to other techniques and vegetation domains across the globe.

TI  - Satellite Determination of Peatland Water Table Temporal Dynamics by Localizing Representative Pixels of A SWIR-Based Moisture Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) is a physically-based approach for remote soil moisture estimation. OPTRAM is based on the response of short-wave infrared (SWIR) reflectance to vegetation water status, which in turn responds to changes of root-zone soil moisture. In peatlands, the latter is tightly coupled to water table depth (WTD). Therefore, in theory, the OPTRAM index might be a useful tool to monitor WTD dynamics in peatlands, although the sensitivity of OPTRAM index to WTD changes will likely depend on vegetation cover and related rooting depth. In this study, we aim at identifying those locations (further called 'best pixels') where the OPTRAM index is most representative of overall peatland WTD dynamics. In peatlands, the high saturated hydraulic conductivity of the upper layer largely synchronizes the temporal WTD fluctuations over several kilometers, i.e., even though the mean and amplitude of the WTD dynamics may vary in space. Therefore, it can be assumed that the WTD time series, either measured at a single location or simulated for a grid cell with the PEATland-specific adaptation of the NASA Catchment Land Surface Model (PEATCLSM), are representative of the overall peatland WTD dynamics. We took advantage of this concept to identify the 'best pixel' of all spatially distributed OPTRAM pixels within a peatland, as that pixel with the highest time series Pearson correlation (R) with WTD data accounting for temporal autocorrelation. The OPTRAM index was calculated based on various remotely sensed images, namely, Landsat, MODIS, and aggregated Landsat images at MODIS resolution for five northern peatlands with long-term WTD records, including both bogs and fens. The 'best pixels' were dominantly covered with mosses and graminoids with little or no shrub or trees. However, the performance of OPTRAM highly depended on the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed data. The Landsat-based OPTRAM index yielded the highest R values (mean of 0.7 across the 'best pixels' in five peatlands). Our study further indicates that, in the absence of historical in situ data, PEATCLSM can be used as an alternative to localize 'best pixels'. This finding enables the future applicability of OPTRAM to monitor WTD changes in peatlands on a global scale.

TI  - Incorporating canopy structure from simulated GEDI lidar into bird species distribution models
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar began data acquisition from the International Space Station in March 2019 and is expected to make over 10 billion measurements of canopy structure and topography over two years. Previously, airborne lidar data with limited spatial coverage have been used to examine relationships between forest canopy structure and faunal diversity, most commonly bird species. GEDI's latitudinal coverage will permit these types of analyses at larger spatial extents, over the majority of the Earth's forests, and most importantly in areas where canopy structure is complex and/or poorly understood. In this regional study, we examined the impact that GEDI-derived Canopy Structure variables have on the performance of bird species distribution models (SDMs) in Sonoma County, California. We simulated GEDI waveforms for a two-year period and then interpolated derived Canopy Structure variables to three grid sizes of analysis. In addition to these variables, we also included Phenology, Climate, and other Auxiliary variables to predict the probability of occurrence of 25 common bird species. We used a weighted average ensemble of seven individual machine learning models to make predictions for each species and calculated variable importance. We found that Canopy Structure variables were, on average at our finest resolution of 250 m, the second most important group (32.5%) of predictor variables after Climate variables (35.3%). Canopy Structure variables were most important for predicting probability of occurrence of birds associated with Conifer forest habitat. Regarding spatial analysis scale, we found that finer-scale models more frequently performed better than coarser-scale models, and the importance of Canopy Structure variables was greater at finer spatial resolutions. Overall, GEDI Canopy Structure variables improved SDM performance for at least one spatial resolution for 19 of 25 species and thus show promise for improving models of bird species occurrence and mapping potential habitat.

TI  - Axillary ultrasound during neoadjuvant systemic therapy in triple-negative breast cancer patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To investigate the value of performing mid-treatment axillary ultrasound (AUS) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients who are undergoing neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) by determining the optimal cutoff number of abnormal nodes associated with residual nodal disease on surgical pathology.Materials and methods: This sub-study, an interim analysis of an ongoing single-institution clinical trial enrolling patients with stage I-III TNBC, included 106 patients. Number of abnormal nodes at mid-treatment was assessed and recorded by experienced breast radiologists, who empirically categorized lymph nodes using a binary approach of sonographically-normal versus abnormal. Pathologic lymph node positivity was defined as presence of macrometastasis or micrometastasis in >= 1 axillary node from sentinel lymph node biopsy and/or axillary lymph node dissection.Results: Of 106 patients, 26 (25 %) had residual nodal disease and 80 (75 %) had no nodal disease at surgery. Median number of abnormal nodes at mid-treatment was 5 (standard deviation [SD], 5) for patients with residual nodal disease and 0 (SD, 2) for patients with no nodal disease at surgery (p < 0.0001). TNBC patients with > 4 abnormal nodes at mid-treatment had a significantly higher chance of being node-positive at surgery (AUC = 0.908, p < 0.0001; PPV = 90 %).Conclusion: Our data suggest that a cutoff of > 4 abnormal nodes on mid-treatment AUS is associated with residual disease post-NAST. If our findings are substantiated by subsequent analyses, then mid-treatment AUS could be used to identify patients unlikely to achieve nodal pathologic complete response and who should be offered alternative therapy.

TI  - Predicting WNV Circulation in Italy Using Earth Observation Data and Extreme Gradient Boosting Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile Disease (WND) is one of the most spread zoonosis in Italy and Europe caused by a vector-borne virus. Its transmission cycle is well understood, with birds acting as the primary hosts and mosquito vectors transmitting the virus to other birds, while humans and horses are occasional dead-end hosts. Identifying suitable environmental conditions across large areas containing multiple species of potential hosts and vectors can be difficult. The recent and massive availability of Earth Observation data and the continuous development of innovative Machine Learning methods can contribute to automatically identify patterns in big datasets and to make highly accurate identification of areas at risk. In this paper, we investigated the West Nile Virus (WNV) circulation in relation to Land Surface Temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Surface Soil Moisture collected during the 160 days before the infection took place, with the aim of evaluating the predictive capacity of lagged remotely sensed variables in the identification of areas at risk for WNV circulation. WNV detection in mosquitoes, birds and horses in 2017, 2018 and 2019, has been collected from the National Information System for Animal Disease Notification. An Extreme Gradient Boosting model was trained with data from 2017 and 2018 and tested for the 2019 epidemic, predicting the spatio-temporal WNV circulation two weeks in advance with an overall accuracy of 0.84. This work lays the basis for a future early warning system that could alert public authorities when climatic and environmental conditions become favourable to the onset and spread of WNV.

TI  - Remote Sensing Classification of Aquatic Vegetation in Ulansuhai Lake Based on Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest natural wetland in the same latitude on the earth, water ecological environment of Ulansuhai Lake, China is seriously threatened, and there is various aquatic vegetation spread over the lake. Remote sensing is considered to be an effective way to map the distribution of aquatic vegetation. Different from the method used in most of the previous studies, discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm was used to identify and classify emergent vegetation (EV), yellow algae (YA), submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and water in Ulansuhai Lake based on Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) in this research. The classification results were validated by 284 investigation sites data and visual interpretation of Gao Fen 2 (GF-2) image. The results indicated that determination coefficient (R-2) for EV, YA, SAV and water were greater than 0.91, root mean square error (RMSE) were less than 0.025 km(2). Besides, the overall accuracy (95.4 %) and Kappa coefficient (0.93) of DPSO algorithm are superior to spectral index, unsupervised classification methods and supervised classification methods. In addition, DPSO algorithm to other regions (the Yellow Sea) and sensors (Sentinel-2) have been successfully applied, which further proves the applicability of DPSO algorithm. The research provides a new tool to assist people in locating and quantifying aquatic vegetation, so that purposeful actions can be taken to control the eutrophication of lake water and improve the water ecological environment.

TI  - Compact Cloud Detection with Bidirectional Self-Attention Knowledge Distillation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The deep convolutional neural network has made significant progress in cloud detection. However, the compromise between having a compact model and high accuracy has always been a challenging task in cloud detection for large-scale remote sensing imagery. A promising method to tackle this problem is knowledge distillation, which usually lets the compact model mimic the cumbersome model's output to get better generalization. However, vanilla knowledge distillation methods cannot properly distill the characteristics of clouds in remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel self-attention knowledge distillation approach for compact and accurate cloud detection, named Bidirectional Self-Attention Distillation (Bi-SAD). Bi-SAD lets a model learn from itself without adding additional parameters or supervision. With bidirectional layer-wise features learning, the model can get a better representation of the cloud's textural information and semantic information, so that the cloud's boundaries become more detailed and the predictions become more reliable. Experiments on a dataset acquired by GaoFen-1 satellite show that our Bi-SAD has a great balance between compactness and accuracy, and outperforms vanilla distillation methods. Compared with state-of-the-art cloud detection models, the parameter size and FLOPs are reduced by 100 times and 400 times, respectively, with a small drop in accuracy.

TI  - Handling the Class Imbalance in Land-Cover Classification Using Bagging-Based Semisupervised Neural Approach
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, a semisupervised neural network-based approach has been proposed for handling the class-imbalance problem in land-cover classification under a hybrid integration of selective undersampling, oversampling, and a bagging-based ensemble of classifiers. Here, a selective undersampling technique is utilized so as to minimize the loss of information from the majority classes; whereas, the minority class sizes are simultaneously increased by exploiting their presence in the unlabeled test samples. Finally, the imbalanced original training set along with the newly found minority samples is used to classify the remaining unlabeled samples from the test set. Experiments conducted on the patterns collected from multispectral (high as well as very high resolution images) and hyperspectral remote sensing satellite images show encouraging performance of the proposed scheme when compared to other state-of-the-art techniques.

TI  - A multi-level weighted transformation based neuro-fuzzy domain adaptation technique using stacked auto-encoder for land-cover classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this manuscript, a neuro-fuzzy domain adaptation (DA) technique has been proposed for a multi-level incremental transformation of the source-target features to find an intermediate space with lesser cross-domain distribution difference at each level. In the present investigation, the unsupervised layers of a stacked auto-encoder are used for granular transformation of the weighted samples (or group of samples) at every level. Out of the three, the first two layers of the stack involve unsupervised weighted transformation of source-target samples without using any labelled information from the target domain. After that, a fuzzy membership-based transfer learning scheme has been used to capture the target-distinctive information thereby facilitating a selective transformation between matching source-target sample groups in the third level. Finally, more accurate class-label predictions for the unknown target samples are obtained using the labelled source samples in the transformed (source-target) feature space. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experimentation has been carried out using samples collected from various multi-spectral satellite images captured over various source and target regions of India. The attained results show superior performance in target class prediction for the proposed DA scheme when compared to other state-of-the-art DA techniques for land-cover classification.

TI  - Multiscale and multitemporal surface temperature monitoring by satellite thermal infrared imagery at Mayon Volcano, Philippines
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mayon Volcano on eastern Luzon Island is the most active volcano in the Philippines. The high level of vulnerability to volcanic hazards is apparent since Mayon is surrounded by eight cities and municipalities with a total population of approximately one million inhabitants. Thus there is an urgent need to develop and expand reliable and affordable long-term methods in volcano monitoring. Despite abundant open access satellite dataset archives, satellite remote sensing has been underutilized in Mayon's hazard mapping and monitoring system. Here, we perform monitoring analysis on a nineteen-year time series of Land Surface Temperature (LST) obtained from satellite thermal infrared images. Both ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) thermal imagery (with 90 m spatial resolution) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) LST products (1 km spatial resolution) are used for the analysis. The Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) is applied as the decomposition tool to extract components of different timescales from the LST time series. Physical interpretation of decomposed 1ST components at various periods are explored and compared with Mayon's eruption records. Specifically, the LST annual period component is compared to regular annual cycle air temperature. Results show that LST annual period component tends to lose its regularity following an eruption. The dissimilarity of the two time series has been taken as an indicator of volcanic restlessness. Trends of different timescales based on LST components have been constructed, which all indicate the rising trend. This means that Mayon volcano will remain restless in the future decades. This study presents the advantages and effectiveness of satellite remote sensing on volcanic monitoring. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - High Resolution Geospatial Evapotranspiration Mapping of Irrigated Field Crops Using Multispectral and Thermal Infrared Imagery with METRIC Energy Balance Model
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial crop water use mapping is critical for field-scale site-specific irrigation management. Landsat 7/8 satellite imagery with a widely adopted METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration) energy balance model (LM approach) estimates accurate evapotranspiration (ET) but limits field-scale spatiotemporal (30 m pixel(-1), similar to 16 days) mapping. A study was therefore conducted to map actual ET of commercially grown irrigated-field crops (spearmint, potato, and alfalfa) at very high-resolution (7 cm pixel(-1)). Six small unmanned aerial system (UAS)-based multispectral and thermal infrared imagery campaigns were conducted (two for each crop) at the same time as the Landsat 7/8 overpass. Three variants of METRIC model were used to process the UAS imagery; UAS-METRIC-1, -2, and -3 (UASM-1, -2, and -3) and outputs were compared with the standard LM approach. ET root mean square differences (RMSD) between LM-UASM-1, LM-UASM-2, and LM-UASM-3 were in the ranges of 0.2-2.9, 0.5-0.9, and 0.5-2.7 mm day(-1), respectively. Internal calibrations and sensible heat fluxes majorly resulted in such differences. UASM-2 had the highest similarity with the LM approach (RMSD: 0.5-0.9, ETdep,abs (daily ET departures): 2-14%, r (Pearson correlation coefficient) = 0.91). Strong ET correlations between UASM and LM approaches (0.7-0.8, 0.7-0.8, and 0.8-0.9 for spearmint, potato, and alfalfa crops) suggest equal suitability of UASM approaches as LM to map ET for a range of similar crops. UASM approaches (Coefficient of variation, CV: 6.7-24.3%) however outperformed the LM approach (CV: 2.1-11.2%) in mapping spatial ET variations due to large number of pixels. On-demand UAS imagery may thus help in deriving high resolution site-specific ET maps, for growers to aid in timely crop water management.

TI  - Improvement of precipitable water vapour and water vapour mixing ratio profile in atmospheric infrared sounder retrievals: differential linear adjustment model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of both the horizontal and vertical distributions of atmospheric water vapour is pivotal to understand the Earth's radiative balance. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) provides an opportunity to monitor both precipitable water vapour (PWV) measurements and water vapour mixing ratio (MR) profiles. In this study, we incorporate a differential linear adjust model (DLAM) by using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim) to adjust the AIRS water vapour retrievals. The performance of the differential linear adjustment model (DLAM) is assessed by comparing AIRS water vapour retrievals with spatio-temporally synchronized radiosonde (RS) observations. Taking RS data as the reference, RMS of the DLAM-adjusted PWV is reduced by about 16%, and that of water vapour MR is decreased by 17% to 8% from 1000 to 500 hPa. We also find that the DLAM appears to be affected by the generally larger uncertainties of the a priori water vapour MR at upper tropospheric levels, and the DLAM-derived water vapour MR improvement is generally greater from 1000 to 850 hPa than 700 to 500 hPa. Moreover, the potential reason for the effectiveness of the DLAM on AIRS water vapour retrievals adjustment may be the deviation of the differential water vapour information derived by the differential process is significantly reduced in the incorporated model.

TI  - Immunological markers for identifying recent HIV infection in North-West India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background & objectives: Being more efficient and widely used, limiting antigen (LAg)-avidity enzyme immunoassay (EIA) based on the recent infection testing algorithm (RITA) has been developed for differentiating recent and established HIV-1 infection. So far, LAg-avidity EIA has not been validated among the Indian population. Hence, the present study was planned to identify recent HIV infections in high risk patients in the North-West region of India using modified LAg-avidity RITA. Methods: Four hundred HIV-positive high risk patients registered on pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme in the last one year, from five ART centres in North-Western States of India, were included for identifying the recent HIV infections. One hundred HIV-positive cases registered for pre-ART for greater than two years in ART centres were included for estimating false recent rate (FRR). Single-well LAg-avidity EIA-based modified RITA was used to identify recent HIV infection cases. Results: Of the 400 HIV-1-positive samples, 64 (16%) were found to have been infected within the past 130 days. The proportion of recent HIV infections was 16.8 per cent (18/107) among female sex workers, 10.7 per cent (9/84) among men who have sex with men and 17.7 per cent (37/209) among injecting drug users. The FRR was one per cent (1/100). Interpretation & conclusions: LAg-avidity EIA-based modified RITA provided good discrimination between recent and non-recent HIV infection, hence, it could be considered suitable for estimating HIV incidence in sentinel surveillance system in India.

TI  - An approach to cross-calibrating multi-mission satellite data for the open ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synchronous observations with similar illumination-observation and meteorological conditions are critical components of cross-calibration analysis. This study outlines data quality control criteria for obtaining the stable synchronous data needed for developing and evaluating a cross-calibration algorithm. With image data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) and Medium Resolution Spectral Imager II (MERSI II), we developed a cross-calibration algorithm using 35 image pairs of four ocean gyres, and we evaluated the data using 11 image pairs of the global ocean. We found that our new algorithm provided well-calibrated MERSI II reflectance at the top-of-atmosphere. The coefficients of determination (R-2) were greater than 0.89, and the mean absolute percent difference (MAPD) varied from 1.13% to 8.37% in the visible bands, which was significantly superior to an algorithm developed from a data set constrained by existing data quality controls. When the satellite data were preprocessed with the new cross-calibration algorithm, the MERSI II instrument provided inter-mission remote sensing reflectance for the North Pacific Gyre that was consistent with the VIIRS instrument. Furthermore, we derived consistent estimates of remote sensing reflectance and backscattering coefficients (b(b)) from VIIRS and the cross-calibrated MERSI II reflectance data for four typically turbid coastal waters. The VIIRS bb coastal images had special distribution patterns, such as tongue-shaped plumes and mesoscale eddies, which accurately reappeared in the MERSI II images. The inter-mission MAPD values varied from 16%-24% for the coastal waters. This uncertainty level was much lower than the bb data quantified from the original MERSI II data with no cross-calibration. Our results suggest that our data quality control criteria provide good quality synchronous data for cross-calibration analysis. MERSI II could provide good ocean color products for oceanic communications after cross-calibration, even though the radiance calibration for the original MERSI II reflectance data are imperfect.

TI  - Mapping Paddy Rice Fields by Combining Multi-Temporal Vegetation Index and Synthetic Aperture Radar Remote Sensing Data Using Google Earth Engine Machine Learning Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge of the area and spatial distribution of paddy rice fields is important for water resource management. However, accurate map of paddy rice is a long-term challenge because of its spatiotemporal discontinuity and short duration. To solve this problem, this study proposed a paddy rice area extraction approach by using the combination of optical vegetation indices and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. This method is designed to overcome the data-missing problem due to cloud contamination and spatiotemporal discontinuities of the traditional optical remote sensing method. More specifically, the Sentinel-1A SAR and the Sentinel-2 multispectral imager (MSI) Level-2A imagery are used to identify paddy rice with a high temporal and spatial resolution. Three vegetation indices, namely normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and land surface water index (LSWI), are estimated from optical bands. Two polarization bands (VH (vertical-horizontal) and VV (vertical-vertical)) are used to overcome the cloud contamination problem. This approach was applied with the random forest machine learning algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform for the Jianghan Plain in China as an experimental area. The results of 39 experiments uncovered the effect of different factors. The results indicated that the combination of VV and VH band showed a better performance compared with other polarization bands; the average producer's accuracy of paddy rice (PA) is 72.79%, 1.58% higher than the second one VH. Secondly, the combination of three indices also showed a better result than others, with average PA 73.82%, 1.42% higher than using NDVI alone. The classification result presented the best combination is EVI, VV, and VH polarization band. The producer's accuracy of paddy rice was 76.67%, with the overall accuracy (OA) of 66.07%, and Kappa statistics of 0.45. However, NDVI, EVI, and VH showed better performance in mapping the morphology. The results demonstrated the method developed in this study can be successfully applied to the cloud-prone area for mapping paddy rice to overcome the data missing caused by cloud and rain during the paddy growing season.

TI  - Co-seismic deformation of the 2017 <i>M</i><sub>s</sub> 7.0 Jiuzhaigou Earthquake observed with GaoFen-3 interferometry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The first application of GaoFen-3 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry to monitoring co-seismic deformation of an earthquake is presented in this paper. First, two GaoFen-3 SAR images spanning the 2017 surface-wave magnitude (Ms) 7.0 Jiuzhaigou earthquake were mosaicked, coregistered and processed into an interferogram with visible fringes. After the removal of severe orbital errors and unwrapping, the co-seismic deformation field is obtained. Finally, the fault parameters and slip distribution are determined based on the deformation field. To evaluate the performance of GaoFen-3 in this case, the interferogram, co-seismic deformation field, derived fault parameters and slip distribution are compared with those derived from Radarsat-2, Sentinel-1A and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2). The comparisons between the deformation field obtained from GaoFen-3 and those obtained from Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1A show Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) values > 90%, demonstrating that GaoFen-3 interferometry can measure the co-seismic deformation effectively. The resultant slip model obtained by GaoFen-3 interferometric measurements shows a simple, elliptical pattern of slip, reaching a maximum of approximately 1 m at depths of 10-13 km. The rake angle is almost 0 degrees, which suggests left-lateral strike-slip motion, consistent with previous studies.

TI  - Does any phenological event defined by remote sensing deserve particular attention? An examination of spring phenology of winter wheat in Northern China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology is often considered the leading indicator of ecological responses to climate change, and therefore it is important that researchers have accurate methods to track phenological changes. Remote sensing has been widely used to study phenological responses to climate change. However, land surface phenology observed by remote sensing is fundamentally different from that observed in the field, which raises the difficulty in understanding and validating phenological change observed using remote sensing. In this study, we revisited the criteria of good phenological events and argued that the relationship between phenology and climate factors is one of the most important meanings of phenological studies. Instead of validating remotely sensed phenology by its consistency with field observations, this study aims to judge different possible definitions of phenological events based on remote sensing by their temperature sensitivity and correlation. Using the winter wheat zone in northern China as the study area, we compared the temperature correlation and sensitivities of winter wheat phenology date derived from different methods: the relative threshold method with different thresholds, and the curvature method, based on remotely sensed data. Our results show that there is no distinct phenological event that is overwhelmingly more sensitive or correlative than any others. Therefore, there are no particular phenological events that deserve emphasis when exploring the relationship between phenology date and the pre-season temperature. Instead, the phenological stage (i.e. the threshold of relative threshold method) that is most sensitive or correlative to pre-season temperature varies spatially, showing a good latitude gradient. On an average, the thresholds of the most correlative and sensitive phenological stages to pre-season temperature decreased by 9.92% and 14.69% per latitudinal degree, respectively. The results indicate that the traditional emphasis on discrete phenological events could miss the phenological stages that are most sensitive and correlative to pre-season temperature, thereby resulting in a limited understanding of phenological responses to climate change.

TI  - Mapping Post-Earthquake Landslide Susceptibility: A U-Net Like Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A serious earthquake could trigger thousands of landslides and produce some slopes more sensitive to slide in future. Landslides could threaten human's lives and properties, and thus mapping the post-earthquake landslide susceptibility is very valuable for a rapid response to landslide disasters in terms of relief resource allocation and posterior earthquake reconstruction. Previous researchers have proposed many methods to map landslide susceptibility but seldom considered the spatial structure information of the factors that influence a slide. In this study, we first developed a U-net like model suitable for mapping post-earthquake landslide susceptibility. The post-earthquake high spatial airborne images were used for producing a landslide inventory. Pre-earthquake Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) images and the influencing factors such as digital elevation model (DEM), slope, aspect, multi-scale topographic position index (mTPI), lithology, fault, road network, streams network, and macroseismic intensity (MI) were prepared as the input layers of the model. Application of the model to the heavy-hit area of the destructive 2008 Wenchuan earthquake resulted in a high validation accuracy (precision 0.77, recall 0.90, F1 score 0.83, and AUC 0.90). The performance of this U-net like model was also compared with those of traditional logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM) models on both the model area and independent testing area with the former being stronger than the two traditional models. The U-net like model introduced in this paper provides us the inspiration that balancing the environmental influence of a pixel itself and its surrounding pixels to perform a better landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) task is useful and feasible when using remote sensing and GIS technology.

TI  - Comparison of Different Missing-Imputation Methods for MAIAC (Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction) AOD in Estimating Daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> Levels
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The immense problem of missing satellite aerosol retrievals (Aerosol Optical Depth, (AOD)) detrimentally affects the prediction ability of ground-level PM2.5 concentrations and may lead to unavoidable biases. An appropriate missing-imputation method has not been well developed to date. This study developed a two-stage approach (AOD-imputation stage and PM2.5-prediction stage) to predict short-term PM2.5 exposure in mainland China from 2013-2018. At the AOD-imputation stage, geostatistical methods and machine learning (ML) algorithms were examined to interpolate 1 km satellite aerosol retrievals. At the PM2.5-prediction stage, the daily levels of PM2.5 were predicted at a resolution of 1 km, based on interpolated AOD and meteorological data. The statistical performances of the different interpolation methods were comprehensively compared at each stage. The original coverage of retrieved AOD was 15.46% on average. For the AOD-imputation stage, ML methods produced a higher coverage (98.64%) of AOD than geostatistical methods (21.43-87.31%). Among ML algorithms, random forest (RF) or extreme gradient boosted (XG-interpolated) AOD produced better interpolated quality (CV R-2 = 0.89 and 0.85) than other algorithms (0.49-0.78), but XGBoost required only 15% of the computing time of RF. For the PM2.5 predicted stage, neither RF-AOD nor XG-AOD could guarantee higher accuracy in PM2.5 estimations (CV R-2 = 0.88 (RF or XG-AOD) compared to 0.85 (original)), or more stable spatial and temporal extrapolation (spatial, (temporal) CV R-2 = 0.83 (0.83), 0.82 (0.82), and 0.65 (0.61) for RF, XG, and original). For the AOD-imputation stage, the missing-filled efficiency depended more on external information, while the missing-filled accuracy relied more on model structure. For the PM2.5 predicted stage, efficient AOD interpolation (or the ability to eliminate the missing data) was a precondition for the stable spatial and temporal extrapolation, while the quality of interpolated AOD showed less significant improvements. It was found that XG-AOD is a better choice to estimate daily PM2.5 exposure in health assessments.

TI  - Neural networks for the automated detection of methanol vapour from airborne passive infrared multispectral imaging data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pattern recognition methodology was developed for the automated detection of methanol vapour plumes from passive multispectral infrared remote sensing data. The data employed in this work were collected with an infrared line scanner equipped with eight spectral bandpass filters mounted in a downward-looking mode on a fixed-wing aircraft. An automated classifier was developed by the application of a backpropagation neural network to the calibrated, registered, and preprocessed radiances. Preprocessing steps were performed to optimize the inputs for the neural network, which included: (1) contrast enhancement by calculating the ratios of band intensities; (2) assembly of training data by use of thek-means clustering algorithm; (3) removal of temperature information from the measured radiance data; (4) feature extraction for identifying the most representative ratios of band intensities; and (5) optimization of the starting assumed emissivity value for the temperature and emissivity separation algorithm. The best classifier achieved an overall classification accuracy of 98.07% on the testing set with a false detection rate of 0.90% and a missed detection rate of 13.50%. The prediction performance of the optimized neural network was demonstrated through its application to 16 images not included in the training procedure.

AB  - The west coast of Tangier, in northern Morocco, has been affected by industrial wastewater discharge that reaches the ocean through the Boukhalef river. Therefore, the Jbila and Sidikacem beaches near to the Boukhalef river mouth have been classified as polluted for many years. With the aim of determining the COVID-19 pandemic consequences on the Tangier coastal environment, a linear model using Sentinel 3 water surface temperature (WST) has been tested in several locations. Data from April 2019 and April 2020, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic related emergency status in Morocco, were compared. The results from April 2019 showed high WST values and consequently, the poorest water quality in the sites closest to the Boukhalef river mouth. On the other hand, the results from April 2020 showed normal WST values and high water quality in the same study area. These results illustrate the usefulness of Sentinel 3 WST for the estimation of bathing water quality on the west coast of Tangier. The study shows the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic consequences on the coastal environment quality in the study area and indicates the importance of decreasing the industrial discharge on the west coast of Tangier. The same methodology could be used in decision-making processes and to reduce cost, time and human resources for coastal monitoring systems. We demonstrate the potential of using the Sentinel 3 data for coastal waters monitoring, as well as the need for stricter controls of pollutant discharges into the world's rivers.

TI  - Exploratory Analysis of Urban Climate Using a Gap-Filled Landsat 8 Land Surface Temperature Data Set
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat 8 satellites have retrieved land surface temperature (LST) resampled at a 30-m spatial resolution since 2013, but the urban climate studies frequently use a limited number of images due to the problems related to missing data over the city of interest. This paper endorses a procedure for building a long-term gap-free LST data set in an urban area using the high-resolution Landsat 8 imagery. The study is applied on 94 images available through 2013-2018 over Bucharest (Romania). The raw images containing between 1.1% and 58.4% missing LST data were filled in using the Data INterpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) algorithm implemented in thesinkrR packages. The resulting high-spatial-resolution gap-filled land surface temperature data set was used to explore the LST climatology over Bucharest (Romania) an urban area, at a monthly, seasonal, and annual scale. The performance of the gap-filling method was checked using a cross-validation procedure, and the results pledge for the development of an LST-based urban climatology.

TI  - Cassirer and Goldstein on Abstraction and the Autonomy of Biology
T2  - HOPOS-THE JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the mutual influence between Ernst Cassirer and his cousin, the neurologist Kurt Goldstein. For both Cassirer and Goldstein, views on the nature of human cognition were fundamental to their understanding of scientific knowledge, and these were informed by both philosophical theorizing and empirical research on pathologies of the nervous system. Following Cassirer, and in agreement with the physicalism of the Vienna Circle, Goldstein held that the physical sciences had progressed by arriving at abstract, mathematical representations to take the place of qualitative characterizations of observable reality. In tension with physicalism, Goldstein was not sanguine about the fruitfulness of the abstractive approach in biology. He proposed that biology must adhere to its own sui generis methods of observation and experimentation in order to obtain knowledge of the "natures" of living organisms. I argue that there is a parallel with Cassirer's assertion of the differences between physical and cultural sciences, underwritten by the deployment of varying symbolic functions. I also propose that the neurological writings of Goldstein are an important backdrop to Cassirer's positive evaluation of abstract thought, in contrast to the pessimism regarding a worldview dominated by scientific abstractions expressed by philosophers such as Bergson, Whitehead, and Husserl.

TI  - Development of a Land Surface Temperature Retrieval Algorithm from GK2A/AMI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important geophysical element for understanding Earth systems and land-atmosphere interactions. In this study, we developed a nonlinear split-window LST retrieval algorithm for the observation area of GEO-KOMPSAT-2A (GK2A), the next-generation geostationary satellite in Korea. To develop the GK2A LST retrieval algorithm, radiative transfer model simulation data, considering various impacting factors, were constructed. The LST retrieval algorithm was developed with a total of six equations as per day/night and atmospheric conditions (dry/normal/wet), considering the effects of diurnal variation of LST and atmospheric conditions on LST retrieval. The emissivity of each channel required for LST retrieval was calculated in real-time with the vegetation cover method using the consecutive 8-day cycle vegetation index provided by GK2A. The indirect validation of the results of GK2A LST with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST Collection 6 showed a high correlation coefficient (0.969), slightly warm bias (+1.227 K), and root mean square error (RMSE) (2.281 K). Compared to the MODIS LST, the GK2A LST showed a warm bias greater than +1.8 K during the day, but a relatively small bias (<+0.7 K) at night. Based on the results of the validation with in situ measurements from the Tateno station of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network, the correlation coefficient was 0.95, bias was +0.523 K, and RMSE was 2.021 K.

TI  - Assessing the Influence of Tourism-Driven Activities on Environmental Variables on Hainan Island, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tourism is a primary socio-economic factor on many coastal islands. Tourism contributes to the livelihoods of the residents, but also influences natural resources and energy consumption and can become a significant driver of land conversion and environmental change. Understanding the influence of tourist-related activities is vital for sustainable tourism development. We chose Hainan Island in South China as a research area to study the influence of tourist-driven activities on environmental variables (as Land Surface Temperatures (LST) and related ecosystem variables) during the period of 2000 to 2019. In Hainan, the local economy relies heavily on tourism, with an ever-growing influx of tourists each year. We categorised location-based points of interest (POIs) into two classes, non-tourism sites and tourism-related sites, and utilised satellite data from the cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) to extract LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. We analysed the LST variations, NDVI changes and the land use/land cover (LULC) changes and compared the relative difference in LST and NDVI between the tourism-related sites and non-tourism-related sites. The main findings of this study were: (1) The median LST in the tourism-related sites was relatively higher (1.3) than the LST in the non-tourism-related sites for the 20 years. Moreover, every annual mean LST of tourism-related sites was higher than the LST values in non-tourism-related sites, with an average difference of 1.2 degrees C for the 20 years and a maximum difference of 1.7 degrees C. We found higher annual LST anomalies for tourist-related sites compared to non-tourism sites after 2010, which indicated the likely positive differences in LST above the average LST during 20 years for tourism-related sites when compared against the non-tourism related sites, thus highlighting the potential influence of tourism activities on LST. (2) The annual mean NDVI value for tourism-related sites was significantly lower than for non-tourism places every year, with an average NDVI difference of 0.26 between the two sites. (3) The land cover changed significantly: croplands and forests reduced by 3.5% and 2.8% respectively, while the areas covered by orchards and urban areas increased by 2% and 72.3% respectively. These results indicate the influence of the tourism-driven activities includes the relatively high LST, vegetation degradation and land-use conversion particular to urban cover type. The outcome of this work provides a method that combines cloud-based satellite-derived data with location-based POIs data for quantifying the long-term influence of tourism-related activities on sensitive coastal ecosystems. It contributes to designing evidence-driven management plans and policies for the sustainable tourism development in coastal areas.

TI  - The Fairy Tale as a Place of Memory in the Context of Intergenerational Communication
T2  - TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A fairy tale as a form of a cultural code is the most important tool for cultural and ethnic socialization, the transfer of social experience, values, and worldview. Modern society is characterized by a high level of technologization, standardization, and universalization of the communication process which leads to the formation of new social practices of communication of various social groups. The article is focused on highlighting the functional and activity role of a fairy tale in the formation of the social memory of the younger generation and the features of the implementation of intergenerational communication through the fairy tale. In the article, a fairy tale as a place of memory in intergenerational communication is also analyzed using the methodological tools of the sociology of communication.The article discusses the detailing of the concept of "social memory", types of social memory. With an emphasis on the identification function, the authors consider the main social functions of a fairy tale (cultural and ethnic, socializing, creative, holographic, developmental and therapeutic, lexical-shaped, recreational). The authors consider the activity aspect of the fairy tale as a place of memory is revealed, the interactional relations of communicants, conditioned by social changes and information and communication technologies, in their historical dynamics.The article analyzes the stage of transition from mythological knowledge to the need to carry out initiation practices with the transfer of secrets to the younger generation in encoded form, in the form of a fairy tale. The most significant stage can be called the transformation of a fairy tale into a verbal-poetic story of a fantastic, adventurous, novelistic, and everyday nature. The article analyzes the impact of information technologies on the form of fairy tale transmission as the destruction of the traditional narrative format from the older generation "by the word of mouth" and the exit of the fairy tale beyond the literary genre.In modern society, the range of communication agents in the transmission of social experience between generations has significantly expanded. There appear agents of non-family communication, which take part in the transmission of cultural memory and the formation of memory places in the younger generation. The authors note that in the communicative aspect, a fairy tale is a convenient form for transmitting cultural code, which can be adapted to current formats (Internet, animation, cinema, computer games, etc.). It is shown that the most important feature of the use of modern storytelling tools is the reduction of traditional emotionality in the interactive relationships of communicants, which leads to the erosion of traditional values and a decrease in the depth of intergenerational ties. This trend may lead to the risk of alienation of traditional values.

TI  - Satellite Observation for Evaluating Cloud Properties of the Microphysical Schemes in Weather Research and Forecasting Simulation: A Case Study of the Mei-Yu Front Precipitation System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiative transfer model can be used to convert the geophysical variables (e.g., atmospheric thermodynamic state) to the radiation field. In this study, the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) is used to connect regional Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model outputs and satellite observations. A heavy rainfall event caused by the Mei-Yu front on the June 1, 2017, in the vicinity of Taiwan, was chosen as a case study. The simulated cloud performance of WRF with four microphysics schemes (i.e., Goddard (GCE), WRF single-moment 6 class (WSM), WRF double-moment 6 class (WDM), and Morrison (MOR) schemes) was investigated objectively using multichannel observed satellite radiances from a Japanese geostationary satellite Himawari-8. The results over the East Asia domain (9 km) illustrate that all four microphysics schemes overestimate cloudy pixels, in particular, the high cloud of simulation with MOR when comparing with satellite data. Sensitivity tests reveal that the excess condensation of ice at >= 14 km with MOR might be associated with the overestimated high cloud cover. However, GCE displayed an improved performance on water vapor channel in clear skies. When focusing on Taiwan using a higher (3 km) model resolution, each scheme displayed a decent performance on cloudy pixels. In the grid-by-grid skill score analysis, the distribution of high clouds was the most accurate among the three cloud types. The results also suggested that all schemes required a longer simulation time to describe the low cloud horizontal extend.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping and intraoperative assessment in a prospective, international, multicentre, observational trial of patients with cervical cancer: The SENTIX trial
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: SENTIX (ENGOT-CX2/CEEGOG-CX1) is an international, multi centre, prospective observational trial evaluating sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy without pelvic lymph node dissection in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. We report the final preplanned analysis of the secondary end-points: SLN mapping and outcomes of intraoperative SLN pathology.Methods: Forty-seven sites (18 countries) with experience of SLN biopsy participated in SENTIX. We preregistered patients with stage IA1/lymphovascular space invasion-positive to IB2 (4 cm or smaller or 2 cm or smaller for fertility-sparing treatment) cervical cancer without suspicious lymph nodes on imaging before surgery. SLN frozen section assessment and pathological ultrastaging were mandatory. Patients were registered postoperatively if SLN were bilaterally detected in the pelvis, and frozen sections were negative. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02494063).Results: We analysed data for 395 preregistered patients. Bilateral detection was achieved in 91% (355/395), and it was unaffected by tumour size, tumour stage or body mass index, but it was lower in older patients, in patients who underwent open surgery, and in sites with fewer cases. No SLN were found outside the seven anatomical pelvic regions. Most SLN and positive SLN were localised below the common iliac artery bifurcation. Single positive SLN above the iliac bifurcation were found in 2% of cases. Frozen sections failed to detect 54% of positive lymph nodes (pN1), including 28% of cases with macrometastases and 90% with micrometastases.Interpretation: SLN biopsy can achieve high bilateral SLN detection in patients with tumours of 4 cm or smaller. At experienced centres, all SLN were found in the pelvis, and most were located below the iliac vessel bifurcation. SLN frozen section assessment is an unreliable tool for intraoperative triage because it only detects about half of N1 cases. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - An integrated framework for Web-based visualisation of forest resources estimated from remote sensing data
T2  - CENTRAL EUROPEAN FORESTRY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced remote sensing technologies has recently become an effective tool for monitoring of forest ecosystems. However, there is a growing need for online dissemination of geospatial data from these activities. We developed and assessed a framework which integrates (1) an algorithm for estimation of forest stand variables based on remote sensing data and (2) a web-map application for 2D and 3D visualisation of geospatial data. The performance of proposed framework was assessed in a Forest Management Unit Viglas (Slovakia, Central Europe) covering a total area of 12,472 ha. The mean error of remote sensing-based estimations of forest resources reached values of 16.4%, 12.1%, -26.8%, and -35.4% for the mean height, mean diameter, volume per hectare, and trees per hectare, respectively. The web-map application is stable and allows real-time visualization of digital terrain model, aerial imagery, thematic maps used in forestry or geology, and 968,217 single trees at forest management unit level.

TI  - First Insights on Soil Respiration Prediction across the Growth Stages of Rainfed Barley Based on Simulated MODIS and Sentinel-2 Spectral Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfed agriculture occupies the majority of the world's agricultural surface and is expected to increase in the near future causing serious effects on carbon cycle dynamics in the context of climate change. Carbon cycle across several temporal and spatial scales could be studied through spectral indices because they are related to vegetation structure and functioning and hence with carbon fluxes, among them soil respiration (Rs). The aim of this work was to assess Rs linked to crop phenology of a rainfed barley crop throughout two seasons based on spectral indices calculated from field spectroscopy data. The relationships between Rs, Leaf Area Index (LAI) and spectral indices were assessed by linear regression models with the adjusted coefficient of determination (R-adj(2)). Results showed that most of the spectral indices provided better information than LAI throughout the studied period and that soil moisture and temperature were relevant variables in specific periods. During vegetative stages, indices based on the visible (VIS) region showed the best relationship with Rs. On the other hand, during reproductive stages indices containing the near infrared-shortwave infrared (NIR-SWIR) spectral region and those related to water content showed the highest relationship. The inter-annual variability found in Mediterranean regions was also observed in the estimated ratio of carbon emission to carbon fixation between years. Our results show the potential capability of spectral information to assess soil respiration linked to crop phenology across several temporal and spatial scales. These results can be used as a basis for the utilization of other remote information derived from satellites or airborne sensors to monitor crop carbon balances.

T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Modelling techniques for the propagation of light pollution in the atmosphere allow the computation of maps of artificial night sky brightness in any direction of the sky, involving a large number of details from satellite data. Cinzano et al. (2001a) introduced a method of mapping naked eye star visibility at the zenith from large areas based on satellite radiance measurements and Garstang models of the propagation of light pollution. It takes into account the altitude of each land area from digital elevation data, natural sky brightness in the chosen sky direction based on the Garstang approach, eye capability after Garstang and Schaefer, and atmospheric extinction in the visual photometric band. Here we discuss how to use these methods to obtain maps of the average number of visible stars when looking at the night sky hemisphere, finally answering, site by site, the question of how many stars are visible in the sky. This is not trivial, as the number of stars visible depends on the limiting magnitude in each direction in the sky, and this depends on sky brightness in that direction, atmospheric extinction at that zenith distance and the observer's visual acuity and experience. We present, as an example, a map of the number of visible stars in Italy to an average observer on clear nights with a resolution of approximately 1 km. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Benefits and Lessons Learned from the Sentinel-3 Tandem Phase
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During its commissioning phase, the Copernicus Sentinel-3B satellite has been placed in a tandem formation with Sentinel-3A for a period of 6 months. This configuration allowed a direct comparison of measurements obtained by the two satellites. The purpose of this paper was to present the range of analyses that can be performed from this dataset, highlighting methodology aspects and the main outcomes for each instrument. We examined, in turn, the benefit of the tandem in understanding instrument operational modes differences, in assessing inter-satellite differences, and in validating measurement uncertainties. The results highlighted the very good consistency of the Sentinel-3A and B instruments, ensuring the complete inter-operability of the constellation. Tandem comparisons also pave the way for further improvements through harmonization of the sensors (OLCI), correction of internal stray-light sources (SLSTR), or high-frequency processing of SRAL SARM data. This paper provided a comprehensive overview of the main results obtained, as well as insights into some of the results. Finally, we drew the main lessons learned from the Sentinel-3 tandem phase and provided recommendations for future missions.

TI  - Computational modeling of extreme wildland fire events: A synthesis of scientific understanding with applications to forecasting, land management, and firefighter safety
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The understanding and prediction of large wildland fire events around the world is a growing interdisciplinary research area advanced rapidly by development and use of computational models. Recent models bidirectionally couple computational fluid dynamics models including weather prediction models with modules containing algorithms representing fire spread and heat release, simulating fire-atmosphere interactions across scales spanning three orders of magnitude. Integrated with weather data and airborne and satellite remote sensing data on wildland fuels and active fire detection, modern coupled weather-fire modeling systems are being used to solve current science problems. Compared to legacy tools, these dynamic computational modeling systems increase cost and complexity but have produced breakthrough insights notably into the mechanisms underlying extreme wildfire events such as fine-scale extreme winds associated with interruptions of the electricity grid and have been configured to forecast a fire's growth, expanding our ability to anticipate how they will unfold. We synthesize case studies of recent extreme events, expanding applications, and the challenges and limitations in our remote sensing systems, fire prediction tools, and meteorological models that add to wildfires' mystery and apparent unpredictability.

TI  - Intra-day variability of temperature and its near-surface gradient with elevation over mountainous terrain: ComparingMODISland surface temperature data with coarse and fine scale near-surface measurements
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Where land surface air temperature data are not available, satellite land surface temperature are used. However, the coarse spatial resolution of satellite-derived products may yield errors at the local scale. This work shows the differences between the MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (MOD11A1) product and ground measurements at two different scales. We used data from 21 SNOTEL stations across the northern Front Range of Colorado to represent the coarse scale and 17 iButton temperature sensors across the Colorado State University Mountain Campus to represent the fine scale. We found significant differences in the temperature and its changes with elevation for the two spatial scales. At the fine scale, cold air drainage can induce an inversion of the temperature gradient with elevation. A higher correlation was found during the nighttime at the fine scale, while, at the coarse scale, higher correlations were observed during the daytime. On windy nights, temperatures do not cool as much as on calmer nights, and the coarse scale near-surface temperature gradient with elevation persists, though the fine scale inversions do not develop. The near-surface temperature gradients with elevation based on the MODIS pixels are similar to the ground-based data at the coarse scale but not at the fine scale. Thus, one must be cautious in selecting the near-surface temperature gradients with elevation for mountainous terrain when different scales are considered, and a proper validation of satellite products is necessary prior to their use to avoid the propagation of uncertainties.

TI  - Exploring the Use of Sentinel-2 Data to Monitor Heterogeneous Effects of Contextual Drought and Heatwaves on Mediterranean Forests
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite data to detect forest areas impacted by extreme events, such as droughts, heatwaves, or fires is largely documented, however, the use of these data to identify the heterogeneity of the forests' response to determine fine scale spatially irregular damage is less explored. This paper evaluates the health status of forests in southern Italy affected by adverse climate conditions during the hot and dry summer of 2017, using Sentinel-2 images (10m) and in situ data. Our analysis shows that the post-event-NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) decrease, observed in five experimental sites, well accounts for the heterogeneity of the local response to the climate event evaluated in situ through the Mannerucci and the Raunkiaer methods. As a result, Sentinel-2 data can be effectively integrated with biological information from field surveys to introduce continuity in the estimation of climate change impacts even in very heterogeneous areas whose details could not be captured by lower resolution observations. This integration appears to be a successful strategy in the study of the relationships between the climate and forests from a dynamical perspective.

TI  - Disentangling fractional vegetation cover: Regression-based unmixing of simulated spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The next generation of spaceborne imaging spectrometers will enable hyperspectral analysis of vegetation cover across large spatial extents. Spectral unmixing provides a means to assess subpixel vegetation composition in such imagery. Here we implement a regression-based unmixing approach to generate fractional vegetation cover on a regional scale from a simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite scene derived from Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery acquired over the San Francisco Bay Area, California, USA, an area with a mixture of temperate and Mediterranean climate forests, woodlands and shrublands. A hierarchical classification scheme was implemented that considered fractional cover of vegetation as a whole (vegetation vs non-vegetation), vegetation life forms (woody vs non-woody vegetation; tree vs shrub vs grass), and tree leaf type (needleleaf vs broadleaf). A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model was trained using synthetically-mixed training data generated from an endmember library, and mapping accuracy was assessed using an independent validation dataset across four ecoregions. Our approach was able to effectively model landscape patterns at all levels of the class hierarchy. Site-wide map accuracy was highest when mapping generic vegetation fractions (MAE = 3.8%) and expectedly decreased at more complex hierarchy levels, with highest errors observed when separating tree and shrub fractions. Still, fraction estimates of needleleaf trees (MAE = 10.6%), broadleaf trees (MAE = 13.1%) and shrubs (MAE = 15.3%) were mapped with low overall error. Using Landsat imagery led to an average decrease in map accuracy of 1.9% when compared to hyperspectral image analysis and a maximum decrease of 3.5% when separating broadleaf and needleleaf trees across all sites. Further, a single regional model was shown to yield comparable results to multiple local ecoregion-based models, facilitating the analysis of large regions without creating a separate model for each region. Our results highlight the utility of regression-based approaches for quantitative vegetation mapping, which is of particular interest for future spaceborne imaging spectroscopy missions operating across large areas at moderate spatial resolution.

TI  - Value and disvalue of the pregnancy checkbox on death certificates in the United States-impact on newly released 2018 maternal mortality data
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Maternal mortality is a sentinel health indicator. To improve the identification of maternal deaths, a pregnancy question was added during the 2003 revision of the US standard death certificate. Its adoption across all states in the United States took 16 years (2003-2018), and therefore the National Center for Health Statistics did not provide the national maternal mortality rate between 2007 and 2018. During this time, researchers raised questions about the accuracy of the checkbox information, particularly regarding its contribution to overreporting of maternal deaths in the United States. Checkbox errors were especially evident for women aged >40 years and for nonspecific causes of death. In January 2020, the NCHS resumed the reporting of maternal mortality data and provided the 2018 figures using a new coding method (ie, the 2018 method). Despite internal analyses suggesting the presence of both high false positive and high false negative pregnancy checkbox errors, the National Center for Health Statistics reported identification of 658 maternal deaths nationwide and a maternal mortality rate of 17.4 deaths per 100,000 live births for 2018. The 2018 coding method restricts the entry of checkbox information to decedents aged 10-44 years; the information cannot, therefore, be entered for women aged >45 years when no pregnancy-related cause of death information is indicated on the death certificate. Reported deaths with a pregnancy or obstetrical condition entered in the cause of death section of the death certificate continue to be coded as maternal deaths regardless of age. The 2018 method likely corrects errors introduced by the use of the checkbox for women aged >45 years, but whether it provides accurate maternal mortality figures remains unknown. We call for efforts to urgently and systematically validate the pregnancy checkbox information. Post hoc coding adjustments cannot substitute for providing accurate and actionable maternal mortality data.

TI  - Illuminating Social-Class Identity: The Persistence of Working-Class African American Women Doctoral Students
T2  - JOURNAL OF DIVERSITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholars have argued that there is a silence related to social class status in educational literature. Consequently, the purpose of this phenomenological study was to develop an understanding of the educational experiences of working-class African American women doctoral students at predominantly White institutions and what factors influence their doctoral persistence. Black feminist thought and the social class worldview model informed the conceptualization of the study. Ten doctoral students completed individual 2-phase semistructured interviews. Three themes reflected students' educational experiences and doctoral persistence: (a) working-class virtues. (b) development of self-efficacy and resiliency, and (c) utilization of personal and academic support systems. Implications for practice, research, and advocacy that support the academic persistence of students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds are discussed.

TI  - Effect of anthropogenic activities on mangrove coverage in the lower Coatzacoalcos river basin
T2  - ECOSISTEMAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are one of the types of coastal wetlands present in the lower basin of the Coatzacoalcos River, which, despite their increasing deterioration, retain ecological and economic importance. The objective of this study was to identify the main anthropogenic activity that has contributed to reducing mangrove coverage in the lower basin of the Coatzacoalcos River, using two methods: 1) comparing mangrove areas and urban development, between 1986 and 2016, with Landsat and Sentinel images (scale 1: 250 000), using Q-Gis version 214.2; and 2) through a matrix of maximums and minimums, where values were assigned to rate the degree of affectation of anthropic actions to each component of the ecosystem. Between 1986 and 2016, mangrove loss was 86%, and it is associated with the increase in human settlements in the lower basin of the Coatzacoalcos River. The actions that most affected the environmental components were human settlements, land clearings and landfills, livestock, and industrial sites with affected percentages of 15.9, 15.7, 15.5, and 13.5%, respectively. The most affected environmental components were soil, flora, and water, with percentages of affectation of the resource of 17, 17, and 16 %, respectively. Human settlements are the leading cause of loss of mangroves in the lower basin of the Coatzacoalcos River, particularly the irregular settlements that occur in the region.

TI  - Making and learning together: Where the makerspace mindset meets platforms for creativity
T2  - GLOBAL STUDIES OF CHILDHOOD
M3  - Article
AB  - While makerspaces are rightly recognized as places for getting people of all ages together to experiment with materials, technologies, processes, and narratives, they are inevitably limited by physical resources of time, space, and money. The appealingly inclusive concept of a "makerspace mindset"-that is, a worldview that admits the possibility of gathering and collaborating a creative fellowship without borders-can facilitate the goal of a global learning community. To meet that goal, however, new thinking must identify how to equitably direct efforts toward a more expansive and sustainable culture for creating. Articulating how and why the vast array of events, environments, tools, or toys that encourage people to create can promote making and connecting is the first step. This article elaborates on our existing work regarding platforms for creativity to consider those principles the makerspace mindset must manifest to encourage learning for a lifetime. We argue that imagining the makerspace mindset as a key plank in platforms for creativity can inspire the development of more and better ways for us to learn about ourselves and others by making and sharing. Framing the makerspace mindset with platforms for creativity illuminates the potential for making and learning to grow creative, curious individuals who together will form an engaged society of learners at large.

TI  - Diffuse Attenuation of Clear Water Tropical Reservoir: A Remote Sensing Semi-Analytical Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The diffuse attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance (Kd) is an essential parameter for inland waters research by remotely sensing the water transparency. Lately,Kdsemi-analytical algorithms substituted the empirical algorithms widely employed. The purpose of this research was to reparametrize a semi-analytical algorithm to estimateKdand then apply it to a Sentinel-2 MSI time-series (2017-2019) for the Tres Marias reservoir, Brazil. The results for theKdsemi-analytical reparametrization achieved good accuracies, reaching mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) for bands B2, B3 and B4 (492, 560 and 665 nm), lower than 21% when derived from in-situ remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), while for MSI Data, a derived MAPE of 12% and 38% for B2 and B3, respectively. After the application of the algorithm to Sentinel-2 images time-series, seasonal patterns were observed in the results, showing highKdvalues at 492 nm during the rainy periods, mainly in the tributary mouths, possibly due to an increase in the surface runoff and inflows and outflow rates in the reservoir watershed.

TI  - New technologies in breast cancer sentinel lymph node biopsy; from the current gold standard to artificial intelligence
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an important diagnostic procedure performed in early breast cancer patients with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes. Detection and examination of sentinel lymph nodes determine further therapy decisions, therefore a choice of optimal technique minimising the risk of false-negative results is of great importance. Currently, the gold standard is the dual technique comprising the blue dye and radiotracer, however, this method creates a logistical problem for many medical units. The intrinsic constraints of the existing methods led to the development of a very wide range of alternatives with varying clinical efficiency and feasibility. While each method presents with its own advantages and disadvantages, many techniques have improved enough to become a non-inferior alternative in the sentinel lymph node biopsy. Along with the improvement of the existing technologies, there are evolving trends such as multimodality of the techniques maximising the diagnostic outcome or an emerging use of artificial intelligence (AI) improving the workflow of the procedure. This literature review aims to give an overview of the current status of the standard techniques and emerging cutting-edge technologies in the sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - A Time Series Mining Approach for Agricultural Area Detection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIG DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Acquiring meaningful data to be employed in building training sets for classification models is a costly task, both in terms of difficult to find suitable samples as well as their quantity. In this sense, Active Learning (AL) improves the training set building by providing an efficient way to select only essential data to be attached to the training set, consequently reducing its size and even enhancing model's accuracy, when compared to random sample selection. In this paper, we proposed a framework for time series classification in order to monitor sugarcane area in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The AL approach consisted of selecting seasonal time series information from less than 1 percent of each class' pixels to build the training set and evaluate this selection by an expert user supported by distance measurements, repeating this process until both distance measurement thresholds were satisfied. In most years, the classification results presented about 90 percent of correlation with official estimates based on both traditional and satellite image analysis methods. This framework can then help Land Use Change (LUC) monitoring as it produced similar results compared to other methods that demands more human and financial resources to be adopted.

We present here the TLS elaborated, based on the ideas proposed by Meheut (2005) and Meheut and Psillos (2004), and for data analysis, we used the content analysis proposed by Bardin (2016), which shows that the introduction of didactics in which the contextualization of chemical contents transcends everyday examples and extends the students' worldview to the great social issues that surround them, are fundamental. Mainly, in the content approach that presents abstraction and duality, such as radioactivity. Therefore, this work seeks to contribute to teaching proposals that involve aspects interrelated with the STS triad and in promoting critical student learning.

T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide mapping and analysis are essential aspects of hazard and risk analysis. Landslides can block rivers and create landslide-dammed lakes, which pose a significant risk for downstream areas. In this research, we used an object-based image analysis approach to map geomorphological features and related changes and assess the applicability of Sentinel-1 data for the fast creation of post-event digital elevation models (DEMs) for landslide volume estimation. We investigated the Hitardalur landslide, which occurred on the 7 July 2018 in western Iceland, along with the geomorphological changes induced by this landslide, using optical and synthetic aperture radar data from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1. The results show that there were no considerable changes in the landslide area between 2018 and 2019. However, the landslide-dammed lake area shrunk between 2018 and 2019. Moreover, the Hitara river diverted its course as a result of the landslide. The DEMs, generated by ascending and descending flight directions and three orbits, and the subsequent volume estimation revealed that-without further post-processing-the results need to be interpreted with care since several factors influence the DEM generation from Sentinel-1 imagery.

TI  - Drought Model DISS Based on the Fusion of Satellite and Meteorological Data under Variable Climatic Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of effective methods for large-area drought monitoring is an important issue; hence, there have been many attempts to solve this problem. In this study, the Drought Information Satellite System (DISS) index is presented, based on the synergistic use of meteorological data and information derived from satellite images. The index allows us to monitor drought phenomena in various climatic and environmental conditions. The approach utilizes two indices for constructing a drought index: (1) the hydrothermal coefficient (HTC), which characterizes meteorological conditions across the study area over a long-term period; and (2) the temperature condition index (TCI) derived from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, which refers instantaneous land surface temperature (LST) to long-term extreme values. The model for drought assessment based on the DISS index was applied for generating drought index maps for Poland for the 2001-2019 vegetation seasons. The performance of the index was verified through comparison of the extent of agricultural drought to the reduction in cereal and maize yield. Analysis of variance revealed a significant relationship between the area of drought determined by the drought index and the decrease in cereal yield due to unfavorable growth conditions. The presented study proves that the proposed drought index can be an effective tool for large-area drought monitoring under variable environmental conditions.

TI  - Hydrodynamic Measurements of Propagating Waves at Different Nearshore Depths in Hujeong Beach, Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports the results of hydrodynamic measurements at two different water depths to observe wave properties in the course of wave propagation, especially during storm periods, in Hujeong Beach, Korea. In addition to hydrodynamic measurements, video monitoring data and satellite images from Sentinel-II were employed to compare the temporal changes in shoreline positions and shallow water bathymetry during the storms. Through combination of a variety of observational data sets, the accuracy of analysis could be enhanced by preventing possible misinterpretation. Two significant storms were observed from two experiments conducted at different times and locations of the beach. The hydrodynamic conditions were similar in both of the periods in terms of wave and current conditions as well as wave nonlinearity such as skewness. However, the response of shoreline during the two storms was the opposite because it was eroded during the first storm but advanced during the second storm. This suggests that other controlling factors such as storm duration need to be investigated to support the analysis of cross-shore sediment transport and consequent shoreline evolution for future studies.

AB  - The carbon sequestration capacity of wetland vegetation determines carbon stocks and changes in wetlands. However, modeling vegetation carbon sequestration of herbaceous wetlands is still problematic due to complex hydroecological processes and rapidly changing biomass carbon stocks. Theoretically, a vegetation index (VI) time series can retrieve the dynamic of biomass carbon stocks and could be used to calculate the cumulative composite of biomass carbon stocks during a given interval, i.e., vegetation carbon sequestration. Hence, we explored the potential for mapping vegetation carbon sequestration in herbaceous wetlands in this study by using a combination of remotely sensed VI time series and field observation data. This method was exemplarily applied for Poyang Lake wetland in 2016 by using a 16-day Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series. Results show that the vegetation carbon sequestration in this area was in the range of 193-1221 g C m(-2) year(-1) with a mean of 401 g C m(-2) year(-1) and a standard deviation of 172 g C m(-2) year(-1) in 2016. The approach has wider spatial applicability in wetlands than the currently used global map of vegetation production (MOD17A3) because our carbon estimation in areas depicted by 'no data' in the MOD17A3 product is considerable, which accounts for 91.2-91.5% of the total vegetation carbon sequestration of the wetland. Thus, we determined that VI time series data shows great potential for estimating vegetation carbon sequestration in herbaceous wetlands, especially with the continuously improving quality and frequency of satellite VI images.

TI  - Ice loss in the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau permafrost as seen by 16 yr of ESA SAR missions
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - InSAR time series of surface deformation from 16 yr of Envisat (2003-2011) and Sentinel-1 (2014-2019) ESA satellite radar measurements have been constructed to characterise spatial and temporal dynamics of ground deformation over an 80,000 km(2) area in the permafrost of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The regional deformation maps encompass various types of periglacial landforms and show that seasonal thaw effects are controlled by the sediment type and local topography. High seasonal ground movements are concentrated on shallow slopes and poor-drainage areas in unconsolidated, frost-susceptible and fine-grained sediments within glacier outwash plains, braided stream plains, alluvial deposits or floodplains. Fast subsidence due to thaw settlement takes place during June/July while frost heave is intense during December/January when two-sided freezing of pore water under pressure causes prolonged ice segregation near the permafrost table. The analysis reveals pervasive subsidence of the ground of up to similar to 2 cm/yr, and increasing by a factor of 2 to 5 from 2003 to today, in high-relief and well-drained areas. The findings suggest that seasonal thaw increasingly affects ice-rich layers at the permafrost table, as well as high-rates of widespread mass movements of non-consolidated sediments, the latter amplified by an increase of effects from frost heave/thaw settlement.

A1  - INCLEN Intussuscept Surveillance
TI  - Prospective surveillance for intussusception in Indian children aged under two years at nineteen tertiary care hospitals
T2  - BMC PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIndia introduced rotavirus vaccines (RVV, monovalent, Rotavac (TM) and pentavalent, Rotasiil (TM)) in April 2016 with 6, 10 and 14weeks schedule and expanded countrywide in phases. We describe the epidemiology of intussusception among children aged 2-23months in India.MethodsThe prospective surveillance at 19 nationally representative sentinel hospitals from four regions recruited children with intussusception from April 2016 to September 2017. Data on sociodemography, immunization, clinical, treatment and outcome were collected. Along with descriptive analysis, key parameters between four regions were compared using Chi-Square/Fisher's exact/Mann-Whitney U/Kruskal-Wallis tests. The pre- and post-RVV periods were compared to estimate the risk ratios.ResultsSix hundred twenty-one children with intussusception from South (n=262), East (n=190), North (n=136) and West (n=33) regions were recruited. Majority (n=465, 74.8%) were infants (40.0% aged 4-7months) with median age 8months (IQR 5, 13months), predominantly males (n=408, 65.7%) and half (n=311, 50.0%) occurred during March-June months. A shorter interval between weaning and intussusception was observed for ragi based food (median 1month, IQR 0-4.2months) compared to rice (median 4months, IQR 1-9months) and wheat (median 3months, IQR 1-7months) based food (p<0.01). Abdominal pain or excessive crying (82.8%), vomiting (72.6%), and bloody stool (58.1%) were the leading symptoms. Classical triad (abdominal pain, vomiting and bloody stool) was observed in 34.8% cases (24.4 to 45.8% across regions). 95.3% of the cases were diagnosed by ultrasound. 49.3% (10.5 to 82.4% across regions) cases were managed by reduction, 39.5% (11.5 to 71.1% across regions) cases underwent surgery and 11.1% spontaneously resolved. Eleven (1.8%) cases died. 89.1% cases met Brighton criteria level 1 and 7.6% met Level 2. RVV was received by 12 cases within 1-21days prior to intussusception. No increase in case load (RR=0.44; 95% CI 0.22-1.18) or case ratio (RR=0.5; 95% CI 0.3-1.2) was observed after RVV introduction in select sites.ConclusionsIntussusception cases were observed across all sites, although there were variations in cases, presentation and mode of management. The high case load age coincided with age of the RVV third dose. The association with ragi based weaning food in intussusception needs further evaluation.

TI  - Decadal Variation of the Land Surface Temperatures (LST) and Urban Heat Island (UHI) over Kolkata City Projected Using MODIS and ERA-Interim DataSets
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) is one of the essential climatic phenomena on the land surface induced by urbanization due to the difference in albedo, surface roughness, and heat-flux exchange. The study tries to examine the application of quantitative remote sensing of UHI, which could encourage our comprehension about urban/suburban environmental conditions and its association with urbanization in the Kolkata city. Kolkata is one of the most populated cities in the world and seventh-most populated city in India. Overpopulation over the years increased the human-made structures as well as industrialization in the Kolkata city, which replaced the vegetation and land cover area, extending it to the city outskirts impacting the UHI. Analyzing the MODIS and ERA-Interim remote sensing data from 2008 to 2017 provides a cost-effective and time-consuming methodology for spatio-temporal analyses of land surface temperature (LST) distribution. For urban climate-related studies, canopy urban heat island (CUHI) is studied based on air temperature. The validation results indicate that the surface urban heat intensity (SUHI) during the summer months reveals an average heat island effect of 1.5 K during the daytime and 0.4 K in the night time. Furthermore, this study shows there is a slight significant relationship between urban heat and vegetation index. However, the growth of vegetation distribution may impact the UHI, and the high LST correlated to the presence of high particulate matter in the area.

TI  - Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 among patients in the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre primary care network: a cross-sectional study
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background There are few primary care studies of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre primary care network.Methods We analysed routinely collected, pseudonymised data for patients in the RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre primary care sentinel network who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between Jan 28 and April 4, 2020. We used multivariable logistic regression models with multiple imputation to identify risk factors for positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within this surveillance network.Findings We identified 3802 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 587 were positive. In multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (296 [18.4%] of 1612 men vs 291 [13.3%] of 2190 women; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% CI 1.27-1.89). Adults were at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with children, and people aged 40-64 years were at greatest risk in the multivariable model (243 [18.5%] of 1316 adults aged 40-64 years vs 23 [4.6%] of 499 children; adjusted OR 5.36, 95% CI 3.28-8.76). Compared with white people, the adjusted odds of a positive test were greater in black people (388 [15.5%] of 2497 white people vs 36 [62.1%] of 58 black people; adjusted OR 4.75, 95% CI 2.65-8.51). People living in urban areas versus rural areas (476 [26.2%] of 1816 in urban areas vs 111 [5.6%] of 1986 in rural areas; adjusted OR 4.59, 95% CI 3.57-5.90) and in more deprived areas (197 [29.5%] of 668 in most deprived vs 143 [7.7%] of 1855 in least deprived; adjusted OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.51-2.71) were more likely to test positive. People with chronic kidney disease were more likely to test positive in the adjusted analysis (68 [32.9%] of 207 with chronic kidney disease vs 519 [14.4%] of 3595 without; adjusted OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.31-2.78), but there was no significant association with other chronic conditions in that analysis. We found increased odds of a positive test among people who are obese (142 [20.9%] of 680 people with obesity vs 171 [13.2%] of 1296 normal-weight people; adjusted OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.04-1.91). Notably, active smoking was linked with decreased odds of a positive test result (47 [11.4%] of 413 active smokers vs 201 [17.9%] of 1125 non-smokers; adjusted OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.34-0.71).Interpretation A positive SARS-CoV-2 test result in this primary care cohort was associated with similar risk factors as observed for severe outcomes of COVID-19 in hospital settings, except for smoking. We provide evidence of potential sociodemographic factors associated with a positive test, including deprivation, population density, ethnicity, and chronic kidney disease.

TI  - Machine learning algorithms for mapping <i>Prosopis glandulosa</i> and land cover change using multi-temporal Landsat products: a case study of Prieska in the Northern Cape Province, South Africa
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive alien plants (IAPs) are responsible for loss in biodiversity and the depletion of water resources in natural ecosystems. Prosopis species are IAPs previously introduced by farmers to provide shade and fodder for livestock. In the Northern Cape, Prosopis spp. invasions are associated with the loss of native species resulting in overgrazing and degrading rangelands. Mapping Prosopis glandulosa is essential for management initiatives to assist the government in minimising the spread and impact of IAPs. This study aims to evaluate the performance of two machine learning algorithms i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) to map the spatial dynamics of P. glandulosa in Prieska. The spatial invasion extent of P. glandulosa was mapped using multitemporal Landsat data spanning the period from 1990 to 2018. Validation of the results was done through an estimated error matrix with the use of the proportion of area and the estimates of overall accuracy, user's accuracy and producer's accuracy with a 95% confidence interval. The performance of the SVM and RF classifiers showed similar results in the overall accuracy and Kappa statistics throughout the years. These methods showed an overall increase of at least 3.3% of the area invaded by P. glandulosa from 1990 to 2018. The study indicates the importance of Landsat imagery for mapping historical and current land cover change of IAPs. The spread of P. glandulosa was confirmed by an increase in the total area of invasion, which enables decision-makers to improve monitoring and eradication initiatives.

TI  - Yield Gap Analysis Using Remote Sensing and Modelling Approaches: Wheat in the Northwest of Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The reduction of the yield gap is one of the strategies implemented for the improvement of food security. In this research, the yield gap of wheat in the west of Golestan province, Iran, was estimated using a two-step methodology. In the first step, the potential yield was evaluated using the SSM-iCrop2 model and in the following, the yield gap was determined by the difference between the actual yield and potential yield. In the second step, the NDVI-actual yield regression in parallel with boundary-line analysis was used to assess the attainable yield. The estimated attainable yield varied from 3.0 to 5.8 t ha(-1). Accordingly, the attainable yield gap in the studied region was 2.6 t ha(-1)on average, which could be obtained via improved management. Also, based on model outputs, the potential yield varied from 5.4 to 7.2 t ha(-1)which suggests a high possibility to improve wheat yield in the west parts of Golestan province. The results of the study provided basic information to quantify the yield gap and yield optimization options. Our results revealed that remote sensing in combination with crop simulation models is a powerful tool in regional assessments and removes the limitations of working with point data.

TI  - Remotely-sensed assessment of the impact of century-old biochar on chicory crop growth using high-resolution UAV-based imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, special attention has been given to the long-term effects of biochar on the performance of agroecosystems owing to its potential for improving soil fertility, harvested crop yields, and aboveground biomass production. The present experiment was set up to identify the effects on soil-plant systems of biochar produced more than 150 years ago in charcoal mound kiln sites in Wallonia (Belgium). Although the impacts of biochar on soil-plant systems are being increasingly discussed, a detailed monitoring of the crop dynamics throughout the growing season has not yet been well addressed. At present there is considerable interest in applying remote sensing for crop growth monitoring in order to improve sustainable agricultural practices. However, studies using high-resolution remote sensing data to focus on century-old biochar effects are not yet available. For the first time, the impacts of century-old biochar on crop growth were investigated at canopy level using highresolution airborne remote sensing data over a cultivated field. High-resolution RGB, multispectral and thermal sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were used to generate high frequency remote sensing information on the crop dynamics. UAVs were flown over 11 century-old charcoal-enriched soil patches and the adjacent reference soils of a chicory field. We retrieved crucial crop parameters such as canopy cover, vegetation indices and crop water stress from the UAV imageries. In addition, our study also provides in-situ measurements of soil properties and crop traits. Both UAV-based RGB imagery and in-situ measurements demonstrated that the presence of century-old biochar significantly improved chicory canopy cover, with greater leaf lengths in biochar patches. Weighted difference vegetation index imagery showed a negative influence of biochar presence on plant greenness at the end of the growing season. Chicory crop stress was significantly increased by biochar presence, whereas the harvested crop yield was not affected. The main significant variations observed between reference and century-old biochar patches using in situ measurements of crop traits concerned leaf length. Hence, the output from the present study will be of great interest to help developing climate-smart agriculture practices allowing for adaptation and mitigation to climate.

TI  - Potential of satellite and reanalysis evaporation datasets for hydrological modelling under various model calibration strategies
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Twelve actual evaporation datasets are evaluated for their ability to improve the performance of the fully distributed mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM). The datasets consist of satellite-based diagnostic models (MOD16A2, SSEBop, ALEXI, CMRSET, SEBS), satellite-based prognostic models (GLEAM v3.2a, GLEAM v3.3a, GLEAM v3.2b, GLEAM v3.3b), and reanalysis (ERA5, MERRA-2, JRA-55). Four distinct multivariate calibration strategies (basin-average, pixel-wise, spatial bias-accounting and spatial bias-insensitive) using actual evaporation and streamflow are implemented, resulting in 48 scenarios whose results are compared with a benchmark model calibrated solely with streamflow data. A process-diagnostic approach is adopted to evaluate the model responses with in-situ data of streamflow and independent remotely sensed data of soil moisture from ESA-CCI and terrestrial water storage from GRACE. The method is implemented in the Volta River basin, which is a data scarce region in West Africa, for the period from 2003 to 2012.Results show that the evaporation datasets have a good potential for improving model calibration, but this is dependent on the calibration strategy. All the multivariate calibration strategies outperform the streamflowonly calibration. The highest improvement in the overall model performance is obtained with the spatial bias accounting strategy (+ 29%), followed by the spatial bias-insensitive strategy (+ 26%) and the pixel-wise strategy (+ 24%), while the basin-average strategy (+ 20%) gives the lowest improvement. On average, using evaporation data in addition to streamflow for model calibration decreases the model performance for streamflow (-7%), which is counterbalance by the increase in the performance of the terrestrial water storage (+ 11%), temporal dynamics of soil moisture (+ 6%) and spatial patterns of soil moisture (+ 89%). In general, the top three best performing evaporation datasets are MERRA-2, GLEAM v3.3a and SSEBop, while the bottom three datasets are MOD16A2, SEBS and ERA5. However, performances of the evaporation products diverge according to model responses and across climatic zones. These findings open up avenues for improving process representation of hydrological models and advancing the spatiotemporal prediction of floods and droughts under climate and land use changes.

T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of seasonal variability of the East Siberian Sea (ESS) water column primary production (IPP) and evaluation of its total annual value (PPtot) were performed using MODIS-Aqua data (2002-2018). Region-specific primary production and chlorophyll algorithms were used for the first time to achieve that result. Northeastern and Southwestern regions were distinguished in ESS based on multiyear average daily primary production. Seasonal variations in IPP in the Northeastern region were characterized by the maximum in June (273 mgC m(-2) d(-1)). The maximum of water column primary production value in the Southwestern region was recorded in May (311 mgC m(-2) d(-1)). The maximum of IPP for the entire ESS was registered in June (273 mgC m(-2) d(-1)). Values of daily primary production and PPtot in the Southwestern region were, respectively, 1.8 and 2 fold higher than in the Northeastern region. The multiyear averaged value of ESS IPP was equal to 91 mgC m(-2) d(-1) and PPtot value was equal to 9 TgC. Productivity of the Siberian seas decreased eastward.

TI  - Detection of Citrus Huanglongbing Based on Multi-Input Neural Network Model of UAV Hyperspectral Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Citrus is an important cash crop in the world, and huanglongbing (HLB) is a destructive disease in the citrus industry. To efficiently detect the degree of HLB stress on large-scale orchard citrus trees, an UAV (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle) hyperspectral remote sensing tool is used for HLB rapid detection. A Cubert S185 (Airborne Hyperspectral camera) was mounted on the UAV of DJI Matrice 600 Pro to capture the hyperspectral remote sensing images; and a ASD Handheld2 (spectrometer) was used to verify the effectiveness of the remote sensing data. Correlation-proven UAV hyperspectral remote sensing data were used, and canopy spectral samples based on single pixels were extracted for processing and analysis. The feature bands extracted by the genetic algorithm (GA) of the improved selection operator were 468 nm, 504 nm, 512 nm, 516 nm, 528 nm, 536 nm, 632 nm, 680 nm, 688 nm, and 852 nm for the HLB detection. The proposed HLB detection methods (based on the multi-feature fusion of vegetation index) and canopy spectral feature parameters constructed (based on the feature band in stacked autoencoder (SAE) neural network) have a classification accuracy of 99.33% and a loss of 0.0783 for the training set, and a classification accuracy of 99.72% and a loss of 0.0585 for the validation set. This performance is higher than that based on the full-band AutoEncoder neural network. The field-testing results show that the model could effectively detect the HLB plants and output the distribution of the disease in the canopy, thus judging the plant disease level in a large area efficiently.

CP  - 78th Annual Meeting of the American-Association-for-the-Surgery-of-Trauma (AAST) / Clinical Congress of Acute Care Surgery

AB  - BACKGROUND Impaired microvascular perfusion in the obese patient has been linked to chronic adverse health consequences. The impact on acute illnesses including trauma, sepsis, and hemorrhagic shock (HS) is uncertain. Studies have shown that endothelial glycocalyx and vascular endothelial derangements are causally linked to perfusion abnormalities. Trauma and HS are also associated with impaired microvascular perfusion in which glycocalyx injury and endothelial dysfunction are sentinel events. We postulate that obesity may impact the adverse consequences of HS on the vascular barrier. This was studied in vivo in a biomimetic model of HS using microfluidic technology. METHODS Human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers were established in a microfluidic device. Cells were exposed to standard or biomimetic shock conditions (hypoxia plus epinephrine) followed by perfusion from plasma obtained from obese or nonobese subjects. Endothelial glycocalyx and endothelial cellular injury were then determined. RESULTS Plasma from nonobese patients completely reversed glycocalyx and endothelial vascular barrier injury. Plasma from obese patients was only partially protective and was associated with differences in adipokines and other substances in the plasma of these patients. CONCLUSION Our study supports that obesity impairs HS resuscitation. This may be due to microrheological differences between nonobese and obese individuals and may contribute to the poorer outcome in this patient population.

TI  - Evaluating Processing Choices for the Geodetic Estimation of Earth Orientation Parameters With Numerical Models of Global Geophysical Fluids
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Different Earth orientation parameter (EOP) time series are publicly available that typically arise from the combination of individual space geodetic technique solutions. The applied processing strategies and choices lead to systematically differing signal and noise characteristics particularly at the shortest periods between 2 and 8 days. We investigate the consequences of typical choices by introducing new experimental EOP solutions obtained from combinations at either normal equation level processed by Deutsches Geodatisches Forschungsinstitut at the Technical University of Munich (DGFI-TUM) and Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG), or observation level processed by European Space Agency (ESA). All those experiments contribute to an effort initiated by ESA to develop an independent capacity for routine EOP processing and prediction in Europe. Results are benchmarked against geophysical model-based effective angular momentum functions processed by Helmholtz Centre Potsdam GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences (ESMGFZ). We find, that a multitechnique combination at normal equation level that explicitly aligns a priori station coordinates to the ITRF2014 frequently outperforms the current International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) standard solution 14C04. A multi-Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-only solution already provides very competitive accuracies for the equatorial components. Quite similar results are also obtained from a short combination at observation level experiment using multi-GNSS solutions and SLR from Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B to realize space links. For Delta UT1, however, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) information is known to be critically important so that experiments combining only GNSS and possibly SLR at observation level perform worse than combinations of all techniques at normal equation level. The low noise floor and smooth spectra obtained from the multi-GNSS solution nevertheless illustrates the potential of this most rigorous combination approach so that further efforts to include in particular VLBI are strongly recommended.

TI  - Combining Artificial Neural Networks with Causal Inference for Total Phosphorus Concentration Estimation and Sensitive Spectral Bands Exploration Using MODIS
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The total phosphorus (TP) concentration is a key water quality parameter for water monitoring and a major indicator of the state of eutrophication in inland lakes. Using remote-sensing to estimate TP concentration is useful, as it provides a synoptic view of the entire water region; however, the weak optical characteristics of TP lead to difficulty in accurately estimating TP concentration. The differences in water characteristics and components between lakes mean that most TP estimation methods are not applicable to all lakes. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was created to represent the correlation between TP concentration and the spectral bands of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images in different research areas. We investigated the causal inference under the potential outcome framework to analyze the sensitivity of each band with regard to the TP concentration of different lakes for the research of water characteristics. Our results show that the accuracy of the ANN-based TP concentration estimation, withR(2)> 0.73, root mean squared error (RMSE) < 0.037 mg/L in Lake Okeechobee andR(2)> 0.73, RMSE < 4.1 mu g/L in Lake Erie, respectively, is much higher than traditional empirical methods, e.g., linear regression. We found that the sensitive bands of TP concentration in Lake Erie are blue bands, whereas the sensitive bands in Lake Okeechobee are green bands. Various TP concentration maps were drawn to indicate the distribution of TP concentration and its tendency to change. The maps show that the distribution of TP concentration closely corresponds to the shore land-use, and a high TP concentration corresponds to the latest algal blooms breakout. Our proposed approach shows good potential for the remote-sensing estimation of TP concentration for inland lakes. Identifying the sensitive bands not only help characterize the lakes, but will also help the researchers to further observe the TP concentration of specific lakes in an efficient way.

TI  - On the Characterization and Forecasting of Ground Displacements of Ocean-Reclaimed Lands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we study ground deformation of ocean-reclaimed platforms as retrieved from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analyses. We investigate, in particular, the suitability and accuracy of some time-dependent models used to characterize and foresee the present and future evolution of ground deformation of the coastal lands. Previous investigations, carried out by the authors of this paper and other scholars, related to the zone of the ocean-reclaimed lands of Shanghai, have already shown that ocean-reclaimed lands are subject to subside (i.e., the ground is subject to settling down due to soil consolidation and compression), and the temporal evolution of that deformation follows a certain predictable model. Specifically, two time-gapped SAR datasets composed of the images collected by the ENVISAT ASAR (ENV) from 2007 to 2010 and the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) sensors, available from 2013 to 2016, were used to generate long-term ground displacement time-series using a proper time-dependent geotechnical model. In this work, we use a third SAR data set consisting of Radarsat-2 (RST-2) acquisitions collected from 2012 to 2016 to further corroborate the validity of that model. As a result, we verified with the new RST-2 data, partially covering the gap between the ENV and CSK acquisitions, that the adopted model fits the data and that the model is suitable to perform future projections. Furthermore, we extended these analyses to the area of Pearl River Delta (PRD) and the city of Shenzhen, China. Our study aims to investigate the suitability of different time-dependent ground deformation models relying on the different geophysical conditions in the two areas of Shanghai and Shenzhen, China. To this aim, three sets of SAR data, collected by the ENV platform (from both ascending and descending orbits) and the Sentinel-1A (S1A) sensor (on ascending orbits), were used to obtain the ground displacement time-series of the Shenzhen city and its surrounding region. Multi-orbit InSAR data products were also combined to discriminate the up-down (subsidence) ground deformation time-series of the coherent points, which are then used to estimate the parameters of the models adopted to foresee the future evolution of the land-reclaimed ground consolidation procedure. The exploitation of the obtained geospatial data and products are helpful for the continuous monitoring of coastal environments and the evaluation of the socio-economical impacts of human activities and global climate change.

TI  - Retrieval of Melt Pond Fraction over Arctic Sea Ice during 2000-2019 Using an Ensemble-Based Deep Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate knowledge of variations of melt ponds is important for understanding the Arctic energy budget due to its albedo-transmittance-melt feedback. In this study, we develop and validate a new method for retrieving melt pond fraction (MPF) over Arctic sea ice using all seven spectral bands of MODIS surface reflectance. We construct a robust ensemble-based deep neural network and use in-situ MPF observations collected from multiple sources as the target data to train the network. We examine the potential influence of using sea ice concentration (SIC) from different sources as additional target data (besides MPF) on the MPF retrieval. The results suggest that the inclusion of SIC has a minor impact on MPF retrieval. Based on this, we create a new MPF data from 2000 to 2019 (the longest data in our knowledge). The validation shows that our new MPF data is in good agreement with the observations. We further compare the new MPF dataset with the previously published MPF datasets. It is found that the evolution of the new MPF is similar to previous MPF data throughout the melting season, but the new MPF data is in relatively better agreement with the observations in terms of correlations and root mean squared errors (RMSE), and also has the smallest value in the first half of the melting season.

TI  - Regional-Scale Investigation of Preconditioning Factors of Rock Slope Instabilities in NW Bhutan
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new inventory of large rock slope instabilities and an extensive structural data set for northwestern Bhutan. Our data set is largely based on satellite observations, such as optical images and high-resolution digital surface models, complemented with field observations. Kinematic analyses over seven different structural domains recognized in the study region were carried out to investigate structural control over the landslide distribution at a regional scale. In order to account for the sampling heterogeneity in the different data sets, a weighting system to the structural data is proposed. The results show that structural control exists in five out of seven domains, with foliation strongly influencing the sliding mechanisms. A lithological control appears also evident, with sedimentary rocks showing the highest landslide densities in the region. This study demonstrates how methodologies built on remote sensing data are suitable to investigate landslide predisposition at regional scales especially in largely inaccessible areas.

TI  - Biomarker phenotyping drives clinical management in axillary sentinel node: A retrospective study on women with primary breast cancer in 2002
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study examined if cancer biomarker phenotyping could predict the clinical/pathological status of axillary nodes in women with primary breast cancer. Primary breast cancers from 2002 were analyzed for tumor size, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), Ki-67MIB expression and Her2/neu amplification. Relationships between the clinical and pathological status of the axilla and the biological subtypes classification were analyzed using univariate, multivariate and regression tree analysis. A total of 65% of women with axillary nodes clinically involved had complete axillary node dissection (ALND) while 705 women with clinically negative axillary underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), 18.5% of the latter had at least one pathologically SLNB involved node. Multivariate analysis revealed that the Luminal A subtype was significantly associated (OR 0.62; P<10(-9)) with clinical negative axilla while HER2pos/not Luminal was associated with clinical positivity (OR 1.71; P<0.01). No significant association between biological subtypes and SLNB status was demonstrated. Regression tree analysis revealed that subgroups with significantly different probability of SLNB status were separated according to tumor size and PgR values. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that biomarker breast cancer phenotyping is significantly associated with clinical status of axillary nodes but not with pathological involvement of nodes at SLNB. Regression tree analysis could represent a valid attempt to individualize some patients subgroups candidate to different surgical axilla approaches.

TI  - Are men and women with breast cancer treated equally in Germany?
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR EVIDENZ FORTBILDUNG UND QUALITAET IM GESUNDHEITSWESEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Within the statutory health insurance system of the Federal Republic of Germany, a system of quality assurance has been implemented and operationalised through the measurement of quality indicators. For breast surgery, these quality indicators are mainly based on recommendations of the German clinical guideline for screening, diagnosis, therapy and follow-up of breast cancer. The 2018 update of this guideline includes a new chapter on breast cancer in men. The aim of this analysis is to examine whether male and female patients with breast cancer are treated equally where appropriate and recommended by the clinical guideline, as measured by the quality indicators.Method: Data of ten quality assurance indicators were analysed, for each indicator separately, stratified by sex and pooled over a 5-year period to gain statistical power. This dataset constitutes the largest data pool of men with surgical interventions for breast neoplasm in Germany. Indicator results were then compared between male and female cases. Additional subgroup analyses were carried out for two quality indicators with substantial outcome difference between male and female cases in order to detect possible differences in the treatment of breast cancer between different medical departments.Results: The database of the ten quality assurance indicators comprised 551,221 patients (546,324 females and 4,897 males) between 2014 and 2018. Pooled data of nine quality indicators (QIs) showed statistically significant outcome differences between male and female cases. In spite of pooling, the male sample size of four QIs was too small to allow for statistically reliable comparisons between male and female patients. Outcome differences in the remaining five QIs may, on the one hand, be explained by anatomical differences and different extent of the surgery, and on the other hand they confirm international data for lower HER2-positivity rates in male breast cancer patients. However, two process indicators, aiming at pretherapeutic biopsy and sentinel lymph node biopsy in invasive breast cancer recommended by the clinical guideline, show substantial differences of more than 6 percentage points between the sexes: although recommended by the clinical guideline, both procedures are carried out less often in male cases. Further analysis regarding the medical departments that recorded the treatment revealed that risk for non-adherence to guideline recommendation was high if treatment took place in non-gynaecological departments. Compared to gynaecological departments, procedures such as pretherapeutic biopsy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were carried out less frequently if cases were documented to be handled by surgery or plastic surgery departments.Discussion and conclusion: Analysis of breast surgery quality indicators reveals a lower level of adherence to guideline recommendations for men with breast cancer compared to women in some aspects of the guideline, as measured by statutory quality indicators in breast surgery. Male breast cancer might be a rare disease, but nevertheless, awareness-rising is needed in diagnostics, treatment and interdisciplinarity in order to avoid inequality between the sexes.

TI  - Very Local Subsidence Near the Hot Spring Region in Hakone Volcano, Japan, Inferred from InSAR Time Series Analysis of ALOS/PALSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of surface displacement by satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis is an effective method for detecting land subsidence in areas where routes of leveling measurements are undeveloped, such as mountainous areas. In particular, InSAR-based monitoring around well-developed hot spring resorts, such as those in Japan, is useful for conserving hot spring resources. Hakone Volcano is one of the major hot spring resorts in Japan, and many hot spring wells have been developed in the Owakudani fumarole area, where a small phreatic eruption occurred in 2015. In this study, we performed an InSAR time series analysis using the small baseline subset (SBAS) method and ALOS/PALSAR scenes of the Hakone Volcano to monitor surface displacements around the volcano. The results of the SBAS-InSAR time series analysis show highly localized subsidence to the west of Owakudani from 2006-2011 when the ALOS/PALSAR satellite was operated. The area of subsidence was approximately 500 m in diameter, and the peak rate of subsidence was approximately 30 mm/year. Modeling using a point pressure source suggested that the subsidence was caused by a contraction at approximately 700 m above sea level (about 300 m below the ground surface). The rate of this contraction was estimated to be 1.04 x 10(4)m(3)/year. Hot spring water is collected from a nearby well at almost the same depth as the contraction source, and its main dissolved ion component is chloride ions, suggesting that the hydrothermal fluids are supplied from deep within the volcano. The land subsidence suggests that the fumarole activity is attenuating due to a decrease in the supply of hydrothermal fluids from deeper areas.

TI  - Non-climatic component provoked substantial spatiotemporal changes of carbon and water use efficiency on the Mongolian Plateau
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the joint impact of anthropologic and climatic changes on ecosystem function and dynamics is among the frontiers in global environmental change studies. Carbon and water balances are especially crucial to the sustainable ecosystem and functional returns in sensitive regions such as the Mongolian Plateau. In this study, the significance of non-climatic component (NCC) on carbon and water use efficiency (CUE and WUE) is quantified among the ecosystem types on the Mongolian Plateau. We mapped the spatial gradients of carbon/water balance and delineated the hotspots of NCC-driven CUE and WUE for 2000-2013 using gross and net primary production (GPP and NPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) products derived from the MODIS databases. Significantly higher CUE and WUE values were found in Mongolia (MG) than in Inner Mongolia (IM) due to both climatic forcing (CF) and NCC. NCC was found to dominate the changes in CUE and WUE in the steppes on the plateau by over 16% and 22%, respectively, but with spatially uneven distributions. NCC-driven WUE values were much higher than those driven by CF. The hotspots for NCC-driven CUE did not overlap with those of WUE, with CUE hotspots concentrated in the east of MG and northeast of IM; WUE hotspots were found in the central and Khangai regions of MG and eastern regions of IM. The NCC-driven CUE area in MG was from population growth and the industrial shares in gross domestic product, while the NCC-driven WUE area was due to livestock growth in MG but driven by the growth of cultivated lands in IM. In sum, we conclude that NCC provoked substantial spatiotemporal changes on carbon and water use. CF and NCC effects on carbon and water balance varied in space, by ecosystem type, and between the two political entities.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variation of Total Nitrogen and Ammonia Nitrogen in the Water Source of the Middle Route of the South-To-North Water Diversion Project
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantitative inversion of the concentrations of water quality parameters could clarify the temporal and spatial distribution characteristic, migration, and conversion of water quality parameters. This study took the Danjiangkou Reservoir as the research object, and established an inversion model based on the reflectance of different band combinations of remote sensing analyses on Sentinel-2 images, combined with the water quality monitoring data of total nitrogen (TN) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) of the sampling sites in February 2016. The inversion results of TN and NH3-N in 2020 were obtained, the variation of TN and NH3-N concentrations in the reservoir area were analyzed, and the factors accounting for the variation were discussed. The results indicated that the fitting accuracy using the established model was high for both TN and NH3-N, and R-2 was 0.782 for TN and 0.851 for NH3-N, respectively, showing high predication accuracy, which could be suitable for remote sensing inversion of TN and NH3-N concentrations in the Danjiangkou Reservoir. The NH3-N concentration of the Danjiangkou Reservoir was in line with Class I from 2016 to 2020, while the TN concentration was between Class III and IV. The inter-annual changes indicated that the overall water quality had an upward trend. The main tributary in the northern of the Danjiangkou Reservoir had a heavy load of TN, and after entering the reservoir, the flow velocity decreased, which caused nitrogen to accumulate at the river entrance, leading to a high TN concentration. The large slope of the mountainous area cause soil erosion. The lost soil and water carried a large amount of pesticides and fertilizers, and the ground runoff carried a large amount of nitrogen into water body, which could account for the high NH3-N concentration on the east and west sides of the southern part of the Danjiangkou Reservoir.

TI  - Submesoscale fronts observed by satellites over the Northern South China Sea shelf
T2  - DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fronts are ubiquitous dynamic processes in the ocean, which play a significant role in the ocean dynamical and ecological environments. In this paper strong temperature fronts are investigated on the shelf of the Northern South China Sea using high resolution satellite data. These fronts have large horizontal gradients exceeding 1 degrees C km(-1) with spatial scales around several kilometers. The fronts generate meanders and eddies due to baroclinic instability, since these instabilities have spatial scales around the local first baroclinic mode deformation radius. The estimated Rossby number of the fronts is O(0.4), suggesting that the fronts tend to be ageostrophic and show submesoscale features. The Finite Size Lyapunov Exponent analysis of the generation mechanism indicates that the fronts are tightly related to the combined flow straining of geostrophic and Ekman currents.

TI  - High-Frequency Ultrasonic Forceps for the In Vivo Detection of Cancer During Breast-Conserving Surgery
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL DEVICES-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
M3  - Article
AB  - A major aim in the surgical management of soft tissue cancers is to detect and remove all cancerous tissues while ensuring noncancerous tissue remains intact. Breast-conserving surgery provides a prime illustration of this aim, since remaining cancer in breast margins results in multiple surgeries, while removal of too much unaffected tissue often has undesirable cosmetic effects. Similarly, resection of benign lymph nodes during sentinel lymph node biopsy can cause deleterious health outcomes. The objective of this study was to create an intraoperative, in vivo device to address these challenges. Instant diagnostic information generated by this device could allow surgeons to precisely and completely remove all malignant tissue during the first surgery. Surgical forceps based on Martin forceps were instrumented at the tips with high-frequency ultrasonic transducers composed of polyvinylidene difluoride, a thickness-sensing rotary potentiometer at the base, and a spring to provide the appropriate restoring force. Transducer wires within the forceps were connected to an external high-frequency pulser-receiver, activating the forceps' transmitting transducer at 50 MHz and amplifying through-transmission signals from the receiving transducer. The forceps were tested with tissue-mimicking agarose phantoms embedded with 58-550 mu m polyethylene microspheres to simulate various stages of cancer progression and to provide a range of measurement values. Results were compared with measurements from standard 50 MHz immersion transducers. The results showed that the forceps displayed similar sensitivity for attenuation and increased accuracy for wave speed. The forceps could also be extended to endoscopes and laparoscopes.

TI  - Fault slip distribution of the 2015 M<sub>w</sub>7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake estimated from InSAR and GPS measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Inversion of the coseismic slip distribution is important for understanding seismogenic mechanisms. In this study, the geometric parametersand uncertainties for the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal were inverted using a Bayesian approach. The coseismic fault slip distribution was inverted based on triangular dislocations from interferometrc synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) surface displacement measurements. The inversion results show that the rupture propagated southeast for approximately 140 km, with most of the slip constrained within 30 - 40 km along the dip direction. There are two peak slips in the slip distribution: a similar to 5.9 m slip located similar to 50 km southeast of the epicenter at a depth of 10.2 km, and a similar to 6.32 m slip located similar to 100 km southeast of the epicenter at a depth of 10 km. Near the M(w)7.3 aftershock, the rupture propagated to the north and southeast. The gap in slip formed between the mainshock and the M(w)7.3 aftershock is similar to the shape of a "crocodile with an open mouth". The results of the triangular dislocation model can explain the GPS-based coseismic displacements and the InSAR deformation field when compared with a classic rectangular dislocation, with a 10.6 cm reduction in the average residual of the InSAR data and a 2 cm reduction in the average residual of the GPS deformation. Compared to the geometry of a ramp-flat-ramp structure, we postulate that both a single-segment and multiple-segments are possible near Kathmandu.

TI  - Component Decomposition-Based Hyperspectral Resolution Enhancement for Mineral Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining both spectral and spatial information with enhanced resolution provides not only elaborated qualitative information on surfacing mineralogy but also mineral interactions of abundance, mixture, and structure. This enhancement in the resolutions helps geomineralogic features such as small intrusions and mineralization become detectable. In this paper, we investigate the potential of the resolution enhancement of hyperspectral images (HSIs) with the guidance of RGB images for mineral mapping. In more detail, a novel resolution enhancement method is proposed based on component decomposition. Inspired by the principle of the intrinsic image decomposition (IID) model, the HSI is viewed as the combination of a reflectance component and an illumination component. Based on this idea, the proposed method is comprised of several steps. First, the RGB image is transformed into the luminance component, blue-difference and red-difference chroma components (YCbCr), and the luminance channel is considered as the illumination component of the HSI with an ideal high spatial resolution. Then, the reflectance component of the ideal HSI is estimated with the downsampled HSI image and the downsampled luminance channel. Finally, the HSI with high resolution can be reconstructed by utilizing the obtained illumination and the reflectance components. Experimental results verify that the fused results can successfully achieve mineral mapping, producing better results qualitatively and quantitatively over single sensor data.

TI  - Simulating Radiometric Resolution of Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder Onboard the FY-3D Satellite
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave humidity and temperature sounder (MWHTS) is an important payload of FENGYUN-3D (FY-3D) satellite. MWHTS is designed as a total power radiometer because of its high radiometric resolution (NEDT) and simple configuration. NEDT is one of the most important indicators for MWHTS. However, the traditional NEDT analysis results have a large error compared with the measured results. To estimate the overall radiometer performance, this article presents a numerical system simulation model that can be used to estimate NEDT. The model considers two of three main components that degrade the NEDT: thermal noise and calibration error. The third component 1/ f noise is calculated by analyzing the power spectrum of the actual output voltage. Based on digital signal processing, this article presents a method for accurate system modeling, including radiation source modeling, frontend modeling, and backend modeling. The simulation model is validated by comparing the dynamic range, linearity, and standard deviation in output signals of the simulation system and actual instrument. In this article, the model has been applied to NEDT estimate of 15 MWHTS channels operating from 89 to 183 GHz. The comparison of the estimate results between the simulation model and actual instrument shows they are in good agreement and the maximum error is no more than 18%.

TI  - Comprehensive Study of the Sand Spit Evolution at Tidal Inlets in the Central Coast of Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal inlets along the central coast of Vietnam are located in a microtidal, wave-dominated coastal environment. In addition, the Vietnam coast is highly influenced by the seasonal monsoon regime, which is characterized by large northeast waves from October to March and calm southeast waves from April to September every year. Consequently, the tidal inlet entrance morphologies often suffer from a dynamic seasonal evolution due to distinct differences in the direction of wave-induced longshore sediment transport (LST) between the two monsoon seasons. The migration or closure of tidal inlets causes a lot of problems for socio-economic development in the region since these are the main reasons leading to an increase in the risk of coastal flooding and the obstruction of navigation. This paper presents a comprehensive study of the morphological evolutions of natural tidal inlets on the central coast of Vietnam using long-term remote sensing data sets and by the Delft3D numerical model. Surprisingly, the estimated LST rates from the former method are in an order of magnitude agreement with the results from the latter one for all of the areas in this study. Based on the conservation equation for sand and comprehensive data collection, a new simple empirical formula for predicting the sand spit elongation rate as a function of the sand spit width is developed. Although the breaching of sand spit might happen during an extreme flood event at some tidal inlets, the growth rate of the spit before and after the breaching is almost unchanged. These findings are very useful information for supporting the local coastal authorities to find better management solutions in terms of sustainable development.

TI  - Accelerated Snow Melt in the Russian Caucasus Mountains After the Saharan Dust Outbreak in March 2018
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Light absorbing particles, such as mineral dust, are a potent climate forcing agent. Many snow-covered areas are subject to dust outbreak events originating from desert regions able to significantly decrease snow albedo. Here, using a combination of Sentinel-2 imagery, in situ measurements and ensemble detailed snowpack simulations, we study the impact on snow cover duration of a major dust deposition event that occurred in the Caucasus in March 2018. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study using ensemble approach and Sentinel-2 imagery to quantify the impact of a dust event on the snow cover evolution. We demonstrate that the calculation of the impact is strongly affected by the snow model uncertainties but that the March 2018 dust event systematically shortened the snow cover duration inWestern Caucasus. The shortening is higher for location with higher accumulation and higher elevation (median values of 23 +/- 7 days) than for location at lower elevation (median values of 15 +/- 3 days). This is because for sites with higher location and higher accumulation, melt occurs later in the season when more incoming solar energy is available. This highlights the huge impact of a single 1- day event on snow cover duration, and consequently, on the hydrology of a large region.

TI  - Lessons to Be Learned: Groundwater Depletion in Chile's Ligua and Petorca Watersheds through an Interdisciplinary Approach
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater (GW) is the primary source of unfrozen freshwater on the planet and in many semi-arid areas, it is the only source of water available during low-water periods. In north-central Chile, there has been GW depletion as a result of semi-arid conditions and high water demand, which has unleashed major social conflicts, some due to drought and others due to agribusiness practices against the backdrop of a private water management model. The Ligua and Petorca watersheds in the Valparaiso Region were studied in order to analyze the influence of climatic and anthropogenic factors on aquifer depletion using an interdisciplinary approach that integrates hydroclimatic variables, remote sensing data techniques, and GW rights data to promote sustainable GW management. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated and the 2002-2017 land-use change was analyzed. It was shown that GW decreased significantly (in 75% of the wells) and that the hydrological drought was moderate and prolonged (longest drought in the last 36 years). The avocado-growing area in Ligua increased significantly-by 2623 ha-with respect to other agricultural areas (higher GW decrease), while in Petorca, it decreased by 128 ha. In addition, GW-rainfall correlations were low and GW rights were granted continuously despite the drought. The results confirmed that aquifer depletion was mostly influenced by human factors due to overexploitation by agriculture and a lack of water management.

TI  - Interdisciplinary Teaching Using Satellite Images as a Way to Introduce Remote Sensing in Secondary School
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to meet two needs: (i) the need for skilled workers and students in the area of remote sensing and (ii) the need to make school science interesting for students. This article addresses both needs by proposing a project for high school students entitled "the Colors of Earth". The main aim for students was to distinguish between different types of land cover via the creation of various false color band compositions from the satellite Sentinel-2. Achieving this goal requires knowledge from various subjects and enables their practical application via work performed using real data. The project was presented to 39 high-school teachers and 184 high-school students (K-9 and K-10) in the summer semester of the 2019/2020 school year, and their opinions about the project were collected. Overall, both students and teachers judged the project to be interesting, worth introducing to the school, and capable of influencing student opinions of science. In addition, introducing remote sensing elements during pre-university education can help meet the demands for students and workers to study Earth observation.

TI  - Recent Applications of Landsat 8/OLI and Sentinel-2/MSI for Land Use and Land Cover Mapping: A Systematic Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Recent applications of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (L8/OLI) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (S2/MSI) data for acquiring information about land use and land cover (LULC) provide a new perspective in remote sensing data analysis. Jointly, these sources permit researchers to improve operational classification and change detection, guiding better reasoning about landscape and intrinsic processes, as deforestation and agricultural expansion. However, the results of their applications have not yet been synthesized in order to provide coherent guidance on the effect of their applications in different classification processes, as well as to identify promising approaches and issues which affect classification performance. In this systematic review, we present trends, potentialities, challenges, actual gaps, and future possibilities for the use of L8/OLI and S2/MSI for LULC mapping and change detection. In particular, we highlight the possibility of using medium-resolution (Landsat-like, 10-30 m) time series and multispectral optical data provided by the harmonization between these sensors and data cube architectures for analysis-ready data that are permeated by publicizations, open data policies, and open science principles. We also reinforce the potential for exploring more spectral bands combinations, especially by using the three Red-edge and the two Near Infrared and Shortwave Infrared bands of S2/MSI, to calculate vegetation indices more sensitive to phenological variations that were less frequently applied for a long time, but have turned on since the S2/MSI mission. Summarizing peer-reviewed papers can guide the scientific community to the use of L8/OLI and S2/MSI data, which enable detailed knowledge on LULC mapping and change detection in different landscapes, especially in agricultural and natural vegetation scenarios.

TI  - Molecular surveillance of antimalarial partner drug resistance in sub-Saharan Africa: a spatial-temporal evidence mapping study
T2  - LANCET MICROBE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Molecular markers for antimalarial drug resistance can be used to rapidly monitor the emergence and spatial distribution of resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). Little has been done to analyse molecular surveillance efforts or to assess surveillance coverage. This study aimed to develop an evidence map to characterise the spatial-temporal distribution and sampling methodologies of drug resistance surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa, specifically focusing on markers associated with ACT partner drugs.Methods By use of a systematic search, we identified studies that reported data on the following mutations associated with ACT partner drug resistance: pfmdr1 Asn86Tyr, Tyr184Phe, Asp1246Tyr, and copy number variation and pfcrt Lys76Thr, with sample collection occurring in sub-Saharan Africa between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2018, corresponding to the uptake of ACTs. For each identified study, we extracted information on its sampling and laboratory methods, author and publication affiliations, years of sampling and of publication, geographic coordinates of the study sites, and prevalence of the partner drug resistance-associated markers. We used linear models to test whether urbanicity, population density, and endemicity were predictors of drug resistance survey sites and linear regressions to identify associations between the number of resistance surveys within a given country and the at-risk malaria population in 2010, the per-capita GDP in 2010, and the mean amount of funding directed to malaria and to determine trends in marker prevalence over time. For country case studies with three or more datapoints, we assessed global spatial autocorrelation using Moran's I.Findings Our search yielded 254 studies encompassing 492 year-specific and location-specific surveys from 35 malariaendemic countries, the most complete set of molecular partner drug surveillance data to date. We observed a median time lag of 3.1 years (95% CI 1.0-7.7) from final sample acquisition to publication. 22 (49%) of the 44 countries in the study region conducted, on average, one or fewer studies every 3 years. The locations of surveillance sites were positively associated with urbanicity (p<0.0001), and the abundance of country-level data was associated with reported donor funding in 2004-18 (p=0.0011) and local government funding in 2004-09 (p=0.014). Nearly all molecular markers displayed significant regional trends over time and global spatial autocorrelation in space. For selected countries with more widespread coverage of surveillance data, some markers also displayed spatial heterogeneity.Interpretation In most sub-Saharan countries, molecular data on antimalarial resistance might not be representative of the temporal and geographic heterogeneity of partner drug resistance, and likely do not represent the true spatially dependent distribution of partner drug resistance. Our results highlight several inefficiencies that can be improved upon to develop more accurate data landscapes, including the expansion of sentinel surveillance systems, syndemic usage of research samples, and increased participation in reporting published and unpublished data to centralised platforms.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis of Different Environmental Factor Impacts on Land Cover in Nisos Elafonisos, Crete, Greece
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Cover monitoring is an essential task for a better understanding of the ecosystem's dynamicity and complexity. The availability of Remote Sensing data improved the Land Use Land Cover mapping as it is routine work in ecosystem management. The complexity of the Mediterranean ecosystems involves a complexity of the surrounding environmental factors. An attempt to quantitatively investigate the interdependencies between land covers and affected environmental factors was conducted in Nisos Elafonisos to represent diverse and fragile coastal Mediterranean ecosystems. Sentinel-2 (MSI) sensor and ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data were used to classify the LULC as well as to draw different vegetation conditions over the designated study area. DEM derivatives were conducted and incorporated. The developed methodology is intended to assess the land use land cover for different practices under the present environmental condition of Nisos Elafonisos. Supervised classification resulted in six different land cover clusters and was tested against three different environmental clusters. The findings of the current research pointed out that the environmental variables are independent and there is a vertical distribution of the vegetation according to altitude.

AB  - Background Sentinel surveillance for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in Egypt began in 2006 and occurs at eight sites. Avian influenza is endemic, and human cases of influenza A (H5N1) have been reported annually since 2006. This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of SARI at a major sentinel site in the country.Methods Data included in the study were collected from a major SARI sentinel site in Egypt during three consecutive years (2013-15).Results A total of 1254 SARI patients conforming to the WHO case definition were admitted to the sentinel site, representing 5.6% of admitted patients for all causes and 36.6% of acute respiratory infection patients. A total of 99.7% of the patients were tested, and 21.04% tested positive; 48.7% of cases involved influenza A viruses, while 25% involved influenza B. The predominant age group was under 5 years of age, accounting for 443 cases. The seasonality of the influenza data conformed to the Northern Hemisphere pattern.Conclusions The present study's results show that SARI leads to substantial morbidity in Egypt. There is a great need for high-quality data from the SARI surveillance system in Egypt, especially with endemic respiratory threats such as influenza A (H5N1) in Egypt.

TI  - Non-exposure Simple Suturing Endoscopic Full-thickness Resection with Sentinel Basin Dissection in Patients with Early Gastric Cancer: the SENORITA 3 Pilot Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Recently, non-exposure simple suturing endoscopic full-thickness resection (NESS-EFTR) was developed to prevent tumor exposure to the peritoneal cavity. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of NESS-EFTR with sentinel basin dissection for early gastric cancer (EGC).Materials and Methods: This was the prospective SENORITA 3 pilot. From July 2017 to January 2018, 20 patients with EGC smaller than 3 cm without an absolute indication for endoscopic submucosal dissection were enrolled. The sentinel basin was detected using Tc-99m-phytate and indocyanine green, and the NESS-EFTR procedure was performed when all sentinel basin nodes were tumor-free on frozen pathologic examination. We evaluated the complete resection and intraoperative perforation rates as well as the incidence of postoperative complications.Results: Among the 20 enrolled patients, one dropped out due to large tumor size, while another underwent conventional laparoscopic gastrectomy due to metastatic sentinel lymph nodes. All NESS-EFTR procedures were performed in 17 of the 18 other patients (94.4%) without conversion, and the complete resection rate was 83.3% (15/18). The intraoperative perforation rate was 27.8% (5/18), and endoscopic clipping or laparoscopic suturing or stapling was performed at the perforation site. There was one case of postoperative complications treated with endoscopic clipping; the others were discharged without any event.Conclusions: NESS-EFTR with sentinel basin dissection is a technically challenging procedure that obtains safe margins, prevents intraoperative perforation, and may be a treatment option for EGC after additional experience.

TI  - Gaussian processes retrieval of LAI from Sentinel-2 top-of-atmosphere radiance data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieval of vegetation properties from satellite and airborne optical data usually takes place after atmospheric correction, yet it is also possible to develop retrieval algorithms directly from top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance data. One of the key vegetation variables that can be retrieved from at-sensor TOA radiance data is leaf area index (LAI) if algorithms account for variability in atmosphere. We demonstrate the feasibility of LAI retrieval from Sentinel-2 (S2) TOA radiance data (L1C product) in a hybrid machine learning framework. To achieve this, the coupled leaf-canopy-atmosphere radiative transfer models PROSAIL-6SV were used to simulate a look-up table (LUT) of TOA radiance data and associated input variables. This LUT was then used to train the Bayesian machine learning algorithms Gaussian processes regression (GPR) and variational heteroscedastic GPR (VHGPR). PROSAIL simulations were also used to train GPR and VHGPR models for LAI retrieval from S2 images at bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) level (L2A product) for comparison purposes. The BOA and TOA LAI products were consistently validated against a field dataset with GPR (R-2 of 0.78) and with VHGPR (R-2 of 0.80) and for both cases a slightly lower RMSE for the TOA LAI product (about 10% reduction). Because of delivering superior accuracies and lower uncertainties, the VHGPR models were further applied for LAI mapping using S2 acquisitions over the agricultural sites Marchfeld (Austria) and Barrax (Spain). The models led to consistent LAI maps at BOA and TOA scale. The LAI maps were also compared against LAI maps as generated by the SNAP toolbox, which is based on a neural network (NN). Maps were again consistent, however the SNAP NN model tends to overestimate over dense vegetation cover. Overall, this study demonstrated that hybrid LAI retrieval algorithms can be developed from TOA radiance data given a cloud-free sky, thus without the need of atmospheric correction. To the benefit of the community, the development of such hybrid models for the retrieval vegetation properties from BOA or TOA images has been streamlined in the freely downloadable ALG-ARTMO software framework.

TI  - Unsupervised Monitoring Vegetation after the Closure of an Ore Processing Site with Multi-Temporal Optical Remote Sensing
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ore processing is a source of soil heavy metal pollution. Vegetation traits (structural characteristics such as spatial cover and repartition; biochemical parameters-pigment and water contents, growth rate, phenological cycle horizontal ellipsis ) and plant species identity are indirect and powerful indicators of residual contamination detection in soil. Multi-temporal multispectral satellite imagery, such as the Sentinel-2 time series, is an operational environment monitoring system widely used to access vegetation traits and ensure vegetation surveillance across large areas. For this purpose, methodology based on a multi-temporal fusion method at the feature level is applied to vegetation monitoring for several years from the closure and revegetation of an ore processing site. Features are defined by 26 spectral indices from the literature and seasonal and annual change detection maps are inferred. Three indices-CIred-edge(CIREDEDGE), IRECI (Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index) and PSRI (Plant Senescence Reflectance Index)-are particularly suitable for detecting changes spatially and temporally across the study area. The analysis is conducted separately for phyto-stabilized vegetation zones and natural vegetation zones. Global and specific changes are emphasized and explained by information provided by the site operator or meteorological conditions.

TI  - Integration of Well Logging and Remote Sensing Data for Detecting Potential Geothermal Sites along the Gulf of Suez, Egypt
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gulf of Suez area is one of the most favorable regions in Egypt for geothermal exploitation since it hosts an evident cluster of superficial thermal springs. Some of these thermal springs include Hammam Musa, Hammam Faraun, Sudr, Ayn Musa and Ain Sokhna, which are characterized by high temperatures ranging between 35 degrees C to 86.66 degrees C. It is this feature that makes the Gulf of Suez locality sufficient for geothermal power production. Corrected bottom hole temperature (BHT) data from 197 oil wells situated onshore and offshore of the Gulf of Suez were utilized for the present research. The results indicated that the study area has a geothermal gradient ranging from 24.9 to 86.66 degrees C/km, a heat flow ranging from 31 to 127.2 m W k(-1), a thermal conductivity of 2.6-3.2 W m(-1)k(-1), and an amplitude temperature varying from 49.48 degrees C to 157.8 degrees C. The derived geothermal and geological layers were used together with the remote sensing thermal infrared and topographic data, to map relevant physiographic variables including surface elevation, fractures density, drainage density, nighttime land surface temperature and major lithological units. The nine produced variables were integrated in GIS to model the geothermal potential map (GTP) for the Gulf of Suez region. The model identifies the northeastern and the southwestern areas as equally two sites for high geothermal potential. Findings of this study demonstrate that integration of well logging and space data with the adopted geospatial techniques is a practical method for geothermal prospecting in similarly geologic and tectonic setting in Egypt and East Africa.

TI  - Control of salinity stratification on recent increase in tropical cyclone intensification rates over the postmonsoon Bay of Bengal
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the variability of tropical cyclone (TC) intensification rates (IRs) in the postmonsoon Bay of Bengal (BoB) for the satellite period of 1980-2015. It is found that both number of rapid intensification (RI) events and magnitude of IRs show a robust increase, with a northeastward shift of intensification events. Analyses show that the temporal variability of sea surface temperature dominated the IR variability during 1980-1997. However, the thick barrier layer in the northern BoB was considerably responsible for IR variability during 1998-2015, which significantly contributed to the IR increase. Due to more intensification events occurring over the northeastern region in two recent decades, the thick barrier layer with strong salinity stratification in the northern BoB limits TC-induced sea surface cooling and in turn favors TC intensification. This study has an important implication that air-sea coupled climate model need to realistically simulate upper ocean salinity variability on projecting TC intensity change over the BoB.

TI  - Winter cover crops in Dutch maize fields: Variability in quality and its drivers assessed from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Planting a cover crop between the main cropping seasons is an agricultural management measure with multiple potential benefits for sustainable food production. In the maize production system of the Netherlands, an effective establishment of a winter cover crop is important for reducing nitrogen leaching to groundwater. Cover crop establishment after maize cultivation is obliged by law for sandy soils and consequently implemented on nearly all maize fields, but the winter-time vegetative ground cover varies significantly between fields. The objectives of this study are to assess the variability in winter vegetative cover and evaluate to what extent this variability can be explained by the timing of cover crop establishment and weather conditions in two growing seasons (2017-2018). We used Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to construct NDVI time series for fields known to be cultivated with maize within the province of Overijssel. We fitted piecewise logistic functions to the time series in order to estimate cover crop sowing date and retrieve the fitted NDVI value for 1 December (NDVIDec). We used NDVIDec to represent the quality of cover crop establishment at the start of the winter season. The Sentinel-2 estimated sowing dates compared reasonably with ground reference data for eight fields (RMSE = 6.6 days). The two analysed years differed considerably, with 2018 being much drier and warmer during summer. This drought resulted in an earlier estimated cover crop sowing date (on average 19 days) and an NDVIDec value that was 0.2 higher than in 2017. Combining both years and all fields, we found that Sentinel-2 retrieved sowing dates could explain 55% of the NDVIDec variability. This corresponded to a positive relationship (R-2 = 0.50) between NDVIDec and the cumulative growing degree days (GDD) between sowing date and 1 December until reaching 400 GDD. Based on cumulative GDD derived from two weather stations within Overijssel, we found that on average for the past three decades a sowing date of 19 September ( +/- 7 days) allowed to attain these 400 GDD; this provides support for the current legislation that states that from 2019 onwards a cover crop should be sown before 1 October. To meet this deadline, while simultaneously ascertaining a harvest-ready main crop, in practice implies that undersowing of the cover crop during spring will gain importance. Our results show that Sentinel-2 NDVI time series can assess the effectiveness and timing of cover crop growth for small agricultural fields, and as such has potential to inform regulatory frameworks as well as farmers with actionable information that may help to reduce nitrogen leaching.

TI  - Evaluation and validation of a high spatial resolution satellite soil moisture product over the Continental United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil moisture (SM) data retrieved from the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) satellite are available at a 9km grid spacing since April 2015. This product can provide valuable information for research and applications in hydrology and other related fields. However, the resolution may be too coarse for applications at catchment or field scale. In this study, an established downscaling methodology, which had a major modification regarding its application on the SMAP 33 km domain, was implemented to develop a 1 km soil moisture product based on the SMAP 9km data. The algorithm proposed here is based on the thermal inertia principle and developed by modeling the relationship between surface temperature difference and SM for different Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) classes. The model functions were established and tuned using data from the NASA's Land Information System (LIS) North America Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) and remotely sensed VISible/InfRared (VIS/IR) reflectance data from Long Term Data Record (LTDR) AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) for the growing season months of April-September 1981-2018. These were then implemented using the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data over the Continental United States (CONUS) domain. Validation activities were carried out using in situ measurements distributed through the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). The validation results computed using the 1 km SM data showed that the R-2, unbiased RMSE (root mean square error) and bias were improved relative to the 9km SMAP product by 0.045, 0.018 m(3)/m(3) and 0.001 m(3)/m(3), respectively. The 1 km SM also exhibited a strong time-series autocorrelation. Further accuracy assessment analyses indicated that precipitation might contribute to the uncertainties in both the 9km SMAP and 1 km downscaled SMAP SM products.

TI  - Discriminating tree species at different taxonomic levels using multi-temporal WorldView-3 imagery in Washington DC, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the promise of transformative changes for the management of rural and urban forests, the discrimination of tree species from satellite imagery has been a long-standing goal of remote sensing. For the species-rich urban setting of Washington, D.C. USA, we evaluate current prospects toward this goal by combining a Random Forest (RF) object-based tree species classification method with two large datasets 1) A suite of 12 very high resolution (VHR) WorldView-3 images (WV-3), whose image acquisition date cover each pheno-phase of the growing season from April to November; and 2) the 16,496 street trees from Washington D.C. Department of Transportation's (DDOT) field inventory. We classify the 19 most abundant tree species with an overall accuracy of 61.3% and classify the ten most abundant genera with an overall accuracy of 73.7%. We observe that (1) there are larger declines in accuracy when attempting to classify species in the same genus, and (2) the most valuable phenological period is fall senescence for classification at different taxonomic levels. Especially if satellite data can be matched to the key pheno-phases, our study highlights that current VHR satellite sensors now have the radiometric, spectral, and spatial resolution to potentially help manage species-rich urban forests.

TI  - SAR Data Fusion Using Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images taken over a certain area at different bands and also with a short time interval are now more widely available. This is due to the increase of SAR acquisitions following the last space missions, such as Sentinel 1 and COSMO-SkyMed (CSK). New paradigms capable of performing effective analysis and synthesis stemming from such a type of information are then required in order to exploit better and disseminate the information contained in the data. In this letter, a data fusion technique between CSK and Sentinel-1 data is described. To this purpose, an ad hoc Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis (NLPCA) with Auto-Associative Neural Networks (AANNs) algorithm is designed and developed. The network extracts the most relevant features from the combination of the different scattering mechanisms. The extracted features are then used as inputs for a land cover classification exercise. A comparison between the results obtained with the original images and those yielded by the new synthesized data, with lower dimensionality, demonstrates the ability of the algorithm to generate useful final products.

TI  - Contribution of vegetation change to the surface radiation budget: A satellite perspective
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface radiation budget is of crucial importance to ecosystem evolution but varies with complex atmospheric and surface conditions. Vegetation change alters the surface thermal properties and the subsequent radiation budget; however, the vegetation contribution is difficult to isolate from mixed influences. Based on satellite observations, we apply a novel trajectory-based approach to detect the impact of vegetation change on the global surface radiation variation in recent decades (2001-2016). Satellite data on radiation and vegetation available from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments are adopted for this investigation. Methodologically, the surface net radiation (Rn) in the nonchanged vegetation trajectory represents the synthetic result of atmospheric influences and serves as a reference for isolating Rn variations due to vegetation change. The results demonstrate that the multiyear mean of global Rn is 71.57 W.m(-2) with an increasing trend of 0.053 W.m(-2) yr(-1). Vegetation change contributes an additional 0.047 W.m(-2) yr(-1) of radiation in greening regions, accounting for 53.36% of the total increase in Rn. Spatially, the contribution of vegetation presents significant variability, with positive contributions located mainly in western Europe and southern Africa and negative contributions located mainly in parts of Asia and eastern Australia. Physically, the influence of vegetation change on the surface radiation budget originates from its alteration of albedo and emissivity, particularly the former. Specifically, a 1% increase in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is expected to reduce albedo by - 0.003 and increase surface net shortwave radiation by 0.86 W.m(-2). It can be concluded that the change in albedo by vegetation change has a nonnegligible influence on the surface radiation budget in different regions. These results help capture the physical mechanism responsible for the evolution of Earth's radiation and support environmental management.

The play, which nurtures from all the typical ingredients of comedia nueva, encloses a whole epistemological reflection on how the gaze determines perception and understanding of the world, and makes visible on stage some touchstones of Baroque worldview. Through a metatheatrical game which expands to all constructive components of the play, Villegas places his particular dramatic rendition of trove-failin a line which crosses 17th century artistic and literary creation.

TI  - Mid-season empirical cotton yield forecasts at fine resolutions using large yield mapping datasets and diverse spatial covariates
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasts of crop yield are an important tool for a variety of stakeholders, but most studies produce large-scale, late-season yield forecasts that are not appropriate for farmers. Farmers require forecasts of crop yield mid-season and at fine spatial resolutions to guide site-specific adaptive crop management practices. This study created empirical random forest models to forecast cotton yield mid-season at three different spatial resolutions: 30 m, field, and farm aggregation. Large yield mapping datasets from 14 different seasons were utilised to build the model across 68 different fields from six large cotton farms in eastern Australia. A generic conceptual framework is proposed to empirically model crop yield. This topsaw framework represents the spatial and temporal factors that drive yield, including topography (t), organisms (o), plant measurements (p), soil (s), agronomy/management (a), and weather (w). In this study, the specific predictor variables to represent these driving factors of yield included elevation (t), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, MODIS Evapotranspiration (p), gamma radiometrics grid, clay content digital soil map (s), rainfall data, and growing day degrees (w). Forecasts of cotton yield increased in accuracy as the spatial resolution of predictions became coarser. Using a leave-one-year-out cross-validation, cotton yield could be forecasted to an accuracy of 0.42 Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (LCCC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.11 bales ha(-1) at 30 m resolution. This improved to a 0.63 LCCC and 1.72 bales ha(-1) RMSE at the field resolution, and a 0.65 LCCC and 0.77 bales ha(-1) at the aggregation-scale. As the developed approach solely relied on publicly available predictor variables, there is an opportunity to apply this to any cotton field in Australia, and over a much larger area. Overall, this study is an important step in building an operational approach to forecast mid-season cotton yield at fine spatial resolutions, and has the potential to improve production, input use efficiency, and profitability for individual growers and the Australian Cotton Industry as a whole.

TI  - Do recent NDVI trends demonstrate boreal forest decline in Alaska?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing analyses of boreal forest regions have found widespread decreasing or increasing trends in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Initially, these trends were attributed to climate change induced shifts in primary productivity. It is emerging, however, that fire disturbance and subsequent succession also strongly impact the optical properties of boreal forests. Here we use NDVI time series data from Landsat (1999-2018) paired with surveys of 102 forest stands with known recent fire history to investigate the relationship between NDVI and forest structure during succession. We found that NDVI varies systematically with stand age as a result of successional changes in forest structure and composition and that the proportion of deciduous (broad-leaved) trees in the upper canopy is a better predictor of NDVI than leaf area index. Recent fire disturbance led to strong NDVI decreases and early post-fire recovery of herbaceous and deciduous vegetation to strong NDVI increases. The mid-succession transition from deciduous to evergreen (needle-leaved) stands led to weak NDVI decreases, while mid-to-late succession thinning of evergreen canopies led to weak NDVI increases. Thus, both increasing and decreasing NDVI stands occur naturally across the landscape, and do not necessarily reflect a large-scale shift in boreal forest productivity.

TI  - Evaluating the Spectral Indices Efficiency to Quantify Daytime Surface Anthropogenic Heat Island Intensity: An Intercontinental Methodology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface anthropogenic heat island (SAHI) phenomenon is one of the most important environmental concerns in urban areas. SAHIs play a significant role in quality of urban life. Hence, the quantification of SAHI intensity (SAHII) is of great importance. The impervious surface cover (ISC) can well reflect the degree and extent of anthropogenic activities in an area. Various actual ISC (AISC) datasets are available for different regions of the world. However, the temporal and spatial coverage of available and accessible AISC datasets is limited. This study was aimed to evaluate the spectral indices efficiency to daytime SAHII (DSAHII) quantification. Consequently, 14 cities including Budapest, Bucharest, Ciechanow, Hamburg, Lyon, Madrid, Porto, and Rome in Europe and Dallas, Seattle, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Phoenix in the USA, were selected. A set of 91 Landsat 8 images, the Landsat provisional surface temperature product, the High Resolution Imperviousness Layer (HRIL), and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) imperviousness data were used as the AISC datasets for the selected cities. The spectral index-based ISC (SIISC) and land surface temperature (LST) were modelled from the Landsat 8 images. Then, a linear least square model (LLSM) obtained from the LST-AISC feature space was applied to quantify the actual SAHII of the selected cities. Finally, the SAHII of the selected cities was modelled based on the LST-SIISC feature space-derived LLSM. Finally, the values of the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) between the actual and modelled SAHII were calculated to evaluate and compare the performance of different spectral indices in SAHII quantification. The performance of the spectral indices used in the built LST-SIISC feature space for SAHII quantification differed. The index-based built-up index (IBI) (R-2= 0.98, RMSE = 0.34 degrees C) and albedo (0.76, 1.39 degrees C) performed the best and worst performance in SAHII quantification, respectively. Our results indicate that the LST-SIISC feature space is very useful and effective for SAHII quantification. The advantages of the spectral indices used in SAHII quantification include (1) synchronization with the recording of thermal data, (2) simplicity, (3) low cost, (4) accessibility under different spatial and temporal conditions, and (5) scalability.

TI  - Ground surface changes detection using interferometric synthetic aperture radar
T2  - SMART STRUCTURES AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Disasters, including earthquakes and landslides, have enormous economic and social losses besides their impact on environmental disruption. Iran, and particularly its Western part, is known as an earthquake susceptible area due to numerous strong ground motions. Studying ecological changes due to climate change can improve the public and expert sector's awareness and response to future disastrous events. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technologies are appropriate tools for modeling and surface deformation modeling. This paper proposes an efficient approach to detect ground deformation changes using Sentinel-1A. The focal point of this research is to map the ground surface deformation modeling is presented using InSAR technology over Sarpol-e Zahab on 25th November 2018 as a study case. For surface deformation modeling and detection of the ground movement due to earthquake SARPROZ in MATLAB programming language is used and discussed. Results show that there is a general ground movement due to the Sarpol-e Zahab earthquake between -7 millimeter to +18 millimeter in the study area. This research verified previous researches on the advanced image analysis techniques employed for mapping ground movement, where InSAR provides a reliable tool for assisting engineers and the decision-maker in choosing proper policies in a time of disasters. Based on the result, 574 out of 682 damaged buildings and infrastructures due to the 2017 Sarpol-e Zahab earthquake have moved from -2 to +17 mm due to the 2018 earthquake with a magnitude of 6.3 Richter. Results show that mountainous areas have suffered land subsidence, where urban areas had land uplift.

TI  - All pixels are useful, but some are more useful: Efficient <i>in situ</i> data collection for crop-type mapping using sequential exploration methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A precise knowledge of the crop distribution in the landscape is crucial for the agricultural sector to inform better management and logistics. Crop-type maps are often derived by the supervised classification of satellite imagery using machine learning models. The choice of data sampled during the data collection phase of building a classification model has a tremendous impact on a model's performance, and is usually collected via roadside surveys throughout the area of interest. However, the large spatial extent, and the varying accessibility to fields, often makes the acquisition of appropriate training data sets difficult. As such, in situ data are often collected on a best-effort basis, leading to inefficiencies, sub-optimal accuracies, and unnecessarily large sample sizes. This highlights the need for new more efficient tools to guide data collection. Here, we address three tasks that one commonly faces when planning to collect in situ data: which survey route to select among a set logistically feasible routes; which fields are the most relevant to collect along the chosen survey route; and how to best augment existing in situ data sets with additional observations. Our findings show that the normalised Moran's I index is a useful indicator for choosing the survey route, and that sequential exploration methods can identify the most important fields to survey on that route. The provided recommendations are flexible, overcome the main logistical constraints associated with in situ data collection, yield accurate results, and could be incorporated in a mobile application to assist data collection in real-time.

TI  - Update on sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patient
T2  - ANNALI ITALIANI DI CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is considered the gold standard for axillary staging in early breast cancer patients with clinically negative lymph nodes (cNO). SLNB allows to determine the axillary lymph node status sparing the axillary dissection (AD) and its potential complications (seroma formation, loss of sensation, shoulder dysfunction and lymphedema)On the other hand, SLNB for nodal staging in breast cancer patients with clinically negative lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (ycN0) is a highly debated topic due to different reported success rates. In order to optimize oncological results, high identification rate (> 90%) and false negative rate as low as possible (< 10%) should always be obtained when performing SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The success rates of SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) mainly depend on the clinical lymph node status pre-NAC.In patients with pre-NAC clinically negative nodes (cN0) and at restaging with post-NAC clinically negative nodes (ycN0), SLNB after chemotherapy should be performed because it is an accurate and safe procedure.In patients with pre-NAC clinically positive nodes (cN+) and at restaging with post-NAC clinically negative nodes (ycN0), SLNB after chemotherapy might be considered thanks to the high lymph nodal pathologic complete response rate; however, in this last setting, individual ability, technical skills and repetitive performance of specific tasks must always be followed to improve the identification rate and false negative rate.AD may be avoided only if sentinel lymph node is negative [ypN0(sn)J; instead, to date, patients with metastatic sentinel lymph node after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, even with only isolated tumor cells, fypN+(sn) including ypN0i+(sn) and ypN1mic(sn)J should always be treated with AD.However, NAC significantly increases the difficulties and complexity of axillary surgical management. A personalized multidisciplinary path in specialized breast centers should ensure an accurate clinical counselling and refined patient selection for SLNB post-NAC.

TI  - Satellite-based NDVI crop coefficients and evapotranspiration with eddy covariance validation for multiple durum wheat fields in the US Southwest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A three-year study was conducted to assess the ability of satellite-based vegetation index (VI) images to track evapotranspiration over wheat. While the ability of using VIs, notably with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), to track vegetation growth has been well established, the operational capability to accurately estimate the crop coefficient (K-c) and crop evapotranspiration (ETc) at farm-scale from spaceborne platforms has not been widely studied. The study evaluated wheat ET over 7 sites between 2016 and 2019 in Yuma and Maricopa, Arizona, USA estimated by using Sentinel 2 and Venus satellites to map NDVI time-series for entire wheat cropping seasons, December to June. The basal crop coefficient (K-cb) was modeled by the NDVI time-series and the daily FAO56 reference ETo was obtained by near-by weather network stations. Eddy covariance (EC) stations in each field observed ETc during the same seasonal periods, and applied irrigation amounts were logged. The experiment found that remote sensing of NDVI and modeled K-cb accurately estimated K-c and crop ET during mid-season through senescence in most cases. However, NDVI-based estimation performed less well during early season (<60 days after planting), when observed ETc was highly variable due to frequent rain and irrigation at low crop cover. Mid-season K-c values observed for the seven wheat fields were from 0.92 to 1.14, and end of season K-c values ranged from about 0.20 to 0.40, in close agreement to values reported elsewhere. Seasonal VI-based transpiration and ETc values ranged from 467 to 618 mm, closely agreeing with seasonal EC data, which ranged 499-684 mm. Using the Venus sensor, the study in Maricopa in 2019 revealed that when augmented by a background soil water balance model, water stressed wheat can be detected mid-season with NDVI. This capability is specifically due to the sensor's ability to provide well-calibrated images every 2 days. Findings from this study will help farmers, irrigators, and water managers use and understand the capabilities of visible near infrared remote sensing to track ETc from space.

TI  - Global Impact of COVID-19 on Nuclear Medicine Departments: An International Survey in April 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed significant challenges on health-care systems worldwide, whether in the preparation, response, or recovery phase of the pandemic. This has been primarily managed by dramatically reducing in- and outpatient services for other diseases and implementing infection prevention and control measures. The impact of the pandemic on nuclear medicine departments and their services has not yet been established. The aim of this online survey was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on nuclear medicine departments. Methods: A web-based questionnaire, made available from April 16 to May 3, 2020, was designed to determine the impact of the pandemic on in- and outpatient nuclear medicine departments, including the number of procedures, employee health, availability of radiotracers and other essential supplies, and availability of personal protective equipment. The survey also inquired about operational aspects and types of facilities as well as other challenges. Results: A total of 434 responses from 72 countries were registered and analyzed. Respondents reported an average decline of 54% in diagnostic procedures. PET/CT scans decreased by an average of 36%, whereas sentinel lymph-node procedures decreased by 45%, lung scans by 56%, bone scans by 60%, myocardial studies by 66%, and thyroid studies by 67%. Of all participating centers, 81% performed radionuclide therapies, and they reported a reduction of 45% on average in the last 4 wk, ranging from over 76% in Latin America and South East Asia to 16% in South Korea and Singapore. Survey results showed that 52% of participating sites limited their Tc-99m/Mo-99 generator purchases, and 12% of them temporarily cancelled orders. Insufficient supplies of essential materials (radioisotopes, generators, and kits) were reported, especially for Tc-99m/Mo-99 generators and I-131, particularly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Conclusion: Both diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures declined precipitously, with countries worldwide being affected by the pandemic to a similar degree. Countries that were in the postpeak phase of the pandemic when they responded to the survey, such as South Korea and Singapore, reported a less pronounced impact on nuclear medicine services; however, the overall results of the survey showed that nuclear medicine services worldwide had been significantly impacted. In relation to staff health, 15% of respondents experienced COVID-19 infections within their own departments.

TI  - Remote sensing inversion of saline and alkaline land based on reflectance spectroscopy and D-TELM algorithm in Wuyuan areas
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to obtain the distribution of saline and alkaline land in Wuyuan County and take appropriate improvement measures, it is necessary to invert the distribution map accurately. This paper introduces an analysis method for saline and alkaline land, which is used to analyze the salt content (parts per thousand), organic matter content (g/ kg), and PH value. First of all, thirteen saline and alkaline land samples of Wuyuan County were collected in the field. Then, the spectral data was acquired by the SVC HR-1204 portable spectrometer, and the salt content, organic matter content, and PH value data were acquired by chemical analysis. Taking different hidden layers with different activation functions as the innovation point, the TELM is improved to propose D-TELM algorithm. Finally, D-TELM was used to construct three model of the relationship between the spectral data and the salt content, organic matter content, and PH value data, and the inversion and distribution maps were performed. The experimental result shows that most of the D-TELM models are better than the TELM models. According to the principle of minimum standard deviation, the inversion model of salt content uses the dsig-sin model, the inversion model of organic matter content uses the tanh-dsig model, and the inversion model of pH value uses the dsig-sin model.

TI  - Fire Detection and Fire Radiative Power in Forests and Low-Biomass Lands in Northeast Asia: MODIS versus VIIRS Fire Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire omission and commission errors, and the accuracy of fire radiative power (FRP) from satellite moderate-resolution impede the studies on fire regimes and FRP-based fire emissions estimation. In this study, we compared the accuracy between the extensively used 1-km fire product of MYD14 from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the 375-m fire product of VNP14IMG from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) in Northeastern Asia using data from 2012-2017. We extracted almost simultaneous observation of fire detection and FRP from MODIS-VIIRS overlapping orbits from the two fire products, and identified and removed duplicate fire detections and corresponding FRP in each fire product. We then compared the performance of the two products between forests and low-biomass lands (croplands, grasslands, and herbaceous vegetation). Among fire pixels detected by VIIRS, 65% and 83% were missed by MODIS in forests and low-biomass lands, respectively; whereas associated omission rates by VIIRS for MODIS fire pixels were 35% and 53%, respectively. Commission errors of the two fire products, based on the annual mean measurements of burned area by Landsat, decreased with increasing FRP per fire pixel, and were higher in low-biomass lands than those in forests. Monthly total FRP from MODIS was considerably lower than that from VIIRS due to more fire omission by MODIS, particularly in low-biomass lands. However, for fires concurrently detected by both sensors, total FRP was lower with VIIRS than with MODIS. This study contributes to a better understanding of fire detection and FRP retrieval performance between MODIS and its successor VIIRS, providing valuable information for using those data in the study of fire regimes and FRP-based fire emission estimation.

TI  - Monitoring Urban Green Infrastructure Changes and Impact on Habitat Connectivity Using High-Resolution Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, the City of Stockholm, Sweden, has grown substantially and is now the largest city in Scandinavia. Recent urban growth is placing pressure on green areas within and around the city. In order to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services, green infrastructure is part of Stockholm municipal planning. This research quantifies land-cover change in the City of Stockholm between 2003 and 2018 and examines what impact urban growth has had on its green infrastructure. Two 2018 WorldView-2 images and three 2003 QuickBird-2 images were used to produce classifications of 11 land-cover types using object-based image analysis and a support vector machine algorithm with spectral, geometric and texture features. The classification accuracies reached over 90% and the results were used in calculations and comparisons to determine the impact of urban growth in Stockholm between 2003 and 2018, including the generation of land-cover change statistics in relation to administrative boundaries and green infrastructure. For components of the green infrastructure, i.e., habitat networks for selected sensitive species, habitat network analysis for the European crested tit (Lophophanes cristatus) and common toad (Bufo bufo) was performed. Between 2003 and 2018, urban areas increased by approximately 4% while green areas decreased by 2% in comparison with their 2003 areal amounts. The most significant urban growth occurred through expansion of the transport network, paved surfaces and construction areas which increased by 12%, mainly at the expense of grassland and coniferous forest. Examination of urban growth within the green infrastructure indicated that most land area was lost in dispersal zones (28 ha) while the highest percent change was within habitat for species of conservation concern (14%). The habitat network analysis revealed that overall connectivity decreased slightly through patch fragmentation and areal loss mainly caused by road expansion on the outskirts of the city. The habitat network analysis also revealed which habitat areas are well-connected and which are most vulnerable. These results can assist policymakers and planners in their efforts to ensure sustainable urban development including sustaining biodiversity in the City of Stockholm.

M3  - Article
AB  - 'My Africa Reads' is a memoir that looks back at my reading history. The 'Preamble' identifies authors who influenced my worldview during my secondary and tertiary education in the UK and who remained my companions during the first decade of my return to Nigeria. From this immersion in Eurocentric literature, the memoir progresses to my encounter with postcolonial African literature in the collective setting of the Africa Book Group (ABG), which I joined in 2002 and led from 2014 to 2018. The memoir looks at authors and literature that the international women of ABG have engaged with, and at meetings at which guest experts spoke on aspects of African studies and affairs. It highlights the power of ABG-a shared reading experience-to advance that part of my cultural liberation facilitated by good postcolonial literature and open, unconstrained discussions with other women.

TI  - Super-Resolution of Sentinel-2 Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Real Ground Truth Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation data is becoming more accessible and affordable thanks to the Copernicus programme and its Sentinel missions. Every location worldwide can be freely monitored approximately every 5 days using the multi-spectral images provided by Sentinel-2. The spatial resolution of these images for RGBN (RGB + Near-infrared) bands is 10 m, which is more than enough for many tasks but falls short for many others. For this reason, if their spatial resolution could be enhanced without additional costs, any posterior analyses based on these images would be benefited. Previous works have mainly focused on increasing the resolution of lower resolution bands of Sentinel-2 (20 m and 60 m) to 10 m resolution. In these cases, super-resolution is supported by bands captured at finer resolutions (RGBN at 10 m). On the contrary, this paper focuses on the problem of increasing the spatial resolution of 10 m bands to either 5 m or 2.5 m resolutions, without having additional information available. This problem is known as single-image super-resolution. For standard images, deep learning techniques have become the de facto standard to learn the mapping from lower to higher resolution images due to their learning capacity. However, super-resolution models learned for standard images do not work well with satellite images and hence, a specific model for this problem needs to be learned. The main challenge that this paper aims to solve is how to train a super-resolution model for Sentinel-2 images when no ground truth exists (Sentinel-2 images at 5 m or 2.5 m). Our proposal consists of using a reference satellite with a high similarity in terms of spectral bands with respect to Sentinel-2, but with higher spatial resolution, to create image pairs at both the source and target resolutions. This way, we can train a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network to recover details not present in the original RGBN bands. An exhaustive experimental study is carried out to validate our proposal, including a comparison with the most extended strategy for super-resolving Sentinel-2, which consists in learning a model to super-resolve from an under-sampled version at either 40 m or 20 m to the original 10 m resolution and then, applying this model to super-resolve from 10 m to 5 m or 2.5 m. Finally, we will also show that the spectral radiometry of the native bands is maintained when super-resolving images, in such a way that they can be used for any subsequent processing as if they were images acquired by Sentinel-2.

TI  - Mapping the Forage Nitrogen-Phosphorus Ratio Based on Sentinel-2 MSI Data and a Random Forest Algorithm in an Alpine Grassland Ecosystem of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nondestructive and accurate estimating of the forage nitrogen-phosphorus (N:P) ratio is conducive to the real-time diagnosis of nutrient limitation and the formulation of a management scheme during the growth and development of forage. New-generation high-resolution remote sensors equipped with strategic red-edge wavebands offer opportunities and challenges for estimating and mapping forage N:P ratio in support of the sustainable utilization of alpine grassland resources. This study aims to detect the forage N:P ratio as an ecological indicator of grassland nutrient content by employing Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) data and a random forest (RF) algorithm. The results showed that the estimation accuracy (R-2) of the forage N:P ratio model established by combining the optimized spectral bands and vegetation indices (VIs) is 0.49 and 0.59 in the vigorous growth period (July) and the senescing period (November) of forage, respectively. Moreover, Sentinel-2 MSI B9 and B12 bands contributed greatly to the estimation of the forage N:P ratio, and the VIs (RECI2) constructed by B5 and B8A bands performed well in the estimation of the forage N:P ratio. Overall, it is promising to map the spatial distribution of the forage N:P ratio in alpine grassland using Sentinel-2 MSI data at regional scales. This study will be potentially beneficial in implementing precise positioning of vegetation nutrient deficiency and scientific fertilization management of grassland.

TI  - Error analysis of on-orbit thermal emission band radiometric calibration or FY3C/MERSI
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese medium resolution spectral imager (MERSI) carried on the Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) satellite can realize the high-precision global measurement of the cloud, aerosol, land surface, sea surface, and low-level water vapor. The MERSI is described conceptually in this paper, and the radiometric calibrations of its thermal emission bands by the on-board blackbody (BB) were given by two different algorithms. In order to evaluate the stability of the instrument's performance, the measured irradiance after the dark current correction was compared with the theoretical value calculated from the BB temperature by Planck function. The results showed that the algorithm of linear fitting to the BB measurements averaged over sampling points was an optimal choice for the radiometric calibration, and that the calibration coefficients determined by this method could reflect the pixel difference while maintaining a relative stability between each frame. Using the perturbation method, the influences of the BB temperature, wavelength, and emissivity offsets on the calibration coefficients were analyzed and discussed through theoretical deduction and computer simulation for improving the calibration accuracy of the instrument.

TI  - Greening Hiatus in Eurasian Boreal Forests Since 1997 Caused by a Wetting and Cooling Summer Climate
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eurasian boreal forest ecosystem is a strong sink in the global carbon cycle. Satellite observations show significant change in the ecosystem in recent decades, specifically an increase in vegetation productivity since 1982 and a hiatus after 1997. Previous studies attributed this enhanced vegetation growth (also known as greening) to air temperature increases and a longer growing season, and the recent greening hiatus as a result of a warmer and drier climate. However, using satellite data, we found observational evidence that increases in summer peak growth dominated the overall greening trend and that a wetting and cooling climate during the peak growing season was the primary cause of the hiatus.

TI  - Identifying Variables to Discriminate between Conserved and Degraded Forest and to Quantify the Differences in Biomass
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this work was to determine which structural variables present statistically significant differences between degraded and conserved tropical dry forest through a statistical study of forest survey data. The forest survey was carried out in a tropical dry forest in the watershed of the River Ayuquila, Jalisco state, Mexico between May and June of 2019, when data were collected in 36 plots of 500 m(2). The sample was designed to include tropical dry forests in two conditions: degraded and conserved. In each plot, data collected included diameter at breast height, tree height, number of trees, number of branches, canopy cover, basal area, and aboveground biomass. Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we show that there are significant differences in canopy cover, tree height, basal area, and aboveground biomass between degraded and conserved tropical dry forest. Among these structural variables, canopy cover and mean height separate conserved and degraded forests with the highest accuracy (both at 80.7%). We also tested which variables best correlate with aboveground biomass, with a view to determining how carbon loss in degraded forest can be quantified at a larger scale using remote sensing. We found that canopy cover, tree height, and density of trees all show good correlation with biomass and these variables could be used to estimate changes in biomass stocks in degraded forests. The results of our analysis will help to increase the accuracy in estimating aboveground biomass, contribute to the ongoing work on REDD+, and help to reduce the great uncertainty in estimation of emissions from forest degradation.

TI  - Tropical Cyclone Wind Speed Retrieval from Dual-Polarization Sentinel-1 EW Mode Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies indicate that the cross-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have the ability of retrieving high wind speed on ocean surface without wind direction input. This study presents a new approach for tropical cyclone (TC) wind speed retrieval utilizing thermal-noise-removed Sentinel-1 dual-polarization (VV+VH) Extra-Wide Swath (EW) Mode products. Based on 20 images of 9 TCs observed in the 2016 and 2018 and SAR-collocated European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5) data and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Hurricane Research Division's (HRD) Real-time Hurricane Wind Analysis System (H*Wind) data, a subswath-based geophysical model function (GMF) Sentinel-1 EW Mode Wind Speed Retrieval Model after Noise Removal (S1EW.NR) is developed and validated statistically. TC wind speed is retrieved by using the proposed GMF and the C-band model 5.N (CMOD5.N). The results show that the wind speeds retrieved by the S1EW.NR model are in good agreement with wind references up to 31ms(-1). The correlation coefficient, bias, and standard deviation between the retrieval results and reference wind speeds are 0.74, -0.11, and 3.54ms(-1), respectively. Comparison of the wind speeds retrieved from both channels suggests that the cross-polarized signal is more suitable for high-wind speed retrieval, indicating the promising capability of cross-polarization SAR for TC monitoring.

AB  - In order to explain from an ethnoecological perspective the relationship between the birds and the community of Coatetelco, Morelos, fifty-five interviews were conducted open to farmers, as well as guided tours to carry out the collection of ethnobiological data through audio and visual records, which allowed us to identify the taxonomic species and calculate the frequency of mention. The informants recognize 83 species of birds belonging to 14 orders and 32 families, and they know part of their ecological functions and their local distribution. 70 species were registered in the low deciduous forest, which corresponds to 84% of the species reported by the informants. The use of the 23 species by farmers include food (52%), ornamentation (39%), amulet (21%) and medicinal uses (8%). Farmers obtain the avian resources using slingshots and rifles. The turtle dove Columbina inca and the dove Zenaida macroura registered the highest frequency of mention (60%). Beliefs about six birds are preserved, which are related to death, bad luck or those associated with the rains. The ethnoecological knowledge that the inhabitants of Coatetelco preserve about birds must be integrated into public conservation policies in defense of their biocultural heritage.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 12th North American Forest Ecology Workshop (NAFEW)
CL  - Flagstaff, AZ
AB  - In forestry, common garden experiments traditionally require manual measurements and visual inspections. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are a newer method of monitoring plants that is potentially more efficient than traditional techniques. This study had two objectives: to assess the size and mortality of Pinus strobiformis Engelm. seedlings using UAS and to predict the second-year seedling size using manual measurements from the first year and from UAS size estimates. Raised boxes containing 150 seedlings were surveyed twice, one year apart, using multispectral UAS. Seedling heights and diameters at root collar (DRC) were measured manually in both years. We found that size estimates made using a vegetation mask were suitable predictors for size, while spectral indices were not. Furthermore, we provided evidence that inclusion of UAS size estimates as predictors improves the fit of the models. Our study suggests that common variables used in forest monitoring are not necessarily best suited for seedlings. Therefore, we created a new variable, called the longitudinal area (height x DRC), which proved to be a significant predictor for both height and DRC. Finally, we demonstrate that seedling mortality can be effectively measured from remotely sensed data, which is useful for common garden and regeneration studies.

TI  - Estimating Fractional Snow Cover in Open Terrain from Sentinel-2 Using the Normalized Difference Snow Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 provides the opportunity to map the snow cover at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions on a global scale. Here we calibrate and evaluate a simple empirical function to estimate the fractional snow cover (FSC) in open terrains using the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) from 20 m resolution Sentinel-2 images. The NDSI is computed from flat surface reflectance after masking cloud and snow-free areas. The NDSI-FSC function is calibrated using Pleiades very high-resolution images and evaluated using independent datasets including SPOT 6/7 satellite images, time lapse camera photographs, terrestrial lidar scans and crowd-sourced in situ measurements. The calibration results show that the FSC can be represented with a sigmoid-shaped function 0.5 x tanh(a x NDSI + b) + 0.5, where a = 2.65 and b = -1.42, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 25%. Similar RMSE are obtained with different evaluation datasets with a high topographic variability. With this function, we estimate that the confidence interval on the FSC retrievals is 38% at the 95% confidence level.

TI  - Copernicus Sentinel-1 MT-InSAR, GNSS and Seismic Monitoring of Deformation Patterns and Trends at the Methana Volcano, Greece
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Methana volcano in Greece belongs to the western part of the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, where the African and Eurasian tectonic plates converge at a rate of approximately 3 cm/year. While volcanic hazard in Methana is considered low, the neotectonic basin constituting the Saronic Gulf area is seismically active and there is evidence of local geothermal activity. Monitoring is therefore crucial to characterize any activity at the volcano that could impact the local population. This study aims to detect surface deformation in the whole Methana peninsula based on a long stack of 99 Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images in interferometric wide swath mode acquired in March 2015-August 2019. A Multi-Temporal Interferometric SAR (MT-InSAR) processing approach is exploited using the Interferometric Point Target Analysis (IPTA) method, involving the extraction of a network of targets including both Persistent Scatterers (PS) and Distributed Scatterers (DS) to augment the monitoring capability across the varied land cover of the peninsula. Satellite geodetic data from 2006-2019 Global Positioning System (GPS) benchmark surveying are used to calibrate and validate the MT-InSAR results. Deformation monitoring records from permanent Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations, two of which were installed within the peninsula in 2004 (METH) and 2019 (MTNA), are also exploited for interpretation of the regional deformation scenario. Geological, topographic, and 2006-2019 seismological data enable better understanding of the ground deformation observed. Line-of-sight displacement velocities of the over 4700 PS and 6200 DS within the peninsula are from -18.1 to +7.5 mm/year. The MT-InSAR data suggest a complex displacement pattern across the volcano edifice, including local-scale land surface processes. In Methana town, ground stability is found on volcanoclasts and limestone for the majority of the urban area footprint while some deformation is observed in the suburban zones. At the Mavri Petra andesitic dome, time series of the exceptionally dense PS/DS network across blocks of agglomerate and cinder reveal seasonal fluctuation (5 mm amplitude) overlapping the long-term stable trend. Given the steepness of the slopes along the eastern flank of the volcano, displacement patterns may indicate mass movements. The GNSS, seismological and MT-InSAR analyses lead to a first account of deformation processes and their temporal evolution over the last years for Methana, thus providing initial information to feed into the volcano baseline hazard assessment and monitoring system.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes how a series of papers published inAquatic Conservationhave had a clear impact on the conservation process run at Rapa Nui by the Chilean Government and the Rapanui community. Exploratory expeditions set the scientific basis for the creation of Rapa Nui Multiple Use Marine Protected Area. Past conservation initiatives lacked proper participative processes and were strongly resisted by the local communities. Science transfer through capacity building was key for a local transformation towards embracing marine conservation objectives. Publications showed the importance of participation, a good balance between political will and a local wish for protection of the sea, and the incorporation of a local worldview, for a successful conservation process. Strong differences between the socio-ecological systems in mainland Chile and that in Rapa Nui were recognized and helped to build a new conservation strategy for Rapa Nui between the Chilean Government and Rapanui community. International experience exchanges also helped to develop the conservation process in Rapa Nui, and recent ecological studies will help future Marine Protected Area implementation.

TI  - Object-Based Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Land Cover Mapping Leveraging Hierarchical Class Relationships
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - European satellite missions Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) provide at high spatial resolution and high revisit time, respectively, radar and optical images that support a wide range of Earth surface monitoring tasks, such as Land Use/Land Cover mapping. A long-standing challenge in the remote sensing community is about how to efficiently exploit multiple sources of information and leverage their complementarity, in order to obtain the most out of radar and optical data. In this work, we propose to deal with land cover mapping in an object-based image analysis (OBIA) setting via a deep learning framework designed to leverage the multi-source complementarity provided by radar and optical satellite image time series (SITS). The proposed architecture is based on an extension of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) enriched via a modified attention mechanism capable to fit the specificity of SITS data. Our framework also integrates a pretraining strategy that allows to exploit specific domain knowledge, shaped as hierarchy over the set of land cover classes, to guide the model training. Thorough experimental evaluations, involving several competitive approaches were conducted on two study sites, namely the Reunion island and a part of the Senegalese groundnut basin. Classification results, 79% of global accuracy on the Reunion island and 90% on the Senegalese site, respectively, have demonstrated the suitability of the proposal.

TI  - Assessment of the Capability of Sentinel-2 Imagery for Iron-Bearing Minerals Mapping: A Case Study in the Cuprite Area, Nevada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With several bands covering iron-bearing mineral spectral features, Sentinel-2 has advantages for iron mapping. However, due to the inconsistent spatial resolution, the sensitivity of Sentinel-2 data to detect iron-bearing minerals may be decreased by excluding the 60 m bands and neglecting the 20 m vegetation red-edge bands. Hence, the capability of Sentinel-2 for iron-bearing minerals mapping were assessed by applying a multivariate (MV) method to pansharpen Sentinel-2 data. Firstly, the Sentinel-2 bands with spatial resolution 20 m and 60 m (except band 10) were pansharpened to 10 m. Then, extraction of iron-bearing minerals from the MV-fused image was explored in the Cuprite area, Nevada, USA. With the complete set of 12 bands with a fine spatial resolution, three band ratios (6/1, 6/8A and (6 + 7)/8A) of the fused image were proposed for the extraction of hematite + goethite, hematite + jarosite and the mixture of iron-bearing minerals, respectively. Additionally, band ratios of Sentinel-2 data for iron-bearing minerals in previous studies were modified with substitution of narrow near infrared band 8A for band 8. Results demonstrated that the capability for detection of iron-bearing minerals using Sentinel-2 data was improved by consideration of two extra bands and the unified fine spatial resolution.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water bodies eutrophication is a worldwide environmental problem characterized by excessive phytoplankton growth which often includes occurrence of harmful algal blooms events. Chlorophyll-a concentration is widely used as an indicator of biomass and can be quantified by optic sensors. In this work, we use a satellite derived Chlorophyll-a concentration time series for the period 2001-2014 obtained from MODIS/TERRA data to detect and characterize algal bloom events in an eutrophic reservoir. Our results demonstrate that fixed threshold methods identify too many bloom dates but a dynamic method based on frequencies analysis and statistical approach, performed better because it represents the normal phytoplankton mass and a bloom is identified like a deviation from it. This approach was tested in San Roque reservoir which supplies fresh water to Cordoba city, one of the most populated of Argentina. According to Carlson index values, this is an eutrophic to hypereutrophic water body. Validation of log(10) (Chlorophyll-a concentration) derived from satellite model concentration with ground-based measurements data of Chlorophyll-a concentration demonstrates an acceptable error (RMSE = 0.59) considering data distribution. The implementation of the proposed method to identify blooms over a control data set and validated with LANDSAT 8 - OLI images, demonstrates that the approach described is robust and stable over time.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) in patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are associated with increased morbidity, mortality and economic costs. Many BSIs are associated with central venous catheters (CVCs). The Infection in Critical Care Quality Improvement Programme (ICCQIP) was established to initiate surveillance of BSIs in English ICUs.Methods: A web-based data capture system was launched on 1st May 2016 to collect all positive blood cultures (PBCs), patient-days and CVC-days. National Health Service (NHS) trusts in England were invited to participate in the surveillance programme. Data were linked to the antimicrobial resistance dataset maintained by Public Health England and to mortality data.Findings: Between 1st May 2016 and 30th April 2017, 84 ICUs (72 adult ICUs, seven paediatric ICUs and five neonatal ICUs) based in 57 of 147 NHS trusts provided data. In total, 1474 PBCs were reported, with coagulase-negative staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium being the most commonly reported organisms. The rates of BSI and ICU-associated CVC-BSI were 5.7, 1.5 and 1.3 per 1000 bed-days and 2.3, 1.0 and 1.5 per 1000 ICU-CVC-days in adult, paediatric and neonatal ICUs, respectively. There was wide variation in BSI and CVC-BSI rates within ICU types, particularly in adult ICUs (0-44.0 per 1000 bed-days and 0-18.3 per 1000 ICU-CVC-days).Conclusions: While the overall rates of ICU-associated CVC-BSIs were lower than 2.5 per 1000 ICU-CVC-days across all age ranges, large differences were observed between ICUs, highlighting the importance of a national standardized surveillance system to identify opportunities for improvement. Data linkage provided clinically important information on resistance patterns and patient outcomes at no extra cost to participating trusts.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP) Using Landsat 8-Based Indices: A Case Study From Hir-Neur Rangelands, Iran
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP), an indicator of ecosystems' ability to capture and convert solar energy, is critical to evaluate and manage ecosystem carbon balance index including rangelands. Measuring ANPP over a large area is difficult at it varies with different factors including climate and anthropogenic, while satellite-based information shows strong opportunity. The aim of this study was to estimate the ANPP of Plant Functional Types (PFTs) using Landsat-8 imagery over the rangelands of HirNeur from Ardabil Province, Iran as a case study area. Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images were collected on 9th June 2017 aligning with the field sampling of PFTs ANPP. Eleven sampling sites with 10 plots at each site (locations recorded with a Global Positioning System, GPS) were selected along a transect with elevation gradient and the ANPP of PFTs were recorded. Twenty-two vegetation indices were calculated from the Landsat-8 imagery and the index values were extracted for the sampling plots. Correlation between derived indices and field collected ANPP data were calculated. Predictive relationships between PFTs and total ANPP and satellite indices were developed using a 3rd-order polynomial model and the model was used to map the whole study area. The best estimation of PFTs and total ANPP was obtained using the Vegetation Index (VI3) for grasses (R-2 =0.47), Iron Oxide (IO) for forbs (R-2=0.51), and Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI) for shrubs (R-2= 0.50). The Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) was the best estimator for the total ANPP (R-2=0.49). The overall accuracies of the maps were acceptable (MAE, MDE, RMSE <0.5). Results showed a difference when using PFTs for ANPP estimation in comparison with direct ANPP estimation. Thus, direct estimation of ANPP from the satellite based indices would be more accurate. This study also showed promising capabilities of the indices based on PFTs and total ANPP for estimating aboveground biomass, supply-demand balance and carbon balance at the study area and elsewhere with similar ecological conditions. This study also showed opportunity to select the most appropriate vegetation indices for the estimation of PFTs and the total ANPP. (C) 2020 The Society for Range Management.

TI  - Improved land cover map of Iran using Sentinel imagery within Google Earth Engine and a novel automatic workflow for land cover classification using migrated training samples
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information about the location, extent, and type of Land Cover (LC) is essential for various applications. The only recent available country-wide LC map of Iran was generated in 2016 by the Iranian Space Agency (ISA) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images with a considerably low accuracy. Therefore, the production of an up-to-date and accurate Iran-wide LC map using the most recent remote sensing, machine learning, and big data processing algorithms is required. Moreover, it is important to develop an efficient method for automatic LC generation for various time periods without the need to collect additional ground truth data from this immense country. Therefore, this study was conducted to fulfill two objectives. First, an improved Iranian LC map with 13 LC classes and a spatial resolution of 10 m was produced using multi-temporal synergy of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite datasets applied to an object-based Random forest (RF) algorithm. For this purpose, 2,869 Sentinel-1 and 11,994 Sentinel-2 scenes acquired in 2017 were processed and classified within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform allowing big geospatial data analysis. The Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient (KC) of the final Iran-wide LC map for 2017 was 95.6% and 0.95, respectively, indicating the considerable potential of the proposed big data processing method. Second, an efficient automatic method was developed based on Sentinel-2 images to migrate ground truth samples from a reference year to automatically generate an LC map for any target year. The OA and KC for the LC map produced for the target year 2019 were 91.35% and 0.91, respectively, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed method for automatic LC mapping. Based on the obtained accuracies, this method can potentially be applied to other regions of interest for LC mapping without the need for ground truth data from the target year.

TI  - Volcanic Processes in the Gassendi Region of the Moon
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - The lunar floor-fractured crater Gassendi and surrounding area were examined with high-resolution Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter imagery and other remote sensing data to characterize and understand the volcanic processes in the southwestern region of the Moon. This study was selected because the Gassendi region exhibits a variety of volcanic features (e.g., cryptomaria deposits, pyroclastic deposits, maria, and lava lakes) and team participants have studied this region for 30 years (Hawke et al., 1991, ). This study confirms the existence of a previously identified cryptomare deposit and identifies an additional cryptomare deposit west of Gassendi crater and a pyroclastic northeast of Gassendi. Spectral and geochemical anomalies associated with dark-haloed impact craters reveal cryptomaria deposits in the western Gassendi crater floor and previously unmapped mare basalt within northeastern Gassendi. We identified three separate lava lakes on the northeast, northwest, and southwest floor of Gassendi crater based on morphology analogous to terrestrial lava lakes, geochemical signatures, and digital terrain data. Crater count (model) age data suggest that the lava lakes were active at similar to 3.6 Ga (300 Ma after floor emplacement). Criteria used to identify lava lakes in Gassendi were applied globally to locate candidate lava lakes within floor-fractured craters. With the identification of lava lake morphology, both in Gassendi crater and in other floor-fractured craters, the current ascent and eruption models should be revised to allow for at least short-term connection between magma supply at depth and surface lava lakes. Hence, this integration of multiple perspectives afforded by recent remote data sets reveals new views about lunar volcanic processes.

TI  - An Empirical Radiometric Intercomparison Methodology Based on Global Simultaneous Nadir Overpasses Applied to Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Simultaneous Nadir Overpass (SNO) method was developed by the NOAA/NESDIS to improve the consistency and quality of climate data acquired by different meteorological satellites. Taking advantage of the reduced impact induced by the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), atmospheric effects, illumination and viewing geometries during an SNO, we created a sensor comparison methodology for all spectral targets. The method is illustrated by applying it to the assessment of data acquired by the Landsat 8 (L8), Sentinel-2A (S2A), and Sentinel-2B (S2B) optical sensors. Multiple SNOs were identified and selected without the need for orbit propagators. Then, by locating spatially homogeneous areas, it was possible to assess, for a wide range of Top-of-Atmosphere reflectance values, the relationship between the L8 bands and the corresponding ones of S2A and S2B. The results yield high coefficients of determination for S2 A/B with respect to L8. All are higher than 0.980 for S2A and 0.984 for S2B. If the S2 band 8 (wide near-infrared, NIR) is excluded then the lowest coefficients of determination become 0.997 and 0.999 from S2A and S2B, respectively. This methodology can be complementary to those based on Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) due to its simplicity, highly correlated results and the wide range of compared reflectances and spectral targets.

TI  - Mosquito Community Composition, Seasonal Distributions, and Trap Bias in Northeastern Florida
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquito control agencies monitor mosquito diversity and abundance through a variety of trap types. Although various long-term ecological data sets exist, little work has been done to address the sampling effort required to capture mosquito community diversity by trap type and few spatiotemporal distributions of vector species have been described. Here, we describe the seasonal distributions of vector species of importance, assess trapping effort needed to capture the diversity of the mosquito community, and use a partial redundancy analysis to identify trap bias from four commonly deployed adult mosquito traps in Volusia County, Florida. Collections were made with American Biophysics Corporation (ABC) light traps, Biogents Sentinel (BGS) traps, chicken coop exit traps, and gravid traps. We collected a total of 238,301 adult female mosquitoes belonging to 11 genera and 36 species, 12 of which we deemed to be vector species of epidemiological importance. We found that ABC traps not only yielded the greatest abundance and diversity but also captured several nonvector species. BGS and gravid traps yielded the highest proportions of vector species; exit traps recorded the lowest abundances and species richness. Wintertime abundances of several species demonstrated a need for year-round surveillance in the study area; partial redundancy analysis revealed that trap type explained a significant proportion of the variance in our data set, with certain vector species associated with specific trap types. Increased awareness regarding the amount of trapping effort needed to detect vector species diversity will help to optimize efforts in the field, leading to more effective resource allocation.[GRAPHICS].

M3  - Comparative Study
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Multicenter Study
AB  - PURPOSE: As part of the implementation of quality registration in Iceland we used retrospective data to compare diagnosis and treatment of invasive breast cancer between Iceland and Sweden.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on all patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in Iceland 2016-2017 was obtained from the Icelandic Cancer Registry. Hospital records were used to register variables in an electronic form adapted from the Swedish quality registration, and compared with data from Sweden for the same period. A chi-square test was used to compare ratios.RESULTS: A total of 486 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in Iceland and 15.325 in Sweden. A lower proportion of 40-69 year old women were diagnosed within the screening programme in Iceland (46%) compared to Sweden (60%) (p<0.01). Multidisciplinary tumor board meetings held before and after surgery were less frequent in Iceland (92% vs. 96%) compared to Sweden (98% vs. 99%) in 2016 (p<0,01) but no difference was seen in 2017. A sentinel node surgery was done in 69% of the cases in Iceland compared to 94% in Sweden (p<0,01). For cancers ≤30mm breast conserving surgery was done in 48% cases in Iceland but 80% in Sweden (p<0,01). In Iceland 87% of the cases had radiation therapy after breast conserving surgery but 94% in Sweden (p<0,01). Among mastectomy patients with lymph node metastases, 49% received radiation therapy in Iceland compared to 83% in Sweden (p<0,01).CONCLUSION: Differences were seen in several areas of diagnosis and treatment of invasive breast cancer between Iceland and Sweden. With quality registration it will be possible to monitor and set goals for the diagnosis and treatment, with the aim of providing the best treatment to as many patients as possible.

TI  - Adaptation to Land Degradation in Southeast Vietnam
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - A framework was developed to elucidate (1) the drivers of land degradation, (2) pressures, (3) local impacts and vulnerabilities and (4) adaptation strategies. The combination of participatory approaches, statistical data analysis, time series Landsat imagery and spatial data mining was tested in southeast Vietnam where the impacts of land degradation on the environment and economy are considerable. The major drivers of land degradation are climate, notably drought, and population density. The pressures include natural resource management and land use/cover change. A Landsat archive analysis showed an increase in agricultural land use from 31% to 50%, mostly at the expense of forests, from 1990 to 2019. Farmers adapted by investing in the irrigation of rice and dragon fruit, and by selecting their rainfed crops in line with the changing environment. The most vulnerable were the rural poor and farmers without access to land and water resources. The best protection against land degradation was prosperity, which is enhanced by the region's location along Vietnam's major national route, connecting major cities along a north-south axis. Our analysis shows that southeast Vietnam emerged as a region with an important human ecological resilience strengthened by increased prosperity. The current adaptation options and limitations warrant further research.

TI  - Satellite and In Situ Monitoring of Chl-<i>a</i>, Turbidity, and Total Suspended Matter in Coastal Waters: Experience of the Year 2017 along the French Coasts
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The consistency of satellite and in situ time series of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), Turbidity and Total Suspended Matters (TSM) was investigated at 17 coastal stations throughout the year 2017. These stations covered different water types, from relatively clear waters in the Mediterranean Sea to moderately turbid regions in the Bay of Biscay and the southern bight of the North-Sea. Satellite retrievals were derived from MODIS/AQUA, VIIRS/NPP and OLCI-A/Sentinel-3 spectral reflectance. In situ data were obtained from the coastal phytoplankton networks SOMLIT (CNRS), REPHY (Ifremer) and associated networks. Satellite and in situ retrievals of the year 2017 were compared to the historical seasonal cycles and percentiles, 10 and 90, observed in situ. Regarding the sampling frequency in the Mediterranean Sea, a weekly in situ sampling allowed all major peaks in Chl-a caught from space to be recorded at sea, and, conversely, all in situ peaks were observed from space in a frequently cloud-free atmosphere. In waters of the Eastern English Channel, lower levels of Chl-a were observed, both in situ and from space, compared to the historical averages. However, despite a good overall agreement for low to moderate biomass, the satellite method, based on blue and green wavelengths, tends to provide elevated and variable Chl-a in a high biomass environment. Satellite-derived TSM and Turbidity were quite consistent with in situ measurements. Moreover, satellite retrievals of the water clarity parameters often showed a lower range of variability than their in situ counterparts did, being less scattered above and under the seasonal curves of percentiles 10 and 90.

TI  - Stable isotopes used to assess pollution impacts on coastal and marine ecosystems of Cuba and Mexico
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Stable isotopes of nitrogen (delta N-15) have been widely used around the world to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic activities on marine ecosystems; however, in the Caribbean Sea countries, such as Mexico and Cuba, they are rarely used. Inputs of nutrients related to urban development and tourist activities along the coasts of the Caribbean Sea have the potential to deteriorate their fragile marine ecosystems. The use of isotopic tools and elemental analysis in sentinel organisms would be useful to provide evidence of the impact generated by anthropogenic nutrients. Measurements of delta N-15 (h), carbon and nitrogen content, and C:N ratios, were conducted in different sentinel groups (macroalgae, seagrasses, gorgonians, and corals) collected in five marine ecosystems with different nearby coastal development pressure in both countries. The selected ecosystems, ordered according to the level of coastal areas development (low to high), were: Jardines de la Reina (JR), Gulf of Ana Maria (GAM), Cayo Coco (CC), and Laguna Larga (LL) in Cuba, and Puerto Morelos (PM) in Mexico. Results evidenced that the majority of sentinels inhabiting near the most developed coastal areas, in terms of population and tourism, showed higher N contents, lower C:N ratios and higher values of delta N-15 (e.g., PM and LL) than those near less developed coastal ecosystems (e.g., GAM and JR). Land-based nutrients from municipal wastewater constitute the primary source of N pollution. Because eutrophication represents a significant threat to the integrity of valuable coastal ecosystems, there is an urgent need to accelerate progress in wastewater treatment systems, in terms of capacity and efficiency, to significantly reduce nutrient inputs to coastal ecosystems. Otherwise, more negative changes and deteriorations to the health of coastal ecosystems, including coral reefs, are expected along the Mexican Caribbean and numerous key points of Cuba and other Caribbean countries.

TI  - Use of indocyanine green fluorescence compared to radioisotope for sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: In early-stage breast cancer, indocyanine green (ICG)-fluorescence based sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection is being considered. This is a meta-analysis of SLN detection rates and sensitivity of ICG-fluorescence compared to radioisotope (RI), to evaluate its clinical applicability.Data sources: Systematic review of full-text articles from PubMed and Scopus, of women with early breast cancer who underwent SLN mapping using ICG and RI concurrently was performed. The metaanalysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel method.Results: 2301 patients from 19 studies were included. No significant difference was observed between ICG and RI for SLN detection (OR0.90,95%Cl0.66-1.24) or sensitivity (OR1.23,95%Cl0.73-2.05) with heterogeneity between studies (I-2 = 58%,P = 0.003). Sensitivity of dual mapping (ICG + RI) was significantly better compared to single mapping with RI (OR3.69,95%Cl1.79-7.62) or ICG (OR3.32,95%Cl1.52-7.24) alone with no heterogeneity between studies (I-2 = 0%,P = 0.004).Conclusion: ICG-fluorescence could complement RI method or provide alternative in centers with poor accessibility to RI lymphoscintigraphy.

TI  - Two ultrastaging protocols for the detection of lymph node metastases in early-stage cervical and endometrial cancers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To date, there is no universal consensus on which is the optimal ultrastaging protocol for sentinel lymph node (SLN) evaluation in gynecologic malignancies. To estimate the impact of different ultrastaging methods of SLNs on the detection of patients with nodal metastases in early-stage cervical and endometrial cancers and to describe the incidence of low-volume metastases between two ultrastaging protocols. Methods We retrospectively compared two ultrastaging protocols (ultrastaging-A vs ultrastaging-B) in patients with clinical stage I endometrial cancer or FIGO stage IA-IB1 cervical cancer who underwent primary surgery including SLN biopsy from October 2010 to December 2017 in our institution. The histologic subtypes and grades of the tumors were evaluated according to WHO criteria. Only SLNs underwent ultrastaging, while other lymph nodes were sectioned and examined by routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Results Overall 224 patients were reviewed (159 endometrial cancer and 65 cervical cancer). Lymph node involvement was noted in 15% of patients with endometrial cancer (24/159): 24% of patients (9/38) with the ultrastaging protocol A and 12% (15/121) with the ultrastaging protocol B (p=0.08); while for cervical cancer, SLN metastasis was detected in 14% of patients (9/65): 22% (4/18) in ultrastaging-A and 11% (5/47) in ultrastaging-B (p=0.20). Overall, macrometastasis and low-volume metastases were 50% and 50% for endometrial cancer and 78% and 22% for cervical cancer. Median size of nodal metastasis was 2 (range 0.9-8.5) mm for the ultrastaging-A and 1.2 (range 0.4-2.6) mm for the ultrastaging-B protocol in endometrial cancer (p=0.25); 4 (range 2.5-9.8) mm for ultrastaging-A and 4.4 (range 0.3-7.8) mm for ultrastaging-B protocol in cervical cancer (p=0.64). Conclusion In endometrial or cervical cancer patients, the incidence of SLN metastasis was not different between the two different types of ultrastaging protocol.

TI  - Preliminary Results of Ship Detection Technique by Wake Pattern Recognition in SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, international agencies for border security ask for an improvement of the actual Maritime Situational Awareness. This manuscript presents preliminary results of a detection technique of go-fast boats, whose utilization in illegal affairs is strongly increasing. Their detection is very challenging since: (i) their echo is not visible in SAR images, and (ii) the illegal activities are carried out in the nighttime making useless the optical sensors. However, their wakes are very persistent and extent in SAR images for some kilometers. Hence, the manuscript shows an innovative deterministic methodology for the ship detection based on the wake signature. It firstly identifies pixels crossed by the wakes, whose presence is, then, validated in two steps. The first level of validation estimated how prominent the wake components are with respect to their background. The second level of validation exploits the presence of the wakes among neighbor pixels. The approach has been applied on ships imaged by TerraSAR-X mission showing the same peculiarities of go-fast boats. Results highlight the potentialities of the proposed approach, which can be also conceived as a subsequent step in a hybrid system, whose preliminary wake detection screening is carried out by different techniques.

TI  - Molecular risk prediction in cutaneous melanoma: A meta-analysis of the 31-gene expression profile prognostic test in 1,479 patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Multiple studies have reported on the accuracy of the prognostic 31-gene expression profile test for cutaneous melanoma. Consistency of the test results across studies has not been systematically evaluated.Objective: To assess the robustness of the prognostic value of the 31-gene expression profile.Methods: Raw data were obtained from studies identified from systematic review. A meta-analysis was performed to determine overall effect of the 31-gene expression profile. Clinical outcome metrics for the 31-gene expression profile were compared with American Joint Committee on Cancer staging.Results: Three studies met inclusion criteria; data from a novel cohort of 211 patients were included (n = 1,479). Five-year recurrence-free and distant metastasis-free survival rates were 91.4% and 94.1% for Class 1A patients and 43.6% and 55.5% for Class 2B patients (P<.0001). Meta-analysis results showed that Class 2 was significantly associated with recurrence (hazard ratio 2.90; P<.0001) and distant metastasis (hazard ratio 2.75; P<.0001). The 31-gene expression profile identified American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to III patient subsets with high likelihood for recurrence and distant metastasis. Sensitivity was 76% (95% confidence interval 71%-80%) and 76% (95% confidence interval 70%-82%) for each end point, respectively. When 31-gene expression profile and sentinel lymph node biopsy results were considered together, sensitivity and negative predictive value for distant metastasis-free survival were both improved.Conclusion: The 31-gene expression profile test consistently and accurately identifies melanoma patients at increased risk of metastasis, is independent of other clinicopathologic covariates, and augments current risk stratification by reclassifying patients for heightened surveillance who were previously designated as being at low risk.

TI  - Towards an Integration of Models of Discrimination of Immigrants: from Ultimate (Functional) to Proximate (Sociofunctional) Explanations
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION AND INTEGRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We integrated models of discrimination of immigrants by combining established approaches to prejudice and discrimination towards immigrants (proximate explanations) using assumptions of Evolutionary-Coalitional Theory (ultimate explanations). Based on this perspective, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and multicultural ideology (MCI) were considered as sociofunctional motives for attitudes towards immigrants. We examined relationships between individual differences in beliefs about the social world (dangerous worldview and competitive worldview) as more distal antecedents, and RWA, SDO, and MCI as more proximal antecedents, and the endorsement of discrimination of immigrants in the socioeconomic domain by Russian majority group members as the outcome. Data were collected among 576 participants from 33 regions in Russia, using online social media. MCI predicted endorsement of discrimination of immigrants by Russian majority group members better than did RWA and SDO. SDO predicted only economic aspects of the endorsement of discrimination. The results are discussed within the Russian context, with its ethnically diverse composition of the population and high migration rates.

TI  - Prognostic Gene Expression Profiling in Cutaneous Melanoma Identifying the Knowledge Gaps and Assessing the Clinical Benefit
T2  - JAMA DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Question What evidence is needed for incorporation of prognostic gene expression profile (GEP) testing into clinical practice for patients with melanoma? Findings Findings of GEP testing are needed from large, representative patient cohorts with adequate clinical follow-up to enable statistical modeling and validation, and these findings must be compared with known relevant melanoma clinicopathologic factors. The currently published evidence is insufficient to establish that routine use of GEP testing provides additional clinical value for melanoma staging and prognostication beyond available clinicopathologic variables. Meaning Before GEP testing is routinely used, the clinical benefit to the management of patients with melanoma must be established through further clinical investigation.Importance Use of prognostic gene expression profile (GEP) testing in cutaneous melanoma (CM) is rising despite a lack of endorsement as standard of care. Objective To develop guidelines within the national Melanoma Prevention Working Group (MPWG) on integration of GEP testing into the management of patients with CM, including (1) review of published data using GEP tests, (2) definition of acceptable performance criteria, (3) current recommendations for use of GEP testing in clinical practice, and (4) considerations for future studies. Evidence Review The MPWG members and other international melanoma specialists participated in 2 online surveys and then convened a summit meeting. Published data and meeting abstracts from 2015 to 2019 were reviewed. Findings The MPWG members are optimistic about the future use of prognostic GEP testing to improve risk stratification and enhance clinical decision-making but acknowledge that current utility is limited by test performance in patients with stage I disease. Published studies of GEP testing have not evaluated results in the context of all relevant clinicopathologic factors or as predictors of regional nodal metastasis to replace sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The performance of GEP tests has generally been reported for small groups of patients representing particular tumor stages or in aggregate form, such that stage-specific performance cannot be ascertained, and without survival outcomes compared with data from the American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition melanoma staging system international database. There are significant challenges to performing clinical trials incorporating GEP testing with SLNB and adjuvant therapy. The MPWG members favor conducting retrospective studies that evaluate multiple GEP testing platforms on fully annotated archived samples before embarking on costly prospective studies and recommend avoiding routine use of GEP testing to direct patient management until prospective studies support their clinical utility. Conclusions and Relevance More evidence is needed to support using GEP testing to inform recommendations regarding SLNB, intensity of follow-up or imaging surveillance, and postoperative adjuvant therapy. The MPWG recommends further research to assess the validity and clinical applicability of existing and emerging GEP tests. Decisions on performing GEP testing and patient management based on these results should only be made in the context of discussion of testing limitations with the patient or within a multidisciplinary group.This consensus statement assesses what evidence is needed to develop guidelines on integration of gene expression profile testing into cutaneous melanoma management.

TI  - Performance of the Remotely-Derived Products in Monitoring Gross Primary Production across Arid and Semi-Arid Ecosystems in Northwest China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important component to quantify the carbon budget, accurate evaluation of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) is crucial for large-scale applications, especially in dryland ecosystems. Based on the in situ data from six flux sites in northwestern China from 2014 to 2016, this study compares seasonal and interannual dynamics of carbon fluxes between these arid and semi-arid ecosystems and the atmosphere. Meanwhile, the reliability of multiple remotely-derived GPP products in representative drylands was examined, including the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and data derived from the OCO-2 solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (GOSIF). The results indicated that the carbon fluxes had clear seasonal patterns, with all ecosystems functioning as carbon sinks. The maize cropland had the highest GPP with 1183 g C m(-2)y(-1). Although the net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) in the Tamarix spp. ecosystem was the smallest among these flux sites, it reached 208 g C m(-2)y(-1). Furthermore, distinct advantages of GOSIF GPP (with R-2=0.85-0.98, and RMSE=0.87-2.66 g C m(-2)d(-1)) were found with good performance. However, large underestimations in three GPP products existed during the growing seasons, except in grassland ecosystems. The main reasons can be ascribed to the uncertainties in the key model parameters, including the underestimated light use efficiency of the MODIS GPP, the same coarse land cover product for the BESS and MODIS GPP, the coarse gridded meteorological data, and distribution of C-3 and C-4 plants. Therefore, it still requires more work to accurately quantify the GPP across these dryland ecosystems.

TI  - Self-esteem and cultural worldview buffer mortality salience effects on responses to self-face: Distinct neural mediators
T2  - BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terror management theory proposes cultural worldview and self-esteem as two buffers against death anxiety. The neural mediators of these buffering effects, however, have not been fully understood. The present work investigated neural mediation mechanisms between self-esteem/cultural trait (self-construal) and mortality salience (MS) effects on self-face processing. We found that MS (vs. NA) priming eliminated self-face advantage in behavioral judgments of face-orientation in low self-esteem individuals and reduced self-face advantage in behavioral judgments of facial-familiarity in individuals with high interdependent self-construals. Our functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results showed that, following MS priming, insular activities mediated the relationship between self-esteem and self-face advantage in face-orientation judgments, whereas dorsal medial prefrontal activity mediated the relationship between interdependent self-construal and self-face advantage in face-familiarity judgments. Our findings suggest that distinct neural mechanisms are engaged in mediating the relationships between self-esteem/cultural trait and MS effects on the emotional and cognitive processes of self-relevant information.

TI  - A prospective comparative study of ultrasonography, contrast-enhanced MRI and <SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG PET/CT for preoperative detection of axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients
T2  - ANNALI ITALIANI DI CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - AIM: We aimed to evaluate; (i) the accuracy of ultrasonography (US), contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) for detection of axillary lymph node metastases (ALNMs), (ii) the role of late prone imaging, and (iii) the effect of PET/CT on preoperative staging of breast cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS: From June 2015 to January 2019, 236 breast cancer patients were preoperatively examined using US, cMRI, and PET/CT and whom underwent pathological evaluations of axillary lymph nodes were analyzed. The sensitivity, spec (city, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy (ACC) of US, cMRI, and PET/CT for ALNMs were determined.RESULTS: There were 235 female and one male in our study. The mean age was 55,6 +/- 11,3 years. Of 158 patients who were histopathologically evaluated, 85 patients (36%) were negative and 73 patients (30.9%) were positive for ALNMs. The remaining 78 patients who were only radiologically evaluated with US and/or cMRI, 24 patients (10.2%) were negative and 54 patients (22.9%) were positive for ALNMs. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and ACC of PET/CT were 80.0%, 92.2%, 92.0%, 80.3%, and 85.7%, respectively. The axillary lymph node, which was suspicious in supine imaging, remained in the suspicious group again in prone imaging in PET/CT.CONCLUSIONS: There is no single absolute modality for detecting ALNMs in breast cancers to replace sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary, lymph node dissection. If ALNM is suspected based on PET/CT, axillary, lymph node dissection without sentinel lymph node biopsy might be a better option because it is related to high possibilities of ALNM.

TI  - Discrepancies in the Simulated Global Terrestrial Latent Heat Flux from GLASS and MERRA-2 Surface Net Radiation Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface all-wave net radiation (Rn) is a crucial variable driving many terrestrial latent heat (LE) models that estimate global LE. However, the differences between different Rn products and their impact on global LE estimates still remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated two Rn products, Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) beta version Rn and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications-version 2 (MERRA-2) Rn, from 2007-2017 using ground-measured data from 240 globally distributed in-situ radiation measurements provided by FLUXNET projects. The GLASS Rn product had higher accuracy (R(2)increased by 0.04-0.26, and RMSE decreased by 2-13.3 W/m(2)) than the MERRA-2 Rn product for all land cover types on a daily scale, and the two Rn products differed greatly in spatial distribution and variations. We then determined the resulting discrepancies in simulated annual global LE using a simple averaging model by merging five diagnostic LE models: RS-PM model, SW model, PT-JPL model, MS-PT model, and SIM model. The validation results showed that the estimated LE from the GLASS Rn had higher accuracy (R(2)increased by 0.04-0.14, and RMSE decreased by 3-8.4 W/m(2)) than that from the MERRA-2 Rn for different land cover types at daily scale. Importantly, the mean annual global terrestrial LE from GLASS Rn was 2.1% lower than that from the MERRA-2 Rn. Our study showed that large differences in satellite and reanalysis Rn products could lead to substantial uncertainties in estimating global terrestrial LE.

TI  - High-Resolution Gridded Level 3 Aerosol Optical Depth Data from MODIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The state-of-art satellite observations of atmospheric aerosols over the last two decades from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments have been extensively utilized in climate change and air quality research and applications. The operational algorithms now produce Level 2 aerosol data at varying spatial resolutions (1, 3, and 10 km) and Level 3 data at 1 degree. The local and global applications have benefited from the coarse resolution gridded data sets (i.e., Level 3, 1 degree), as it is easier to use since data volume is low, and several online and offline tools are readily available to access and analyze the data with minimal computing resources. At the same time, researchers who require data at much finer spatial scales have to go through a challenging process of obtaining, processing, and analyzing larger volumes of data sets that require high-end computing resources and coding skills. Therefore, we created a high spatial resolution (high-resolution gridded (HRG), 0.1 x 0.1 degree) daily and monthly aerosol optical depth (AOD) product by combining two MODIS operational algorithms, namely Deep Blue (DB) and Dark Target (DT). The new HRG AODs meet the accuracy requirements of Level 2 AOD data and provide either the same or more spatial coverage on daily and monthly scales. The data sets are provided in daily and monthly files through open an Ftp server with python scripts to read and map the data. The reduced data volume with an easy to use format and tools to access the data will encourage more users to utilize the data for research and applications.

TI  - Feasibility of visual signals on the construction of biosensors based on behavioral analysis of <i>Perna perna</i> mussels
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bivalve mollusks are well known for their sentinel characteristics being sensitive to environmental changes. Considering the capability of closing their valves to isolate their soft tissues from the aquatic medium, the analysis of bivalves behavior has been used in the construction of aquatic pollution biosensors. Hall effect sensors are a well-established and widely used valvometry method and present several advantages. However, its use still requires fixing components in the animal shells. The present study has investigated the feasibility of using visual signals for the behavioral analysis of Perna perna mussels. In this sense, it has described a computer vision algorithm for the analysis of mussels valve-activity. Moreover, the valve-activity responses obtained through the computer vision algorithm have demonstrated a very similar pattern to the signal obtained with Hall effect sensors. In conclusion, the use of visual signals in the behavioral monitoring of Perna perna mussels have proved to be feasible. Furthermore, results indicated that the study of more robust computer-vision techniques may lead to the construction of totally non-invasive biosensors.

TI  - Establishing a baseline for tick surveillance in Alaska: Tick collection records from 1909-2019
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The expanding geographic ranges of tick species that are known pathogen vectors can have implications for human, domestic animal, and wildlife health. Although Alaska is home to several hard tick species, it has his-torically been outside of the range of the most common medically important ticks in the contiguous United States and western Canada. To assess the status of tick species establishment in the state and to provide a baseline for tracking future change in the distribution of ticks, we reviewed and compiled historical tick records and sum-marized recent tick occurrence records collected through the development of the Alaska Submit-A-Tick Program and through tick drag sampling at sentinel sites in southcentral Alaska. Between 1909-2019, there were 1190 tick records representing 4588 individual ticks across 15 species in Alaska. The majority of ticks were species historically found in Alaska: Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, Ixodes angustus, Ixodes auritulus, Ixodes howelli, Ixodes signatus, and Ixodes uriae. Over half of all tick records in the state were collected in the last 10 yr. During this time, the number of tick records and the number of tick species recorded in Alaska each year has increased substantially. Between 2010-2019, there were 611 tick records representing 1921 individual ticks. The most common hosts for reported ticks were domestic animals (n = 343, 56 %) followed by small wild mammals (n = 147, 24 %), humans (n = 49, 8%), and wild birds (n = 31, 5%). Less than 5% of records (n = 25) were of unattached ticks found in the environment. Since 2007, non-native tick species have been documented in the state every year, including Amblyomma americanum, Dermacentor andersoni, Dermacentor occidentalis, Dermacentor variabilis, Ixodes pacificus, Ixodes ricinus, Ixodes scapularis, Ixodes texanus, and Rhipicephalus sangui-neus sensu lato (s.l.). Almost half of the records (n = 68, 48 %) of non-native tick species from 2010 to 2019 represented ticks found on a host (usually a dog or a human) that had traveled outside of Alaska in the two weeks prior to collection. However, A. americanum, D. variabilis, I. pacificus, I. texanus, and R. sanguineus s.l. have been found on humans and domestic animals in Alaska without reported recent travel. In particular, there is evidence to suggest that there is local establishment of R. sanguineus s.l. in Alaska. A tick species historically found in the state, I. angustus was frequently found on human and dogs, suggesting a potential role as a bridge vector of pathogens. Given the inconsistency of tick monitoring in Alaska over the past century, it is difficult to draw many conclusions from temporal trends in the data. Continued monitoring through the Alaska Submit-A-Tick Program will allow a more accurate assessment of the changing risk of ticks and tick-borne diseases in the state and provide information for setting clinical and public health guidelines for tick-borne disease prevention.

TI  - Atmospheric phase screen estimation for land subsidence evaluation by InSAR time series analysis in Kurdistan, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric phase screen (APS) is one of the main error sources of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements. In order to accurately retrieve displacement fields, it is necessary to use advanced methods to eliminate the tropospheric effect of interferograms. In this paper, the land subsidence in Kurdistan province of Iran is investigated using Sentinel-1A acquisitions on a single track for the period 2014-2018. The accurate and applicable 3D ray tracing technique is used to accurately estimate the APS. The ERA-I reanalysis data generated by European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) are used to implement the 3D ray tracing technique. In order to determine the effect of using the 3D ray tracing technique, the APSs are also determined using a traditional approach called, spatiotemporal filters method. To evaluate the capability of the two methods, the results are compared with the weather research and forecasting model (WRF) model. Finally, the interferograms are corrected using APSs from 3D ray tracing technique and traditional method and the subsidence rate in the study area is computed. Comparing the subsidence rates obtained from two APS estimation methods with piezometric data, GPS and precise levelling observations shows that the 3D ray tracing technique is significantly more accurate than traditional method in computing InSAR displacement fields.

TI  - Land Subsidence Measurement of Jakarta Coastal Area Using Time Series Interferometry with Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Jakarta coastal area is a part of North Jakarta which has a boundary to the Java Sea. Coastal flood from the Java Sea was not a new case in North Jakarta, the situations occurred due to sea-level rise. The conditions of coastal flood in Jakarta can be worsening by land subsidence in Jakarta coastal area. The land subsidence in Jakarta coastal area was occurred in many years and detected by geodetic measurement methods such as GPS and leveling surveys. The study about land subsidence in Jakarta coastal area needed to be updated because it could affect the urban development. This study presents the mean vertical deformation map using Stanford Methods for Persistent Scatterer (StaMPS) for time-series analysis on the Sentinel-1 data archives in the period of March 2017 through April 2020 in both ascending and descending track. The comparison of mean vertical deformation map between two tracks shows a good correlation in terms of displacement patterns with slightly different in 4 individual chosen points that show a high deformation at rates between 30 mm/year and 40 mm/year. The area chosen in this study known as a reclaimed area and the subsidence occurred due to young alluvium consolidation that not supported the maximum compression from a lot of buildings. These approach methods in this study that using StaMPS could be used to monitor land subsidence from all-terrain.

TI  - EPICOVID19 protocol: repeated serological surveys on SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The first case of COVID-19 was reported in China in December 2019, and, as the virus has spread worldwide, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic. Estimates on the number of COVID-19 cases do not reflect it real magnitude as testing is limited. Population based data on the proportion of the population with antibodies is relevant for planning public health policies. We aim to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, presence of signs and symptoms of COVID-19, and adherence to isolation measures. A random sample comprising 133 sentinel cities from all states of the country will be selected. Three serological surveys, three weeks apart, will be conducted. The most populous municipality in each intermediate region of the country, defined by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, was chosen as sentinel city. In each city, 25 census tracts will be selected, and 10 households will be systematically sampled in each tract, totaling 33,250 participants. In each household, one inhabitant will be randomly selected to be interviewed and tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, using WONDFO SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test. By evaluating a representative sample of Brazilian sentinel sites, this study will provide essential information for the design of health policies.

TI  - Implementation of BFASTmonitor Algorithm on Google Earth Engine to Support Large-Area and Sub-Annual Change Monitoring Using Earth Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of abnormal changes on the earth's surface (e.g., forest disturbance) has improved greatly in recent years because of satellite remote sensing. However, high computational costs inherently associated with processing and analysis of satellite data often inhibit large-area and sub-annual monitoring. Normal seasonal variations also complicate the detection of abnormal changes at sub-annual scale in the time series of satellite data. Recently, however, computationally powerful platforms, such as the Google Earth Engine (GEE), have been launched to support large-area analysis of satellite data. Change detection methods with the capability to detect abnormal changes in time series data while accounting for normal seasonal variations have also been developed but are computationally intensive. Here, we report an implementation of BFASTmonitor (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend monitor) on GEE to support large-area and sub-annual change monitoring using satellite data available in GEE. BFASTmonitor is a data-driven unsupervised change monitoring approach that detects abnormal changes in time series data, with near real-time monitoring capabilities. Although BFASTmonitor has been widely used in forest cover loss monitoring, it is a generic change monitoring approach that can be used to monitor changes in a various time series data. Using Landsat time series for normalised difference moisture index (NDMI), we evaluated the performance of our GEE BFASTmonitor implementation (GEE BFASTmonitor) by detecting forest disturbance at three forest areas (humid tropical forest, dry tropical forest, and miombo woodland) while comparing it to the original R-based BFASTmonitor implementation (original BFASTmonitor). A map-to-map comparison showed that the spatial and temporal agreements on forest disturbance between the original and our GEE BFASTmonitor implementations were high. At each site, the spatial agreement was more than 97%, whereas the temporal agreement was over 94%. The high spatial and temporal agreement show that we have properly translated and implemented the BFASTmonitor algorithm on GEE. Naturally, due to different numerical solvers being used for regression model fitting in R and GEE, small differences could be observed in the outputs. These differences were most noticeable at the dry tropical forest and miombo woodland sites, where the forest exhibits strong seasonality. To make GEE BFASTmonitor accessible to non-technical users, we developed a web application with simplified user interface. We also created a JavaScript-based GEE BFASTmonitor package that can be imported as a module. Overall, our GEE BFASTmonitor implementation fills an important gap in large-area environmental change monitoring using earth observation data.

AB  - Background: It is unknown whether all thick melanomas share the same prognostic features. We present a large, multi-institutional study on thick melanoma, evaluating for factors prognostic of survival.Methods: We queried the database of the Sentinel Lymph Node Working Group for patients with thick melanoma (>4 mm) who had a sentinel lymph node biopsy from 1993 to 2018. Clinicopathologic characteristics were correlated with overall survival.Results: There were 1,235 patients with a median follow-up of 28 months. Median thickness was 5.9 mm, with 713, 356, and 166 cases having a thickness of >4 to 6, >6 to 10, and >10 mm, respectively. Ulceration was seen in 51.2% of cases, while sentinel lymph node metastases were seen in 439 of 1,235 (35.5%) cases. For melanomas >4 to 6 mm, age, thickness, ulceration, lymphovascular invasion, and sentinel lymph node metastasis were correlated with overall survival (all P < .05), but for melanomas >6 to 10 mm, only sex and sentinel lymph node metastasis were prognostic of overall survival (both P <.05). For melanomas >10 mm, only sentinel lymph node metastasis predicted overall survival on multivariable analyses (P < .05).Conclusion: Prognostic markers of overall survival for thick melanoma include thickness, ulceration, and sentinel lymph node metastasis, but also include other unique factors such as lymphovascular invasion. Moreover, certain prognostic markers for survival are associated with different subgroups of thick melanoma, which vary based on thickness group. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Automatic Shadow Detection for Multispectral Satellite Remote Sensing Images in Invariant Color Spaces
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Shadow often results in difficulties for subsequent image applications of multispectral satellite remote sensing images, like object recognition and change detection. With continuous improvement in both spatial and spectral resolutions of satellite remote sensing images, a more serious impact occurs on satellite remote sensing image interpretation due to the existence of shadow. Though various shadow detection methods have been developed, problems of both shadow omission and nonshadow misclassification still exist for detecting shadow well in high-resolution multispectral satellite remote sensing images. These shadow detection problems mainly include high small shadow omission and typical nonshadow misclassification (like bluish and greenish nonshadow misclassification, and large dark nonshadow misclassification). For further resolving these problems, a new shadow index is developed based on the analysis of the property difference between shadow and the corresponding nonshadow with several multispectral band components (i.e., near-infrared, red, green and blue components) and hue and intensity components in various invariant color spaces (i.e., HIS, HSV, CIELCh, YCbCr and YIQ), respectively. The shadow mask is further acquired by applying an optimal threshold determined automatically on the shadow index image. The final shadow image is further optimized with a definite morphological operation of opening and closing. The proposed algorithm is verified with many images from WorldView-3 and WorldView-2 acquired at different times and sites. The proposed algorithm performance is particularly evaluated by qualitative visual sense comparison and quantitative assessment of shadow detection results in comparative experiments with two WorldView-3 test images of Tripoli, Libya. Both the better visual sense and the higher overall accuracy (over 92% for the test image Tripoli-1 and approximately 91% for the test image Tripoli-2) of the experimental results together deliver the excellent performance and robustness of the proposed shadow detection approach for shadow detection of high-resolution multispectral satellite remote sensing images. The proposed shadow detection approach is promised to further alleviate typical shadow detection problems of high small shadow omission and typical nonshadow misclassification for high-resolution multispectral satellite remote sensing images.

TI  - A Method for Classifying Land and Ocean Area by Removing Sentinel-1 Speckle Noise
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In Korea, satellite image-based land cover maps are limited because they are based on time-consuming pixel value-based classification techniques. The main categories of land cover classification are water and land; therefore, synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images with high water reflectivity may be used to improve land cover map classification accuracy. In this study, C-band SAR images obtained by the Sentinel-1 satellite are used, which include various noises including speckle noise. To remove speckle noise, this paper applied Lee, Gamma, and Frost filters, and found that the Lee filter offered the best performance. By combining a stacking technique and the Lee filter, this paper successfully classified the target water system using image dichotomy and histogram analyses of the region of interest (ROI). The resulting land cover map showed 90 % accuracy compared to the pixel-based map, and comparison with the optical image showed that water coverage was effectively classified. This classification of forest reservoirs, which are difficult to distinguish in optical images, was rated as excellent. Thus, this speckle noise-removal technique will facilitate the improvement of land cover classification accuracy, particularly for flood boundaries and shorelines.

TI  - Construction of the Long-Term Global Surface Water Extent Dataset Based on Water-NDVI Spatio-Temporal Parameter Set
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland surface water is highly dynamic, seasonally and inter-annually, limiting the representativity of the water coverage information that is usually obtained at any single date. The long-term dynamic water extent products with high spatial and temporal resolution are particularly important to analyze the surface water change but unavailable up to now. In this paper, we construct a global water Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) spatio-temporal parameter set based on the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI. Employing the Google Earth Engine, we construct a new Global Surface Water Extent Dataset (GSWED) with coverage from 2000 to 2018, having an eight-day temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 250 m. The results show that: (1) the MODIS NDVI-based surface water mapping has better performance compared to other water extraction methods, such as the normalized difference water index, the modified normalized difference water index, and the OTSU (maximal between-cluster variance method). In addition, the water-NDVI spatio-temporal parameter set can be used to update surface water extent datasets after 2018 as soon as the MODIS data are updated. (2) We validated the GSWED using random water samples from the Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset and achieved an overall accuracy of 96% with a kappa coefficient of 0.9. The producer's accuracy and user's accuracy were 97% and 90%, respectively. The validated comparisons in four regions (Qinghai Lake, Selin Co Lake, Utah Lake, and Dead Sea) show a good consistency with a correlation value of above 0.9. (3) The maximum global water area reached 2.41 million km(2)between 2000 and 2018, and the global water showed a decreasing trend with a significance of P = 0.0898. (4) Analysis of different types of water area change regions (Selin Co Lake, Urmia Lake, Aral Sea, Chiquita Lake, and Dongting Lake) showed that the GSWED can not only identify the seasonal changes of the surface water area and abrupt changes of hydrological events but also reflect the long-term trend of the water changes. In addition, GSWED has better performance in wetland areas and shallow areas. The GSWED can be used for regional studies and global studies of hydrology, biogeochemistry, and climate models.

TI  - Evaluation of the in-orbit performance of the microwave temperature sounder onboard the FY-3D satellite using different radiative transfer models
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - The in-orbit performance of the Microwave Temperature Sounder (MWTS) onboard the Fengyun-3D (FY3D) satellite is evaluated using the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) and the Radiative Transfer for the Television Infrared Observation Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder (RTTOV) model. Both radio-occultation data from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) Data Analysis and Archive Center and ERA-Interim analysis data from the European centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts are taken as inputs to the two fast radiative transfer models. The radio-occultation data are quality controlled and the collocation criterion between the radio-occultation data and the MWTS measurements is defined such that the spatial and temporal difference is <50 km and <3 h, respectively. The biases of MWTS channels 5-10 produced by both CRTM and RTTOV agree well over the oceans under clear sky conditions between 60 degrees S and 60 degrees N from July to December 2018. The mean biases simulated by the radio-occultation and ERA-Interim data are negative and the absolute values of the biases are <0.6 and <1.5 K for channels 5-10 of the MWTS, respectively. The biases at channels 4 and 11 between the CRTM and RTTOV simulations are inconsistent and require further investigation of the transmittance difference between the fast models. The standard deviation of the biases from the radio-occultation and ERA-Interim data are <0.5 and <1.8 K for the limited amount of collocated radio-occultation data. Asymmetrical patterns are detected for the MWTS through the scan angle-dependent bias. The long-term mean MWTS bias shows only a weak dependence on latitude, which suggests that biases do not vary systematically with brightness temperature. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improving Reservoir Outflow Estimation for Ungauged Basins Using Satellite Observations and a Hydrological Model
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, most of rivers globally are regulated by dams and reservoirs, which have substantially altered natural streamflow regimes. Understanding the impacts of these dams and reservoirs on streamflow is essential for water resources management. In situ reservoir release data or actual reservoir operating rules are difficult to obtain, particularly for transboundary rivers, resulting in the tremendous difficulty of simulating exact reservoir behaviors. This study aims to use easy-to-obtain satellite observations combined with a distributed hydrological model to estimate reservoir releases at the daily time scale. The developed Satellite-Based Reservoir routing Scheme (SBRS) was applied to two individual reservoirs in the United States and Thailand and cascade reservoirs on the Lancang River in China. The normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), correlation coefficient (CC), and hydrographs of daily regulated streamflow simulations were used to assess the performance of the reservoir release simulations. The SBRS was compared with four other global reservoir operation schemes and showed better overall performance with higherCCand lowerNRMSE. In addition, the SBRS performed better for the individual reservoirs (CC > 0.6,NRMSE < 0.2) than the cascade reservoirs, which is attributed to the uncertainty in the simulation of inflow and reservoir storage changes and to the lack of remote sensing data for all the cascade reservoirs. This study explores the potential of satellite observations combined with hydrological modeling in elucidating reservoir behaviors in ungauged and/or transboundary river basins. A better understanding of reservoir behaviors serves as a basis for water resources management and provides a more cooperative environment for all stakeholders of a basin.

TI  - A novel use of the leukocyte coping capacity assay to assess the immunomodulatory effects of organohalogenated contaminants in avian wildlife
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Apex predators are characterized by high levels of biomagnifying organohalogenated contaminants (OHCs) which have been found to induce detrimental health effects in wildlife, such as immune system impairment. The leukocyte coping capacity (LCC) assay is a functional real-time measure of an innate immune response essential in pathogen resistance, known as the respiratory burst. The current study suggests the novel use of this tool to WA whether OHCs impair the innate immune system of a sentinel top predator, the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla; WTE). The LCC analysis was performed in the field on WTE nestlings (n = 84) from northern Norway over two breeding seasons. Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) dominated the total OHC load, surpassing the levels of legacy organochlorines. In addition, we detected significant negative correlations between concentrations of all polychlorinated biphenyls, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, perfluorohexane sulfonic acid and long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids and the LCC of WTE nestlings. Based on our current findings reflecting a potential negative effect of both emerging and legacy OHCs on innate immune capacity, we suggest LCC to be a relevant and accessible WA expanding the ecotoxicological toolbox to assess sub-lethal effects of OHCs in apex avian wildlife.

TI  - Transfer Learning for Crop classification with Cropland Data Layer data (CDL) as training samples
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Training samples is fundamental for crop mapping from remotely sensed images, but difficult to acquire in many regions through ground survey, causing significant challenge for crop mapping in these regions. In this paper, a transfer learning (TL) workflow is proposed to use the classification model trained in contiguous U.S.A. (CONUS) to identify crop types in other regions. The workflow is based on fact that same crop growing in different regions of world has similar temporal growth pattern. This study selected high confidence pixels across CONUS in the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and corresponding 30-m 15-day composited NDVI time series generated from harmonized Landat-8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data as training samples, trained the Random Forest (RF) classification models and then applied the models to identify crop types in three test regions, namely Hengshui in China (HS), Alberta in Canada (AB), and Nebraska in USA (NE). NDVI time series with different length were used to identify crops, the effect of time-series length on classification accuracies were then evaluated. Furthermore, local training samples in the three test regions were collected and used to identify crops (LO) for comparison. Results showed that overall classification accuracies in HS, AB and NE were 97.79%, 86.45% and 94.86%, respectively, when using TL with NDVI time series of the entire growing season for classification. However, LO could achieve higher classification accuracies earlier than TL. Because the training samples were collected across USA containing multiple growth conditions, it increased the potential that the crop growth environment in test regions could be similar to those of the training samples; but also led to situation that different crops had similar NDVI time series, which caused lower TL classification accuracy in HS at early-season. Generally, this study provides new options for crop classification in regions of training samples shortage.

TI  - Applying Multi-Temporal Landsat Satellite Data and Markov-Cellular Automata to Predict Forest Cover Change and Forest Degradation of Sundarban Reserve Forest, Bangladesh
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Overdependence on and exploitation of forest resources have significantly transformed the natural reserve forest of Sundarban, which shares the largest mangrove territory in the world, into a great degradation status. By observing these, a most pressing concern is how much degradation occurred in the past, and what will be the scenarios in the future if they continue? To confirm the degradation status in the past decades and reveal the future trend, we took Sundarban Reserve Forest (SRF) as an example, and used satellite Earth observation historical Landsat imagery between 1989 and 2019 as existing data and primary data. Moreover, a geographic information system model was considered to estimate land cover (LC) change and spatial health quality of the SRF from 1989 to 2029 based on the large and small tree categories. The maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) technique was employed to classify the historical images with five different LC types, which were further considered for future projection (2029) including trends based on 2019 simulation results from 1989 and 2019 LC maps using the Markov-cellular automata model. The overall accuracy achieved was 82.30%similar to 90.49% with a kappa value of 0.75 similar to 0.87. The historical result showed forest degradation in the past (1989-2019) of 4773.02 ha yr(-1), considered as great forest degradation (GFD) and showed a declining status when moving with the projection (2019-2029) of 1508.53 ha yr(-1) and overall there was a decline of 3956.90 ha yr(-1) in the 1989-2029 time period. Moreover, the study also observed that dense forest was gradually degraded (good to bad) but, conversely, light forest was enhanced, which will continue in the future even to 2029 if no effective management is carried out. Therefore, by observing the GFD, through spatial forest health quality and forest degradation mapping and assessment, the study suggests a few policies that require the immediate attention of forest policy-makers to implement them immediately and ensure sustainable development in the SRF.

TI  - A Spectral-Aware Convolutional Neural Network for Pansharpening
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening aims at fusing a low-resolution multiband optical (MBO) image, such as a multispectral or a hyperspectral image, with the associated high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image to yield a high spatial resolution MBO image. Though having achieved superior performances to traditional methods, existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based pansharpening approaches are still faced with two challenges: alleviating the phenomenon of spectral distortion and improving the interpretation abilities of pansharpening CNNs. In this work, we develop a novel spectral-aware pansharpening neural network (SA-PNN). On the one hand, SA-PNN employs a network structure composed of a detail branch and an approximation branch, which is consistent with the detail injection framework; on the other hand, SA-PNN strengthens processing along the spectral dimension by using a spectral-aware strategy, which involves spatial feature transforms (SFTs) coupling the approximation branch with the detail branch as well as 3D convolution operations in the approximation branch. Our method is evaluated with experiments on real-world multispectral and hyperspectral datasets, verifying its excellent pansharpening performance.

TI  - Normal Faulting in the 2020 Mw 6.2 Yutian Event: Implications for Ongoing E-W Thinning in Northern Tibet
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensional earthquakes in the Tibetan Plateau play an important role in the plateau's orogenic evolution and cause heavy seismic hazard, yet their mechanisms remain poorly known, in particular in harsh northern Tibet. On 25 June 2020, a Mw 6.2 earthquake struck Yutian, Xinjiang, offering us a rare chance to gain insights into its mechanism and implications in the Tibetan extension. We used both descending and ascending Sentinel-1 images to generate coseismic deformation associated with this event, which indicates a typical extensional mechanism with a maximum subsidence displacement of 25 cm and minor uplift. The causative fault constrained with interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data based on a finite fault model suggests that the fault plane has a strike of 186.4 degrees and westward dip of 64.8 degrees, and the main rupture is concentrated at a depth of 3.6-10.8 km with a peak slip of 0.85 m. Our source model indicates that the 2020 Yutian event ruptured an unknown high-angle blind normal fault with N-S striking. The total released geodetic moment yields 2.69 x 10(18) N center dot m, equivalent to Mw 6.23. We used dense interseismic global positioning system (GPS) measurements to reveal an approximate 7 mm/yr extensional motion in the Yutian region, but it still does not seem large enough to support high local seismicity for normal events within 12 years, i.e., Mw 7.1 in 2008, Mw 6.2 in 2012, and this event in 2020. Combined with Coulomb stress change modeling, we speculate that the seismicity in Yutian is related to the lower lithospheric dynamics.

TI  - Highly Local Model Calibration with a New GEDI LiDAR Asset on Google Earth Engine Reduces Landsat Forest Height Signal Saturation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - While Landsat has proved to be effective for monitoring many elements of forest condition and change, the platform has well-documented limitations in measuring forest structure, the vertical distribution of the canopy. This is important because structure determines several key ecosystem functions, including: carbon storage; habitat suitability; and timber volume. Canopy structure is directly measured by LiDAR, and it should be possible to train Landsat structure models at a highly local scale with the dense, global sample of full waveform LiDAR observations collected by NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI). Local models are expected to perform better because: (a) such models may take advantage of localized correlations between structure and canopy surface reflectance; and (b) to the extent that models revert to the mean of the calibration data due to a lack of discrimination, local models will revert to a more representative mean. We tested Landsat-based relative height predictions using a new GEDI asset on Google Earth Engine, described here. Mean prediction error declined by 23% and important prediction biases at the extremes of the range of canopy height dropped as model calibration became more local, minimizing forest structure signal saturation commonly associated with Landsat and other passive optical sensors. Our results suggest that Landsat-based maps of structural variables such as height and biomass may substantially benefit from the kind of local calibration that GEDI's dense sample of LiDAR data supports.

TI  - Armed conflict and land-use changes: Insights from Iraq-Iran war in Zagros forests
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of armed conflicts on land use/cover changes (LUCC), especially in Zagros forests of Iran, remains ambiguous after 30 years of the Iraq-Iran war. Our goal in this study was to assess LUCC in Sardasht related to the Iraq-Iran war in a 22 year period (1976-1998). LUCC of Sardasht city was evaluated using Landsat satellite image time series of MSS and TM data. We classified multi-temporal Landsat imagery using Random Forest classifier, then Land Change Modeler (LCM) was used to change detection and analysis. Change detection results showed that during 1976-1998, 5363.37 ha of forest areas were declined and converted to the croplands, rangelands and built-up areas. The highest decrease of forest areas was in periods of before (1976-1984) and after the war (1988-1993 and 1993-1998), 1331, 1734, and 2066 ha, respectively. While, during the war (1984-1988), only 54 ha decrease has taken place in forest lands of Sardasht. Also, increasing in other land uses during this period was significantly less than other periods. Calculation of annual rate of deforestation showed that the period of 1993-1998, has the highest rate of degradation in forest areas with a rate of - 0.45%. While, during and before the war, it was - 0.01% and - 0.20%, respectively. With the start of the war, residents of the region migrated to safe areas. The result of this migration was reducing forest conversion to other land uses. Trends in deforestation and forest degradation intensified after the end of the war. The causes of this destruction were destroying regulatory and control infrastructure on forests and natural resources in addition to the return of the inhabitants and an increase in demand for food and agricultural development. Moreover, after the war, the attention of the government was towards supplying the needs of human societies. Therefore, not enough attention was paid to monitoring and controlling over the degradation of natural resources. It is therefore necessary to reduce residents' dependence on natural resources through accurate and detailed planning and to increase their participation in forest conservation. In this regard, conservation programs should be continued strongly.

TI  - Person-oriented citizenship education in public secondary education
T2  - TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
M3  - Article
AB  - The generation of young people growing up in this challenging and ever-changing 21st-century society needs a solid foundation, and meaningful framework to participate in Dutch society as a resilient, responsible and conscious person. Young people need time and space to develop their own identity through thinking about values, norms and motives. They also need this to reflect on what gives meaning and direction to life. This is exactly what worldview education is all about.A worldview is a coherent set of ideas, experiences, values and images that a person develops about themselves, about living together with others, and about the world. Everyone has a perspective on life and this perspective is influenced by cultures, religion, or other (more secular) worldviews such as humanism. When we talk about worldview education, we distinguish two components. The first component is knowledge about and from different religions and worldviews. The second component is the development of a personal worldview and the unfolding of ones own identity.Worldview education is important because it helps young people to develop a moral compass that gives direction and meaning to life. Furthermore, it gives them roots which empower them in today's challenging society. All schools should recognise the relevance of worldview education and should give structural attention to this subject in their vision and curriculum. In the Netherlands, confessional secondary education offers worldview education as school subject "levensbeschouwing" (worldview education) or "godsdienst" (religious education). Most public secondary schools, however, do not offer any worldview education.Two reasons explain why most public secondary schools do not offer worldview education. First, Dutch public schools are established and managed by the government. The Dutch government has a neutral attitude towards certain topics such as religion, identity and worldview. Public education adopted this neutral attitude and substantiated this by arguing that all forms of confessional worldview education should take place outside of public education. This is called the active neutral attitude of public education. Second, worldview education is associated with (confessional) religious education and this association consists out of two parts: the religious identity of confessional schools (which is where confessional worldview education is taught) and the teaching of one specific religion in these schools (instead of learning about and from different religions and worldviews).However, we want to argue that public education still does justice to its identity and assignment when offering worldview education in an active pluralistic way. Public schools claim to be a meeting place for children with different backgrounds because every student, regardless of belief culture, or other background, is welcome at a public school. This diversity is a distinctive aspect of the identity of a public school. Worldview education pays attention to this diversity and teaches about different religions and worldviews that play a role in society. Giving equal attention to different cultures, religions and worldviews is more "neutral" than giving preference to a secular vision where none of these subjects are taught.Apart from the above, the government has given public education the obligatory task that is called "active pluralism", which means that public schools have to pay attention to diversity in society, that students have to reflect critically on their own worldview, and that they should discuss different religions and worldviews with respect and without prejudice. One could say that, because of its identity and assignment, public education in particular is the place where worldview education should have a structural place. We argue that worldview education could have this structural place in public education by connecting worldview education to citizenship education.Citizenship education consists of three different domains: democracy, participation and identity. Worldview education is interwoven with all of these three domains, but especially with the domain "identity" and is, therefore, an essential part of citizenship education. Based on these three domains of citizenship education, two substantive aspects of citizenship education can be distinguished: society-oriented citizenship education (based on the democracy domain) and person-oriented citizenship education (based on the identity domain). Participation is an important part of both domains and an overall purpose of citizenship education and can, therefore, be seen as the overarching domain.Person-oriented citizenship education is about identity development and consists of five different elements: worldview and religious literacy, meaning-giving, personhood formation, active encounter and critical thinking. This means that person-oriented citizenship education overlaps with worldview education. Therefore, person-oriented citizenship education is the solution for public secondary schools to offer worldview education. Person-oriented citizenship education offers important elements of worldview education, and has no association with learning in a specific religion or with confessional schools. Furthermore, this education is in line with the identity and task of public secondary schools.In conclusion: it is important that public secondary schools give structural attention to person-oriented citizenship education. This can be done in two ways. First of all, it should be part of the school policy and, therefore, in public secondary schools person-oriented citizenship education ought to be accommodated in the vision, mission and goals of the school. Secondly, person-oriented citizenship education should get a structural place in the curriculum of the school as an independent subject, or as part of other already existing related subjects.

TI  - Calibrating Geosynchronous and Polar Orbiting Satellites: Sharing Best Practices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth remote sensing optical satellite systems are often divided into two categories-geosynchronous and sun-synchronous. Geosynchronous systems essentially rotate with the Earth and continuously observe the same region of the Earth. Sun-synchronous systems are generally in a polar orbit and view differing regions of the Earth at the same local time. Although similar in instrument design, there are enough differences in these two types of missions that often the calibration of the instruments can be substantially different. Thus, respective calibration teams develop independent methods and do not interact regularly or often. Yet, there are numerous areas of overlap and much to learn from one another. To address this issue, a panel of experts from both types of systems was convened to discover common areas of concern, areas where improvements can be made, and recommendations for the future. As a result of the panelist's efforts, a set of eight recommendations were developed. Those that are related to improvements of current technologies include maintaining sun-synchronous orbits (not allowing orbital decay), standardization of spectral bandpasses, and expanded use of well-developed calibration techniques such as deep convective clouds, pseudo invariant calibration sites, and lunar methodologies. New techniques for expanded calibration capability include using geosynchronous instruments as transfer radiometers, continued development of ground-based prelaunch calibration technologies, expansion of RadCalNet, and development of space-based calibration radiometer systems.

TI  - Improvement of the soil-atmosphere interactions and subsequent heavy precipitation modelling by enhanced initialization using remotely sensed 1 km soil moisture information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the impact of an improved soil moisture (SM) initialization using direct insertion methodology for convection-resolving modelling of heavy precipitation events (HPEs). State-of-the-art 1 km SM data from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, SMOS-BEC L4 version 3 are used for this purpose. A strategy is developed to prepare the SMOS-L4 surface soil moisture (SSM) product for the COnsortium for Small-scale MOdelling (COSMO) model initialization by applying a cumulative density function (CDF)-matching biascorrection and the exponential filter method to calculate corresponding SM profiles (L4-Expo). The processed satellite-derived product is validated with 38 observing sites from three in-situ SM networks REMEDHUS (19), SMOSMANIA (11) and VAS (8). All networks measure at a soil depth of 5 cm, only at the SMOSMANIA network additional measurements at 10, 20 and 30 cm are available. Four HPEs are selected to evaluate the impact of the high-resolution realistic initialization. The results show a high agreement index (AI = 0.91) and a low root-mean-square deviation (0.03 m(3)/m(3)) of the high-resolution, bias-corrected SMOS-L4 SSM product compared to in-situ observations. Moreover, the derived L4-Expo SM profile field agrees with ground-based observations and successfully removes the wet bias of the original COSMO simulated SM profile. Enhanced SM initialization with the SMOS-L4 SM derived profiles improves precipitation modelling in all selected HPEs as a consequence of improved near-surface 2 m-temperature and induced changes in the pressure field (-0.5 hPa), atmospheric humidity distribution (dqs = 5-15%) as well as wind circulations (dw(700hPa) = 25%), thus convergence/divergence fields. The sensitivity study, applying the same methodology for SM initialization for a SMOS-L3 (similar to 25 km), shows a weaker improvement of the precipitation forecast of an analysed HPE than the 1 km SMOS-4 product. Our results highlight the benefit of high-resolution SSM remote sensing satellite data for scientific disciplines like meteorology in overcoming present limitations such as the uncertainty associated to SM initialization in models.

TI  - Mapping pervasive selective logging in the south-west Brazilian Amazon 2000-2019
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests harbour the highest biodiversity on the planet and are essential to human livelihoods and the global economy. However continued loss and degradation of forested landscapes, coupled with a rapidly rising global population, is placing incredible pressure on forests globally. The United Nations has developed the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD +) programme in response to the challenges facing tropical forests and in recognition of the role they can play in climate mitigation. REDD + requires consistent and reliable monitoring of forests, however, national-level methodologies for measuring degradation are often bespoke and, because of an inability to track degradation effectively, the majority of countries combine reporting for deforestation and forest degradation into a single value. Here, we extend a recent analysis that enabled the detection of selective logging at the scale of a logging concession to a regional-scale estimation of selective logging activities. We utilized logging records from across Brazil to train a supervised classification algorithm for detecting logged pixels in Landsat imagery then predicted the extent of logging over a 20 year period throughout Rondonia, Brazil. Approximately one-quarter of the forested lands in Rondonia were cleared between 2000 and 2019. We estimate that 11.0% of the forest area present in 2000 had been selectively logged by 2019, comprising >11 500 km(2)of forest. In general, rates of selective logging were twice as high in the first decade relative to the last decade of the period. Our approach is a considerable advance in developing an operationalized selective logging monitoring system capable of detecting subtle forest disturbances over large spatial scales.

TI  - Pathogenicity of West Nile Virus Lineage 1 to German Poultry
T2  - VACCINES
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus that originates from Africa and at present causes neurological disease in birds, horses, and humans all around the globe. As West Nile fever is an important zoonosis, the role of free-ranging domestic poultry as a source of infection for humans should be evaluated. This study examined the pathogenicity of an Italian WNV lineage 1 strain for domestic poultry (chickens, ducks, and geese) held in Germany. All three species were subcutaneously injected with WNV, and the most susceptible species was also inoculated via mosquito bite. All species developed various degrees of viremia, viral shedding (oropharyngeal and cloacal), virus accumulation, and pathomorphological lesions. Geese were most susceptible, displaying the highest viremia levels. The tested waterfowl, geese, and especially ducks proved to be ideal sentinel species for WNV due to their high antibody levels and relatively low blood viral loads. None of the three poultry species can function as a reservoir/amplifying host for WNV, as their viremia levels most likely do not suffice to infect feeding mosquitoes. Due to the recent appearance of WNV in Germany, future pathogenicity studies should also include local virus strains.

TI  - Comparing Sentinel-1 and-2 Data and Indices for Agricultural Land Use Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural vegetation development and harvest date monitoring over large areas requires frequent remote sensing observations. In regions with persistent cloud coverage during the vegetation season this is only feasible with active systems, such as SAR, and is limited for optical data. To date, optical remote sensing vegetation indices are more frequently used to monitor agricultural vegetation status because they are easily processed, and the characteristics are widely known. This study evaluated the correlations of three Sentinel-2 optical indices with Sentinel-1 SAR indices over agricultural areas to gain knowledge about their relationship. We compared Sentinel-2 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Water Index, and Plant Senescence Radiation Index with Sentinel-1 SAR VV and VH backscatter, VH/VV ratio, and Sentinel-1 Radar Vegetation Index. The study was conducted on 22 test sites covering approximately 35,000 ha of four different main European agricultural land use types, namely grassland, maize, spring barley, and winter wheat, in Lower Saxony, Germany, in 2018. We investigated the relationship between Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 indices for each land use type considering three phenophases (growing, green, senescence). The strength of the correlations of optical and SAR indices differed among land use type and phenophase. There was no generic correlation between optical and SAR indices in our study. However, when the data were split by land use types and phenophases, the correlations increased remarkably. Overall, the highest correlations were found for the Radar Vegetation Index and VH backscatter. Correlations for grassland were lower than for the other land use types. Adding auxiliary data to a multiple linear regression analysis revealed that, in addition to land use type and phenophase information, the lower quartile and median SAR values per field, and a spatial variable, improved the models. Other auxiliary data retrieved from a digital elevation model, Sentinel-1 orbit direction, soil type information, and other SAR values had minor impacts on the model performance. In conclusion, despite the different nature of the signal generation, there were distinct relationships between optical and SAR indices which were independent of environmental variables but could be stratified by land use type and phenophase. These relationships showed similar patterns across different test sites. However, a regional clustering of landscapes would significantly improve the relationships.

T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the problem of semi-supervised transfer learning with limited cross-modality data in remote sensing. A large amount of multi-modal earth observation images, such as multispectral imagery (MSI) or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, are openly available on a global scale, enabling parsing global urban scenes through remote sensing imagery. However, their ability in identifying materials (pixel-wise classification) remains limited, due to the noisy collection environment and poor discriminative information as well as limited number of well-annotated training images. To this end, we propose a novel cross-modal deep-learning framework, called X-ModalNet, with three well-designed modules: self-adversarial module, interactive learning module, and label propagation module, by learning to transfer more discriminative information from a small-scale hyperspectral image (HSI) into the classification task using a large-scale MSI or SAR data. Significantly, XModalNet generalizes well, owing to propagating labels on an updatable graph constructed by high-level features on the top of the network, yielding semi-supervised cross-modality learning. We evaluate X-ModalNet on two multi-modal remote sensing datasets (HSI-MSI and HSI-SAR) and achieve a significant improvement in comparison with several state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - MULTITEMPORAL HISTOGRAM MATCHING - A NEW APPROACH OF MOSS AND LICHEN CHANGE DETECTION FROM LANDSAT IN DATA-POOR ANTARCTICA ENVIRONMENTS
T2  - JURNAL TEKNOLOGI-SCIENCES & ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosses and lichens are important components of Antarctic ecosystems. Maps of these vegetation are needed to improve our understanding of ecosystem dynamics. This requires species distribution to be mapped repeatedly over time, a critical task that becomes extremely challenging in data-poor Antarctic regions, where the lack of field data, logistics, coupled with scarcity of cloud free, quality multitemporal Landsat imagery are major intrinsic constraints to time-series analysis for change detection. This study firstly analyzes the spectral curves of moss and lichen generated by field-based spectroradiometer and then proposes an innovative histogram matching technique where historical Landsat data is modified such that its histogram matches that of present (reference) dataset. This has made it possible to mapping multitemporal Landsat data in the Antarctic Peninsula. The results demonstrate an overall accuracy of 90.5%. Mapping of Arctic vegetation facilitated by histogram matching of Landsat image, according to the results, seems to be an advisable image processing technique for application in a data-poor context.

TI  - Land reclamation and risk assessment in the coastal zone of China from 2000 to 2010
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and assessing of land reclamation are essential components of sustainable coastal management. In this study, satellite remote sensing data were used in combination with ground investigations to systematically obtain land reclamation data for the coastal zone of China from 2000-2010. Then, the spatiotemporal variation in land reclamation and morphology of the coastal zone was analyzed. Furthermore, a spatially explicit habitat risk assessment (HRA) model from the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST 3.0) suite of tools was adopted to evaluate the risk posed by land reclamation to key coastal habitats over these ten years. Our results show that (1) the overall land reclamation intensity was higher in the north and lower in the south. At the Sea Region level, both the sea-filling area and tidal flat reclamation area in the Bohai Sea were higher than those of the other three sea regions. At the province level, Hebei, Jiangsu and Tianjin provinces were the top three in sea-filling reclamation, while Liaoning, Jiangsu and Shandong exhibited the greatest increases in tidal flat reclamation; (2) 31.2% of land reclamation happened in the natural coastal zone, reducing natural coastlines from 54.6% to 44.1% between 2000 and 2010; (3) land reclamation posed a great risk to important coastal habitats. Half of the tidal flat and 5% of the mangrove habitats experienced a high risk from tidal flat reclamation and sea filling, while 43.1% of saline meadows were at high risk, mainly from agricultural development and industrial construction. We argue that regional development strategies played important roles in stimulating land reclamation from 2000-2010. Considering multiple social and ecological functions of the coastal zone, trade-offs between land reclamation and ecosystem conservation should be recognized. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Satellites HY-1C and Landsat 8 Combined to Observe the Influence of Bridge on Sea Surface Temperature and Suspended Sediment Concentration in Hangzhou Bay, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the influence of a cross-sea bridge on the sea surface temperature (SST) and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) of Hangzhou Bay based on landsat8_TIRS data and HY-1C data using an improved single window algorithm to retrieve the SST and an empirical formula to retrieve the SSC. In total, 375 paired sampling points and 70 transects were taken to compare the SST upstream and downstream of the bridge, and nine transects were taken to compare the SSC. The results show the following. (i) In summer, when the current flows through the bridge pier, the downstream SST of the bridge decreases significantly, with a range of 3.5%; in winter, generally, the downstream SST decreases but does not change as obviously as in summer. The downstream SSC increases obviously. (ii) The range of influence of the bridge pier on the downstream SST is about 0.3-4.0 km in width from the bridge and that on the downstream SSC is approximately 0.3-6.0 km. (iii) When the current flows around the pier, a portion of the flow is dispersed in upward and downward directions; the downward flow generates local scour. When the scouring at the front end of the pier stops, the upward flow behind the pier brings the sediment and the bottom cold water downstream, causing the downstream SST to decrease and the SSC to increase. (iv) The other portion passes around the pier, which generates a wake vortex. Once a wake vortex is released, a low-pressure center appears, sucking the sediment and the bottom cold water to the downstream sea surface, reducing the downstream SST and raising the SSC. (v) The range of reduction of the SST downstream of the bridge is shorter than the range of increase in the SSC. This is because the wake vortices have an effect in the 0.3-4.0 km downstream but not in the 4.0-6.0 km. Therefore, the SST and SSC are affected within the range of 0.3-4.0 km by wake vortices, while in the 4.0-6.0 km region, the SSC is still high due to the transport of sediment by currents.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy should be considered for clinically node-negative breast cancer regardless of <i>BRCA1</i>/<i>2</i> mutation status
T2  - ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: BRCA1/2 mutations lead to an elevated risk of breast cancer. None involved in whether BRCA1/2 mutation status will affect the first decision-making of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy or not for clinically node-negative breast cancer. We retrospectively investigated whether BRCA1/2 mutation status influenced SLN involvement rate and survival outcomes after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for Chinese clinically node-negative breast cancer patients.Methods: Patients who underwent SLNB at initial were enrolled and divided according to BRCA1/2 mutation status. Germline DNA for BRCA1/2 testing was derived from blood samples. SLN involvement rate and clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed using the Chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to compare survival between groups.Results: According to BRCA1/2 mutation test criteria, 156 Chinese women receiving initial SLNB with clinically node-negative breast cancer were selected-thirty-one patients identified as BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and 102 as non-carriers were enrolled. Non-carriers seemed to be with a more advanced TNM stage (P<0.01) compared to the non-carrier group. Once SLN involved, the patient will receive axillary lymph node dissection in which BRCA1/2 mutation did not increase the rate (P=0.73). Disease-free survival (DFS) (P=0.48) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P=0.79) are comparable between groups, even after adjustment for clinicopathological characteristics, systemic treatment, and surgical management of breast [DFS, hazard ratio (HR) =1.63, confidence interval (CI): 0.48-5.54, P=0.43; RFS, HR =0.75, CI: 0.14-3.89, P=0.73].Conclusions: SLNB should be considered for clinically node-negative breast cancer regardless of BRCA1/2 status.

TI  - A carbon monitoring system for mapping regional, annual aboveground biomass across the northwestern USA
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a prototype Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) developed to produce regionally unbiased annual estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB). Our CMS employed a bottom-up, two-step modeling strategy beginning with a spatially and temporally biased sample: project datasets collected and contributed by US Forest Service (USFS) and other forestry stakeholders in 29 different project areas in the northwestern USA. Plot-level AGB estimates collected in the project areas served as the response variable for predicting AGB primarily from lidar metrics of canopy height and density (R-2= 0.8, RMSE = 115 Mg ha(-1), Bias = 2 Mg ha(-1)). This landscape model was used to map AGB estimates at 30 m resolution where lidar data were available. A stratified random sample of AGB pixels from these landscape-level AGB maps then served as training data for predicting AGB regionally from Landsat image time series variables processed through LandTrendr. In addition, climate metrics calculated from downscaled 30 year climate normals were considered as predictors in both models, as were topographic metrics calculated from elevation data; these environmental predictors allowed AGB estimation over the full range of observations with the regional model (R-2= 0.8, RMSE = 152 Mg ha(-1), Bias = 9 Mg ha(-1)), including higher AGB values (>400 Mg ha(-1)) where spectral predictors alone saturate. For both the landscape and regional models, the machine-learning algorithm Random Forests (RF) was consistently applied to select predictor variables and estimate AGB. We then calibrated the regional AGB maps using field plot data systematically collected without bias by the national Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program. We found both our project landscape and regional, annual AGB estimates to be unbiased with respect to FIA estimates (Biases of 1% and 0.7%, respectively) and conclude that they are well suited to inform forest management and planning decisions by our contributing stakeholders. Social media abstract Lidar-based biomass estimates can be upscaled with Landsat data to regionally unbiased annual maps.

TI  - Comparison of the Sentinel-3A and B SLSTR Tandem Phase Data Using Metrological Principles
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-3 mission is part of the Copernicus programme space segment and has the objective of making global operational observations of ocean, land and atmospheric parameters with its four on-board sensors. Two Sentinel-3 satellites are currently on orbit, providing near-daily global coverage. Sentinel-3A was launched on 16 February 2016 and Sentinel-3B on 25 April 2018. For the early part of its operation, Sentinel-3B flew in tandem with Sentinel-3A, flying 30 s ahead of its twin mission. This provided a unique opportunity to compare the instruments on the two satellites, and to test the per pixel uncertainty values in a metrologically-robust manner. In this work, we consider the tandem-phase data from the infrared channels of one of the on-board instruments: the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer, SLSTR. A direct comparison was made of both the Level 1 radiance values and the Level 2 sea surface temperature values derived from those radiances. At Level 1, the distribution of differences between the sensor values were compared to the declared uncertainties for data gridded on to a regular latitude-longitude grid with propagated pixel uncertainties. The results showed good overall radiometric agreement between the two sensors, with mean differences of similar to 0.06 K, although there was a scene-temperature dependent difference for the oblique view that was consistent with what was expected from a stray light effect observed pre-flight. We propose a means to correct for this effect based on the tandem data. Level 1 uncertainties were found to be representative of the variance of the data, expect in those channels affected by the stray light effect. The sea surface temperature results show a very small difference between the sensors that could be in part due to the fact that the Sentinel-3A retrieval coefficients were also applied to the Sentinel-3B retrieval because the Sentinel-3B coefficients are not currently available. This will lead to small errors between the S3A and S3B retrievals. The comparison also suggests that the retrieval uncertainties may need updating for two of the retrieval processes that there are extra components of uncertainty related the quality level and the probability of cloud that should be included. Finally, a study of the quality flags assigned to sea surface temperature pixel values provided valuable insight into the origin of those quality levels and highlighted possible uncertainties in the defined quality level.

T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates land use change within the upper catchment area of Ala river, Akure, Ondo State over a period of 31 years (1986-2017) using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) 5 of 1986, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) 7 of 2002, and Landsat 8 OLI / TIRS of 2017. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface runoff and terrain configuration within the study area were analysed using ArcGIS 10.5 software. Three land use types were identified namely; built up, vegetation and bareland/outcrop. The built up covered 29.39 % in 1986 and increased to 43.64% in 2017. Vegetation revealed a reverse trend with a continuous decline from 49.21% in 1986 to 14.16% in 2017 while bareland/outcrop increased from 19.60% in 1986 to 42.20% in 2017. The NDVI values range between -0.03 and 0.4; -0.3 and 0.3; and 0.04 and 0.3 in 1986, 2002, 2017, respectively as an indicator of vegetation degradation. The analysis showed that the study area has been considerably degraded, mainly due to the depletion of vegetation and uncontrolled urbanization process. It is therefore recommended that the government through its physical planning agency, put in place effective control mechanism to guide physical development that will enhance sustainable development in the study area and other parts of the town.

TI  - Object-based land use/land cover change detection of a coastal city using Multi-Source Imagery: a case study of Lagos, Nigeria
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the wake of the burgeoning population, socio-economic and environmental issues facing coastal areas, LULC change detection has become an essential tool for environmental monitoring towards achieving sustainable development. In this study, an object-based image analysis approach using post-classification comparison technique was applied for assessing the LULC of the coastal city of Lagos from 1986 to 2016. The study describes how satellite imagery from different sources (Landsat and SENTINEL 2A) can be successfully integrated for Land use Land cover change detection. The results show that between 1986 and 2016, there were net increases in bare areas, built-up areas, and shrublands and a general decline in forestlands, waterbodies and wetlands. Over 60,000ha cover (approx. 190% increase) was converted into built-up areas while 83,541ha (835.4km(2)) of forestland were lost, suggesting high rates of urbanization and corresponding deforestation. About 60% loss of wetlands was also observed in the same time period. The decrease in water bodies and a steady increase in bare and built-up areas are possibly due to the prevalent land reclamation activities in the study area. Higher rates of deforestation and increase in bare areas were observed from 2001 to 2016 in comparison to 1986 to 2001. The observed trends are likely to continue, and for future management actions, predictive studies are suggested to provide more empirical evidence.

TI  - Comparison of EPIC-Simulated and MODIS-Derived Leaf Area Index (LAI) across Multiple Spatial Scales
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeled leaf area index (LAI) in conjunction with satellite-derived LAI data streams may be used to support various regional and local scale air quality models for retrospective and future meteorological assessments. The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model holds promise for providing LAI within a dynamic range for input into climate and air quality models, improving on current LAI distribution assumptions typical within atmospheric modeling. To assess the potential use of EPIC LAI, we first evaluated the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product collections 5 and 6 (i.e., Mc5, Mc6) with in situ LAI estimates upscaled at four 1.0 km resolution research sites distributed over the Albemarle-Pamlico Basin in North Carolina and Virginia, USA. We then compared the EPIC modeled 12.0 km resolution LAI to aggregated MODIS LAI (Mc5, Mc6) over a 3 x 3 grid (or 36 km x 36 km) centered over the same four research sites. Upscaled in situ LAI comparison with MODIS LAI showed improvement with the newer collection where the Mc5 overestimate of +2.22 LAI was reduced to +0.97 LAI with the Mc6. On three of the four sites, the EPIC/MODIS LAI comparison at 12.0 km resolution grid showed similar weighted mean LAI differences (LAI 1.29-1.34), with both Mc5 and Mc6 exceeding EPIC LAI across most dates. For all four research sites, both MODIS collections showed a positive bias when compared to EPIC LAI, with Mc6 (LAI = 0.40) aligning closer to EPIC than the Mc5 (LAI = 0.61) counterpart. Despite modest differences between both MODIS collections and EPIC LAI, the overestimation trend suggests the potential for EPIC to be used for future meteorological alternative management applications on a regional or national scale.

TI  - An Approach to Minimize Atmospheric Correction Error and Improve Physics-Based Satellite-Derived Bathymetry in a Coastal Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Physics-based radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion methods have been developed and implemented for satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB); however, precise atmospheric correction (AC) is required for robust bathymetry retrieval. In a previous study, we revealed that biases from AC may be related to imaging and environmental factors that are not considered sufficiently in all AC algorithms. Thus, the main aim of this study is to demonstrate how AC biases related to environmental factors can be minimized to improve SDB results. To achieve this, we first tested a physics-based inversion method to estimate bathymetry for a nearshore area in the Florida Keys, USA. Using a freely available water-based AC algorithm (ACOLITE), we used Landsat 8 (L8) images to derive per-pixel remote sensing reflectances, from which bathymetry was subsequently estimated. Then, we quantified known biases in the AC using a linear regression that estimated bias as a function of imaging and environmental factors and applied a correction to produce a new set of remote sensing reflectances. This correction improved bathymetry estimates for eight of the nine scenes we tested, with the resulting changes in bathymetry RMSE ranging from +0.09 m (worse) to -0.48 m (better) for a 1 to 25 m depth range, and from +0.07 m (worse) to -0.46 m (better) for an approximately 1 to 16 m depth range. In addition, we showed that an ensemble approach based on multiple images, with acquisitions ranging from optimal to sub-optimal conditions, can be used to estimate bathymetry with a result that is similar to what can be obtained from the best individual scene. This approach can reduce time spent on the pre-screening and filtering of scenes. The correction method implemented in this study is not a complete solution to the challenge of AC for satellite-derived bathymetry, but it can eliminate the effects of biases inherent to individual AC algorithms and thus improve bathymetry retrieval. It may also be beneficial for use with other AC algorithms and for the estimation of seafloor habitat and water quality products, although further validation in different nearshore waters is required.

TI  - Modeling for multi-temporal cyanobacterial bloom dominance and distributions using landsat imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms pose great risks to aquatic systems due to its increase in frequency and severity worldwide. This study developed multi-temporal satellite remote sensing models that accurately portray spatial distribution of freshwater cyanobacterial blooms, which traditional monitoring methods cannot accomplish. The models were developed using multiple linear regression involving in-situ measurements and Landsat imagery in Lake Champlain for cyanobacterial blooms and other water quality variables i.e. chlorophyll-a, total phytoplankton, chlorophyte, chrysophyta, pyrrophyta, secchi disk and temperature. The developed models with Landsat imagery successfully captured the distribution of cyanobacterial blooms and other variables (adjusted R-2 = 0.6-0.98). Multi-temporal analysis of remote sensing highlighted the high bloom years with quantified cyanobacterial levels over the entire water body, associated with temperature, indicating the impact of precipitation on cyanobacterial bloom growth. The modeling approach in this study can provide information to improve our understanding of algal dominance and dynamics. This approach can be applied to other freshwater systems, providing a pathway for rapid response systems.

AB  - Introduction The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinicopathological features of patients with false-negative fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and to determine the factors associated with negative FNAC. Methods Patients with negative FNAC from January 2010 to December 2019 were included. The patients with positive sentinel nodes (SN) were divided into two groups: micrometastasis (<= 2 mm) group and macrometastasis (>2 mm) group. The clinicopathological characteristics were compared between the two groups using the chi(2)test. Results A total of 165 patients with negative FNAC were included; 52 (31.5%) had positive SNs. Of the 52 patients, 13 (25%) had micrometastasis and the remaining 39 (75%) had macrometastasis. Of the 113 patients with negative SNs, none had metastases found in non-SNs. No significant differences were observed in age, cT stage or subtype, and preoperative ultrasound findings between the two groups. Conclusions The false-negative rate of FNAC was high (31.5%). Micrometastatic disease was seen in patients with negative FNAC, and this might be the cause of false-negative FNAC results.

AB  - The subject of research is sake - traditional Japanese alcoholic beverage. The purpose of the article is to determine the role of sake in Japanese culture, to identify the ideas, national stereotypes, and a system of values behind it. The relevance of the study is determined by the symbolic value of gastronomic culture as a means of identifying an ethnic group.The national cuisine of any nation is formed under the influence of various factors: natural and geographical features of the area, type of civilization, and fundamental cultural values. Its analysis allows us to come closer to understanding more global issues of identity formation, preservation and translation of cultural heritage, and features of national thinking. Due to its semiotic functions, food can serve as a symbol in various life situations. Using a specific set of products endowed with cultural meaning, the nation retains its original features. Thus, gastronomic culture reveals traits of a national character and contributes to the preservation of cultural identity.Sake is a ritual beverage with a thousand-year history, a concentrate of cultural meanings that identify a person and society in their inextricable relationship.For centuries it has been part of the life of almost every person in Japan, has inspired forms of conduct and ways of thinking because of its importance in rites commemorating everything from birth to death. Sake is more than a drink taken to enjoy. It also serves a vital social purpose at the defining moments in life.The author has analyzed sake as a sacred beverage, mentioned in the ancient Japanese Chronicles, showed its close connection with Shinto rituals, determined the role in the everyday and festive culture of the Japanese. Belief in the divine nature of sake is rooted in ancient myths and legends. Tolerant attitude towards the drunk in Japan also goes back to ancient rituals. Turning to literary sources and Japanese phraseology made it possible to significantly expand the research base and to reveal the totality of ideas about sake in the worldview of native Japanese speakers.The main methods of work are conceptual and contextual analysis, lingvocultural commentary, implemented in the methods of classification and systematization of material.Analysis of numerous examples made it possible to explicate the spiritual, sacred significance of sake, to conclude that in the Japanese worldview it is more than just an alcoholic drink, it is associated with ideas that encompass the entire sphere of a person's life: life, death, work, family, generational communication, change of seasons. As a cultural marker sake carries culturally significant information and serves as the most important means of understanding cultural identity.

TI  - Remote sensing products for predicting actual evapotranspiration and water stress footprints under different land cover
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The changes of evapotranspiration (ET) in temporal periods should be evaluated and monitored, because of its importance in the management of water stresses. For this purpose, the actual ET rate and water shortage of Qom basin-Iran were estimated using Surface Energy Balance System-Iran (SEBS-Iran) with MODIS images of two wet and dry years (2000 and 2014 respectively) selected from 1986 to 2018. The results were compared with the measured stations data and MOD16 model. The NASA MODIS MOD16A2 operational product provides 500-m 8-day global ET estimates extending. The correlation results showed a good relationship between estimated and measured ET, however, SEBS in the wet year showed better performance compared to the MOD16 (R-2 = 0.93). In both wet and dry years, the maximum mean water stress was observed in both SEBS-Iran and MOD16 in arid and agricultural lands, respectively. The SEBS-Iran showed significant differences that the maximum and minimum water stress were observed in 2014 in barren land (0.78) and urban areas (0.44), respectively. In barrer lands, the water stress of MOD16 is lower than real value, which shows the weak performance of MOD16 in the arid area compared to the SEBS-Iran. An increase in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) values led to increasing water stress. There is a correlation of water stress with the indices in both years (R = 0.74). In 2000, 2014, NDVI ranges were 0.31-0.68 and 0.15-0.53, respectively. In a dry year, by decreasing normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), water stress rate was increased. The result showed that in determining ET and water stress in dry and semi-dry areas, SEBS-Iran model demonstrates good performance in presenting more accurate and close to real results. Hence, SEBS-Iran model can be used in the field of water policymaking and management.

TI  - Optimizing the Global Digital Elevation Models (GDEMs) and accuracy of derived DEMs from GPS points for Iraq's mountainous areas
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimizing the combined horizontal and vertical accuracy of the well-known Global Digital Elevation Models (GDEMs) of various resolutions for each country and region especially in Iraq's mountainous areas is still questionable. All the three GDEMs, approximately, have the same vertical accuracy with the Root Mean Square (RMSE) of +/- 7.3 m, +/- 7.6 m and +/- 6.5 m via 12 fixed Ground Control Points (GCPs) for the Advanced Land Observation Satellite Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR 12.5 m), the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM 30 m) and the TerraSAR-X (the name of twin satellites) add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement (TanDEM-X 90 m) GDEMs respectively. Moreover, the percentage of outliers that are greater or smaller than +/- 10 m detection of the height extraction from both the ALOS PALSAR and SRTM Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) contains 16.7% and for TanDEM-X was 25%. In this paper, the special DEM is derived using 2123 handheld GPS points for Sulaymaniyah Governorate, Kurdistan region, Iraq. The height extraction by discarding the outliers of 58% gives the RMSE of +/- 8.0 m in the case of adding geoid heights (N) to the ellipsoidal heights (h) via the Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008) and +/- 5.6 m without adding N. It is expected that the derived DEMs will give more accurate results both horizontally and vertically in the mountainous areas when GPS observations are intensified. The horizontal accuracy is validated through extracting hierarchy stream types of the watershed map from the DEMs for higher than 100 pixels length. The ALOS PALSAR DEM extracted more numbers of stream orders than others. Finally, based on the criteria of RMSE, outlier detection, and the number of extracted stream orders, the ALOS PALSER DEM is regarded as the optimal GDEM in comparison with the close accuracy of both the TanDEM-X and SRTM DEM.

TI  - Evaluating the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with DCIS treated with breast conserving surgery
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for patients with ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) is limited given the rarity of nodal metastasis in non-invasive disease. Although SLNB is typically a safe procedure, there are potential complications and associated costs. The purpose of this study is to assess national surgical practice patterns and clinical outcomes with respect to the use of SLNB for DCIS in patients undergoing breast conserving surgery (BCS).Methods: Case-level data from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) was assessed to identify adult patients > 18 with DCIS, who underwent BCS and SLNB. Patient demographics and hospital characteristics were grouped for analytic purposes. A multivariate analysis was performed for patient and hospital characteristics.Results: We identified 15,422 patients with DCIS undergoing BCS in 2015, of which 2,698 (18%) underwent SLNB. A multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant association between greater frequency of SLNB in patients age range of 60-69, receipt of care at a community facility, and higher nuclear grade DCIS. Positive sentinel nodes metastasis was identified in 0.9% patients undergoing BCS and SLNB for DCIS.Conclusion: The role of SLNB in patients with DCIS undergoing BCS is limited and does not routinely provide meaningful information or benefit to clinical management. Despite this, nearly one in five patients undergoing BCS for DCIS had lymph node sampling performed. Given the potential increased morbidity and financial implications, this finding represents an opportunity for further education and improvement in patient selection for SLNB. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Climate Change Scenarios and Effects on Snow-Melt Runoff
T2  - CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-TEHRAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is an important environmental issue, as progression of melting glaciers and snow cover is sensitive to climate alteration. The aim of this research was to model climate alterations forecasts, and to assess potential changes in snow cover and snow-melt runoff under the different climate change scenarios in the case study of the Zayandeh-rud River Basin. Three cluster models for climate change (NorESM1-M, IPSL-CM5A-LR and CSIRO-MK3.6.0) were applied under RCP 8.5, 4.5 and 2.6 scenarios, to examine climate influences on precipitation and temperature in the basin. Temperature and precipitation were determined for all three scenarios for four periods of 2021-2030, 2031-2040, 2041-2050 and 2051-2060. MODIS (MOD10A1) was also applied to examine snow cover using temperature and precipitation data. The relationship between snow-covered area, temperature and precipitation was used to forecast future snow cover. For modeling future snow melt runoff, a hydrologic model of SRM was used including input data of precipitation, temperature and snow cover. The results indicated that all three RCP scenarios lead to an increase in temperature, and reduction in precipitation and snow cover. Investigation in snowmelt runoff throughout the observation period (November 1970 to May 2006) showed that most of annual runoff is derived from snow melting. Maximum snowmelt runoff is generated in winter. The share of melt water in the autumn and spring runoff is estimated at 35 and 53%, respectively. The results of this study can assist water manager in making better decisions for future water supply.

TI  - Superparamagnetic iron oxide: a novel tracer for sentinel lymph node detection in vulvar cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Superparamagnetic techniques for sentinel lymph node (SLNs) biopsy in breast cancer is well recognized but remains novel in the literature in relation to early stage vulvar cancer. The aim of this study was to compare and validate SLN detection using a superparamagnetic iron oxide tracer and a magnetometer probe compared with the standard procedure with a radioisotope (Tc-99-technetium 99) and a gamma probe, in patients with vulvar cancer. Methods Patients were included in the study with squamous vulvar tumors less than 4 cm in diameter and without suspicious groin lymph nodes on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Patients must have previously qualified for SLN biopsy with a radiotracer as the standard of care. The primary endpoint was the proportion of successful SLN detection with superparamagnetic iron oxide tracer versus(99)Tc. The secondary endpoints were average number of SLNs retrieved per patient, proportion of SLNs detected (nodal detection rate), and proportion of pathologically positive results (malignancy rate) per patient and per node comparing both SLN detection methods. Results A total of 20 patients were included in the study. SLNs were found in all patients with both methods, resulting in similar average distributions (3.1/3.2 SLN per patient). The SLN detection rate per patient was 100% with both techniques. Nodal detection sensitivity was 98.5% for the superparamagnetic technique and 93.8% for the radiotracer. Percentage of metastatic lymph nodes detected was 100% with both tracers. The rate of lymph node positivity was 21.5% (14 lymph nodes with metastases) and for patients 45% (9 patients with nodal metastases). Additionally, SLN tainted brown due to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in 19 of 20 patients. Conclusions The use of superparamagnetic iron oxide tracer in patients with vulvar cancer seems reliable and not inferior to the standard approach with radiotracer.

TI  - Mapping 10-m Resolution Rural Settlements Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Datasets with the Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate information on rural settlements is essential for rural development planning. Remote sensing has become an important means for accurately mapping large scale rural settlements. Nevertheless, numerous difficulties remain in accurate and efficient rural settlement extraction. In this study, by combining multi-dimensional features derived from Sentinel-1/2 images, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite supporting a Day-Night Band (VIIRS-DNB) dataset, and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we proposed an efficient framework with good transferability for mapping rural settlements in the Yangtze River Delta. To avoid the time-consuming selection of a large number of training samples in the whole study area, we employed four random forest models obtained from the training samples in respective training municipal districts in four different regions to classify other municipal districts in their corresponding region. We found that different features play diverse vital roles in the extraction of rural settlements in various regions. Compared to results only using optical data, accuracies obtained by the proposed method were significantly improved. The average user's accuracy, producer's accuracy, overall accuracy, and Kappa coefficient increased by 16.75%, 17.75%, 11.50%, and 14.50% in the four training municipal administrative areas, respectively. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were 96% and 0.84, respectively. By contrast, our classification results are superior to other public datasets. The final mapping results provided a detailed spatial distribution of the rural settlements in the Yangtze River Delta and revealed that the total area of rural settlements is approximately 32,121.1 km(2), accounting for 17.41% of the total area. The high-density rural settlements are mainly distributed in the Northern Plain and East Coast, while the low-density rural settlements are located in the Central Hills and Southern Mountain.

TI  - Deep-Learning-Based Stress-Ratio Prediction Model Using Virtual Reality with Electroencephalography Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Reich Chancellery, built by Albert Speer, was designed with an overwhelming ambience to represent the worldview of Hitler. The interior of the Reich Chancellery comprised high-ceiling and low-ceiling spaces. In this study, the change in a person's emotions according to the ceiling height while moving was examined through brain wave experiments to understand the stress index for each building space. The Reich Chancellery was recreated through VR, and brain wave data collected per space were processed through a first and second analysis. In the first analysis, beta wave changes related to the stress index were calculated, and the space with the highest fluctuation was analyzed. In the second analysis, the correlation between 10 different types of brain waves and waveforms was analyzed; deep-learning algorithms were used to verify the accuracy and analyze spaces with a high stress index. Subsequently, a deep-learning platform for calculating such a value was developed. The results showed that the change in stress index scores was the highest when entering from the Mosaic Hall (15 m floor height) to the Fuhrerbunker (3 m floor height), which had the largest floor height difference. Accordingly, a stress-ratio prediction model for selecting a space with a high stress level was established by monitoring the architectural space based on brain wave information in a VR space. In the architectural design process, the ratio can be used to reflect user sensibility in the design and improve the efficiency of the design process.

TI  - Mott Transition and Superconductivity in Quantum Spin Liquid Candidate NaYbSe<sub>2</sub>
T2  - CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mott transition is one of the fundamental issues in condensed matter physics, especially in the system with antiferromagnetic long-range order. However, such a transition is rare in quantum spin liquid (QSL) systems without long-range order. Here we report the experimental pressure-induced insulator to metal transition followed by the emergence of superconductivity in the QSL candidate NaYbSe(2)with a triangular lattice of 4fYb(3+)ions. Detail analysis of transport properties in metallic state shows an evolution from non-Fermi liquid to Fermi liquid behavior when approaching the vicinity of superconductivity. An irreversible structure phase transition occurs around 11 GPa, which is revealed by the x-ray diffraction. These results shed light on the Mott transition in the QSL systems.

TI  - The day-glow data application of FY-3D IPM in monitoring O/N<sub>2</sub>
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ionosphere Photometer (IPM) is a far ultraviolet nadir-viewing photometer that flew aboard the secondgeneration, polar-orbiting Chinese meteorological satellite FY-3D, which was launched on November 25th, 2017. The F-2 layer peak electron density (NmF2) and O/N-2 the column density ratio can be deduced by far ultraviolet measurements of night-time OI 135.6 nm emissions, which are produced by the recombination of O+ ions and electrons, and the day-time OI 135.6 nm and N2LBH wavelength emissions produced by the photoelectron impact excitation of atomic oxygen O and molecular nitrogen N-2. Analysis of the IPM data indicated the stray light at 135.6 nm wavelength is under deducted. Based on comparison with the emissive intensity calculation of AURIC model, the day-time data was conducted to make a revision of stray light. The reliable factor (1.13) of stray light subtraction was obtained by fitting the median values of the observed data points per each latitude bin to the model data. According to the O/N-2 error estimation from the estimated factor of the stray light, when the factor does not change by more than 0.03, the error of O/N-2 ratio from the factor will not exceed 20%. The O/N-2 changes retrieved from revised IPM data during storms in April and August 2018 are well correlated with Dst indices. The research results show that the IPM data could provide a good monitoring of O/N-2 changes during magnetic storms.

TI  - Integration of Geospatial Tools and Multi-source Geospatial Data to Evaluate the Tropical Forest Cover Change in Central America and Its Methodological Replicability in Brazil and the DRC
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite monitoring of forests plays a relevant role in the agendas of tropical countries, mainly in the framework of international negotiations to implement a mechanism that ensures a reduction in global CO(2)emissions from deforestation. An efficient way to approach this monitoring is to avoid duplication of efforts, generating products in a regional context that are subsequently adopted at the national level. In this effort, you should take advantage of the different data sources available by integrating geospatial tools and satellite image classification algorithms. In this research, a methodological framework was developed to generate cost-efficient national maps of forest cover and its dynamics for the countries of Central America, and its scalability and replicability was explored in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the State of Para in Brazil. The maps were generated from Landsat images from the years 2000, 2012, and 2017. New geoprocessing elements have been incorporated into the digital classification procedures for satellite images, such as the automated extraction of training samples from secondary sources, the use of official national reference maps that respond to nationally adopted forest definitions, and automation of post-classification adjustments incorporating expert criteria. The applied regional approach offers advantages in terms of reducing costs and time, as well as improving the consistency and coherence of reports at different territorial levels (regional and national), reducing duplication of efforts and optimizing technical and financial resources. In Central America, the percentage of forest area decreased from 44% in 2000 to 38% in 2017. Average deforestation in the 2000-2012 period was 197,443 ha/year and that of 2012-2017 was 332,243 ha/year. Average deforestation for the complete period 2000-2017 was 264,843 ha/year. The tropical forests in both the State of Para, Brazil, and the DRC have decreased over time.

TI  - Early life exposure to green space and insulin resistance: An assessment from infancy to early adolescence
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Recent studies suggest that greater exposure to natural vegetation, or "green space" is associated with lower diabetes risk, possibly through increasing physical activity. However, there is limited research on green space and insulin resistance in youth. We hypothesized greater green space at early-life sensitive time periods would be associated with lower insulin resistance in youth.Methods: We used data from Project Viva (N = 460), a pre-birth cohort study that recruited pregnant women in eastern Massachusetts, 1999-2002, and followed offspring into adolescence. We defined residential green space exposure at infancy (median age - 1.1 years), early childhood (3.2 years), mid-childhood (7.7 years), and early adolescence (12.8 years), using 30 m resolution Landsat satellite imagery to estimate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI]. Our main outcome was early adolescence estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). We used multiple imputation to account for missing data and multiple linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, parental education, household income, and neighborhood median household income.Results: The highest green space tertile had the highest percentage of white participants (85%), college-educated mothers (87%) and fathers (85%), and households with income higher than US$70,000 (86%). Unadjusted models showed that participants living in the highest green space tertile at infancy had a 0.15 unit lower HOMA-IR (95% CI: -0.23, -0.06) in early adolescence, than those living in the lowest tertile. However, in adjusted models, we did not observe evidence of associations between green space from infancy to early adolescence and HOMA-IR in early adolescence, although some point estimates were in the hypothesized direction. For example, participants in the highest green space tertile in infancy had 0.03 units lower HOMA-IR (95%CI: -0.14, 0.08) than those living in the lowest tertile.Conclusions: Exposure to green space at early life sensitive time periods was not associated with HOMA-IR in youth. Early-life longitudinal studies across diverse populations are needed to confirm or refute our results.

TI  - Modulation Effect of Mesoscale Eddies on Sequential Typhoon-Induced Oceanic Responses in the South China Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of mesoscale eddies on the modulation of typhoon-induced oceanic responses are important for understanding ocean dynamics. Satellite observations identified prominent ocean surface temperature and chlorophyll changes over the regions with mesoscale eddies after two sequential typhoons, e.g., Linfa and Nangka, in the South China Sea. The impacts of typhoons on the ocean surface were more prominent within cyclonic eddies than within anticyclonic eddies. The wind speed (translation speed) of Linfa was much larger (slower) than that of Nangka; thus, the changes induced by Linfa were stronger. However, the second typhoon easily generated mixing through the weak stratification induced by the first typhoon and impacted the upper ocean. The strong chlorophyll enhancement induced by Nangka was identified at a cyclonic eddy. Using a combination of reanalysis data, the depth of water origin (DWO) was applied to quantify the depth to which a typhoon's impact could be exerted. Prominent changes were identified when the DWO reached the depth at which the temperature and nutrients differed from those within the mixed layer. This method can overcome the impacts of cloud coverage when examining a typhoon's influence with remotely sensed data and offers a quantitative approach to determine the mechanisms responsible for typhoon-induced ocean surface changes.

TI  - Exploring Wetland Dynamics in Large River Floodplain Systems with Unsupervised Machine Learning: A Case Study of the Dongting Lake, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large river floodplain systems (LRFS) are among the most diverse and dynamic ecosystems. Accurately monitoring the dynamics of LRFS over long time series is fundamental and essential for their sustainable development. However, challenges remain because the spatial distribution of LRFS is never static due to inter- and intra-annual changes in environmental conditions. In this study, we developed and tested a methodological framework to re-construct the long-term wetland dynamics in Dongting Lake, China, utilizing an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm (UMLA) on the basis of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) time series. Our results showed that the UMLA achieved comparable performance to the time-consuming satellite image segmentation method with a Kappa coefficient of agreement greater than 0.75 and an overall accuracy over 85%. With the re-constructed annual wetland distribution maps, we found that 31.35% of wet meadows, one of most important ecological assets in the region, disappeared at an average rate of c.a. 1660 ha year(-1)during the past two decades, which suggests that the Dongting Lake is losing its ecological function of providing wintering ground for migratory water birds, and remediation management actions are urgently required. We concluded that UMLA offers a fast and cost-efficient alternative to monitor ecological responses in a rapidly changing environment.

TI  - Molecular Epidemiology of Rotavirus A Strains Pre- and Post-Vaccine (Rotarix(R)) Introduction in Mozambique, 2012-2019: Emergence of Genotypes G3P[4] and G3P[8]
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Group A rotavirus (RVA) remains the most important etiological agent associated with severe acute diarrhea in children.Rotarix(R)monovalent vaccine was introduced into Mozambique's Expanded Program on Immunization in September 2015. In the present study, we report the diversity and prevalence of rotavirus genotypes, pre- (2012-2015) and post-vaccine (2016-2019) introduction in Mozambique, among diarrheic children less than five years of age. Genotyping data were analyzed for five sentinel sites for the periods indicated. The primary sentinel site, Mavalane General Hospital (HGM), was analyzed for the period 2012-2019, and for all five sites (country-wide analyses), 2015-2019. During the pre-vaccine period, G9P[8] was the most predominant genotype for both HGM (28.5%) and the country-wide analysis (46.0%). However, in the post-vaccine period, G9P[8] was significantly reduced. Instead, G3P[8] was the most common genotype at HGM, while G1P[8] predominated country-wide. Genotypes G9P[4] and G9P[6] were detected for the first time, and the emergence of G3P[8] and G3P[4] genotypes were observed during the post-vaccine period. The distribution and prevalence of rotavirus genotypes were distinct in pre- and post-vaccination periods, while uncommon genotypes were also detected in the post-vaccine period. These observations support the need for continued country-wide surveillance to monitor changes in strain diversity, due to possible vaccine pressure, and consequently, the effect on vaccine effectiveness.

TI  - The close relationship between sudden loss of smell and Covid-19
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The real number of Covid-19 cases may be underestimated since several countries have difficulty offering laboratory tests for all the population. Therefore, finding a symptom with a high predictive value would help in diagnostic and isolation strategies.Objective: To correlate the sudden loss of the sense of smell in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic with results of diagnostic tests for Covid-19.Methods: This is a cross-sectional observational study. An online questionnaire was digitally addressed to 725 outpatients in Brazil who reported partial or total sudden loss of the sense of smell from March to April 2020.Results: Total or partial sudden loss of the sense of smell showed high positive predictive value for Covid-19 diagnosis, during the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil (88.8%). There were no differences between groups tested positive and negative in regard to demographic and clinical characteristics such as presence of allergy, rhinitis, neither to olfactory recovery time.Conclusion: The identification of sudden loss of the sense of smell during Covid-19 pandemic may serve as a sentinel symptom and may be a warning to establish measures to prevent the transmission of the disease.

TI  - Consistent ice and open water classification combining historical synthetic aperture radar satellite images from ERS-1/2, Envisat ASAR, RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1A/B
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite images are used to monitor Arctic sea ice, with systematic data records dating back to 1991. We propose a semi-supervised classification method that separates open water from sea ice and can utilise ERS-1/2, Envisat ASAR, RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR images. The classification combines automatic segmentation with a manual segment selection stage. The segmentation algorithm requires only the backscatter intensities and incidence angle values as input, therefore can be used to establish a consistent decadal sea ice record. In this study we investigate the sea ice conditions in two Svalbard fjords, Kongsfjorden and Rijpfjorden. Both fjords have a seasonal ice cover, though Rijpfjorden has a longer sea ice season. The satellite image dataset has weekly to daily records from 2002 until now, and less frequent records between 1991 and 2002. Time overlap between different sensors is investigated to ensure consistency in the reported sea ice cover. The classification results have been compared to high-resolution SAR data as well as in-situ measurements and sea ice maps from Ny-angstrom lesund. For both fjords the length of the sea ice season has shortened since 2002 and for Kongsfjorden the maximum sea ice coverage is significantly lower after 2006.

TI  - Detecting Montane Flowering Phenology with CubeSat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shifts in wildflower phenology in response to climate change are well documented in the scientific literature. The majority of studies have revealed phenological shifts using in-situ observations, some aided by citizen science efforts (e.g., National Phenology Network). Such investigations have been instrumental in quantifying phenological shifts but are challenged by the fact that limited resources often make it difficult to gather observations over large spatial scales and long-time frames. However, recent advances in finer scale satellite imagery may provide new opportunities to detect changes in phenology. These approaches have documented plot level changes in vegetation characteristics and leafing phenology, but it remains unclear whether they can also detect flowering in natural environments. Here, we test whether fine-resolution imagery (<10 m) can detect flowering and whether combining multiple sources of imagery improves the detection process. Examining alpine wildflowers at Mt. Rainier National Park (MORA), we found that high-resolution Random Forest (RF) classification from 3-m resolution PlanetScope (from Planet Labs) imagery was able to delineate the flowering season captured by ground-based phenological surveys with an accuracy of 70% (Cohen's kappa = 0.25). We then combined PlanetScope data with coarser resolution but higher quality imagery from Sentinel and Landsat satellites (10-m Sentinel and 30-m Landsat), resulting in higher accuracy predictions (accuracy = 77%, Cohen's kappa = 0.39). The model was also able to identify the timing of peak flowering in a particularly warm year (2015), despite being calibrated on normal climate years. Our results suggest PlanetScope imagery holds utility in global change ecology where temporal frequency is important. Additionally, we suggest that combining imagery may provide a new approach to cross-calibrate sensors to account for radiometric irregularity inherent in fine resolution PlanetScope imagery. The development of this approach for wildflower phenology predictions provides new possibilities to monitor climate change effects on flowering communities at broader spatiotemporal scales. In protected and tourist areas where the flowering season draws large numbers of visitors, such as Mt. Rainier National Park, the modeling framework presented here could be a useful tool to manage and prioritize park resources.

TI  - Development of the User Requirements for the Canadian WildFireSat Satellite Mission
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2019 the Canadian Space Agency initiated development of a dedicated wildfire monitoring satellite (WildFireSat) mission. The intent of this mission is to support operational wildfire management, smoke and air quality forecasting, and wildfire carbon emissions reporting. In order to deliver the mission objectives, it was necessary to identify the technical and operational challenges which have prevented broad exploitation of Earth Observation (EO) in Canadian wildfire management and to address these challenges in the mission design. In this study we emphasize the first objective by documenting the results of wildfire management end-user engagement activities which were used to identify the key Fire Management Functionalities (FMFs) required for an Earth Observation wildfire monitoring system. These FMFs are then used to define the User Requirements for the Canadian Wildland Fire Monitoring System (CWFMS) which are refined here for the WildFireSat mission. The User Requirements are divided into Observational, Measurement, and Precision requirements and form the foundation for the design of the WildFireSat mission (currently in Phase-A, summer 2020).

TI  - Optical Properties Using Adaptive Selection of NIR/SWIR Reflectance Correction and Quasi-Analytic Algorithms for the MODIS-Aqua in Estuarine-Ocean Continuum: Application to the Northern Gulf of Mexico
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An adaptive selection of the near/shortwave infrared (NIR/SWIR) reflectance correction and the quasi-analytic algorithms (QAAs) is proposed for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-Aqua) to utilize the strengths of different correction algorithms and QAAs in a single satellite scene with water types ranging from turbid coastal to clear open ocean waters. A blended satellite product is generated by merging three atmospheric-correction algorithms(AD-ATCOR): 1) iterative NIR correction; 2) management unit of the north sea mathematical models (MUMM); and 3) SWIR, using a spectral threshold-based selection for different water types. The validation analysis of a blended remote sensing reflectance product showed overall good agreement with AERONET-OC observations followed by NASA bio-optical marine algorithm data set (NOMAD) at the blue wavelengths and the estuarine data set at the green and red wavelengths. The results suggest that the adaptive method is a better alternative to address the challenging problem of selecting different correction algorithms for different water types in a single satellite scene. Likewise, an adaptive selection of a QAA (AD-QAA) used the QAA-v5 and the QAA-V to obtain merged inherent optical property (IOP) products in a single MODIS-Aqua scene with varying water types. As a case study, the two adaptive selection procedures were sequentially applied to the MODIS-Aqua imagery representing four environmental conditions in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Improved retrievals of the total absorption and backscattering coefficients along an estuarine to ocean continuum demonstrated the effectiveness of this method in an optically complex and dynamic river-dominated system.

M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - We describe a new high spatial resolution surface water classification dataset generated for the Xingu river, Brazil, from its confluence with the Iriri river to the Pimental dam prior to construction of the Belo Monte hydropower complex, and after its operationalization. This river is well-known for its exceptionally high diversity and endemism in ichthyofauna. Pre-existing datasets generated from moderate resolution satellite imagery (e.g., 30 m) do not adequately capture the extent of the river. Accurate measurements of water extent are important for a range of applications utilizing surface water data, including greenhouse gas emission estimation, land cover change mapping, and habitat loss/change estimates, among others. We generated the new classifications from RapidEye imagery (5 m pixel size) for 2011 and PlanteScope imagery (3 m pixel size) for 2019 using a Geographic Object Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) approach.

TI  - FluLCVRT: Reflectance and fluorescence of leaf and canopy modeling based on Monte Carlo vector radiative transfer simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll fluorescence simulation is a hot topic in vegetation remote sensing as it allows to link measurements at leaf and canopy scales to the leaf photosynthetic activity. This work tries to simulate light propagation, scattering and fluorescence emission using 3-D vector radiative transfer theory that allows dealing with polarization. The model is called Fluorescence Leaf Canopy Vector Ratiative Transfer, FluLCVRT. Realistic 3-D mock-up of leaf is used to do simulation based on Monte Carlo ray tracing. Fluorescence is created when radiation passes through chloroplasts. The emission is proportional to the absorbed amount of radiation within the latter. Emitted fluorescence exits chloroplast in a random direction, therefore ray tracing is done separately for original radiation and fluorescence. Bidirectional reflectance, transmittance, and fluorescence are estimated at leaf level within a discrete tessellation for input and output angles, that are afterward saved as databases. Then at canopy level, ray tracing is done leaf by leaf, and at each iteration, original radiation is traced in addition to an auxiliary one relative to fluorescence. Both phenomena are governed by their leaf bidirectional distributions and the precalculated databases are used. Results at leaf level point out the variation of the bidirectional distributions. Particularly, reflectance and upward fluorescence are characterized by high specular effect and hot spot peak, respectively. Horizontally polarized radiation emits fluorescence less than the vertical one because its surface highly reflects radiation in the specular direction. Fluorescence in red and near-infrared increases and decreases with respect to chlorophyll content, respectively. Fluorescence is emitted from shallow chloroplasts in upward case. Meanwhile, in the downward one, it is mainly originated from shallow and deep chloroplasts in the red and near-infrared bands, respectively. At canopy level, the same chlorophyll, polarization, and bidirectional effects are observed except that hot spot peak becomes clear in reflectance. When LAI increases, fluorescence saturates at LAI equal 2 and 3 in red and near-infrared. Soil contribution in fluorescence is not too much since it does not diffuse an important amount of radiation in the chlorophyll absorption domain. A comparison between our model and Fluspect at leaf level shows differences in scattering and fluorescence. They are mainly due to the decrease of the chlorophyll efficiency in FluLCVRT due to the clumping of the chloroplasts within cell cytoplasm. Such an effect is not modeled in Fluspect.

TI  - What drives urban growth in Pune? A logistic regression and relative importance analysis perspective
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Proactive planning and management of rapidly urbanizing cities using up-to-date spatially explicit datasets is an urgent need. This requires a good understanding of the driving factors responsible for urban growth. Using Pune metropolis as test site, this paper presents an approach to assess the relative importance of urban growth driving factors from inexpensive geospatial datasets with respect to (i) urbanization process, (ii) urban planning (iii) urban growth modelling by utilizing relative importance analysis (RIA) as a supplement to logistic regression. Furthermore, this research proposes a new approach to reduce the parameterization and data requirement of urban growth models. Our research shows, that proximity to essential infrastructure has the highest predictive power in explaining urban growth of Pune. The importance of policy factors increase with time. Our results reveal that RIA is a suitable method, which can assist planners in deeper understanding of the urbanization process and to devise sustainable urban development strategies, utilizing a limited amount of data, which can be easily updated from geospatial datasets. The proposed break point method based on RIA to reduce parameterization of urban models performed at par with the model results achieved with the traditional AIC approach using less than half of the total number of driving factors.

TI  - Remote Sensing X-Band SAR Data for Land Subsidence and Pavement Monitoring
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we monitor pavement and land subsidence in Tabriz city in NW Iran using X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor of Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) satellites (2017-2018). Fifteen CSK images with a revisit interval of similar to 30 days have been used. Because of traffic jams, usually cars on streets do not allow pure backscattering measurements of pavements. Thus, the major paved areas (e.g., streets, etc.) of the city are extracted from a minimum-based stacking model of high resolution (HR) SAR images. The technique can be used profitably to reduce the negative impacts of the presence of traffic jams and estimate the possible quality of pavement in the HR SAR images in which the results can be compared by in-situ road roughness measurements. In addition, a time series small baseline subset (SBAS) interferometric SAR (InSAR) analysis is applied for the acquired HR CSK images. The SBAS InSAR results show land subsidence in some parts of the city. The mean rate of line-of-sight (LOS) subsidence is 20 mm/year in district two of the city, which was confirmed by field surveying and mean vertical velocity of Sentinel-1 dataset. The SBAS InSAR results also show that 1.4 km(2) of buildings and 65 km of pavement are at an immediate risk of land subsidence.

We negate the claim that omitting their paper (Dravis and Wanless, 2017) had any consequences for our interpretations. We also provide reasoning and data to demonstrate that our interpretation of the Quaternary stratigraphy of the island was derived from detailed field work and high-resolution remote sensing data, which was subsequently corroborated by AAR and U-Th age-dating control, the opposite of the claim by Wanless and Dravis.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Despite reductions in door-to-balloon times for primary coronary intervention, mortality from ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction has plateaued. Early pre-primary coronary intervention treatment of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors improves pre-primary coronary intervention coronary flow, limits infarct size, and improves survival. We report the first human use of a novel glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor designed for subcutaneous first point-of-care ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction treatment.Methods and Results: Healthy volunteers and patients with stable coronary artery disease receiving aspirin received escalating doses of RUC-4 or placebo in a sentinel-dose, randomized, blinded fashion. Inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) to ADP (20 mu mol/L), RUC-4 blood levels, laboratory evaluations, and clinical assessments were made through 24 hours and at 7 days. Doses were increased until reaching the biologically effective dose (the dose producing >= 80% IPA within 15 minutes, with return toward baseline within 4 hours). In healthy volunteers, 15 minutes after subcutaneous injection, mean +/- SD IPA was 6.9%+7.1% after placebo and 71.8%+/- 15.0% at 0.05 mg/kg (n=6) and 84.7%+/- 16.7% at 0.075 mg/kg (n=6) after RUC-4. IPA diminished over 90 to 120 minutes. In patients with coronary artery disease, 15 minutes after subcutaneous injection of placebo or 0.04 mg/kg (n=2), 0.05 mg/kg (n=6), and 0.075 mg/kg (n=18) of RUC-4, IPA was 14.6%+/- 11.7%, 53.6%+/- 17.0%, 76.9%+/- 10.6%, and 88.9%+/- 12.7%, respectively. RUC-4 blood levels correlated with IPA. Aspirin did not affect IPA or RUC-4 blood levels. Platelet counts were stable and no serious adverse events, bleeding, or injection site reactions were observed.Conclusions: RUC-4 provides rapid, high-grade, limited-duration platelet inhibition following subcutaneous administration that appears to be safe and well tolerated.REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NTC03844191.

T2  - JNCI-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The incidence of melanoma in the United States has been increasing over the past several decades. Prognosis largely depends on disease stage, with 5-year melanoma-specific survival ranging from as high as 99% in patients with stage I disease to less than 10% for some patients with stage IV (distant metastatic) disease. Fortunately, in the last 5-10 years, there have been remarkable treatment advances for patients with high-risk resectable melanoma, including approval of targeted and immune checkpoint blockade therapies. In addition, results of recent clinical trials have confirmed the importance of sentinel lymph node biopsy and continue to refine the approach to regional lymph node basin management. Lastly, the melanoma staging system was revised in the eighth edition AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, which was implemented on January 1, 2018. Here we discuss these changes and the clinicopathological features that confer high risk for locoregional and distant disease relapse and poor survival. Implications regarding the management of melanoma in the metastatic and adjuvant settings are discussed, as are future directions for neoadjuvant therapies.

TI  - A Comparison of Three Temporal Smoothing Algorithms to Improve Land Cover Classification: A Case Study from NEPAL
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series land cover data statistics often fluctuate abruptly due to seasonal impact and other noise in the input image. Temporal smoothing techniques are used to reduce the noise in time series data used in land cover mapping. The effects of smoothing may vary based on the smoothing method and land cover category. In this study, we compared the performance of Fourier transformation smoothing, Whittaker smoother and Linear-Fit averaging smoother on Landsat 5, 7 and 8 based yearly composites to classify land cover in Province No. 1 of Nepal. The performance of each smoother was tested based on whether it was applied on image composites or on land cover primitives generated using the random forest machine learning method. The land cover data used in the study was from the years 2000 to 2018. Probability distribution was examined to check the quality of primitives and accuracy of the final land cover maps were accessed. The best results were found for the Whittaker smoothing for stable classes and Fourier smoothing for other classes. The results also show that classification using a properly selected smoothing algorithm outperforms a classification based on its unsmoothed data set. The final land cover generated by combining the best results obtained from different smoothing approaches increased our overall land cover map accuracy from 79.18% to 83.44%. This study shows that smoothing can result in a substantial increase in the quality of the results and that the smoothing approach should be carefully considered for each land cover class.

T2  - Journal of Sciences-Islamic Republic of Iran
M3  - Article
AB  - Bavanat red bed copper deposits (Jolani area) are located in south Sanandaj-Sirjan metamorphic belt and approximately 15 km NW of Bavanat. In terms of lithology, these deposits include purple to red siltstone (PSS) which are also seen among the layers of green sandstone (GS). Copper mineralization such as malachite is observed in the GS unit at the surface. Both PSS and GS units have Jurassic age. The current study, has used Landsat 8 and SPOT 5 images for RS processing. This study indicated that RGB=432 color composite in SPOT 5 image has the best contrast for enhancement and detection of PSS and GS units. Only the Landsat 8 fused image has been able to enhance and detect the GS unit. Also, based on band ratio technique, RGB=(b6/b2), (b5/b3), (b7/b1) color composite for Landsat 8 data, has the best contrast for PSS and GS units. PCA method shows that RGB=PC4, PC2, PC1 for Spot 5 data and RGB=PC1, PC2, PC3 for Landsat 8 data have the best contrast for enhancement and detection of the Bavanat red bed copper deposits. In this study, different methods of supervised classification such as SAM, SID and SVM were reviewed. Among these methods, SVM technique has the best layout for SPOT 5 image. This important layout as a basic geological map, can be very useful in additional exploration studies on the Bavanat red bed deposits.

TI  - Spatiotemporal monitoring of surface soil moisture using optical remote sensing data: a case study in a semi-arid area
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture content (SSMC) monitoring constitutes an important parameter to estimate crop water requirements, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Remote sensing became a useful tool for estimating SSMC. Two approaches were applied for monitoring the SSMC during the 2013/14 cropping season in the irrigated perimeter of Tadla (Morocco) using multispectral bands of Landsat-8 OLI images. The first approach examined the potential of visible and short-wave infrared drought index (VSDI), normalized multi-band drought index (NMDI) and short-wave infrared water stress index (SIWSI), to retrieve SSMC. The second approach attempted to develop a new SSMC model based on evaluation of the correlations between multispectral bands and measured SSMC using a stepwise multiple regression analysis. Results showed that the established model is highly correlated with the measured SSMC at all crop growth stages withR(2)of 0.87, 0.85 and 0.89, for bare soil, partially covered and entirely covered by vegetation, respectively.

AB  - BecauseEnterococcus faeciumis an important nosocomial pathogen and sentinel organism for tracking antimicrobial resistance, information on the contamination and antimicrobial resistance patterns ofE. faeciumin food are essential to public health and food safety. We analyzed the occurrence ofE. faeciumin retail pork meat products (n= 124), and antimicrobial resistance of 30E. faeciumisolates were examined against 14 antimicrobials using the broth dilution test and disc diffusion test. Rep-PCR-based molecular diversity was also analyzed using Deviersilab. The highest contamination of enterococci was observed for minced pork meat but most of theE. faeciumwas isolated from meatball-type frozen pork meat products (FP). Incidences of antimicrobial-resistantE. faeciumagainst erythromycin, clindamycin and nitrofurantoin were 80%, 50% and 20%, respectively. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci were analyzed. Rep-PCR showed distinctive clusters with a similarity >= 98%, consisting of 18E. faeciumisolates from FP manufactured in seven companies. The analyzed data on the contamination and antimicrobial resistance patterns combined with molecular typing can be useful to derive risk management of antimicrobial-resistant enterococci in food.

TI  - Monitoring of Urban Growth Patterns in Rapidly Growing Bahir Dar City of Northwest Ethiopia with 30 year Landsat Imagery Record
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring urban growth patterns is an important measure to improve our understanding of land use/land cover (LULC) changes and a central part in the proper development of any city. In this study, we analyzed the changes over a period of 30 years (1985-2015) in Bahir Dar, one of the rapidly growing cities of northwest Ethiopia. Satellite images of Landsat TM (1985, 1995, and 2008), and OLI (2015) were used. The classification was carried out using the object-based image analysis technique and a change analysis was undertaken using post-classification comparison in GIS as a novel framework. An accuracy assessment was conducted for each reference year. Eight LULC types were successfully captured with overall accuracies ranging from 88.3% to 92.9% and a Kappa statistic of 0.85 to 0.92. The classification result revealed that cropland (66%), water (12.5%), and grassland (6%) were the dominant LULC types with a small share of areas covered by built-up areas (2.4%) in 1985. In 2015, cropland and water continued to be dominant followed by built-up areas. The change result shows that a rapid reduction in natural forest cover followed by grassland and wetland occurred between the first (1985-1995), second (1995-2008), and third (2008-2015) study periods. On the contrary, build-ups increased in all three periods by 9.3%, 121.3%, and 44.8%, respectively. Although the conversion between the LULC classes varied substantially, analysis of the 30-year change matrix revealed that about 31% was subject to intensive change between the classes. Specifically, the built-up area has increased by 250.5% during the study years. The framed approach used in this research is a good repeatable example of how to assess and monitor urban growth at the local level, by combining remote sensing and GIS technologies. Further study is suggested to investigate detailed drivers, consequences of changes, and future options.

TI  - Detection of sentinel lymph node metastasis in thick melanoma provides promising adjuvant treatment
T2  - ORVOSI HETILAP
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The importance of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the treatment of thick melanomas (Breslow>4 mm) has so far been debated in the literature. Nowadays, histological verification of regional lymph node involvement is a prerequisite for adjuvant therapy. At the same time, the criteria for the need for sentinel lymph node biopsy are not uniform in Hungary either, there are institutes where this procedure is not performed in the case of thick melanomas.Aim: We have consistently performed sentinel lymph node biopsies in the case of melanomas thicker than 4 mm over a five-year long period at the Department of Dermatology and Allergology of the University of Szeged in order to investigate the proportion of clinically occult regional lymph node metastases present in south-east Hungary.Method: Out of 1133 patients diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma between 2007 and 2011 in our department, patients with primary melanomas thicker than 4 mm were retrospectively evaluated based on demographic data, clinical and histological features of the primary tumor correlated with the sentinel lymph node status.Results: During the 5-year period, 116 patients were diagnosed with thick melanoma and underwent surgical excision. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in the case of 78 patients, which was found to be histologically positive in 50 cases. The mean age of patients was 58 years.Conclusion: Annually 10 patients with thick melanoma are treated in our department whose regional lymph node metastasis is verified by sentinel lymph node biopsy. Based on our results and the data from the National Cancer Registry, the annual number of patients where adjuvant therapy would be necessary depending on sentinel lymph node positivity is estimated to be up to 100 in Hungary. Given the relatively young mean age of the patient population, the use of adjuvant target/immunotherapy may be more effective in increasing overall survival compared to when treatment is only initiated upon visceral metastases.

TI  - An Observation-Driven Approach to Improve Vegetation Phenology in a Global Land Surface Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - An empirical model calibration approach is presented that aims to approximate missing biosphere processes in a global land surface model without the need for substantial model structural changes. The strategy is implemented here using the NASA Catchment-CN land surface model and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR). Existing plant functional types (PFTs) of the Catchment-CN model are divided into three subtypes, based on the bias between the model-simulated and MODIS-observed FPAR. Separate sets of vegetation parameters for each subtype are then calibrated at a small number of grid cells with homogeneous, single-PFT land cover, using MODIS FPAR reference observations from 2003 to 2009. The effectiveness of the empirical approach at improving the realism of modeled vegetation dynamics is investigated with two global model simulations for the period 2010-2016, one using the newly calibrated parameter values and the other using the original values. Globally, the calibrated parameters reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of the modeled FPAR with respect to MODIS by 0.029 (similar to 10%) on average. In some regions, substantially larger RMSE reductions are achieved. RMSE reductions are primarily driven by model bias reductions, with neutral effects on the temporal correlation skill. While the empirical approach is suitable for achieving consistent model improvements, it is shown to be sensitive to the characteristics of the model error, specifically a dominance of the bias component in the case of Catchment-CN. Ultimately, more fundamental model structural changes may be required to achieve better improvements.

TI  - Mapping of Major Land-Use Changes in the Kolleru Lake Freshwater Ecosystem by Using Landsat Satellite Images in Google Earth Engine
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - India's largest freshwater ecosystem of the Kolleru Lake has experienced severe threats by land-use changes, including the construction of illegal fishponds around the lake area over the past five decades. Despite efforts to protect and restore the lake and its riparian zones, environmental pressures have increased over time. The present study provides a synthesis of human activities through major land-use changes around Kolleru Lake both before and after restoration measures. For this purpose, archives of all Landsat imageries from the last three decades were used to detect land cover changes. Using the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, three different land-use scenarios were classified for the year before restoration (1999), for 2008 immediately after the restoration, and for 2018, i.e., the current situation of the lake one decade afterward. Additionally, the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) indices were used to identify land cover dynamics. The results show that the restoration was successful; consequently, after a decade, the lake was transformed into the previous state of restoration (i.e., 1999 situation). In 1999, 29.7% of the Kolleru Lake ecosystem was occupied by fishponds, and, after a decade of sustainable restoration, 27.7% of the area was fishponds, almost reaching the extent of the 1999 situation. On the one hand, aquaculture is one of the most promising sources of income, but there is also limited awareness of its negative environmental impacts among local residents. On the other hand, political commitment to protect the lake is weak, and integrated approaches considering all stakeholders are lacking. Nevertheless, alterations of land and water use, increasing nutrient concentrations, and sediment inputs from the lake basin have reached a level at which they threaten the biodiversity and functionality of India's largest wetland ecosystem to the degree that immediate action is necessary to prevent irreversible degradation.

TI  - Empirical Relationships between Remote-Sensing Reflectance and Selected Inherent Optical Properties in Nordic Sea Surface Waters for the MODIS and OLCI Ocean Colour Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Nordic Seas and the Fram Strait regions are a melting pot of a number of water masses characterized by distinct optical water properties. The warm Atlantic Waters transported from the south and the Arctic Waters from the north, combined with the melt waters contributing to the Polar Waters, mediate the dynamic changes of the year-to-year large-scale circulation patterns in the area, which often form complex frontal zones. In the last decade, moreover, a significant shift in phytoplankton phenology in the area has been observed, with a certain northward expansion of temperate phytoplankton communities into the Arctic Ocean which could lead to a deterioration in the performance of remote sensing algorithms. In this research, we exploited the capability of the satellite sensors to monitor those inter-annual changes at basin scales. We propose locally adjusted algorithms for retrieving chlorophyllaconcentrationsChla, absorption by particles apat 443 and 670 nm, and total absorption atotat 443 and 670 nm developed on the basis of intensive field work conducted in 2013-2015. Measured in situ hyper spectral remote sensing reflectance has been used to reconstruct the MODIS and OLCI spectral channels for which the proposed algorithms have been adapted. We obtained MNB <= 0.5% for ap(670)and <= 3% for atot(670)andChla. RMS was <= 30% for most of the retrieved optical water properties except ap(443)andChla. The mean monthly mosaics of ap(443)computed on the basis of the proposed algorithm were used for reconstructing the spatial and temporal changes of the phytoplankton biomass in 2013-2015. The results corresponded very well with in situ measurements.

TI  - The Phenomenon of the Institution of Education in the World Order of Postmodern Globalization
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Globalization as a phenomenon of the modern world in recent years has spread to the educational system. Under these conditions, new values of the mechanism of education were formed and formed: the first is aimed at recognizing education as the most important principle of cultural genesis, and the second, on the contrary, suggests a decline in interest in education as a means of creative self-realization. These contradictory positions are global in nature, but do not depend on the national-state and cultural characteristics of educational systems. The trend towards globalization is manifested in the following areas: the development of the global economic environment, the emergence and mass distribution of PCs and the Internet, as well as the involvement of the educated population of non-European countries such as India, Japan, South Korea, China in the scientific and technological process. At the same time, the leading trend is the intensive growth of cultural diversity as independent entities. Since education is an integral part of any modem person, the educational sphere is influenced by those trends that characterize global dynamics, as well as determine general and individual worldview and moral dominants, affecting individuals in the design of world order. Globalization is a fairly new state of world organization and evidence of the formation of a new type of culture. However, its origins and trends have long been deeply embedded in the bowels of culture, it demonstrates the general nature of globalization, and manifests itself through cultural universals. Their most significant component is generally accepted sociocultural values, Which can become the basis for the development of modern society.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Classification Framework for Mapping Woody Vegetation from Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The inventory of woody vegetation is of great importance for good forest management. Advancements of remote sensing techniques have provided excellent tools for such purposes, reducing the required amount of time and labor, yet with high accuracy and the information richness. Sentinel-2 is one of the relatively new satellite missions, whose 13 spectral bands and short revisit time proved to be very useful when it comes to forest monitoring. In this study, the novel spatio-temporal classification framework for mapping woody vegetation from Sentinel-2 multitemporal data has been proposed. The used framework is based on the probability random forest classification, where temporal information is explicitly defined in the model. Because of this, several predictions are made for each pixel of the study area, which allow for specific spatio-temporal aggregation to be performed. The proposed methodology has been successfully applied for mapping eight potential forest and shrubby vegetation types over the study area of Serbia. Several spatio-temporal aggregation approaches have been tested, divided into two main groups: pixel-based and neighborhood-based. The validation metrics show that determining the most common vegetation type classes in the neighborhood of 5 x 5 pixels provides the best results. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient obtained from five-fold cross validation of the results are 82.97% and 0.75, respectively. The corresponding producer's accuracies range from 36.74% to 97.99% and user's accuracies range from 46.31% to 98.43%. The proposed methodology proved to be applicable for mapping woody vegetation in Serbia and shows a potential to be implemented in other areas as well. Further testing is necessary to confirm such assumptions.

TI  - Social Antinomies of Linguistic Consciousness <i>Russian Blogosphere Debates Crimea</i>'<i>s Incorporation</i>
T2  - COMMUNIST AND POST-COMMUNIST STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on the debate over Crimea's accession. The content analysis relies on data collected during the first and most turbulent year of Crimea's incorporation, which started with the decision to conduct a referendum on the Crimean status and then to declare Crimea's independence in March 2014. The sample consists of 50 entries published on LiveJournal, both posts and commentaries. We have discovered and problematized severe disagreements in bloggers' worldview that give rise to the antinomies of bloggers' linguistic consciousness. By this, we mean the use of words with opposite connotations relating to the same event within the same blog and an inconsistency between bloggers' perception of the event and the affective meanings of lexical items attached to it. Our main point is that Crimea's accession prompts bloggers to reduce this dissonance by "rolling up the semantic rainbow," that is, by destroying meanings with rigid binary semantic opposition, which thereby further exacerbates deep-rooted divisions within Russian society where patriots and liberals increasingly keep apart.

TI  - Anaphylactic Reaction to Lymphazurin 1% during Breast Reconstruction Surgery: An Uncommon but Serious Complication
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymphazurin 1% (isosulfan blue dye) is the most frequently used blue dye in the United States, and it is commonly used for sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer patients. Although cases of allergic reaction to lymphazurin have been reported in the general surgery literature, to our knowledge, no cases of an adverse reaction to isosulfan blue have been reported in the plastic surgery literature. We describe a case of an intraoperative biphasic anaphylactic reaction to isosulfan blue in a female patient undergoing bilateral mastectomy and immediate bilateral DIEP breast reconstruction. The severity of her anaphylactic reaction required that we stop flap dissection and abort the reconstruction. Although an allergic reaction is uncommon, recognizing the signs of an acute hypersensitivity reaction is critical to good outcomes in these situations. Given the volume of combined breast oncologic and breast reconstruction surgeries and the increasing number of vascularized lymph node transfer and lymphovenous anastomosis performed annually, it is essential for the plastic surgeon to be cognizant of this rare hypersensitivity reaction.

TI  - Intercomparison of In Situ Sensors for Ground-Based Land Surface Temperature Measurements
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable in the determination of land surface energy exchange processes from local to global scales. Accurate ground measurements of LST are necessary for a number of applications including validation of satellite LST products or improvement of both climate and numerical weather prediction models. With the objective of assessing the quality of in situ measurements of LST and to evaluate the quantitative uncertainties in the ground-based LST measurements, intensive field experiments were conducted at NOAA's Air Resources Laboratory (ARL)'s Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion Division (ATDD) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA, from October 2015 to January 2016. The results of the comparison of LSTs retrieved by three narrow angle broadband infrared temperature sensors (IRT), hemispherical longwave radiation (LWR) measurements by pyrgeometers, forward looking infrared camera with direct LSTs by multiple thermocouples (TC), and near surface air temperature (AT) are presented here. The brightness temperature (BT) measurements by the IRTs agreed well with a bias of <0.23 degrees C, and root mean square error (RMSE) of <0.36 degrees C. The daytime LST(TC) and LST(IRT) showed better agreement (bias = 0.26 degrees C and RMSE = 0.67 degrees C) than with LST(LWR) (bias > 1.1 and RMSE > 1.46 degrees C). In contrast, the difference between nighttime LSTs by IRTs, TCs, and LWR were <0.47 degrees C, whereas nighttime AT explained >81% of the variance in LST(IRT) with a bias of 2.64 degrees C and RMSE of 3.6 degrees C. To evaluate the annual and seasonal differences in LST(IRT), LST(LWR) and AT, the analysis was extended to four grassland sites in the USA. For the annual dataset of LST, the bias between LST (IRT) and LST (LWR) was <0.7 degrees C, except at the semiarid grassland (1.5 degrees C), whereas the absolute bias between AT and LST at the four sites were <2 degrees C. The monthly difference between LST (IRT) and LST (LWR) (or AT) reached up to 2 degrees C (5 degrees C), whereas half-hourly differences between LSTs and AT were several degrees in magnitude depending on the site characteristics, time of the day and the season.

TI  - Quanta Photogrammetry of Experimental Geodetic Satellite for remote detection of micrometeoroid and orbital debris impacts
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The conventional detection of micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) impacts on satellites is based on insitu sensing or direct, visual inspection of the retrieved surface elements exposed to the particle flux and thus requires active in-orbit operations. We propose Quanta Photogrammetry (QPM) as an optical method for remote detection of surface structural anomalies of passive satellites by measuring solar photon flux reflected off the satellite surface towards the ground detection system.The hypertemporal light curves of the Experimental Geodetic Satellite - Ajisai (NORAD 16908, altitude of 1490 km) are collected with the state-of-the-art photon counting system designed and operated by the Graz Satellite Laser Ranging Observatory (Austria). QPM utilizes the inertial attitude model of the satellite to project the high-rate photometric samples onto the spacecraft bodyfixed frame. The single-photon light curves collected from Oct 2015 until Jan. 2018 are used to map reflectivity of 149 mirror panels on-board Ajisai (approx. size of 20 x 20 cm each) and reveal relatively small, irregularly shaped and spot-like anomalies that can indicate surface degradation due to the long-term environmental interactions and MMOD hypervelocity impacts.

TI  - Combining MWL and MSG SEVIRI Satellite Signals for Rainfall Detection and Estimation
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate rainfall detection and estimation are essential for many research and operational applications. Traditional rainfall detection and estimation techniques have achieved considerable success but with limitations. Thus, in this study, the relationships between the gauge (point measurement) and the microwave links (MWL) rainfall (line measurement), and the MWL to the satellite observations (area-wide measurement) are investigated for (area-wide) rainfall detection and rain rate retrieval. More precisely, we investigate if the combination of MWL with Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite signals could improve rainfall detection and rainfall rate estimates. The investigated procedure includes an initial evaluation of the MWL rainfall estimates using gauge measurements, followed by a joint analysis of the rainfall estimates with the satellite signals by means of a conceptual model in which clouds with high cloud top optical thickness and large particle sizes have high rainfall probabilities and intensities. The analysis produced empirical thresholds that were used to test the capability of the MSG satellite data to detect rainfall on the MWL. The results from Kenya, during the "long rains" of 2013, 2014, and 2018 show convincing performance and reveal the potential of MWL and MSG data for area-wide rainfall detection.

M3  - Article
AB  - Examined is the theme of Russian constructivism and formalism. The main idea of the article is, that ideas of such were felt, expressed and formulated at the dawn of the 20th century, formed the entire content and foundation of post-modernism. Having become the worldview of the masses, post-modernism does not leave themes and cliches that were set at the beginning of the century. As always and everywhere, the main trends arise immediately and entirely. So, at the beginning of the 20th century the problem field of the epoch was outlined, i.e. the foundation of phonology was formed, interest in the "fairy tale" was set, the role of the unconscious was actualized, the meaning of time was revealed, language received an ontological status, and the concept of "game" post-modern reflection. The article attempts to update Russian constructivism and formalism to demonstrate foundations of post-modernism.

TI  - Imaging of Trace Elements Using Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry: Emerging New Applications
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The qualitative and quantitative determination of trace elements is a stronghold of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Whereas in most cases the concentrations of a series of elements are determined in the bulk sample (often requiring a digestion upfront), the use of laser ablation (LA) in combination with ICP-MS allows further insight into an isotope of a given element within a sample, with the added benefit of avoiding labor intensive and contamination-prone digestion processes. LA-ICP-MS also allows the analysis of small samples with highly localized differences in trace elemental concentrations. Higher sensitivity and better interference removal using triple quadrupole instrumentation, as well as faster laser systems with specialized ablation cells enabling fast washout of material from individual laser pulses, has paved the way for new applications for LA-ICP-MS. The software supported recombination of data generated in a series of line scans covering the entire area of a sample. This was in conjunction with information on the laser position over time (using ablation rate, spot size, and stage movement velocity), allowing for the creation of a full image of elemental distributions in a sample. This is especially useful for biological samples, where the role of trace elements involved in biological processes is often unknown. This article will outline the principle of LA-ICP-MS for imaging applications, highlighting its potential to gain additional insights into the field of bioanalysis and metallomics. More specifically, the technique will be used to track the effect of environmental pollution on the distribution of heavy metals in the brain of a sentinel species in a highly urban area.

TI  - Remote sensing data retouching based on image inpainting algorithms in the forgery generation problem
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate image retouching algorithms for generating forgery Earth remote sensing data. We provide an overview of existing neural network solutions in the field of generation and inpainting of remote sensing images. To retouch Earth remote sensing data, we use image-inpainting algorithms based on convolutional neural networks and generative-adversarial neural networks. We pay special attention to a generative neural network with a separate contour prediction block that includes two series-connected generative-adversarial subnets. The first subnet inpaints contours of the image within the retouched area. The second subnet uses the inpainted contours to generate the resulting retouch area. As a basis for comparison, we use exemplar-based algorithms of image inpainting. We carry out computational experiments to study the effectiveness of these algorithms when retouching natural data of remote sensing of various types. We perform a comparative analysis of the quality of the algorithms considered, depending on the type, shape and size of the retouched objects and areas. We give qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the efficiency of the studied image inpainting algorithms when retouching Earth remote sensing data. We experimentally prove the advantage of generative-competitive neural networks in the construction of forgery remote sensing data.

TI  - Urban land cover mapping under the Local Climate Zone scheme using Sentinel-2 and PALSAR-2 data
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and spectral heterogeneity of urban areas makes land cover classification a challenging process. In this study, we highlight the potential of combined multi-spectral Sentinel-2 and fully polarimetric PALSAR-2 data for land cover classification in dense urban areas, based on the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme. We classified differently combined spectral and backscattering characteristics using the subspace method in comparison with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) methods. Results show that, (i) the overall accuracy (OA) was 65.9% for the Sentinel-2 data, (ii) higher OA (71.9%) was achieved by adding four intensity images of PALSAR-2 to Sentinel-2, (iii) the inclusion of decomposed components increased OA to 72.8%, and (iv) the highest OA (73.3%) was achieved using all features. These results suggest that the inclusion of different backscattering characteristics disproportionately improved classification accuracy from using multi-spectral data alone. The results of comparison between different methods show that the subspace method performed better than SVM and MLC, particularly when high-dimensional data were used. The subspace method classified particularly well for some specific LCZ classes which are easily mixed between each other. It provides a promising option for LCZ mapping.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node technique in early-stage ovarian cancer (SENTOV): a phase II clinical trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Early-stage ovarian cancer might represent an ideal disease scenario for sentinel lymph node application. Nevertheless, the published experience seems to be limited. Our objective was to assess the feasibility and safety concerns of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with clinical stage I-II ovarian cancer.Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of 20 patients with histologically confirmed ovarian cancer.Tc-99m and indocyanine green were injected into both the utero-ovarian and infundibulopelvic ligament stump, if they were present, during surgical staging. An intraoperative gamma probe and near-infrared fluorescence imaging were used to detect the sentinel lymph nodes. Inclusion criteria included: >18 years of age, suspicious adnexal mass (unilateral or bilateral) at ultrasound and CT imaging or confirmed ovarian tumor after previous surgery (unilateral or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy). Adverse events were recorded through postoperative day 30. The primary trial end point was to report adverse events related to the technique, including the use of(99m)Tc and ICG intraperitoneally, as well as the feasibility of the technique.Results A total of 20 patients were included in the analysis. Sentinel lymph nodes were detected in 14/15 (93%) pelvic and all 20 (100%) para-aortic regions. Five patients did not have utero-ovarian injection because of prior hysterectomy. The mean time from injection to sentinel lymph node resection was 53 +/- 15 min (range; 30-80). The mean number of harvested sentinel lymph nodes was 2.2 +/- 1.5 (range; 0-5) lymph nodes in the pelvis and 3.3 +/- 1.8 (range; 1-7) lymph nodes in the para-aortic region. There were no adverse intraoperative events, nor any within the 30 days of follow-up related with the technique.Conclusion Sentinel lymph node mapping in early-stage ovarian cancer is feasible without major intraoperative or < 30 days safety concerns.

TI  - OLCI A/B Tandem Phase Analysis, Part 2: Benefits of Sensors Harmonisation for Level 2 Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is a follow-up of a full methodology for the homogenisation and harmonisation of the two Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) payloads based on the tandem phase analysis. Sentinel-3B was manoeuvred into a tandem configuration with its operational twin Sentinel-3A already in orbit few weeks after its launch, which was followed by a short drift phase during which Sentinel-3B was progressively moved to a specific orbit phasing of 140 degrees separation from the sentinel-3A. Harmonisation is performed at Level 1 for the radiometric alignment of the OLCI-A TOA radiances to the ones of OLCI-B, considering the slight spectral differences between the two instruments. The benefits of this harmonisation for the main Level 2 products are assessed in the present manuscript for both land and water products. The results validate such benefits showing accuracy between the two sensors after harmonisation better than the products requirements specifications. For the water processing branch, this accuracy opens a path toward an ensemble Sentinel-3 system vicarious calibration with ground-truth measurements. For land products, the tandem phase analysis is also an opportunity to demonstrate that the terrestrial chlorophyll index product requires improvements of the preliminary spectral adjustment of the red-edge channel at 709 nm. As comparisons from the measurements acquired over the tandem phase provides confidence in the alignment of the OLCI-A and OLCI-B series of products, preliminary analysis of the measurements acquired over the drift phase provides the first insights into the sensitivity of the processing algorithms to the geometry of acquisition as well as to calibration residuals of the OLCI field-of-view. As the harmonisation currently performs a radiometric alignment of OLCI-A to OLCI-B, the question of the reference sensor for operational implementation of the harmonisation raises concerns on the individual quality of the calibration of each sensor, notably their across-track consistency. Following the investigations performed at Level 1, where relatively strong calibration residuals are shown between the OLCI cameras and very similarly for both instruments; we discuss the impact of these residuals at L2 using an empirical correction and further conclude with the need to address these problematics with more attention in the future. We conclude with the extreme usefulness of the tandem phase analysis, presently for Level 2 products, and the need to further monitor the temporal stability of the cross-calibration of the OLCI payloads with a view to implementing their harmonisation at operational level.

TI  - Automatic Generation of Sentinel-1 Continental Scale DInSAR Deformation Time Series through an Extended P-SBAS Processing Pipeline in a Cloud Computing Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present in this work an advanced processing pipeline for continental scale differential synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) deformation time series generation, which is based on the parallel small baseline subset (P-SBAS) approach and on the joint exploitation of Sentinel-1 (S-1) interferometric wide swath (IWS) SAR data, continuous global navigation satellite system (GNSS) position time-series, and cloud computing (CC) resources. We first briefly describe the basic rationale of the adopted P-SBAS processing approach, tailored to deal with S-1 IWS SAR data and to be implemented in a CC environment, highlighting the innovative solutions that have been introduced in the processing chain we present. They mainly consist in a series of procedures that properly exploit the available GNSS time series with the aim of identifying and filtering out possible residual atmospheric artifacts that may affect the DInSAR measurements. Moreover, significant efforts have been carried out to improve the P-SBAS processing pipeline automation and robustness, which represent crucial issues for interferometric continental scale analysis. Then, a massive experimental analysis is presented. In this case, we exploit: (i) the whole archive of S-1 IWS SAR images acquired over a large portion of Europe, from descending orbits, (ii) the continuous GNSS position time series provided by the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory at the University of Nevada, Reno, USA (UNR-NGL) available for the investigated area, and (iii) the ONDA platform, one of the Copernicus Data and Information Access Services (DIAS). The achieved results demonstrate the capability of the proposed solution to successfully retrieve the DInSAR time series relevant to such a huge area, opening new scenarios for the analysis and interpretation of these ground deformation measurements.

TI  - Areal Extent of Dust Emission Events and Source Geomorphology in Northern Africa from MSG-SEVIRI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we (1) mapped the areal extent of current dust sources over Northern Africa between 8 degrees W-31 degrees E and 22 degrees N - Mediterranean coast; and (2) identified and characterized the geomorphic units and soil types that emit dust from these areas. We used the full resolution (3 km) data from the MSG-SEVIRI to map dust sources over a 2-year period between 2005-2006, and examined these regions with remotely sensed images and geomorphic and soil maps. A total of >2600 individual dust emission events were mapped; with frequency up to 34 events in the 2-year study period. The areal extent of dust emission sources exhibited a lognormal distribution with most sources ranging from 20 to 130 km(2). Most dust events were singular and related to a variety of specific geomorphic units. Dust events that created hotspots were mostly located over playas and fluvial landforms, and to a lesser extent over sand dunes and anthropogenic affected regions. About 20% of dust hotspots were offset a few kilometers from clear geomorphic units. Quantitative analysis of emissions revealed that dust sourced from various geomorphic units, among them playas (12%) and fluvial systems (10%). The importance of sand dunes as dust-emission sources greatly differs between examined datasets (7% vs. 30%). Our study emphasizes the importance of scattered dust emission events that are not considered as hotspots, as these sources are usually neglected in dust emission modeling.

TI  - Displacements Monitoring over Czechia by IT4S1 System for Automatised Interferometric Measurements Using Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1 satellite system continuously observes European countries at a relatively high revisit frequency of six days per orbital track. Given the Sentinel-1 configuration, most areas in Czechia are observed every 1-2 days by different tracks in a moderate resolution. This is attractive for various types of analyses by various research groups. The starting point for interferometric (InSAR) processing is an original data provided in a Single Look Complex (SLC) level. This work represents advantages of storing data augmented to a specifically corrected level of data, SLC-C. The presented database contains Czech nationwide Sentinel-1 data stored in burst units that have been pre-processed to the state of a consistent well-coregistered dataset of SLC-C. These are resampled SLC data with their phase values reduced by a topographic phase signature, ready for fast interferometric analyses (an interferogram is generated by a complex conjugate between two stored SLC-C files). The data can be used directly into multitemporal interferometry techniques, e.g., Persistent Scatterers (PS) or Small Baseline (SB) techniques applied here. A further development of the nationwide system utilising SLC-C data would lead into a dynamic state where every new pre-processed burst triggers a processing update to detect unexpected changes from InSAR time series and therefore provides a signal for early warning against a potential dangerous displacement, e.g., a landslide, instability of an engineering structure or a formation of a sinkhole. An update of the processing chain would also allow use of cross-polarised Sentinel-1 data, needed for polarimetric analyses. The current system is running at a national supercomputing centre IT4Innovations in interconnection to the Czech Copernicus Collaborative Ground Segment (CESNET), providing fast on-demand InSAR results over Czech territories. A full nationwide PS processing using data over Czechia was performed in 2017, discovering several areas of land deformation. Its downsampled version and basic findings are demonstrated within the article.

TI  - An Artificial Intelligence Approach to Predict Gross Primary Productivity in the Forests of South Korea Using Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many process-based models for carbon flux predictions have faced a wide range of uncertainty issues. The complex interactions between the atmosphere and the forest ecosystems can lead to uncertainties in the model result. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, which are novel methods to resolve complex and nonlinear problems, have shown a possibility for forest ecological applications. This study is the first step to present an objective comparison between multiple AI models for the daily forest gross primary productivity (GPP) prediction using satellite remote sensing data. We built the AI models such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and deep neural network (DNN) using in-situ observations from an eddy covariance (EC) flux tower and satellite remote sensing data such as albedo, aerosol, temperature, and vegetation index. We focused on the Gwangneung site from the Korea Regional Flux Network (KoFlux) in South Korea, 2006-2015. As a result, the DNN model outperformed the other three models through an intensive hyperparameter optimization, with the correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.93 and the mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.68 g m(-2)d(-1)in a 10-fold blind test. We showed that the DNN model also performed well under conditions of cold waves, heavy rain, and an autumnal heatwave. As future work, a comprehensive comparison with the result of process-based models will be necessary using a more extensive EC database from various forest ecosystems.

TI  - A Study on Seasonal Dynamics of Suspended Particulate Matter in Korean Coastal Waters Using GOCI
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of suspended particulate matter (SPM) is a key to understanding the turbulent sediment flow in the Heuksan mud belt (HMB), located along the southwestern coast of the Korean Peninsula. The purpose of this study was to investigate intra-annual variability in remotely sensed SPM data derived from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) around the HMB over a period of 1 year (2013). Monthly averaged SPM images obtained by the GOCI showed pronounced seasonal changes in turbid water. Dominant environmental factors for intra-annual and diurnal variability of SPM, including river discharge, winds, and tides, were assessed. Monsoon wind dominated seasonal variation in SPM dispersion; the extent of turbid water increased during the winter and decreased during the summer months. Diurnal variation observed from 1-day composite images showed clearly that tidal current was the dominant factor affecting the short-term dispersal pattern of SPM. The gate-controlled river discharge showed the reverse seasonal pattern compared with SPM concentration. However, a turbid plume from the Geum River observed in GOCI data could support the identification of this river as the major source of the HMB. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the spatial and temporal dynamics of the HMB, including intra-annual and diurnal variability, can be successfully detected using the GOCI.

TI  - Characterization of the unprecedented polynya events north of Greenland in 2017/2018 using remote sensing and reanalysis data
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on an ice concentration threshold of 90%, it has been identified that two polynya events occurred in the region north of Greenland during the 2017/2018 ice season. The winter event lasted from February 20 to March 3, 2018 and the summer event persisted from August 2 to September 5, 2018. The minimum ice concentration derived from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) observations was 72% and 65% during the winter and summer events, respectively. The occurrence of both events can be related to strengthened southerly winds associated with an increased east-west zonal surface level air pressure gradient across the north Greenland due to perturbation of mid-troposphere polar vortex. The relatively warm air temperature during the 2017/2018 freezing season in comparison with previous years, together with the occurrence of the winter polynya, formed favourable pre-conditions for ice field fracturing in summer, which promoted the formation of the summer polynya. Diminished southerly winds and increased cover of new ice over the open water were the dominant factors for the disappearance of the winter polynya, whereas increased ice inflow from the north was the primary factor behind the closure of the summer polynya. Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images were found better suited than AMSR2 observations for quantification of a new ice product during the polynya event because the SAR images have high potential for mapping of different sea ice regimes with finely spatial resolution. The unprecedented polynya events north of Greenland in 2017/2018 are important from the perspective of Arctic sea ice loss because they occurred in a region that could potentially be the last "Arctic sea ice refuge" in future summers.

M3  - Article
AB  - Human beings are the products of many thousands of years of biological evolution, and this process occurs in accordance with the principles of natural selection originally articulated and defended by Charles Darwin and developed and defended further in the modern synthesis of the 20th century. In this paper, I consider how it may be thought that this fact threatens the rationality of belief in the Christian God. These threats are countenanced with respect to issues of design, randomness, suffering, and the objectivity of ethics. I argue that while some versions of Christian belief, such as those grounded in a literalist reading of the Genesis creation story or those committed to the image of God thesis, may be threatened by a Darwinian worldview, there are nonetheless plausible versions of Christian belief that are immune to Darwinian challenges.

TI  - Using remote sensing to assess the effect of trees on millet yield in complex parklands of Central Senegal
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry is pointed out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report as a key option to respond to climate change and land degradation while simultaneously improving global food security (IPCC, 2019). Faidherbia albida parklands are widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa and provide several ecosystem services to populations, notably an increase in crop productivity. While remote sensing has been proven useful for crop yield assessment in smallholder farming system, it has so far ignored the woody component. We propose an original approach combining remote sensing, landscape ecology and statistical modelling to i) improve the accuracy of millet yield prediction in parklands and ii) identify the main drivers of millet yield spatial variation. The parkland of Central Senegal was chosen as a case study. Firstly, we calibrated a remote sensing-based linear model that accounted for vegetation productivity and tree density to predict millet yield. Integrating parkland structure improved the accuracy of yield estimation. The best model based on a combination of Green Difference Vegetation Index and number of trees in the field explained 70% of observed yield variability (relative Root Mean Squared Error (RRMSE) of 28%). The best model based solely on vegetation productivity (no information on parkland structure) explained only 46% of the observed variability (RRMSE = 34%). Secondly we investigated the drivers of the spatial variability in estimated yield using Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm (GBM) and biophysical and management factors derived from geospatial data. The GBM model explained 81% of yield spatial variability. Predominant drivers were soil nutrient availability (i.e. soil total nitrogen and total phosphorous) and woody cover in the surrounding landscape of fields. Our results show that millet yield increases with woody cover in the surrounding landscape of fields up to a woody cover of 35%. These findings have to be strengthened by testing the approach in more diversified and/or denser parklands. Our study illustrates that recent advances in earth observations open up new avenues to improve the monitoring of parkland systems in smallholder context.

TI  - Identification and Distribution of Novel Cressdnaviruses and Circular Molecules in Four Penguin Species in South Georgia and the Antarctic Peninsula
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - There is growing interest in uncovering the viral diversity present in wild animal species. The remote Antarctic region is home to a wealth of uncovered microbial diversity, some of which is associated with its megafauna, including penguin species, the dominant avian biota. Penguins interface with a number of other biota in their roles as marine mesopredators and several species overlap in their ranges and habitats. To characterize the circular single-stranded viruses related to those in the phylumCressdnaviricotafrom these environmental sentinel species, cloacal swabs (n= 95) were obtained from King Penguins in South Georgia, and congeneric Adelie Penguins, Chinstrap Penguins, and Gentoo Penguins across the South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula. Using a combination of high-throughput sequencing, abutting primers-based PCR recovery of circular genomic elements, cloning, and Sanger sequencing, we detected 97 novel sequences comprising 40 ssDNA viral genomes and 57 viral-like circular molecules from 45 individual penguins. We present their detection patterns, with Chinstrap Penguins harboring the highest number of new sequences. The novel Antarctic viruses identified appear to be host-specific, while one circular molecule was shared between sympatric Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins. We also report viral genotype sharing between three adult-chick pairs, one in each Pygoscelid species. Sequence similarity network approaches coupled with Maximum likelihood phylogenies of the clusters indicate the 40 novel viral genomes do not fall within any known viral families and likely fall within the recently established phylumCressdnaviricotabased on their replication-associated protein sequences. Similarly, 83 capsid protein sequences encoded by the viruses or viral-like circular molecules identified in this study do not cluster with any of those encoded by classified viral groups. Further research is warranted to expand knowledge of the Antarctic virome and would help elucidate the importance of viral-like molecules in vertebrate host evolution.

TI  - Open-Surface River Extraction Based on Sentinel-2 MSI Imagery and DEM Data: Case Study of the Upper Yellow River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is essential for the survival of plants, animals, and human beings. It is imperative to effectively manage and protect aquatic resources to sustain life on Earth. Small tributaries are an important water resource originating in mountain areas, they play an important role in river network evolution and water transmission and distribution. Snow and cloud cover cast shadows leading to misclassification in optical remote sensing images, especially in high-mountain regions. In this study, we effectively extract small and open-surface river information in the Upper Yellow River by fusing Sentinel-2 with 10 m resolution optical imagery corresponding to average discharge of the summer flood season and the 90 m digital elevation model (DEM) data. To effectively minimize the impact of the underlying surface, the study area was divided into five sub-regions according to underlying surface, terrain, and altitude features. We minimize the effects of cloud, snow, and shadow cover on the extracted river surface via a modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), revised normalized difference water index (RNDWI), automated water extraction index (AWEI), and Otsu threshold method. Water index calculations and water element extractions are operated on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The river network vectors derived from the DEM data are used as constraints to minimize background noise in the extraction results. The accuracy of extracted river widths is assessed using different statistical indicators such as the R-square (R-2) value, root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE). The results show the integrity of the extracted small river surface by theRNDWIindex is optimal. Overall, the statistical evaluation indicates the accuracy of the extracted river widths is satisfactory. The effective river width that can be accurately extracted based on satellite images is three times the image resolution. Sentinel-2 MSI images with a spatial resolution of 10 m are used to find that the rivers over 30 m wide can be connectedly, accurately extracted with the proposed method. Results of this work can enrich the river width database in the northeast Tibetan Plateau and its boundary region. The river width information may provide a foundation for studying the spatiotemporal changes in channel geometry of river systems in high-mountain regions. They can also supplement the necessary characteristic river widths information for the river network in unmanned mountain areas, which is of great significance for the accurate simulation of the runoff process in the hydrological model.

TI  - An evaluation of advanced baseline imager fire radiative power based wildfire emissions using carbon monoxide observed by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument across the conterminous United States
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass-burning emissions (BBE) profoundly affect climate and air quality. BBE have been estimated using various methods, including satellite-based fire radiative power (FRP). However, BBE estimates show very large variability and the accuracy of emissions estimation is poorly understood due to the lack of good reference data. We evaluated fire emissions estimated using FRP from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on GOES-R (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites-R) by comparing with the Sentinel 5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) Carbon Monoxide (CO) over 41 wildfires across the United States during July 2018-October 2019. All the ABI FRP-based CO and TROPOMI CO emissions were significantly correlated and showed a very good agreement with a coefficient of determination of 0.94 and an accuracy of 13-18%. We further reported a CO emission coefficient of 29.92 +/- 2.39 g MJ(-1)based on ABI FRP and TROPOMI CO, which can be used to directly estimate BBE from FRP observed from satellites. Based on the CO emission coefficient and ABI FRP, we finally estimated a monthly mean CO of 596 Gg across the Conterminous United States for June-September 2018.

TI  - Analysis of the Contribution Rate of the Influencing Factors to Land Subsidence in the Eastern Beijing Plain, China Based on Extremely Randomized Trees (ERT) Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a common geological hazard, land subsidence is widely distributed in the Eastern Beijing Plain. The pattern of evolution of this geological phenomenon is controlled by many factors, including groundwater level change in different aquifers, compressible layers of different thicknesses, and static and dynamic loads. First, based on the small baseline subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) technique, we employed 47 ENVISAT ASAR images and 48 RADARSAT-2 images to acquire the ground deformation of the Beijing Plain from June 2003 to November 2015 and then validated the results using leveling benchmark monitoring. Second, we innovatively calculated additional stress to obtain static and dynamic load information. Finally, we evaluated the contribution rate of the influencing factors to land subsidence by using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) and extremely randomized trees (ERT) machine learning methods. The SBAS-InSAR outcomes revealed that the maximum deformation rate was 110.7 mm/year from 2003 to 2010 and 144.4 mm/year from 2010 to 2015. The SBAS-InSAR results agreed well with the leveling benchmark monitoring results; the correlation coefficients were 0.97 and 0.96 during the 2003-2010 and 2013-2015 periods, respectively. The contribution rate of the second confined aquifer to the cumulative land subsidence was 49.3% from 2003 to 2010, accounting for the largest proportion; however, its contribution rate decreased to 23.4% from 2010 to 2015. The contribution rate of the third confined aquifer to the cumulative land subsidence increased from 2003 to 2015. Although the contribution of additional stress engendered from static and dynamic loads to the cumulative land subsidence was slight, it had a significant effect on the uneven land subsidence, with a contribution rate of 33.8% from 2003 to 2010 and 23.1% from 2010 to 2015. These findings provide scientific support for mitigating hazards associated with land subsidence.

TI  - Pattern of spatial evolution of rural settlements in the Jizhou District of China during 1962-2030
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has led not only to the expansion of urban areas but has also greatly influenced rural development and the natural environment. When proposing schemes for rural settlement, and promoting sustainable development and living conditions in rural areas, it is important both to explore long-term trends of evolution and predict trends of development. Remote sensing images are useful to this end, but most date no further back than the 1980s, thus making it difficult to describe the spatial evolution of rural settlements over longer periods. In view of this, this paper uses decrypted remote sensing data from the KeyHole military satellite on the Jizhou District of China, and pushes the interval back by 20 years (to 1962) to study the long-term evolution of the spatial pattern of rural settlements over a longer time scale. By setting different development scenarios, we use the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small Region Extent (CLUE-S) model to simulate and predict the evolutionary trends of rural settlements in Jizhou District in 2030. The results show that the evolution of the spatial pattern of rural settlements in this area during 1962-2015 can be divided into three stages: From 1962 to 1980, the number of rural settlements decreased continually, their boundaries gradually became more regular, and they were randomly distributed throughout the study area. However, from 1980 to 2000, the number, area, and spatial morphological features of rural settlements did not change much compared to the other two periods. From 2000 to 2015, the number of settlements increased drastically, and the boundaries became irregular and were somehow centralized. The evolutionary trend of rural settlements was found to be different under different scenarios of development. In the new-type urbanization scenario, the total area of rural settlements was projected to decrease by 2.23%, and regions where urbanization had a strong influence on rural settlements were concentrated in the southern-central part of Jizhou District. Moreover, the rural settlements are converted mainly into urban land and other construction land. In the tourism development scenario, the total area of rural settlements increased by 7.89%, and regions where tourism had a strong influence on rural settlements were concentrated in the northern mountainous areas of Jizhou District.

TI  - Spaceborne SAR Data for Regional Urban Mapping Using a Robust Building Extractor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of urbanization, timely and accurate information on the spatial distribution of urban areas is essential for urban planning, environmental protection and sustainable urban development. To date, the main problem of urban mapping using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are that nonbuilding objects with high backscattering cause high false alarms, while small-scale buildings with low backscattering result in omission errors. In this paper, a robust building-area extraction extractor is proposed to solve the above problems. The specific work includes (1) building a multiscale and multicategory building area dataset to learn enough building features in various areas; (2) designing a multiscale extraction network based on the residual convolutional block (ResNet50) and a pyramid-based pooling module to extract more discriminative features of building areas and introducing the focal loss item as the object function of the network to further extract the small-scale building areas and (3) eliminating the false alarms using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) index. GF-3 SAR data with a 10-m resolution of four regions in China are used to validate our method, and the regional building-area mapping results with overall accuracy above 85% and kappa coefficient not less than 0.73 are obtained. Compared with the current popular networks and the global human settlement layer (GHSL) product, our method shows better extraction results and higher accuracy in multiscale building areas. The experiments using Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data show that the proposed method has good robustness with different SAR data sources.

TI  - Comparison of summer Arctic sea ice surface temperatures from<i>in situ</i>and MODIS measurements
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship-borne infrared radiometric measurements conducted during the Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (CHINARE) in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2017 were used for in situ validation studies of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sea ice surface temperature (IST) product. Observations of sea ice were made using a KT19.85 radiometer mounted on the Chinese icebreakerXuelongbetween July and September over six years. The MODIS-derived ISTs from the satellites, Terra and Aqua, both show close correspondence with ISTs derived from radiometer spot measurements averaged over areas of 4 kmx4 km, spanning the temperature range of 262-280 K with a +/- 1.7 K (Aqua) and +/- 1.6 K (Terra) variation. The consistency of the results over each year indicates that MODIS provides a suitable platform for remotely deriving surface temperature data when the sky is clear. Investigation into factors that cause the MODIS IST bias (defined as the difference between MODIS and KT19.85 ISTs) shows that large positive bias is caused by increased coverage of leads and melt ponds, while large negative bias mostly arises from undetected clouds. Thin vapor fog forming over Arctic sea ice may explain the cold bias when cloud cover is below 20%.

TI  - Monitoring evolution of melt ponds on first-year and multiyear sea ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago with optical satellite data
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of melt ponds on Arctic sea ice in summer is one of the main factors that affect sea-ice albedo and hence the polar climate system. Due to the different spectral properties of open water, melt pond and sea ice, the melt pond fraction (MPF) can be retrieved using a fully constrained least-squares algorithm, which shows a high accuracy with root mean square error similar to 0.06 based on the validation experiment using WorldView-2 image. In this study, the evolution of ponds on first-year and multiyear ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago was compared based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images. The relationships of pond coverage with air temperature and albedo were analysed. The results show that the pond coverage on first-year ice changed dramatically with seasonal maximum of 54%, whereas that on multiyear ice changed relatively flat with only 30% during the entire melting period. During the stage of pond formation, the ponds expanded rapidly when the temperature increased to over 0 degrees C for three consecutive days. Sea-ice albedo shows a significantly negative correlation (R = -1) with the MPF in melt season and increases gradually with the refreezing of ponds and sea ice.

TI  - Precipitation Characteristics of an Abrupt Heavy Rainfall Event over the Complex Terrain of Southwest China Observed by the FY-4A Satellite and Doppler Weather Radar
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - On 22 July 2019, mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) with an abrupt heavy rainfall event (AHRE) hit Shuicheng County of Guizhou Province in Southwest China causing landslide and debris flow secondary disasters. The AHRE over the complex terrain of Shuicheng County had differences in location and intensity during two stages of the event. The two stages could be divided into different rainfall types (topographic rainfall and synoptic-weather-related rainfall) according to the spatiotemporal distribution and organization of MCSs based on surface and midlevel environmental field conditions. During the topographic rainfall stage, smaller meso-gamma-scale (2-20 km) convective cells with lower echo-top heights (6-10 km) occurred along the windward slope of the primary mountain peak. During the synoptic-weather-related rainfall stage, a meso-beta-scale (20-200 km) convective echo band with higher echo-top heights (10-14 km) occurred in the valley of the region. An adverse wind area (AWA) with distinct convergence of radar radial velocity existed over Shuicheng County. A formation mechanism analysis of the AHRE showed that topographic rainfall occurred in the warm and moist area, while synoptic-weather-related rainfall occurred due to local convergence and the intrusion of a cold tongue. Compared to the early stage, the cold tongue from the higher terrain superimposed over the warm sector at the base of major mountain ranges appeared to strengthen the rainfall.

TI  - Geographically and temporally weighted neural networks for satellite-based mapping of ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub>
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and station-measured PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 mu m) provides a promising approach for the monitoring of PM2.5. Previous models have generally only considered either the spatiotemporal heterogeneities of the AOD-PM2.5 relationship or the nonlinear relationship between AOD and PM2 5. In this paper, to simultaneously allow for the nonlinearity and spatiotemporal heterogeneities of the AOD-PM2.5 relationship, the geographically and temporally weighted neural network (GTWNN) model is proposed for the satellite-based estimation of ground-level PM2.5. The GTWNN model represents the nonlinear AOD-PM2.5 relationship via a generalized regression neural network, and is separately established for individual locations and times, to address the spatiotemporal heterogeneities of the AOD-PM2.5 relationship. Meanwhile, a spatiotemporal weighting scheme is incorporated in the GTWNN model to capture the local relations of samples for the training of the AOD-PM2.5 relationship. By the use of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD product, meteorological data, and MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data as input, the GTWNN model was verified using ground station PM2.5 measurements from China in 2015. The GTWNN model achieved sample-based cross-validation (CV) and site-based CV R-2 values of 0.80 and 0.79, respectively, and it outperformed the geographically and temporally weighted regression model (CV R-2: 0.75 and 0.73) and the daily geographically weighted regression model (CV R-2: 0.72 and 0.72). The proposed model implements the combination of geographical law and a neural network, and will be of great use for remote sensing retrieval of environmental variables.

TI  - CASEarth Poles Big Data for the Three Poles
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Unprecedented changes in the climate and environment have been observed in the three poles, including the North Pole, the South Pole, and the Third Pole-Tibetan Plateau. Although considerable data have been collected and several observation networks have been built in these polar regions, the three poles are relatively data-scarce regions due to inaccessible data acquisition, high-cost labor, and difficult living environments. To address the obstacles to better understanding the unprecedented changes in the three poles and their effects on the global environment and humans, there is a pressing need for better data acquisition, curation, integration, service, and application to support fundamental scientific research and sustainable development for the three poles. CASEarth Poles, a project within the framework of the "CAS Big Earth Data Science Engineering" program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, aims to construct a big data platform for the three poles. CASEarth Poles will be devoted to 1) breaking the bottleneck of polar data curation, integration, and sharing; 2) developing high-resolution remote sensing products over the three poles; 3) generating atmospheric reanalysis datasets for the polar regions; 4) exploring the synchronization, asynchronization, and teleconnection of the environmental changes in the three poles; 5) investigating the climate, water cycle, and ecosystem dynamics and the interactions among the multispheres in the polar regions and their global effects; and 6) supporting decision-making with regard to sea ice forecasting, infrastructure, and sustainable development in polar regions. CASEarth Poles will collaborate with international efforts to enable better data and information services for the three poles in the big data era.

TI  - Mapping global urban boundaries from the global artificial impervious area (GAIA) data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban boundaries, an essential property of cities, are widely used in many urban studies. However, extracting urban boundaries from satellite images is still a great challenge, especially at a global scale and a fine resolution. In this study, we developed an automatic delineation framework to generate a multi-temporal dataset of global urban boundaries (GUB) using 30 m global artificial impervious area (GAIA) data. First, we delineated an initial urban boundary by filling inner non-urban areas of each city. A kernel density estimation approach and cellular-automata based urban growth modeling were jointly used in this step. Second, we improved the initial urban boundaries around urban fringe areas, using a morphological approach by dilating and eroding the derived urban extent. We implemented this delineation on the Google Earth Engine platform and generated a 30 m resolution global urban boundary dataset in seven representative years (i.e. 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018). Our extracted urban boundaries show a good agreement with results derived from nighttime light data and human interpretation, and they can well delineate the urban extent of cities when compared with high-resolution Google Earth images. The total area of 65 582 GUBs, each of which exceeds 1 km(2), is 809 664 km(2)in 2018. The impervious surface areas account for approximately 60% of the total. From 1990 to 2018, the proportion of impervious areas in delineated boundaries increased from 53% to 60%, suggesting a compact urban growth over the past decades. We found that the United States has the highest per capita urban area (i.e. more than 900 m(2)) among the top 10 most urbanized nations in 2018. This dataset provides a physical boundary of urban areas that can be used to study the impact of urbanization on food security, biodiversity, climate change, and urban health. The GUB dataset can be accessed from http://data.ess.tsinghua.edu.cn.

TI  - CSVM Architectures for Pixel-Wise Object Detection in High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting objects becomes an increasingly important task in very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery analysis. With the development of GPU-computing capability, a growing number of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been designed to address the object detection challenge. However, compared with CPU, GPU is much more costly. Therefore, GPU-based methods are less attractive in practical applications. In this article, we propose a CPU-based method that is based on convolutional support vector machines (CSVMs) to address the object detection challenge in VHR images. Experiments are conducted on three VHR and two unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data sets with very limited training data. Results show that the proposed CSVM achieves competitive performance compared to U-Net which is an efficient CNN-based model designed for small training data sets.

TI  - Consistent Comparison of Remotely Sensed Sea Ice Concentration Products with ERA-Interim Reanalysis Data in Polar Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice concentration (SIC) plays a significant role in climate change research and ship's navigation in polar regions. Satellite-based SIC products have become increasingly abundant in recent years; however, the uncertainty of these products still exists and needs to be further investigated. To comprehensively evaluate the consistency of the SIC derived from different SIC algorithms in long time series and the whole polar regions, we compared four passive microwave (PM) satellite SIC products with the ERA-Interim sea ice fraction dataset during the period of 2015-2018. The PM SIC products include the SSMIS/ASI, AMSR2/BT, the Chinese FY3B/NT2, and FY3C/NT2. The results show that the remotely sensed SIC products derived from different SIC algorithms are generally in good consistency. The spatial and temporal distribution of discrepancy among satellite SIC products for both Arctic and Antarctic regions are also observed. The most noticeable difference for all the four SIC products mostly occurs in summer and at the marginal ice zone, indicating that large uncertainties exist in satellite SIC products in such period and areas. The SSMIS/ASI and AMSR2/BT show relatively better consistency with ERA-Interim in the Arctic and Antarctic, respectively, but they exhibit opposite bias (dry/wet) relative to the ERA-Interim data. The sea ice extent (SIE) and sea ice area (SIA) derived from PM and ERA-Interim SIC were also compared. It is found that the difference of PM SIE and SIA varies seasonally, which is in line with that of PM SIC, and the discrepancy between PM and ERA-Interim data is larger in Arctic than in Antarctic. We also noticed that different algorithms have different performances in different regions and periods; therefore, the hybrid of multiple algorithms is a promising way to improve the accuracy of SIC retrievals. It is expected that our findings can contribute to improving the satellite SIC algorithms and thus promote the application of these useful products in global climate change studies.

TI  - Effects of Winter Snow Cover on Spring Soil Moisture Based on Remote Sensing Data Product over Farmland in Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spring soil moisture (SM) is of great importance for monitoring agricultural drought and waterlogging in farmland areas. While winter snow cover has an important impact on spring SM, relatively little research has examined the correlation between winter snow cover and spring SM in great detail. To understand the effects of snow cover on SM over farmland, the relationship between winter snow cover parameters (maximum snow depth (MSD) and average snow depth (ASD)) and spring SM in Northeast China was examined based on 30 year passive microwave snow depth (SD) and SM remote-sensing products. Linear regression models based on winter snow cover were established to predict spring SM. Moreover, 4 year SD and SM data were applied to validate the performance of the linear regression models. Additionally, the effects of meteorological factors on spring SM also were analyzed using multiparameter linear regression models. Finally, as a specific application, the best-performing model was used to predict the probability of spring drought and waterlogging in farmland in Northeast China. Our results illustrated the positive effects of winter snow cover on spring SM. The average correlation coefficient (R) of winter snow cover and spring SM was above 0.5 (significant at a 95% confidence level) over farmland. The performance of the relationship between snow cover and SM in April was better than that in May. Compared to the multiparameter linear regression models in terms of fitting coefficient, MSD can be used as an important snow parameter to predict spring drought and waterlogging probability in April. Specifically, if the relative SM threshold is 50% when spring drought occurs in April, the prediction probability of the linear regression model concerning snow cover and spring SM can reach 74%. This study improved our understanding of the effects of winter snow cover on spring SM and will be beneficial for further studies on the prediction of spring drought.

TI  - Amplification of the Ocean Carbon Sink During El Ninos: Role of Poleward Ekman Transport and Influence on Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Amplification of the ocean carbon sink during El Nino events partially offset terrestrial biosphere carbon losses to the atmosphere, but uncertainties in the magnitude, timing, and spatial extent of the ocean response confound our understanding of the global carbon budget and its sensitivity to climate. Here, we examine the mechanisms controlling the anomalous tropical Pacific Ocean CO(2)drawdown during El Nino events harnessing multidecadal ocean pCO(2)observations in conjunction with a state-of-the-art ocean biogeochemical model. We show that poleward Ekman transport dramatically amplifies the near-equatorial pCO(2)anomaly identified in prior work and that this amplification varies considerably between El Nino events. During central Pacific events, the CO(2)flux anomaly can vary up to fourfold between events (2002/2003 vs. 2015/2016), but it always recedes during the boreal winter to spring transition and the poleward transport of the anomaly mostly extends into the Northern Hemisphere. During eastern Pacific events characterized by an equatorially centered intertropical convergence zone (e.g., 1997/1998), the intense CO(2)flux anomaly persists into boreal summer and can extend further into the Southern Hemisphere. The hemispheric asymmetry (northward vs. southward extension) and the termination (boreal winter/spring for central Pacific events vs. boreal summer for eastern Pacific events) of the ocean CO(2)response are tied to the El Nino dynamics in the near-equatorial region and also how it is amplified by poleward Ekman transport. Finally, we evaluate how differences in the ocean response influence atmospheric CO(2)and discuss the potential of atmospheric CO(2)satellite data to provide observational constraints.

TI  - Could the Buddha Have Been a Naturalist?
T2  - SOPHIA
M3  - Article
AB  - With the naturalist worldview having become widely accepted, the trend of naturalistic Buddhism has likewise become popular in both academic and religious circles. In this article, I preliminarily reflect on this naturalized approach to Buddhism in two main sections. In section 1, I point out that the Buddha rejects theistic beliefs that claim absolute power over our destiny, opting instead to encourage us to inquire intellectually and behave morally. The distinguishing characteristics of naturalism such as a humanistic approach, rational enquiry, empirical observation, as well as a pragmatic and realistic outlook can all be seen in the Buddha's teachings. In section 2, however, I advance arguments to show that while the Buddha is opposed to theistic doctrines, his views are not entirely in accordance with the presuppositions of naturalism. Firstly, the Buddha's foremost concern is not purely intellectual in nature-the purpose of his teachings is to realize a soteriological goal through spiritual practice. Secondly, naturalism tends to subscribe to 'self-being,' while the Buddha holds all things to exist conditionally and impermanently. Because of the dependent nature of all things, it is not possible to discover their essence through reduction. Thirdly, naturalized philosophy would be a kind of belief-habit that follows from certain preconditioned assumptions. But the Buddha encourages us to re-examine our conceptual proliferation leading to biased views, as that ultimately leads to suffering. I conclude by proposing a broader naturalist outlook that would allow for a more inclusive conception of the natural world that would take the axiological dimension of human transcendence into account and increase an overall understanding of human potentiality.

TI  - Multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica after optic neuritis: A nationwide cohort study in Taiwan
T2  - MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND RELATED DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The long-term outcome of optic neuritis (ON) is heterogeneous, and it appears to vary among different populations. Identification of determinants of natural history of ON would be helpful in therapeutic planning and prognostication, while relevant investigations in Asian patients were less reported. This study aims to clarify whether comorbidities and treatment in ON patients are associated with differential risks of subsequent development of multiple sclerosis (MS) or neuromyelitis optica (NMO) in Taiwan.Methods: We conducted the nationwide population-based cohort study using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Incident ON cases during 2003 similar to 2014 were followed until the end of 2015. Pediatric and adult sub-cohorts were examined separately. The associations between immune-related comorbidities or treatment and outcomes were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models.Results: A total of 11,923 adult and 1365 pediatric ON patients were enrolled. The rates of subsequent development of MS were 2.7% for adult and 3.1% for pediatric ON with median follow-up duration of 6.3 and 7.3 years respectively, while 1.2% of pediatric and adult ON evolved to NMO. Comorbid systemic lupus erythematosus was associated with increased risks of subsequent development of MS in adult (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.80; 95% CI, 1.04-7.49) and pediatric ON patients (aHR, 21.65; 95% CI, 1.29-363.4). Adult ON patients were at increased risks of NMO if comorbid with myasthenia gravis (aHR, 9.13; 95% CI, 1.20-69.45) or Sjogren's syndrome (aHR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.74-12.76).Conclusion: ON could be the sentinel event linking several peripheral autoimmune comorbidities to distinct forms of central nervous system demyelination.

TI  - Water Volume Variations Estimation and Analysis Using Multisource Satellite Data: A Case Study of Lake Victoria
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal changes of lake water resources objectively reflect not only the process of the water resources balance, but also the ecological environment changes in the lake area. In recent decades, climate changes and human activities have caused great impacts on the spatial distribution of the earth's water resources and the spatiotemporal process of the surface water cycle, which has caused a series of ecological crises and environmental problems, such as the drying-up of inland lakes, the disappearance of the oasis, water shortage or flooding and water pollution. Therefore, monitoring and fully understanding the dynamic changes of lakes is of great scientific significance for grasping regional water balance, water resources management, and sustainable development of the ecological environment. In this study, we focus on using multi-source satellite data on the estimation of water volume and multi-timescale variations analysis for large scale lakes. This study combines the problems in the practical application of "African Water Action", taking the largest lake in Africa, Lake Victoria, as the study area, and utilizes long-term serial multi-source satellite data of the past 15 years (2003-2017), including Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Jason-1/-2/-3 and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to perform the comprehensive analysis on the water volume change estimation. Firstly, the satellite altimetry data of Jason-1/-2/-3 and MODIS imagery was used to calculate series of water level, and to extract series of water surface area, respectively. On this basis, a more accurate regression model between the area and water level variation (Delta H) was constructed. Then, the model between water volume variation (Delta V) and Delta H, derived from area-Delta Hmodel, was applied to calculate the relative water volume of Lake Victoria. Meanwhile, terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes between 2003 and 2016, derived from GRACE data, were also used for a comparative verification of the Delta Vresults. The results show the long-term series change trends of Delta Vand the TWS are the same. Finally, the multi-timescale analysis of water volume changes was carried out on different time scales, such as the inter-annual, inter-monthly, and variation period.

TI  - Spatial Variability and Detection Levels for Chlorophyll-a Estimates in High Latitude Lakes Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring lakes in high-latitude areas can provide a better understanding of freshwater systems sensitivity and accrete knowledge on climate change impacts. Phytoplankton are sensitive to various conditions: warmer temperatures, earlier ice-melt and changing nutrient sources. While satellite imagery can monitor phytoplankton biomass using chlorophyll a (Chl) as a proxy over large areas, detection of Chl in small lakes is hindered by the low spatial resolution of conventional ocean color satellites. The short time-series of the newest generation of space-borne sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2) is a bottleneck for assessing long-term trends. Although previous studies have evaluated the use of high-resolution sensors for assessing lakes' Chl, it is still unclear how the spatial and temporal variability of Chl concentration affect the performance of satellite estimates. We discuss the suitability of Landsat (LT) 30 m resolution imagery to assess lakes' Chl concentrations under varying trophic conditions, across extensive high-latitude areas in Finland. We use in situ data obtained from field campaigns in 19 lakes and generate remote sensing estimates of Chl, taking advantage of the long-time span of the LT-5 and LT-7 archives, from 1984 to 2017. Our results show that linear models based on LT data can explain approximately 50% of the Chl interannual variability. However, we demonstrate that the accuracy of the estimates is dependent on the lake's trophic state, with models performing in average twice as better in lakes with higher Chl concentration (>20 mu g/L) in comparison with less eutrophic lakes. Finally, we demonstrate that linear models based on LT data can achieve high accuracy (R-2= 0.9;p-value < 0.05) in determining lakes' mean Chl concentration, allowing the mapping of the trophic state of lakes across large regions. Given the long time-series and high spatial resolution, LT-based estimates of Chl provide a tool for assessing the impacts of environmental change.

AB  - Spectral information mining plays a signi?cant role in tree species classi?cation using remote sensing images but a measure of the importance of the mined features is also necessary. We created five new spectral indices and used MLC-RFI to determine their importance. The results showed that these spectral indices had a positive effect on tree species classi?cation, and their importance was ranked as follows: PAI(578)> PAI(678)> TAI(578)> TAI(678)> SI57. The experimental results showed that important spectral indices for tree species classi?cation can be created and that it is bene?cial to mine spectral information from remote sensing images.

TI  - Subpixel impervious surface estimation in the Nansi Lake Basin using random forest regression combined with GF-5 hyperspectral data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surfaces (ISs) are significant indicators of the overall environmental health of watersheds. Monitoring the IS spatial patterns of watersheds is helpful for improving water management and regional pollution assessment. A random forest regression (RFR) approach was developed to estimate the subpixel IS percentage (ISP) from Chinese GF-5 hyperspectral imagery in 30 m pixels in the Nansi Lake Basin. Initially, object-based image analysis and overlay analysis were adopted to generate a very high-resolution ISP reference dataset using GF-1 multispectral imagery. Subsequently, an RFR-based ISP prediction model was established and evaluated using training and validation samples, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method shows a good performance with a root mean square error of 0.17, a mean absolute error of 0.15, and an R-2 value of 0.89. Meanwhile, both band 10 and band 53 of GF-5 made the highest contributions to ISP modeling. Further comparison with other machine learning algorithms revealed that the RFR-based ISP model outperforms support vector machine regression and partial least squares regression, demonstrating the potential usability of the proposed method in ISP estimation from hyperspectral imagery.

TI  - PWNet: An Adaptive Weight Network for the Fusion of Panchromatic and Multispectral Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is a typical image fusion problem, which aims to produce ahigh resolution multispectral(HRMS) image by integrating a high spatial resolutionpanchromatic(PAN) image with a low spatial resolutionmultispectral(MS) image. Prior arts have used eithercomponent substitution(CS)-based methods ormultiresolution analysis(MRA)-based methods for this propose. Although they are simple and easy to implement, they usually suffer from spatial or spectral distortions and could not fully exploit the spatial and/or spectral information existed in PAN and MS images. By considering their complementary performances and with the goal of combining their advantages, we propose apansharpening weight network(PWNet) to adaptively average the fusion results obtained by different methods. The proposed PWNet works by learning adaptive weight maps for different CS-based and MRA-based methods through an end-to-end trainableneural network(NN). As a result, the proposed PWN inherits the data adaptability or flexibility of NN, while maintaining the advantages of traditional methods. Extensive experiments on data sets acquired by three different kinds of satellites demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PWNet and its competitiveness with the state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Co-Evolution of Emerging Multi-Cities: Rates, Patterns and Driving Policies Revealed by Continuous Change Detection and Classification of Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The co-evolution of multi-cities has emerged as the primary form of urbanization in China in recent years. However, the processes, patterns, and coordination are not well characterized and understood, which hinders the understanding of the driving forces, consequences, and management of polycentric urban development. We used the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm to integrate all available Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images and map annual land use and land cover (LULC) from 2001 to 2017 in the Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration (CZTUA), a typical urban agglomeration in China. Results showed that the impervious surface in the study area expanded by 371 km(2)with an annual growth rate of 2.25%, primarily at the cost of cropland (169 km(2)) and forest (206 km(2)) during the study period. Urban growth has evolved from infilling being the dominant type in the earlier period to mainly edge-expansion and leapfrogging in the core cities, and from no dominant type to mainly leapfrogging in the satellite cities. The unfolding of the "cool center and hot edge" urban growth pattern in CZTUA, characterized by higher expansion rates in the peripheral than in the core cities, may signify a new form of the co-evolution of multi-cities in the process of urbanization. Detailed urban management and planning policies in CZTUA were analyzed. The co-evolution of multi-cities principles need to be studied in more extensive regions, which could help policymakers to promote sustainable and livable development in the future.

TI  - Meteorological conditions and their effects on the relationship between aerosol optical depth and macro-physical properties of warm clouds over Shanghai based on MODIS
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have shown that aerosols have an important effect on the cloud reflectance of solar radiation and cloud lifetime, however, the effect of aerosols on the cloud development might be over- or under-estimated without considering the meteorological conditions. In this study, the effect of aerosol optical depth (AOD) on low warm cloud development (cloud fraction (CF) and cloud top pressure (CTP) stood for the horizontal and vertical development of clouds) over Shanghai, were analyzed based on the water vapor (WV) and atmospheric stability (K index) with ten-year (2006-2015) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. The AOD, CF, WV, and K index had similar monthly variations, and their maxima occurred in summer. The maximal AOD in summer might be a result of moisture absorption growth of fine aerosols when there was a large amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. The influence of the WV on the CF was greater than that of the AOD. The results of the satellite data showed that a negative relationship between AOD and CF, which might be caused by the absorptive aerosols. Furthermore, the WV and AOD promoted the vertical development of clouds, which increased the cloud top altitude (the CTP decreased). Besides, the effects of the atmospheric stability (K index) on the horizontal and vertical development of clouds due to AOD were different. When the K index was below 20 degrees C, the influence of AOD on the CF was significant; for a K index above 20 degrees C, the influence was greatly weakened. With the increasing K index, the influence of AOD on CTP increased.

TI  - Quality Assessment of FY-4A Lightning Data in Inland China
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lightning Mapping Imager (LMI) equipped on the FY-4A (FengYun-4A) geostationary satellite achieves lightning positioning through optical imaging and has the advantages of high temporal resolution, high stability, and continuous observation. In this study, FY-4A LMI lightning event, group and flash data from April to August 2018 are selected, and their quality arc assessed through qualitative and quantitative comparison with the ground-based Advanced Time of Arrival and Direction system (ADTD) lightning observation network data and the American International Space Station (ISS) lightning imaging sensor (LIS) data. The results show that the spatial distributions of FY-4A lightning are consistent with those of the ground-based ADTD and ISS LIS. The temporal variation in FY-4A lightning group frequency is consistent with that of ADTD stroke, which reflects that FY-4A LMI can capture the lightning occurrence in inland China. Quantitative statistics show that the consistency rate of FY-4A LMI and ISS LIS events is relatively high but their consistency rate is lower in terms of lightning group and flash data. Compared with the lightning observations by the ISS LIS and the ground-based ADTD, FY-4A LMI reports fewer lightning events in the Tibetan Plateau. The application of Tibetan Plateau lightning data requires further processing and consideration.

TI  - Statistical Convolutional Neural Network for Land-Cover Classification From SAR Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images inherently present random and complex spatial patterns, which makes the land-cover classification from SAR images a challenging task. A convolutional neural network (CNN) has been applied to the land-cover classification. However, the statistical properties of an SAR image have not yet been explicitly considered by CNN for feature extraction. To address this problem, this letter presents a statistical CNN (SCNN) for land-cover classification from SAR images, which enables the representation of learning and statistical analysis to be implemented with a unified framework. In the proposed SCNN, the distribution of mid-level primitive features, extracted by representation learning, is characterized by their first- and second-order statistics. These statistics are used to fit the land-cover representations, which encode the statistical properties of the SAR image in the feature space. Experiments on the TerraSAR-X data demonstrate that the SCNN is effective and efficient for the land-cover classification from SAR images.

TI  - A Simple Approach for Mapping Forest Cover from Time Series of Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover mapping based on multi-temporal satellite observations usually uses dozens of features as inputs, which requires huge training data and leads to many ill effects. In this paper, a simple but efficient approach was proposed to map forest cover from time series of satellite observations without using classifiers and training data. This method focuses on the key step of forest mapping, i.e., separation of forests from herbaceous vegetation, considering that the non-vegetated area can be easily identified by the annual maximum vegetation index. We found that the greenness of forests is generally stable during the maturity period, but a similar greenness plateau does not exist for herbaceous vegetation. It means that the mean greenness during the vegetation maturity period of forests should be larger than that of herbaceous vegetation, while its standard deviation should be smaller. A combination of these two features could identify forests with several thresholds. The proposed approach was demonstrated for mapping the extents of different forest types with MODIS observations. The results show that the overall accuracy ranges 91.92-95.34% and the Kappa coefficient is 0.84-0.91 when compared with the reference datasets generated from fine-resolution imagery of Google Earth. The proposed approach can greatly simplify the procedures of forest cover mapping.

TI  - Surface water change characteristics of Taihu Lake from 1984-2018 based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are important fresh water resources. Accurate understanding of lake dynamic changes benefits the sustainable development of water resources and socio-economic development. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), we analyzed the dynamics of Taihu Lake from 1984 to 2018 by adopting the dataset of Joint Research Centre's Global Surface Water and Landsat imagery. The modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) was used to explore the changes in the area of Taihu Lake in recent 35 years. The results showed that the area of Taihu Lake increased during 1984-2018, with a total increase of 45.31 km(2). The area in spring and winter was larger than that in summer. Eastern Taihu Lake was the main part of Taihu Lake showing area change. Compared with 1984, 88.9% of the water area of Taihu Lake in 2018 did not change, and 0.3% of the water area disappeared permanently. Lake area changes were affected by both natural and anthropogenic factors. Agricultural irrigation, fish farming, reclamation of surrounding lakes, water conservancy engineering facilities, and the transformation of land-use types caused the reduction in lake area. Increased annual precipitation and the implementation of environmental protection policies were the main factors for the increases in lake area. The results provide reference for effective sustainable water resource management and verify the feasibility of monitoring long-term surface water change based on the GEE platform.

TI  - Space eye on flying aircraft: From Sentinel-2 MSI parallax to hybrid computing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the status (position and speed) of flying aircraft is vital for efficient and safe air space management. However, this requirement is often compromised due to the complexity of the aviation environment. Satellite remote sensing (RS) provides a complementary means for tracing aircraft, but is often limited to finding motionless aircraft under specific scenarios (e.g., at airports). Here, based on the inter-band offsets due to hardware parallax in push-broom sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument or MSI), we develop a method for detecting flying aircraft in an automated fashion. Supported by a hybrid computation framework (based on Google Earth Engine computation and local computation) specifically designed to address the challenge of processing large volume of moderate resolution RS data at a global scale, the method is applied to more than 2.31 million MSI images to establish a map of the global distribution of flying aircraft. The detected flying aircraft coincide well with those determined using traditional techniques (e.g., Flightradar24), when both datasets co-exist. With the existing and future moderate-resolution data captured by push-broom satellite sensors, the method is believed to provide a robust and cost-effective means of detecting aircraft status at a global scale, thus supplementing the traditional methods for tracking flying aircraft. The same method is also used to estimate the inter-band and inter-granule time offsets in multi-band MSI and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images, which may provide critical information needed to correct artifacts in aquatic applications.

TI  - Satellite-based monitoring and statistics for raft and cage aquaculture in China's offshore waters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on Landsat 8 remote sensing images, a combination of an unsupervised classification algorithm and artificial review was used to extract areas for Chinese offshore raft and cage aquaculture in 2018. The results of the extraction showed that China's 2018 coastal zone raft aquaculture area comprised 194,110 ha, of which the province having the largest raft aquaculture area was Jiangsu (28.77 %), followed by Fujian (20.42 %) and Shandong (13.11 %). The cage aquaculture area covered 57,847,799 square meters, of which the provinces with the largest cage aquaculture area were Fujian (64.81 %), Guangdong (17.45 %), and Liaoning (5.63 %). In addition, by combining high-resolution remote sensing image visual interpretation and field investigation, the classification of 1200 sample points in four regions was determined, and the accuracy of the aquaculture area extraction was found to be 87.35 %. The extraction results can be used not only to evaluate China's aquaculture production but also offer significant reference value for scientific planning related to sea use, ecological environmental protection, and marine disaster prevention and mitigation.

TI  - Could airborne gamma-spectrometric data replace lithological maps as co-variates for digital soil mapping of topsoil particle-size distribution? A case study in Western France
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Parent material is a crucial co-variate in predicting soil properties using digital soil mapping (DSM) methods. This spatial information can be obtained using available lithology maps, or using proxies such as gamma-ray spectroscopic maps. In this study, we used random forests to predict topsoil texture (clay, silt, and sand in grams per kilogram) in a French sub-region using a high density of soil measurements and available co-variates including climate, topography, land use, and satellite data. Then, we tested the value of adding a lithology map at the 1:50,000 scale and/or an airborne gamma-ray spectroscopy map in a French region characterised by a considerable contrast in geology and lithology. We showed that adding airborne gamma-ray spectroscopic data substantially increased the indicators of prediction performance and led to less noisy and more interpretable maps for this region. These results suggest that airborne gamma-ray spectroscopy can be a very useful co-variate to predict these topsoil properties. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Generation of MODIS-like land surface temperatures under all-weather conditions based on a data fusion approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is among the most important variables in monitoring land surface processes. LST is often retrieved from thermal infrared remote sensing data, which have a tradeoff between the spatial and temporal resolutions and are spatially incomplete due to cloud contamination. Land surface model (LSM) output can reflect LST under all-weather conditions, but the spatial resolution is relatively coarse. In this study, a two-step LST data fusion framework was proposed for generating MODIS-like LST (at the satellite overpass time for each day) at a 1 km spatial resolution under all-weather conditions. First, MODIS LST on clear days (i.e., all MODIS LST pixels are cloud-free) for a given study region (e.g., 80 km x 80 km) and China Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) LST at a spatial resolution of similar to 7 km x 7 km were fused using the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM). Second, systematic biases of the fused LST estimates were corrected by MODIS LST for clear pixels on cloudy days. Results indicate that the fused LST after bias correction (fused LSTcorr) under all-weather conditions is highly consistent with in situ LST measurements made at three sites with different land cover types in the north of China, in terms of mean absolute errors of 2.20-3.08 K, root mean square errors of 2.77-3.96 K, and coefficients of determination of 0.93-0.95. The accuracy of these results is comparable to that of the MODIS LST retrievals at all testing sites. In addition, the fused LSTcorr can well reflect spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in LST under all-weather conditions, and there is no significant difference in the accuracy of the fused LSTcorr between the clear and cloudy pixels on cloudy days. The developed approach maximizes the potential of quality MODIS LST retrievals and LSM LST output, and generates LST under all-weather conditions without using ancillary remote sensing and in situ data. The generated MODIS-like LST data under all-weather conditions are valuable in soil moisture downscaling and evapotranspiration estimation for better water resources management.

TI  - Land-use dynamics in a Brazilian agricultural frontier region, 1985-2017
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing demands for essential human needs (e.g. water, food, and energy) put pressure on natural resources, intensifies land use competition, and create challenges regarding environmental conservation. Understanding such dynamics is instrumental for the implementation of public policies in a more rational and planned manner, ensuring a better balance between uses and the maintenance of natural habitats, as well as fulfilling the demands of a rapidly growing society. Within this scope, in this study we applied statistical sampling techniques to remote sensing data (Landsat images from 1985 to 2017) in order to retrieve information on the dynamics of land use in one of the most prominent agricultural frontier regions in the world. Specifically, we chose the Brazilian state of Goias, located in the Cerrado biome, which is a biodiversity hotspot for its natural value and high endangerment level. Our results yielded estimates showing, in a first moment (1986 - 1996), the suppression of native vegetation concomitant with the expansion of pasture areas. From 1997 onward, this dynamic coexisted with the advance of annual crops and sugarcane over pasture areas (which serve as important land reserves). Our study corroborates the potential of using image-based statistical sampling to understand, in an efficient, agile, unbiased, and accurate manner, the dynamics and history of land uses in any region of interest. Likewise, the synergy between such low cost approach and other datasets (e.g. agricultural surveys) can increase the precision of land-cover and land-use assessments, complementing missing information and refining the identification of occupation patterns and trends. In particular, area estimates, as those generated in this study, can serve to quickly assess the outcomes of public policies focused on reducing deforestation rates and improving the use efficiency of areas already converted.

TI  - Change dynamics of land-use and land-cover for tropical wetland management
T2  - WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In hydrographic basins with wetlands, changes in land use (LU) and land cover (LC) impact the conservation of natural resources, leading to dynamics analysis for integral management. A method is proposed offering greater accuracy in determining the LU and LC bi-temporal and spatial change dynamics in tropical wetlands. LU and LC monitoring is based on Landsat images from 1986 to 2017. 'Pre-classification' and 'post-classification' methods are applied. In the former, reflectance image differencing and principal component N degrees 1 image differencing are analyzed to estimate the rate of change/no change area. In the latter, supervised classification is carried out of image pairs from different dates. The principal components method shows that principal component N degrees 1 collects between 88 and 93% of the reflectance variance innspectral bands of each satellite image, which improves accuracy in determining LU and LC change dynamics.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation of Surface Urban Heat Islands in Relation to Land Cover Composition and Configuration: A Multi-Scale Case Study of Xi'an, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHI) can lead to multiple adverse impacts, including increased air pollution, morbidity, and energy consumption. The association between UHI effects and land cover characteristics has been extensively studied but is insufficiently understood in inland cities due to their unique urban environments. This study sought to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of the thermal environment and their relationships with land cover composition and configuration in Xi'an, the largest city in northwestern China. Land cover maps were classified and land surface temperature (LST) was estimated using Landsat imagery in six time periods from 1995 to 2020. The variations of surface heat island were captured using multi-temporal LST data and a surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) indicator. The relationship between land cover features and land surface temperature was analyzed through multi-resolution grids and correlation analysis. The results showed that mean SUHII in the study area increased from 0.683 degrees C in 1995 to 2.759 degrees C in 2020. The densities of impervious surfaces had a stronger impact on LST than green space, with Pearson's correlation coefficient r ranging from 0.59 to 0.97. The correlation between normalized difference impervious surface index and LST was enhanced with the enlargement of the grid cell size. The correlations between normalized difference vegetation index and LST reached maxima and stabilized at grid cell sizes of 210 and 240 m. Increasing the total area and aggregation level of urban green space alleviated the negative impacts of UHI in the study area. Our results also highlight the necessity of multi-scale analysis for examining the relationships between landscape configuration metrics and LST. These findings improved our understanding of the spatiotemporal variation of the surface urban heat island effect and its relationship with land cover features in a major inland city of China.

TI  - Cost Comparison of Rodent Soiled Bedding Sentinel and Exhaust Air Dust Health-Monitoring Programs
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rodent vivaria have traditionally used soiled bedding sentinel (SBS) health-monitoring programs to detect and exclude adventitious pathogens that could affect research results. Given the limitations of SBS, a likely reduction in animal usage, and a decrease in animal care staff labor, exhaust air dust (EAD) health monitoring has been evaluated by several groups for its efficacy in detecting pathogens when used as a complete replacement for traditional SBS health-monitoring programs. Compared with SBS, EAD has also been shown to provide increased sensitivity for the detection of multiple pathogens. After implementing EAD at our institution, we conducted an analysis to compare the annual costs of the 2 health-monitoring programs. The EAD program was found to be 26% less expensive than SBS. In addition to these cost savings, EAD decreased the amount of time spent by the staff on heath-monitoring activities. For veterinary technicians, this decrease in time was calculated as a savings of 150 h annually, almost 3 h each week. Finally, the EAD program replaced the use of live sentinel animals, decreasing the associated yearly usage from 1,676 animals to zero.

TI  - Research on distribution of suspended sediment concentration in long time series based on mid-resolution imaging spectrometer data and quantile trend analysis
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to explore the long-term variation trend of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the Pearl River Estuary, a multi-voyage in-situ measurements and Moderate-Resolution Imagine Spectrometry (MODIS) Level-1 products were used to establish a quantitative inversion model of the SSC in the Pearl River Estuary. In situ data were gathered with multiple campaigns, while the MODIS sensor was passing over the study area. Then, the Mann-Kendall algorithm and the Sen's slope estimation method were used to analyze the trend of various quantiles SSC. The accuracy of the SSC inversion model was verified by using multiple sets of measured data in which the correlation coefficient was 0.90 and the root mean square error was 4.76. The results showed that: (1) The SSC in the Pearl River Estuary shown a zonal distribution in the northeast-southwest direction, which was gradually reduced from the nearshore to the sea, with an average concentration of more than 90 mg L-1. (2) The SSC in the PRE displayed a decreasing trend, with an averaged SSC reduction rate of about 1.02 mg L-1 yr(-1) during 2004-2016. Decreasing rate in high SSC was generally larger than those was in low SSC, with a marked spatial difference. (3) The seasonal variation of dam-induced reduction of the sediment load into the PRE contributed to most of the low-percentile SSC decreases. The water-depth change in the PRE induced by human activities dominated the high-percentile SSC trends. The decrease of the wind speed over the PRE also affected the high-percentile SSC trend.

TI  - An Experimental Study on Field Spectral Measurements to Determine Appropriate Daily Time for Distinguishing Fractional Vegetation Cover
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology has been widely used to estimate fractional vegetation cover (FVC) at global and regional scales. Accurate and consistent field spectral measurements are required to develop and validate spectral indices for FVC estimation. However, there are rarely any experimental studies to determine the appropriate times for field spectral measurements, and the existing guidelines or references are rather general or inconsistent, it is still not agreed upon and detailed experiments are missing for a local research. In this experiment, five groundcover objects were measured continuously from 07:30 a.m. to 17:30 p.m. local time in three consecutive sunny days using a portable spectrometer. The coefficients of variation (CV) were applied to investigate the reflectance variation at wavelengths corresponding to MODIS satellite channels and the derived spectral indices used to estimate FVC, including photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV). The results reveal little variation in the reflectance measured between 10:00 a.m. and 16:00 p.m., with CV values generally less than 10%. The CV values of FVC spectral indices for estimating PV, NPV and bare soil (BS) are generally less than 3%. While more experiments are yet to be carried out at different locations and in different seasons, the findings so far imply that the in situ spectrum measured between 9:00 a.m. and 17:00 p.m. local time would be useful to discriminate FVC objects and validate satellite estimates-based indices using visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared channels.

TI  - A Novel Algorithm to Estimate Phytoplankton Carbon Concentration in Inland Lakes Using Sentinel-3 OLCI Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton carbon, an important biogeochemical and ecological parameter, plays a critical role in the carbon cycle and in global warming reduction. Estimation of phytoplankton carbon in inland waters on a large scale using remote sensing is useful for understanding, evaluating, and monitoring the carbon dynamics, and, in particular, for determining the spatial temporal variation of primary production in inland waters. In a correlation analysis of the phytoplankton carbon concentration and water components, the result revealed no significant correlation between the chlorophyll-a concentration and phytoplankton carbon concentration in inland waters. However, the absorption peak height of particles at 675 nm, which is defined as the absorption at 675 nm subtracted by that at 660 nm, was found to be closely correlated with the phytoplankton carbon concentration. Thus, the absorption peak height of particles at 675 nm could be used as an indicator of the phytoplankton carbon concentration. A semianalytical method based on the remote-sensing reflectance in Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) bands 8, 9, and 17 was developed to derive the absorption peak of particles at a wavelength of 675 nm. Finally, an algorithm for estimating the phytoplankton carbon concentration in inland waters using OLCI bands 8, 9, and 17 was constructed. From 2013 to 2018, eight field campaigns were conducted in inland lakes in different seasons, and the optical properties, optically active water components, and phytoplankton carbon concentrations were obtained. An assessment of its accuracy using an independent data set demonstrated that the algorithm performance is acceptable (mean absolute percentage error, 48.6%, and root mean square error, 0.36 mg/L). As a demonstration, the algorithm was successfully applied to map the phytoplankton carbon concentration in Taihu Lake and Chaohu Lake, China, using OLCI images acquired on December 5, 2017, and August 5, 2018 and December 8, 2017, and August 7, 2017, and the spatial variation of the phytoplankton carbon concentration in Taihu Lake and Chaohu Lake was thoroughly examined. A semianalytical remote-sensing method, instead of a traditional time-consuming approach, was developed in this article, which can be used to estimate phytoplankton carbon concentration quickly, and provides an effective way to map the phytoplankton carbon concentration in inland water on a large scale.

TI  - Detection of Seasonal Deformation of Highway Overpasses Using the PS-InSAR Technique: A Case Study in Beijing Urban Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In urban areas, deformation of transportation infrastructures may lead to serious safety accidents. Timely and accurate monitoring of the structural deformation is critical for prevention of transportation accidents and assurance of construction quality, particularly in areas with regional land subsidence, such as the city of Beijing. In this study, we proposed a method for the detection of seasonal deformation of highway overpasses using the integration of persistent scatterers Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) techniques and seasonal indices, i.e., deformation concentration degree (DCD) and deformation concentration period (DCP) indices. Taking eastern Beijing urban area as a case study area, we first used the PS-InSAR technique to derive time series surface deformation based on 55 TerraSAR-X images during 2010-2016. Then, we proposed DCD and DCP indices to characterize seasonal deformation of 25 highway overpasses in the study area, with DCD representing to what degree the annual deformation is distributed in a year, and DCP representing the period on which deformation concentrates in the year. Our results showed that the maximum annual deformation rate reached -141.3 mm/year in Beijing urban area, and the PS-InSAR measurements agreed well with levelling measurements (R-2 > 0.97). For PS pixels with DCD >= 0.3, the monthly deformation showed obvious seasonal patterns with deformation values during some months greater than those during the other months. DCP revealed that the settlement during autumn and winter was more serious than that in spring and summer. The seasonal patterns seemed to be related to the location, structure, and construction age of the overpasses. The upper-level overpasses, the newly constructed overpasses, and those located in the subsidence area (rate < -40 mm/year) tended to show a greater seasonal pattern. The seasonal deformation variations were also affected by groundwater-level fluctuation, temperature, and compressible layer.

TI  - Investigation on Mining Subsidence Based on Sentinel-1A Data by SBAS-InSAR technology-Case Study of Ningdong Coalfield, China
T2  - EARTH SCIENCES RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground deformation characterization was difficult to obtain over large spatial areas before the invention of the Satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) technique. Especially underground mining in the Loess Plateau of China, it causes large-scale ground damage within a short period of time. A small baseline subset (SBAS) algorithm can overcome some limitations of InSAR technology, such as temporal decorrelation, spatial decorrelation, and atmospheric delay. In this study, SBAS-InSAR technology was applied to process 19 scenes of Sentinel-1A data in Ningdong Coalfield, China. We investigated and analyzed the mining subsidence status from March 2015 to June 2016. 'There are 6 ground deformation areas in the cumulative subsidence maps, and the maximum cumulative subsidence value is -178cm distributed in the Renjiazhuang mining area during this period. The deformation rate map shows that the maximum deformation rate was -117cm/year. GPS data above the working tunnel was collected in six mining areas in Shigouyi. The subsidence value of SBAS data is consistent with GPS observation station data. The results reveal the evolution process of subsidence in mining subsidence and are helpful to the early warning of the mine disaster.

TI  - ROI Extraction Based on Multiview Learning and Attention Mechanism for Unbalanced Remote Sensing Data Set
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With an increasing number of remote sensing images (RSIs), the automatic region of interest (ROI) extraction based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has attracted much interest in recent years. Although fully supervised CNN-based methods have shown superiority in the field of object extraction, pixelwise annotations are expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, due to the unstable distribution of ROIs in complex landscapes, the ratios of foreground and background areas are quite different in RSIs. Training CNNs with such unbalanced data sets lead to over-fitting and low accuracy. In this article, we propose a framework that combines multiview learning and attention mechanism (MLAM) to solve the above mentioned problems. First, we develop a CNN-based weakly supervised method with a weight-balanced loss function to solve the problems caused by an unbalanced data set. It also helps to generate imagewise saliency maps by computing the gradient maps with respect to the input images. Then, we design a multiview strategy to dramatically reduce the missing inspection. Finally, we design a feedback attention mechanism based on the stage neighbor binary pattern to further modify the extraction result. In summary, the proposed framework achieves pixelwise ROI extraction under imagewise annotations through data-driven ML and a knowledge-driven visual attention mechanism. We evaluate the performance of the MLAM framework on two challenging data sets with complex backgrounds. The experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can achieve better performance than other eight ROI extraction models for unbalanced remote sensing data sets.

TI  - Spatiotemporal partitioning of savanna plant functional type productivity along NATT
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Realistic representations and simulation of mass and energy exchanges across heterogeneous landscapes can be a challenge in land surface and dynamic vegetation models. For mixed life-form biomes such as savannas, plant function is very difficult to parameterise due to the distinct physiological characteristics of tree and grass plant functional types (PFTs) that vary dramatically across space and time. The partitioning of their fractional contributions to ecosystem gross primary production (GPP) remains to be achieved at regional scale using remote sensing. The objective of this study was to partition savanna gross primary production (GPP) into tree and grass functional components based on their distinctive phenological characteristics. Comparison of the remote sensing partitioned GPP(tree) and GPP(grass) against field measurements from eddy covariance (EC) towers showed an overall good agreement in terms of both GPP seasonality and magnitude. We found total GPP, as well as its tree and grass components, decreased dramatically with rainfall over the North Australian Tropical Transect (NATT), from the Eucalyptus forest and woodland in the northern humid coast to the grasslands, Acacia woodlands and shrublands in the southern xeric interior. Spatially, GPP(tree) showed a steeper decrease with precipitation along the NATT compared to GPP(grass), thus tree/grass GPP ratios also decreased from the northern mesic region to the arid south region of the NATT. However, results also showed a second trend at the southern part of the transect, where tree-grass ratios and total GPP increased with decreasing mean annual precipitation, and this occurred in the physiognomic transition from hummock grasslands to Acacia woodland savannas. Total GPP and tree-grass GPP ratios across climate extremes were found to be primarily driven by grass layer response to rainfall dynamics. The grass-containing xeric savannas exhibited a higher hydroclimatic sensitivity, whereas GPP in the northern mesic savannas was fairly stable across years despite large variations in rainfall amount. The pronounced spatiotemporal variations in savanna vegetation productivity encountered along the NATT study area suggests that the savanna biome is particularly sensitive and vulnerable to predicted future climate change and hydroclimatic variability.

TI  - Formation of sea ice ponds from ice-shelf runoff, adjacent to the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ponds that form on sea ice can cause it to thin or break-up, which can promote calving from an adjacent ice shelf. Studies of sea ice ponds have predominantly focused on Arctic ponds formed by in situ melting/ponding. Our study documents another mechanism for the formation of sea ice ponds. Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images from the 2015-16 to 2018-19 austral summers, we analyze the evolution of sea ice ponds that form adjacent to the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica. We find that each summer, meltwater flows from the ice shelf onto the sea ice and forms large (up to 9 km(2)) ponds. These ponds decrease the sea ice's albedo, thinning it. We suggest the added mass of runoff causes the ice to flex, potentially promoting sea-ice instability by the ice-shelf front. As surface melting on ice shelves increases, we suggest that ice-shelf surface hydrology will have a greater effect on sea-ice stability.

TI  - The Quest for Greener Pastures: Evaluating the Livelihoods Impacts of Providing Vegetation Condition Maps to Pastoralists in Eastern Africa
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pastoral households are faced with making migration decisions under increasing uncertainty about resource availability and limited coping strategies due to mounting socioeconomic and climatic stressors. We assess the potential of providing vegetation condition maps to support the migration decisions of pastoralists in Ethiopia and Tanzania and the impact of map usage on their herd condition and size. The maps were generated from remotely sensed data using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation condition and overlain with pastoralists' preferred grazing areas. We surveyed pastoralists before maps were distributed (baseline), and approximately a year (midline), and two years (endline) after map distribution began. Map adopters in both countries reported an overwhelmingly positive experience and stated the maps were accurate and helpful. However, the use of maps for migration decisions was low in the follow-up periods, partly due to challenges in map distribution (26% and 2% in Ethiopia; and 35% and 29% in Tanzania at midline and endline respectively). Map usage was associated with improved animal condition in Tanzania, but we find no causal evidence that map usage affected herd size in the randomized controlled trial in Ethiopia.

TI  - Building an Online Learning Module for Satellite Remote Sensing Applications in Hydrologic Science
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents an online teaching tool that introduces students to basic concepts of remote sensing and its applications in hydrology. The learning module is intended for junior/senior undergraduate students or junior graduate students with no (or little) prior experience in remote sensing, but with some basic background of environmental science, hydrology, statistics, and programming. This e-learning environment offers background content on the fundamentals of remote sensing, but also integrates a set of existing online tools for visualization and analysis of satellite observations. Specifically, students are introduced to a variety of satellite products and techniques that can be used to monitor and analyze changes in the hydrological cycle. At completion of the module, students are able to visualize remote sensing data (both in terms of time series and spatial maps), detect temporal trends, interpret satellite images, and assess errors and uncertainties in a remote sensing product. Students are given the opportunity to check their understanding as they progress through the module and also tackle complex real-life problems using remote sensing observations that professionals and scientists commonly use in practice. The learning tool is implemented in HydroLearn, an open-source, online platform for instructors to find and share learning modules and collaborate on developing teaching resources in hydrology and water resources.

T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanisation is accelerating urban land use dynamics and this has a significant impact on land surface temperature (LST). Impervious surfaces and increase in air pollution has led to the increase in land surface temperature. This study reports on the use of geospatial technologies to monitor and quantify changes in LST using remotely sensed data in the City of Tshwane. Land surface temperature was retrieved using the winter and summer Landsat datasets for 1997 and 2015 and the MODIS data from 2000 to 2015. Land surface temperature was extracted using emissivity and satellite temperature as input parameters. The spatial and temporal variations in the LST were retrieved to show the effects of land cover change on LST. Change in LST was also analysed on different land cover types using transects across the study area. The study revealed an increase in land surface temperature between the years. It also showed that impervious surfaces had a higher LST compared to the non-impervious surfaces. The results revealed variations in LST between non-cropped and cropped agricultural areas, where the former had higher LST than the latter. Temporal trends revealed a notable increase in LST in the urban areas and there were some seasonal variations in LST with high LST values in summer and low values in winter. Cross-section analysis along transects revealed spatio-temporal thermal variations across different land cover types.

TI  - Estimation of Snow Depth in the Hindu Kush Himalayas of Afghanistan during Peak Winter and Early Melt Season
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pamir ranges of the Hindu Kush regions in Afghanistan play a substantial role in regulating the water resources for the Middle Eastern countries. Particularly, the snowmelt runoff in the Khanabad watershed is one of the critical drivers for the Amu River, since it is a primary source of available water in several Middle Eastern countries in the off monsoon season. The purpose of this study is to devise strategies based on active microwave remote sensing for the monitoring of snow depth during the winter and the melt season. For the estimation of snow depth, we utilized a multi-temporal C-band (5.405 GHz) Sentinel-1 dual polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with a differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR)-based framework. In the proposed approach, the estimated snowpack displacements in the vertical transmit-vertical receive (VV) and vertical transmit-horizonal receive (VH) channels were improved by incorporating modeled information of snow permittivity, and the scale was enhanced by utilizing snow depth information from the available ground stations. Two seasonal datasets were considered for the experiments corresponding to peak winter season (February 2019) and early melt season (March 2019). The results were validated with the available nearest field measurements. A good correlation determined by the coefficient of determination of 0.82 and 0.57, with root mean square errors of 2.33 and 1.44 m, for the peak winter and the early melt season, respectively, was observed between the snow depth estimates and the field measurements. Further, the snow depth estimates from the proposed approach were observed to be significantly better than the DInSAR displacements based on the correlation with respect to the field measurements.

TI  - Relationship of Forest Cover Fragmentation and Drought with the Occurrence of Forest Fires in the Department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest fires of 2019 were among the most devastating ever recorded in Bolivia. In this study we analyze the relationship between forest fragmentation and meteorological drought with the spatial distribution of forest fires during that year in the Department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia. We carried out a classification of the natural vegetation using Landsat 8 satellite imagery. Forest fragmentation was defined according to the distribution of forest patch sizes and classified using seven categories; furthermore, distance to anthropogenically used areas and forest edges was quantified. Spatial patterns of meteorological drought severity were quantified using long-term series of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration. Areas burned during 2019 (July-December) were characterized by means of spectral indices (normalized burn ratio (NBR) and normalized delta burn ratio (dNBR)) and unsupervised classification methods (interactive self-organizing data analysis algorithm (ISODATA)). The results show that 61.9% of the total area burned occurred in large (>2,000,000 ha), relatively unfragmented patches. However, the highest proportion of fires (17.1%) occurred in relatively small patches (<20 ha). In addition, anthropogenically used zones and forest edges were most impacted by forest fires. Finally, the spatial patterns of drought severity also influenced the severity of forest fires.

AB  - As a science, aerobiology emerged ninety years ago. Over the years many techniques have been developed to explore the diversity of fungal spores and pollen grains in atmospheric air. Currently, the most common are the Hirst type samplers. Slowly but surely a new era of automatic devices with the possibility of obtaining real-time results begins. They are particulary important in our time, when one-third of the world urban population suffers from allergies to pollen. This review explores the current understanding of the significance of the pollen and fungal spores monitoring, in relation to advances and limitations of the old and the new sampling techniques as well as the present sampling techniques and present knowledge of the molecular aspects of pollen allergens. Pollen and fungal spores monitoring promises to be a valuable tool for examination of the interface between multidisciplinary approaches, allowing us to understand the heterogeneity of nature from the pollen aerosol physics to the molecular and omical aspects of the pollen allergens characteristics and their interaction with our immune system both in health and disease. Thanks to the aerobiological research, using chemical, biochemical and microbiological analysis with metorological and satellite data, we provide the evidence of the long distance transport of the pollen and spore, their impact on the spread of viruses and bacteria and connections to other phenomena.

TI  - Variability and Trend in Integrated Water Vapour from ERA-Interim and IGRA2 Observations over Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated water vapour (IWV) is the total amount of precipitable water in an atmospheric column between the Earth's surface and space. The implication of its variability and trend on the Earth's radiation budget and precipitation makes its monitoring on a regular basis important. ERA-Interim reanalysis (ERA) and radiosonde (RS) data from 1988 to 2018 were used to investigate variability and trend in IWV over Peninsular Malaysia. ERA performed excellently when gauged with RS. Trend analysis was performed using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall and Theil-Sen slope estimator tests. ERA and RS IWV revealed double fluctuations at the seasonal time scale, with maxima in May and November, which are the respective beginnings of the southwest monsoon (SWM) and northeast monsoon (NEM) seasons, as well as coincidental peaks of precipitation in the region. IWV decreased in a southeast-northwest orientation, with regional maximum domiciled over the southeastern tip of the region. Steep orography tended to shape intense horizontal gradients along the edges of the peninsular, with richer gradients manifesting along the western boundary during SWM, which harbours more water vapour in the peninsular. IWV trends, both at the annual and seasonal time series, were positive and statistically significant at the 95% level across the stations, except at Kota Bharu, where a nonsignificant downward trend manifested. Trends were mostly higher in the NEM, with the greatest rate being 0.20 +/- 0.42 kgm(-2)found at Penang. Overall, the IWV trend in Peninsular Malaysia was positive and consistent with the upward global changes in IWV reported elsewhere.

TI  - Comparison of Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) and Multi-Singular Spectrum Analysis (M-SSA) in Reconstruction of Long-Gap Missing Data in NDVI Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring vegetation changes over time is very important in dry areas such as Iran, given its pronounced drought-prone agricultural system. Vegetation indices derived from remotely sensed satellite imageries are successfully used to monitor vegetation changes at various scales. Atmospheric dust as well as airborne particles, particularly gases and clouds, significantly affect the reflection of energy from the surface, especially in visible, short and infrared wavelengths. This results in imageries with missing data (gaps) and outliers while vegetation change analysis requires integrated and complete time series data. This study investigated the performance of HANTS (Harmonic ANalysis of Time Series) algorithm and (M)-SSA ((Multi-channel) Singular Spectrum Analysis) algorithm in reconstruction of wide-gap of missing data. The time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) retrieved from Landsat TM in combination with 250m MODIS NDVI time image products are used to simulate and find periodic components of the NDVI time series from 1986 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2015, respectively. This paper presents the evaluation of the performance of gap filling capability of HANTS and M-SSA by filling artificially created gaps in data using Landsat and MODIS data. The results showed that the RMSEs (Root Mean Square Errors) between the original and reconstructed data in HANTS and M-SSA algorithms were 0.027 and 0.023 NDVI value, respectively. Further, RMSEs among 15 NDVI images extracted from the time series artificially and reconstructed by HANTS and M-SSA algorithms were 0.030 and 0.025 NDVI value, respectively. RMSEs of the original and reconstructed data in HANTS and M-SSA algorithms were 0.10 and 0.04 for time series 6, respectively. The findings of this study present a favorable option for solving the missing data challenge in NDVI time series.

TI  - Estimation of Daily Spatial Snow Water Equivalent from Historical Snow Maps and Limited In-Situ Measurements
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a scheme aimed at estimating daily spatial snow water equivalent (SWE) maps in real time and at high spatial resolution from scarce in-situ SWE measurements from Internet of Things (IoT) devices at actual sensor locations and historical SWE maps. The method consists of finding a background SWE field, followed by an update step using ensemble optimal interpolation to estimate the residuals. This novel approach allowed for areas with parsimonious sensors to have accurate estimates of spatial SWE without explicitly discovering and specifying the spatial-interpolation features. The scheme is evaluated across the Tuolumne River basin on a 50 m grid using an existing LiDAR-based product as the historical dataset. Results show a minimum RMSE of 30% at 50 m resolutions. Compared with the operational SNODAS product, reduction in error is up to 80% with historical LiDAR-measured snow depth as input data.

TI  - An Integrated Spatiotemporal Pattern Analysis Model to Assess and Predict the Degradation of Protected Forest Areas
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest degradation is considered to be one of the major threats to forests over the globe, which has considerably increased in recent decades. Forests are gradually getting fragmented and facing biodiversity losses because of climate change and anthropogenic activities. Future prediction of forest degradation spatiotemporal dynamics and fragmentation is imperative for generating a framework that can aid in prioritizing forest conservation and sustainable management practices. In this study, a random forest algorithm was developed and applied to a series of Landsat images of 1998, 2008, and 2018, to delineate spatiotemporal forest cover status in the sanctuary, along with the predictive model viz. the Cellular Automata Markov Chain for simulating a 2028 forest cover scenario in Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS), Gujarat, India. The model's predicting ability was assessed using a series of accuracy indices. Moreover, spatial pattern analysis-with the use of FRAGSTATS 4.2 software-was applied to the generated and predicted forest cover classes, to determine forest fragmentation in SWS. Change detection analysis showed an overall decrease in dense forest and a subsequent increase in the open and degraded forests. Several fragmentation metrics were quantified at patch, class, and landscape level, which showed trends reflecting a decrease in fragmentation in forest areas of SWS for the period 1998 to 2028. The improvement in SWS can be attributed to the enhanced forest management activities led by the government, for the protection and conservation of the sanctuary. To our knowledge, the present study is one of the few focusing on exploring and demonstrating the added value of the synergistic use of the Cellular Automata Markov Chain Model Coupled with Fragmentation Statistics in forest degradation analysis and prediction.

AB  - The automatic detection, data extraction, 3D modelling and visualization of buildings in urban areas using remote sensing data is an essential task in various applications such as cadastre, urban and rural planning, change detection, mapping, updating geographic information systems, monitoring, housing value and navigation. Even today, this task still remains challenging due to the inherent artefacts (e.g. shadows) in the remote sensing data used, as well as the differences in viewpoints, surrounding environment, complex shape and size of the buildings. This article outlines a generic workflow using modern technologies.

TI  - Automatic Extraction of Grasses and Individual Trees in Urban Areas Based on Airborne Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban vegetation extraction is very important for urban biodiversity assessment and protection. However, due to the diversity of vegetation types and vertical structure, it is still challenging to extract vertical information of urban vegetation accurately with single remotely sensed data. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can provide elevation information with high-precision, whereas hyperspectral data can provide abundant spectral information on ground objects. The complementary advantages of LiDAR and hyperspectral data could extract urban vegetation much more accurately. Therefore, a three-dimensional (3D) vegetation extraction workflow is proposed to extract urban grasses and trees at individual tree level in urban areas using airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data. The specific steps are as follows: (1) airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR data were processed to extract spectral and elevation parameters, (2) random forest classification method and object-based classification method were used to extract the two-dimensional distribution map of urban vegetation, (3) individual tree segmentation was conducted on a canopy height model (CHM) and point cloud data separately to obtain three-dimensional characteristics of urban trees, and (4) the spatial distribution of urban vegetation and the individual tree delineation were assessed by validation samples and manual delineation results. The results showed that (1) both the random forest classification method and object-based classification method could extract urban vegetation accurately, with accuracies above 99%; (2) the watershed segmentation method based on the CHM could extract individual trees correctly, except for the small trees and the large tree groups; and (3) the individual tree segmentation based on point cloud data could delineate individual trees in three-dimensional space, which is much better than CHM segmentation as it can preserve the understory trees. All the results suggest that two- and three-dimensional urban vegetation extraction could play a significant role in spatial layout optimization and scientific management of urban vegetation.

TI  - A Radar Vegetation Index for Crop Monitoring Using Compact Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop growth monitoring using compact-pol synthetic aperture radar (CP-SAR) data is gaining attention with the rapid advancements toward operational applications. In this article, we propose a vegetation index for compact polarimetric (CP) SAR data [compact-pol radar vegetation index (CpRVI)]. The CpRVI is derived using the concept of a geodesic distance between the Kennaugh matrices projected on a unit sphere. This distance is utilized to compute a similarity measure between the observed Kennaugh matrix and the Kennaugh matrix of an ideal depolarizer (a realization of vegetation canopy). The similarity measure is then modulated with a scaled quantity derived from the scattering power ratio of the same and opposite sense polarization with respect to the transmitted circular polarization. In this article, we utilize time-series-simulated RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) compact-pol SAR data (RH-RV) obtained from the full-pol RADARSAT-2 observations during the soil moisture active passive (SMAP) validation experiment 2016 (SMAPVEX16-MB) campaign in Manitoba, Canada, to assess the proposed vegetation index. Among the various crops grown in this region, in particular, we analyze the growth stages of wheat and soybean due to their different canopy structures. A temporal analysis of the proposed CpRVI with crop biophysical parameters [the plant area index (PAI) and vegetation water content (VWC)] at different phenological stages confirms the trend of CpRVI with the plant growth. Nevertheless, variations of CpRVI values are apparent with different plant densities for both the crop types. Also, the linear regression analysis confirms that the CpRVI values significantly correlate with PAI and 0.85) and VWC and 0.75) for both wheat and soybean. We observed good retrieval of PAI and VWC for both wheat and soybean.

TI  - Timing of sentinel node biopsy independently predicts disease-free and overall survival in clinical stage I-II melanoma patients: A multicentre study of the Italian Melanoma Intergroup (IMI)
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) still remains a key procedure to appropriately stage melanoma patients and to select those who are candidate to novel treatments with immunotherapy and targeted therapy in the adjuvant setting. The impact of timing of SNB on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) is still unclear.Material and methods: The study was conducted at 6 Italian Melanoma Intergroup (IMI) centres and included 8953 consecutive clinical stage I-II melanoma patients who were diagnosed, treated, and followed up between November 1997 and March 2018. All patients were prospectively included in dedicated IMI database. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to investigate how baseline characteristics and time interval until SNB are related to DFS and OS.Results: Considering the whole population, at multivariable analysis, after adjusting for age, gender, Breslow thickness, site, ulceration, and the SNB status, a delay in the timing of SNB was associated with a better DFS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR, delayed versus early SNB] 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-0.99, p < 0.001) and OS (aHR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, p = 0.001). Specifically, in patients with a negative SNB status, a beneficial impact of delayed SNB (i.e. at least 32 days after primary excision) was confirmed for DFS (aHR 0.70, 95%CI 0.63-0.79, p < 0.001) and OS (aHR 0.69, 95%CI 0.61-0.78, p < 0.001), whereas in those with a positive SNB status, DFS (aHR 0.96, 95%CI 0.84-1.09, p = 0.534) and OS (aHR 0.94 95% CI 0.81-1.08, p = 0.374) were not significantly different in patients with early or delayed SNB.Conclusions: Our study does not support a strict time interval for SNB. These results may be useful for national guidelines, for counselling patients and reducing the number of high urgency referrals. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Dry biomass estimation of paddy rice with Sentinel-1A satellite data using machine learning regression algorithms
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the growing use of Sentinel-1 in retrieving crop growth information, its potential for obtaining improved estimates of rice biophysical parameters has not been fully investigated. This study therefore assesses the capabilities of Sentinel-1A temporal datasets, of the interferometric wide-swath (IW) mode that include the vertical transmitted and horizontal received (VH), and vertical transmitted and vertical received (VV) polarizations, and the linear combination of VH and VV (VHVV), to estimate rice dry biomass over a test site located in southeast China. To this end, four machine learning regression algorithms; Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), were applied to assess the aforementioned datasets. The results indicated that for the estimation of rice dry biomass over the entire growing season, VHVV data with RF produced the most accurate estimates with an R-2 of 0.73 and an RMSE of 462.4 g/m(2). However, this study suggests that a consideration of the rice growth phases culd produce more accurate estimates of dry biomass as evident by an R-2 of 0.72 and an RMSE of 362.4 g/m(2) recorded at the reproductive phase (elongation to milking) with VH data and k-NN. Hence research works that would investigate the estimation of rice dry biomass at the vegetative (transplanting to elongation) and maturity (milking to ripening) phases are required to ascertain whether a growth-phase approach could obtain more accurate rice biomass estimates that better meet precision agriculture data needs.

TI  - Comparison of Machine-Learning Methods for Urban Land-Use Mapping in Hangzhou City, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land-use information is important for urban land-resource planning and management. However, current methods using traditional surveys cannot meet the demand for the rapid development of urban land management. There is an urgent need to develop new methods to overcome the shortcomings of conventional methods. To address the issue, this study used the random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) models to build machine-leaning methods for urban land-use classification. Taking Hangzhou as an example, these machine-leaning methods could all successfully classify the essential urban land use into 6 Level I classes and 13 Level II classes based on the semantic features extracted from Sentinel-2A images, multi-source features of types of points of interest (POIs), land surface temperature, night lights, and building height. The validation accuracy of the RF model for the Level I and Level II land use was 79.88% and 71.89%, respectively, performing better compared to SVM (78.40% and 68.64%) and ANN models (71.30% and 63.02%). However, the variations of the user accuracy among the methods depended on the urban land-use level. For the Level I land-use classification, the user accuracy was high, except for the transportation land by all methods. In general, the RF and SVM models performed better than the ANN model. For the Level II land-use classification, the user accuracy of different models was quite distinct. With the RF model, the user accuracy of educational and medical land was above 80%. Moreover, with the SVM model, the user accuracy of the business office and educational land classification was above 75%. However, the user accuracy of the ANN model on the Level II land-use classification was poor. Our results showed that the RF model performs best, followed by SVM model, and ANN model was relatively poor in the essential urban land-use classification. The results proved that the use of machine-learning methods can quickly extract land-use types with high accuracy, and provided a better method choice for urban land-use information acquisition.

TI  - Simulating Change in Surface Runoff Depth due to LULC Change using Soil and Water Assessment Tool for Flash Floods Prediction
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate documentation of land-use/land-cover (LULC) change and evaluating its hydrological impact are of great interest for catchment hydrological management. Jukskei River catchment has undergone a rapid infrastructural and residential development which had an influence on runoff depth. The objective of the study is to integrate Geographical Information System (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques with Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to quantify the spatial and temporal changes in surface runoff depth resulting from LULC change. Landsat images of 1987 MSS, 2001 TM and 2015 OLI were pre-processed and classified using a supervised classification method with maximum likelihood. Results indicated that, there was a significant increase in built-up area from 28700.4ha in 1987 LULC to 36313.6ha in 2001 and 42713.1ha in 2015 at the expense of bare surface, intact vegetation and sparsed vegetation. However, during hydrological modelling, soil, DEM and climatic data were kept constant except LULC images which were interchanged during each simulation phase. Calibrated with observed hydrological data at the catchment outlets, SWAT model was used to evaluate the effect of LULC change on surface runoff depth. The analysis of SWAT model showed increases surface runoff depth from 70.5mm in 1987 LULC to 134.2mm in 2001 and 199.3mm in 2015 LULC. The SWAT model indicated satisfactorily results based on model calibration and validation results. Therefore, this study concluded that, integration of GIS and RS techniques with SWAT model can help in formulating policy guidelines for land-use practices thereby reducing hydrological impacts associated with LULC changes.

AB  - Accurate and detailed studies in crop mapping are crucial in precision agriculture, yield estimations, and crop monitoring. This study focused on exploring the utility of Sentinel-2 data in mapping of crop types and testing the two machine learning algorithms which are Random Forest and Support Vector Machine performance in classifying crop types in a heterogeneous agriculture landscape in Free state province, South Africa. Nine crop types were successfully classified. The utility and contribution of different bands for classification were evaluated using RF mean decrease GINI for variable importance. Validation of results was done using a confusion matrix which produced overall accuracy, errors and prediction measures. The best performance was attained by SVM with an overall accuracy of 95% and a kappa value of 94%. RF also performed fairly well with 85% of overall accuracy and kappa value of 83%. It was concluded that Sentinel-2 data performs better using the SVM classifier compared to RF classifier.

TI  - Enhancing wildfire spread modelling by building a gridded fuel moisture content product with machine learning
T2  - MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildland fire decision support systems require accurate predictions of wildland fire spread. Fuel moisture content (FMC) is one of the important parameters controlling the rate of spread of wildland fire. However, dead FMC measurements are provided by a relatively sparse network of remote automatic weather stations (RAWS), while live FMC is relatively infrequently measured manually. We developed a high resolution, gridded, real-time FMC data sets that did not previously exist for assimilation into operational wildland fire prediction systems based on ML. We used surface observations of live and dead FMC to train machine learning models to estimate FMC based on satellite observations. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer Terra and Aqua reflectances are used to predict the live and dead FMC measured by the Wildland Fire Assessment System and RAWS). We evaluate multiple machine learning methods including multiple linear regression, random forests (RFs), gradient boosted regression and artificial neural networks. The models are trained to learn the relationships between the satellite reflectances, surface weather and soil moisture observations and FMC. After training on data corresponding to the temporally and spatially nearest grid points to the irregularly spaced surface FMC observations, the machine learning models could be applied to all grid cells for a gridded product over the Conterminous United States (CONUS). The results show generally that the rule-based approaches have the lowest errors likely due to the sharp decision boundaries among the predictors, and the RF approach that utilizes bagging to avoid over-fitting has the lowest error on the test dataset. The errors are typically between 25%-33% the typical variability of the FMC data, which indicate the skill of the RF in estimating the FMC based on satellite data and surface characteristics. The FMC gridded product based on the RF runs operationally daily over CONUS and can be assimilated into WRF-Fire for more accurate wildland fire spread predictions.

TI  - Mapping hurricane damage: A comparative analysis of satellite monitoring methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are the second-most valuable natural resource on Earth but have declined by approximately 70 % since 1900. Restoration and conservation efforts have succeeded in some areas through establishment of refuges where anthropogenic impacts are minimized. However, these areas are still prone to wetland damage caused by natural disasters. Severe storms such as Hurricane Irma, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane in southwest Florida (USA) on September 11, 2017, can cause the destruction of mangroves and other wetland habitat. Multispectral images from commercial satellites provide a means to assess the extent of the damage to different wetland habitat types with high spatial resolution (2 m pixels or finer) over large areas. Using such images presents a number of challenges, including deriving consistent and accurate classification of wetland and non-wetland vegetation. Machine learning methods have demonstrated high-accuracy mapping capabilities on small spatial scales, but require a large amount of robust training data. Meanwhile, ambitious efforts to map larger areas at finer resolutions may use hundreds of thousands of images, and therefore encounter Big-Data processing challenges. Large-scale efforts face the dilemma of adopting traditional mapping methods that may lend themselves to Big Data analytics but may result in accuracies that are inferior to new methods, or move to machine learning methods, which require robust training data. Given these considerations, we describe a version of the traditional Decision Tree (DT) approach and compare two common machine learning methods to derive land cover classes using a WorldView-2 image collected on November 12, 2018 to include one growing season after Hurricane Irma affected this area. Specifically, we compared the Support Vector Machine [SVM] and Neural Network [NN] methods, trained and validated with separate ground-truth datasets collected during a robust field campaign. Overall accuracies were only marginally different (85 % NN vs 83 % each DT and SVM), but healthy mangroves were more accurately identified with the DT (91 % vs 88 % NN and 86 % SVM), and degraded mangroves were more accurately identified with NN (62 % vs 57 % NN and 38 % DT). These results, combined with their respective training requirements, have implications for the direction with which large-scale high-resolution mapping of coastal habitats proceeds.

TI  - The typewriter mind: modernism, populism and anti-humanism
T2  - TEXTUAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent commentaries on the resurgence of populist nationalism have referred back to the early twentieth century. Such analogies are criticised by scholarly historians, but in a frame of post-humanist theory, the very method of comparison recalls early modernist treatments of political and historical language as essentially metaphoric and fictive. The essay focuses on T.E. Hulme's writing, drawing attention to three challenges to humanism described in his work. Firstly, it examines his critique of excessive scientific confidence that led to a 'nightmare of determinism'. Secondly, it shows how Hulme was both fascinated and disturbed by forms of vitalism that gave individuals agency but seemingly also a vulnerability to manipulation. Thirdly, Hulme advocates a form of a politics subordinated to a transcendent deity, again in reaction to humanist ideals. Through analysis of Hulme's essays on crowd psychology, historical prejudice, and the political use of metaphor, the essay tests parallels between political narratives in the 1910s and the present day, and considers the constructive ends to which Hulme's problematic worldview could be put.

TI  - Machine Learning and the End of Atmospheric Corrections: A Comparison between High-Resolution Sea Surface Salinity in Coastal Areas from Top and Bottom of Atmosphere Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a discussion about the need for atmospheric corrections by comparing data-driven sea surface salinity (SSS) derived from Top- and Bottom-of-Atmosphere imagery. Atmospheric corrections are used to remove the effect of the atmosphere in reflectances acquired by satellite sensors. The Sentinel-2 Level-2A product provides atmospherically corrected Bottom-of-Atmosphere (BOA) imagery, derived from Level-1C Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) tiles using the Sen2Cor processor. SSS at high resolution in coastal areas (100 m) is derived from multispectral signatures using artificial neural networks. These obtain relationships between satellite band information and in situ SSS data. Four scenarios with different input variables are tested for both TOA and BOA imagery, for interpolation (previous information on all platforms is available in the training dataset) and extrapolation (certain platforms are isolated and the network does not have any previous information on these) problems. Results show that TOA always outperforms BOA in terms of higher coefficient of determination (R-2), lower mean absolute error (MAE) and lower most common error (mu(e)). The best TOA results are R-2 = 0.99, MAE = 0.4 PSU and mu(e) = 0.2 PSU. Moreover, the evaluation of the neural network in all the pixels of Sentinel-2 tiles shows that BOA results are accurate only far away from the coast, while TOA data provides useful information on nearshore mixing patterns, estuarine processes and is able to estimate freshwater salinity values. This suggests that land adjacency corrections could be a relevant source of error. Sun glint corrections appear to be another source of error. TOA imagery is more accurate than BOA imagery when using machine learning algorithms and big data, as there is a clear loss of information in the atmospheric correction process that affects the multispectral-in situ relationships. Finally, the time and computational resources gained by avoiding atmospheric corrections can make the use of TOA imagery interesting in future studies, such as the estimation of chlorophyll or coloured dissolved organic matter.

TI  - Comparing the spatial and temporal dynamics of urban expansion in Guangzhou and Shenzhen from 1975 to 2015: A case study of pioneer cities in China's rapid urbanization
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The distinct urbanization process of China has attracted worldwide attention because of its impressive speed, massive scale, and policy intervention. However, the interrelationship between urban expansion and government policies is still not well understood. The Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomeration of China is the first national pioneering urbanization area since the implementation of the policy "Reform and Opening-up" in the late 1970s. Here we compared the spatial and temporal patterns of urbanization in two leading cities of the Pearl River Delta (i.e., Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the provincial capital and the first Special Economic Zone of China, respectively) from 1975 to 2015, using Landsat data integrated with urban growth and landscape metrics analysis, and examined possible footprints of major economic and urbanization policies. Our results illustrated that urban land areas in both Guangzhou and Shenzhen have experienced magnificent annual growth rates at 8.1% and 11%, respectively between 1975 and 2015. On average, Shenzhen witnessed substantially higher urban growth rate than Guangzhou during the past four decades, particularly in the initial period (1978-1990) when the Reform and Opening-up policy was launched and Shenzhen was designated as the first Special Economic Zone in China in the late 1970s. However, the speed of urban expansion in Shenzhen became considerably lower than Guangzhou from 2005 to 2015, subject to physical conditions and a series of urban land use policies. Both cities showed a generally similar dynamics of urban growth forms with leapfrogging as the predominant type of urban growth at first and then edge-expansion while the contribution of infilling in Shenzhen was higher than that in Guangzhou, especially since 2005. The urbanization processes characterized by landscape and urban growth metrics revealed that a diffusion-coalescence-diffusion-coalescence process was identified for Guangzhou, while Shenzhen was generally consistent with the diffusion-coalescence urban growth hypothesis.

TI  - Apocalypse yesterday: Posthumanism and comics in the Anthropocene
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is widely recognised that the growing awareness that we are living in the Anthropocene - an unstable geological epoch in which humans and their actions are catalysing catastrophic environmental change - is troubling humanity's understanding and perception of temporality and the ways in which we come to terms with socio-ecological change. This article begins by arguing in favour of posthumanism as an approach to this problem, one in which the prefix 'post' does not come as an apocalyptic warning, but rather signals a new way of thinking, an encouragement to move beyond a humanist perspective and to abandon a social discourse and a worldview fundamentally centred on the human. The article then explores how the impending environmental catastrophe can be productively reimagined through graphic narratives, arguing that popular culture in general, and comics in particular, emerge as productive sites for geographers to interrogate and develop posthuman methodologies and narratives. Developing our analysis around two comics in particular - Here and Mad Max: Fury Road - we show how graphic narrative can help us to move beyond the nature-society divide that is rendered anachronistic by the Anthropocene.

TI  - Spatio-temporal dynamics in seismic exposure of Asian megacities: past, present and future
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of urban growth in megacities is a critical and intricate task for researchers and decision-makers owing to the complexity of these urban systems. Currently, the majority of megacities are located in Asia which is one of the most disaster-prone regions in the world. The high concentrations of people, infrastructure and assets in megacities create high loss potentials for natural hazards; therefore, the forecasting of exposure metrics such as built-up area is crucial for disaster risk assessment. This study aims to identify and project the dynamics of built-up area at risk using a spatio-temporal approach considering seismic hazard in three Asian megacities, namely Jakarta, Metro Manila and Istanbul. First, Landsat Thematic Mapper images were processed to obtain the built-up areas of 1995 and 2016 for Metro Manila, and of 1995 and 2018 for Jakarta and Istanbul. The SLEUTH urban growth model, a cellular automaton (CA)-based spatial model that simulates urban growth using historical geospatial data, was then employed to predict the urban growth of these megacities by 2030. Finally, seismic hazard maps obtained for 10% and 2% probabilities of exceedance were overlaid with built-up area maps. For a seismic hazard of 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years, the total urban area subjected to Modified Mercalli intensities (MMI) VIII and IX has increased nearly 65% over 35 years in Metro Manila. For Jakarta and Istanbul, the total urban area at the MMI VIII level has increased nearly 79% and 54% over 35 years, respectively. For a seismic hazard of 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years, the total urban area subjected to MMI IX has increased nearly 75%, 65% and 49% over 35 years in Jakarta, Metro Manila and Istanbul, respectively. The results show that urban growth modelling can be utilized to assess the built-up area exposed to high risk as well as to plan urban growth considering natural hazards in megacities.

TI  - Long-Term Analysis of Atmospheric Energetics Components over the Mediterranean, Middle East and North Africa
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, one aspect of the climate that is not commonly referred to, namely, the long-term changes in the components of the atmospheric energy, is investigated. In this respect, the changes in four energy forms are considered, namely, Kinetic Energy (KE), Thermal Energy (TE), Internal Energy (IE), Potential Energy (PE) and Latent Energy (LE); the Energy Conversion (EC) between Kinetic Energy and Potential plus Internal Energy (PIE) is also considered. The area considered in this long-term energetics analysis covers the entire Mediterranean basin, the Middle East and a large part of North Africa. This broad geographical area has been identified by many researchers as a hot spot of climate change. Analyses of climatic data have indeed shown that this region has been experiencing marked changes regarding several climatic variables. The present energetics analysis makes use of the ERA-Interim database for the period from 1979 to 2018. In this 40-year period, the long-term changes in the above energetics components are studied. The monthly means of daily means for all the above energy forms and Energy Conversion comprise the basis for the present research. The results are presented in the form of monthly means, annual means and spatial distributions of the energetics components. They show the dominant role of the subtropical jet-stream in theKEregime. During the study period, the tendency is forKEto decrease with time, with this decrease found to be more coherent in the last decade. The tendency forTEis to increase with time, with this increase being more pronounced in the most recent years, with the maximum in the annual mean inKEnoted in 2015. The sum of Potential and Internal energies (PIE) and the sum of Potential, Internal and Latent energies (PILE) follow closely the patterns established forTE. In particular, the strong seasonal influence on the monthly means is evident with minima ofPIEandPILEnoted in winters, whereas, maxima are registered during summers. In addition, bothPIEandPILEexhibit a tendency to increase with time in the 40-year period, with this increase being more firmly noted in the more recent years. Although local conversion fromKEintoPIEis notable, the area averaging ofECshows that the overall conversion is in the direction of increasing thePIEcontent of the area at the expense of theKEcontent.ECbehaves rather erratically during the study period, with values ranging from 0.5 to 3.7 x 10(2)W m(-2). Averaged over the study area, the Energy Conversion term operates in the direction of convertingKEintoPIE; it also lacks a seasonal behavior.

TI  - Assessment of a Spatially and Temporally Consistent MODIS Derived NDVI Product for Application in Index-Based Drought Insurance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid and semi-arid regions of Eastern and Southern Africa, drought can be devastating to pastoralists who depend on healthy vegetation for their herds. The Kenya Livestock Insurance Program (KLIP) addresses this challenge through its insurance program that relies on a vegetation index product derived from eMODIS NDVI (enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Insurance payouts are triggered when index values fall below a certain threshold for a Unit Area of Insurance (UAI). The objective of this study is to produce an updated, cloud-based NDVI product, potentially allowing for earlier payouts that may help herders to prevent, minimize, or offset drought-induced losses. The new product, named reNDVI (rapid enhanced NDVI), provides an updated cloud filtering algorithm and brings the entire processing chain to the cloud. Access to the scripts used for the processing described and resulting data is openly available. To test the performance of the new product, we provide a robust evaluation of reNDVI and eMODIS NDVI and their derived payout indices against historical drought, payouts provided, and mortality data. The implications of potential payout differences are also discussed. The products show good comparability; the monthly average NDVI per UAI has correlation values over 0.95 and MAPD under 5% for most UAIs. However, there are moderate differences when assessing year-to-year payout amounts triggered. Because the payouts are currently calculated based on the 20th and first percentile of index values from 2003-2016, payouts are very sensitive to even small changes in NDVI. Where livestock mortality was available, payouts for reNDVI and eMODIS had similar correlations (r = 0.453 and r = 0.478, respectively) with mortality rates. Therefore, with the potential reduced latency and updated cloud filtering, the reNDVI product could be a suitable replacement for eMODIS in the Kenya Livestock Insurance Program. The updated reNDVI product shows promise as a vegetation index that could address a pressing drought insurance challenge.

TI  - Joint Use of PROSAIL and DART for Fast LUT Building: Application to Gap Fraction and Leaf Biochemistry Estimations over Sparse Oak Stands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gap Fraction, leaf pigment contents (content of chlorophylls a and b (C-ab) and carotenoids content (Car)), Leaf Mass per Area (LMA), and Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT) are considered relevant indicators of forests' health status, influencing many biological and physical processes. Various methods exist to estimate these variables, often relying on the extensive use of Radiation Transfer Models (RTMs). While 3D RTMs are more realistic to model open canopies, their complexity leads to important computation times that limit the number of simulations that can be considered; 1D RTMs, although less realistic, are also less computationally expensive. We investigated the possibility to approximate the outputs of a 3D RTM (DART) from a 1D RTM (PROSAIL) to generate in very short time numerous extensive Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The intrinsic error of the approximation model was evaluated through comparison with DART reference values. The model was then used to generate LUTs used to estimate Gap Fraction, C-ab, Car, EWT, and LMA of Blue Oak-dominant stands in a woodland savanna from AVIRIS-C data. Performances of the approximation model for estimation purposes compared to DART were evaluated using Wilmott's index of agreement (d(r)), and estimation accuracy was measured with coefficients of determination (R-2) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The low approximation error of the proposed model demonstrated that the model could be considered for canopy covers as low as 30%. Gap Fraction estimations presented similar performances with either DART or the approximation (dr0.78 and 0.77, respectively), while C-ab and Car showed improved performances (d(r) increasing from 0.65 to 0.77 and 0.34 to 0.65, respectively). No satisfying estimation methods were found for LMA and EWT using either models, probably due to the high sensitivity of the scene's reflectance to Gap Fraction and soil modeling at such low LAI. Overall, estimations using the approximated reflectances presented either similar or improved accuracy. Our findings show that it is possible to approximate DART reflectances from PROSAIL using a minimal number of DART outputs for calibration purposes, drastically reducing computation times to generate reflectance databases: 300,000 entries could be generated in 1.5 h, compared to the 12,666 total CPU hours necessary to generate the 21,840 calibration entries with DART.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction of Multispectral VNIR Remote Sensing Data: Algorithm and Inter-sensor Comparison of Aerosol and Surface Reflectance Products
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical imaging satellites, such as SPOT and Cartosat-2S, provide visible/near infrared (VNIR) multispectral data at very high spatial resolution. The applications of these data sets are associated with precise mapping, monitoring, and change detection of Earth's surface, given that the measurements can be compensated for atmospheric effects. Existing atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms use visible and shortwave infrared channels and therefore cannot be used for AC of data from VNIR sensors. This article describes an algorithm for aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval and AC of VNIR imaging data. The AOD algorithm relies on the fact that for vegetated surfaces there exists a visible/NIR surface reflectance relationship due to the absorption of solar radiation by photosynthetic pigments in visible bands, while high reflectance in NIR bands governed by structural discontinuities in the leaves of healthy vegetation. We then describe how retrieved AOD is used to derive surface reflectance. To test the algorithm, the aerosol and surface reflectance products generated from 106 Cartosat-2S data sets are compared with MODIS-terra products. The algorithm significantly removes the haze from the images making surface feature visible. The comparison of Cartosat-2S and MODIS-terra AOD involving >1,500 data points shows good correlation of 0.95 with a relative difference of <= 25%. Similarly, the comparison of surface reflectance involving >4,500 data points shows good correlation ranging from 0.75 to 0.86 with a relative difference ranging from 24%to 37%. The normalized difference vegetation index shows a correlation of 0.89, with a relative difference of <= 18%. Results show that the given algorithm may be useful for AC of data from VNIR sensors.

TI  - Status of Phenological Research Using Sentinel-2 Data: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing of plant phenology as an indicator of climate change and for mapping land cover has received significant scientific interest in the past two decades. The advancing of spring events, the lengthening of the growing season, the shifting of tree lines, the decreasing sensitivity to warming and the uniformity of spring across elevations are a few of the important indicators of trends in phenology. The Sentinel-2 satellite sensors launched in June 2015 (A) and March 2017 (B), with their high temporal frequency and spatial resolution for improved land mapping missions, have contributed significantly to knowledge on vegetation over the last three years. However, despite the additional red-edge and short wave infra-red (SWIR) bands available on the Sentinel-2 multispectral instruments, with improved vegetation species detection capabilities, there has been very little research on their efficacy to track vegetation cover and its phenology. For example, out of approximately every four papers that analyse normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) or enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from Sentinel-2 imagery, only one mentions either SWIR or the red-edge bands. Despite the short duration that the Sentinel-2 platforms have been operational, they have proved their potential in a wide range of phenological studies of crops, forests, natural grasslands, and other vegetated areas, and in particular through fusion of the data with those from other sensors, e.g., Sentinel-1, Landsat and MODIS. This review paper discusses the current state of vegetation phenology studies based on the first five years of Sentinel-2, their advantages, limitations, and the scope for future developments.

TI  - Mapping Brick Kilns to Support Environmental Impact Studies around Delhi using Sentinel-2
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities lying in the Indo-Gangetic plains of South Asia have the world's worst anthropogenic air pollution, which is often attributed to urban growth. Brick kilns, facilities for producing fired clay-bricks for construction are often found at peri-urban region of South Asian cities. Although brick kilns are significant air pollutant emitters, their contribution in under-represented in air pollution emission inventories due to unavailability of their distribution. This research overcomes this gap by proposing publicly available remote sensing dataset based approach for mapping brick-kiln locations using object detection and pixel classification. As brick kiln locations are not permanent, an open-dataset based methodology is advantageous for periodically updating their locations. Brick kilns similar to Bull Trench Kilns were identified using the Sentinel-2 imagery around the state of Delhi in India. The unique geometric and spectral features of brick kilns distinguish them from other classes such as built-up, vegetation and fallow-land even in coarse resolution imagery. For object detection, transfer learning was used to overcome the requirement of huge training datasets, while for pixel-classification random forest algorithm was used. The method achieved a recall of 0.72, precision of 0.99 and F1 score of 0.83. Overall 1564 kilns were detected, which are substantially higher than what was reported in an earlier study over the same region. We find that brick kilns are located outside urban areas in proximity to outwardly expanding built-up areas and tall built structures. Duration of brick kiln operation was also estimated by analyzing the time-series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over the brick kiln locations. The brick kiln locations can be further used for updating land-use emission inventories to assess particulate matter and black carbon emissions.

TI  - Adjuvant Nodal Radiation Therapy for Melanoma in the Era of Immunotherapy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - In the last few years there have been dramatic changes in the management of patients with melanoma with locally advanced disease. Previously, standard therapy for melanoma patients with nodal disease involved completion lymph node dissection followed by adjuvant radiation therapy for high-risk features, as defined by TROG 02.01. Adjuvant systemic therapy with interferon could be offered, but many eligible patients did not receive this agent in the context of significant toxicity. New, effective, and often well-tolerated systemic therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted MAPK pathway inhibitors, have shown impressive responses in metastatic disease and are now being applied to the locally advanced setting. Currently, for patients with occult nodal disease found at sentinel lymph node biopsy, completion lymph node dissection is uncommon with adjuvant anti-PD1 therapy often recommended. For patients with clinically apparent nodal disease, neoadjuvant immunotherapy has shown impressive pathologic response rates, which thus far have correlated well with longer term disease outcomes. However, not all patients exhibit a robust pathologic response. In circumstances of either occult nodal disease or clinically evident nodal disease without a robust pathologic response to neoadjuvant immunotherapy, there is a dearth of evidence regarding the optimal use of radiation therapy. Prospective studies investigating the role of adjuvant nodal radiation therapy for melanoma patients in the modern immunotherapy era are much needed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - On Removal of Sea State Contribution to Sentinel-1 Doppler Shift for Retrieving Reliable Ocean Surface Current
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Doppler frequency shift acquired by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) contains information about ocean surface motion induced by waves and the underlying ocean currents in the radar range direction. An accurate estimate of the wave-induced contribution is therefore required to derive a reliable estimation of the ocean surface current. In this study, we developed an empirical model for estimating the wave-induced Doppler shift based on Sentinel-1B Wave Mode (WV) Level 2 Ocean products acquired from December 2017 to January 2018 collocated with wind field from ECMWF and wavefield from WAVEWATCH III. We found that the relationship between the wind field at 10 m height and the Doppler shift from Sentinel-1 is in agreement with previous findings based on ASAR observations. Retraining of the conventional CDOP model for the Sentinel-1 observations (CDOP-S) yields distinct improvements. We speculate that the improvement is due to different sensor properties and hence biases in the data. Moreover, combing wave and wind information into the model yield considerable improvements especially for the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific. Given accurate wave bias correction, the ocean surface radial velocity maps based on 2 months of Sentinel-1 acquisitions agree with ocean surface current climatology derived from multiyear drifter observations. This suggests that Sentinel-1 Doppler shift observations can be used to study ocean surface currents with 20 km spatial resolutions at a monthly time scale.

TI  - The Dynamics of Mangroves in the Mekong Delta (Vietnam): From Degradation to Restoration
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of the analysis of LANDSAT satellite images were used to reconstruct the change in the area of mangrove forests of the Mekong River Delta over a 30-year-long period. This study was based on a series of images made in 1988, 1998, 2013, and 2018, covering the entire coast of the delta. We calculated the total area of mangroves for each period, as well as the area on which the mangroves were replaced by secondary vegetation or anthropogenic landscapes, and the area on which mangrove vegetation was restored. In 1988, the mangrove forest occupied 111 000 ha. The area of mangroves decreased by 35 000 ha over a 30-year period, by 68% of their initial area, and the rate of disappearance of mangrove vegetation calculated from these data should have been 1200 hectares, or about 1% per year. However, the satellite monitoring performed every 10-15 years shows that the negative trend of the dynamics has changed to a positive one. The area of mangroves increased by 7 800 ha from 2013 till 2018. This is the first documented change in the trend of mangrove dynamics for a large region.

TI  - Measures of Canopy Structure from Low-Cost UAS for Monitoring Crop Nutrient Status
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Deriving crop information from remotely sensed data is an important strategy for precision agriculture. Small unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have emerged in recent years as a versatile remote sensing tool that can provide precisely-timed, fine-grained data for informing management responses to intra-field crop variability (e.g., nutrient status and pest damage). UAS sensors with high spectral resolution used to compute informative vegetation indices, however, are practically limited by high cost and data dimensionality. This research extends spectral analysis for remote crop monitoring to investigate the relationship between crop health and 3D canopy structure using low-cost UAS equipped with consumer-grade RGB cameras. We used flue-cured tobacco as a case study due to its known sensitivity to fertility variation and nutrient-specific symptomology. Fertilizer treatments were applied to induce plant health variability in a 0.5 ha field of flue-cured tobacco. Multi-view stereo images from three UAS surveys collected during crop development were processed into orthoimages used to compute a visible band spectral index and photogrammetric point clouds using Structure from Motion (SfM). Plant structural metrics were then computed from detailed high resolution canopy surface models (0.05 m resolution) interpolated from the photogrammetric point clouds. The UAS surveys were complimented by nutrient status measurements obtained from plant tissues. The relationships between foliar nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and boron (B) concentrations and the UAS-derived metrics were assessed using multiple linear regression. Symptoms of N and K deficiencies were well captured and differentiated by the structural metrics. The strongest relationship observed was between canopy shape and N foliar concentration (adj.<mml:semantics>r 2</mml:semantics>= 0.59, increasing to adj.<mml:semantics>r 2</mml:semantics>= 0.81 when combined with the spectral index). B foliar concentration was consistently better predicted by canopy structure with a maximum adj.<mml:semantics>r 2</mml:semantics>= 0.41 observed at the latest growth stage surveyed. Overall, combining information about canopy structure and spectral reflectance increased model fit for all measured nutrients compared to spectral alone. These results suggest that an important relationship exists between relative canopy shape and crop health that can be leveraged to improve the usefulness of low cost UAS for precision agriculture.

TI  - Sizing and selection of wind turbines for water pumping in pre-mountain zones
T2  - REVISTA CUBANA DE INGENIERIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This work arises from the need to reduce costs by concept of electricity and fuel consumption in Las Terrazas complex, Cuba. A visit to the place was made and the highest and closest places were identified. An evaluation of them was made, selecting El Salon hill as the study place. With satellite data and international databases, the average wind speed was determinate (5.7 m/s at 50 m), which favors the wind machines installation. These characteristics have been adopted to reduce costs for the complex by electricity consumption for water pumping. It has proposed to install a wind turbine with horizontal axis. The proposed mathematical model allows selecting the more feasible wind turbine options. From a database composed by 17 models of wind turbines, five wind turbines were selected as the most economically feasible. Additionally, the mathematical model was able to determine the optimal dimensions of the selected equipment. According to the mathematical model, the most suitable wind turbine is the Nordex N27/150 (option 1), based on an economic point of view and because is in agreement with the requirements of the case studied.

TI  - MODIS Sensor Capability to Burned Area Mapping-Assessment of Performance and Improvements Provided by the Latest Standard Products in Boreal Regions
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an accuracy assessment of the main global scale Burned Area (BA) products, derived from daily images of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Fire_CCI 5.1 and MCD64A1 C6, as well as the previous versions of both products (Fire_CCI 4.1 and MCD45A1 C5). The exercise was conducted on the boreal region of Alaska during the period 2000-2017. All the BA polygons registered by the Alaska Fire Service were used as reference data. Both new versions doubled the annual BA estimate compared to the previous versions (66% for Fire_CCI 5.1 versus 35% for v4.1, and 63% for MCD64A1 C6 versus 28% for C5), reducing the omission error (OE) by almost one half (39% versus 67% for Fire_CCI and 48% versus 74% for MCD) and slightly increasing the commission error (CE) (7.5% versus 7% for Fire_CCI and 18% versus 7% for MCD). The Fire_CCI 5.1 product (CE = 7.5%, OE = 39%) presented the best results in terms of positional accuracy with respect to MCD64A1 C6 (CE = 18%, OE = 48%). These results suggest that Fire_CCI 5.1 could be suitable for those users who employ BA standard products in geoinformatics analysis techniques for wildfire management, especially in Boreal regions. The Pareto boundary analysis, performed on an annual basis, showed that there is still a potential theoretical capacity to improve the MODIS sensor-based BA algorithms.

TI  - Understanding vegetation variability and their "hotspots" within Lake Victoria Basin (LVB: 2003-2018)
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lake Victoria's surface area has recently been shown to have shrunk by 0.3% compared to its 1984 value, a decline that has been associated with climatic as well as anthropogenic factors. Climatic factors include, e.g., reduced rainfall, which impacts not only on the lake's water level but also on the basin's vegetation that forms the lake's catchment. Understanding the locations of vegetation changes and the driving forces of such changes, therefore, is of most critical importance to major stakeholders regarding environmental management, policies and planning. For Lake Victoria Basin (LVB; Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi), human development and climatic variability/change have subjected the region to significant changes in its vegetation characteristics whose spatio-temporal patterns are, however, not well understood. To understand this variability in vegetation for the period 2003-2018, this study employs the use of remotely sensed MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with station data) precipitation data, Google Earth Pro imagery, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)-based Mascon's total water storage (TWS) products and the statistical PCA (Principal Component Analysis). The study aims at determining (i) "significant hotspots", i.e. vegetation areas within the LVB largely impacted, and (ii), the extent of which anthropogenic and climatic variability have contributed to the "hotspots" formation. The results indicate a total of 8 hotspots; 5 in Uganda and 1 each in Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda. Google Earth Pro imagery of all the hotspots show the changes in anthropogenic processes as the primary driver for the long-term changes in vegetation characteristics. Conversely, the analysis of PCA and Mascon's TWS concluded that only the Tanzanian hotspot may have been driven somewhat by climate variability. Climate variability is understood to be the driver of short-term vegetation changes while the long-term effects are driven primarily by human influence.

TI  - Assessment of SDG Indicator 11.3.1 and Urban Growth Trends of Major and Small Cities in South Africa
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial technologies play an important role in understanding and monitoring of land cover and land use change which is critical in achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 and related goals. In this study, we assessed SDG Indicator 11.3.1, Ratio of Land Consumption Rate to Population Growth Rate (LCRPGR) and other urban growth trends of four cities in South Africa using Landsat 5 TM and SPOT 2&5 satellite images and census data collected in 1996, 2001 and 2011. The 2011 built-up areas were mapped using South Africa's SPOT 5 Global Human Settlements Layer (GHSL) system whereas the 1996 and 2001 built-up areas were extracted from Landsat 5 and SPOT 2 satellite imagery using a kNN object-based image analysis technique that uses textural and radiometric features. We used the built-up area layer to calculate the land consumption per capita and total urban change for each city, both of which have been identified as being important explanatory indicators for the ratio of LCRPGR. The assessment shows that the two major cities, Johannesburg and Tshwane, recorded a decline in the ratio of LCRPGR between the periods 1996-2001 and 2001-2011. In contrast, the LCRPGR ratios for secondary cities, Polokwane and Rustenburg increased during the same periods. The results further show that Tshwane recorded an increase in land consumption per capita between 1996 and 2001 followed by a decrease between 2001 and 2011. Over the same time, Johannesburg experienced a gradual decrease in land consumption per capita. On the other hand, Polokwane and Rustenburg recorded a unique growth trend, in which the overall increase in LCRPGR was accompanied by a decrease in land consumption per capita. In terms of land consumption, Tshwane experienced the highest urban growth rate between 1996 and 2001, whereas Johannesburg and Polokwane experienced the highest urban growth rates between 2001 and 2011. The information derived in this study shows the significance of Indicator 11.3.1 in understanding the urbanization trends in cities of different sizes in South Africa and creates a baseline for nationwide assessment of SDG 11.3.1.

M3  - Article
AB  - Author summary Because of global trade of used tyres and ornamental plants, invasive mosquitoes of the genusAedesare spreading passively between continents. Within continents, adults are frequently travelling along roads as hitchhikers in motorised vehicles and may then colonise new areas. Because someAedesmosquitoes are competent to transmit diseases they threaten public and veterinary health. In Europe, the Asian tiger mosquito,Aedes albopictusis of particular concern as it is a vector of chikungunya, dengue and Zika virus. While its distribution in southern Europe is well documented, its dispersal modes across the Alps remain poorly investigated, preventing a projection of future scenarios beyond its current range in order to target mosquito control. To monitor the introduction of invasiveAedesmosquitoes beyond the Alps we placed traps at motorway service areas across Switzerland. Between 2013 and 2018 we identified three invasiveAedesspecies, includingAe.albopictus,Ae.koreicus(Korean bush mosquito) andAe.japonicus(Japanese bush mosquito). Based on the frequency and distribution patterns we conclude thatAe.albopictusandAe.koreicusare being passively spread primarily along the European route E35 from Italy to Germany, whileAe.japonicushas been expanding its range across Switzerland mainly through active dispersal. Over the past three decades, Europe has witnessed an increased spread of invasive aedine mosquito species, most notablyAedes albopictus, a key vector of chikungunya, dengue and Zika virus. While its distribution in southern Europe is well documented, its dispersal modes across the Alps remain poorly investigated, preventing a projection of future scenarios beyond its current range in order to target mosquito control. To monitor the presence and frequency of invasiveAedesmosquitoes across and beyond the Alps we set oviposition and BG-Sentinel traps at potential points of entry with a focus on motorway service areas across Switzerland. We placed the traps from June to September and controlled them for the presence of mosquitoes every other week between 2013 and 2018. Over the six years of surveillance we identified three invasiveAedesspecies, includingAe.albopictus,Ae.japonicusandAe.koreicus. Based on the frequency and distribution patterns we conclude thatAe.albopictusandAe.koreicusare being passively spread primarily along the European route E35 from Italy to Germany, crossing the Alps, whileAe.japonicushas been expanding its range from northern Switzerland across the country most likely through active dispersal.

TI  - Apportioning Smoke Impacts of 2018 Wildfires on Eastern Sierra Nevada Sites
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The summer of 2018 saw intense smoke impacts on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada in California, which have been anecdotally ascribed to the closest wildfire, the Lions Fire. We examined the role of the Lions Fire and four other, simultaneous large wildfires on smoke impacts across the Eastern Sierra. Our approach combined GOES-16 satellite data with fire activity, fuel loading, and fuel type, to allocate emissions diurnally per hour for each fire. To apportion smoke impacts at key monitoring sites, dispersion was modeled via the BlueSky framework, and daily averaged PM(2.5)concentrations were estimated from 23 July to 29 August 2018. To estimate the relative impact of each contributing wildfire at six Eastern Sierra monitoring sites, we layered the multiple modeled impacts, calculated their proportion from each fire and at each site, and used that proportion to apportion smoke from each fire's monitored impact. The combined smoke concentration due to multiple large, concurrent, but more distant fires was on many days substantially higher than the concentration attributable to the Lions Fire, which was much closer to the air quality monitoring sites. These daily apportionments provide an objective basis for understanding the extent to which local versus regional fire affected Eastern Sierra Nevada air quality. The results corroborate previous case studies showing that slower-growing fires, when and where managed for resource objectives, can create more transient and manageable air quality impacts relative to larger fires where such management strategies are not used or feasible.

TI  - Continuous Monitoring of Urban Land Cover Change Trajectories with Landsat Time Series and LandTrendr-Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Producing accurate land cover maps is time-consuming and estimating land cover changes between two generated maps is affected by error propagation. The increased availability of analysis-ready Earth Observation (EO) data and the access to big data analytics capabilities on Google Earth Engine (GEE) have opened the opportunities for continuous monitoring of environment changing patterns. This research proposed a framework for analyzing urban land cover change trajectories based on Landsat time series and LandTrendr, a well-known spectral-temporal segmentation algorithm for land-based disturbance and recovery detection. The framework involved the use of baseline land cover maps generated at the beginning and at the end of the considered time interval and proposed a new approach to merge the LandTrendr results using multiple indices for reconstructing dense annual land cover maps within the considered period. A supervised support vector machine (SVM) classification was first performed on the two Landsat scenes, respectively, acquired in 1987 and 2019 over Kigali, Rwanda. The resulting land cover maps were then imported in the GEE platform and used to label the interannual LandTrendr-derived changes. The changes in duration, year, and magnitude of land cover disturbance were derived from six different indices/bands using the LandTrendr algorithm. The interannual change LandTrendr results were then combined using a robust estimation procedure based on principal component analysis (PCA) for reconstructing the annual land cover change maps. The produced yearly land cover maps were assessed using validation data and the GEE-based Area Estimation and Accuracy Assessment (Area(2)) application. The results were used to study the Kigali's urbanization in the last three decades since 1987. The results illustrated that from 1987 to 1998, the urbanization was characterized by slow development, with less than a 2% annual growth rate. The post-conflict period was characterized by accelerated urbanization, with a 4.5% annual growth rate, particularly from 2004 onwards due to migration flows and investment promotion in the construction industry. The five-year interval analysis from 1990 to 2019 revealed that impervious surfaces increased from 4233.5 to 12116 hectares, with a 3.7% average annual growth rate. The proposed scheme was found to be cost-effective and useful for continuously monitoring the complex urban land cover dynamics, especially in environments with EO data affordability issues, and in data-sparse regions.

TI  - Quantifying Land Use Land Cover Changes in the Lake Victoria Basin Using Satellite Remote Sensing: The Trends and Drivers between 1985 and 2014
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) is a significant resource for five states within East Africa, which faces major land use land cover changes that threaten ecosystem integrity and ecosystem services derived from the basin's resources. To assess land use land cover changes between 1985 and 2014, and subsequently determine the trends and drivers of these changes, we used a series of Landsat images and field data obtained from the LVB. Landsat image pre-processing and band combinations were done in ENVI 5.1. A supervised classification was applied on 118 Landsat scenes using the maximum likelihood classifier in ENVI 5.1. The overall accuracy of classified images was computed for the 2014 images using 124 reference data points collected through stratified random sampling. Computations of area under various land cover classes were calculated between the 1985 and 2014 images. We also correlated the area from natural vegetation classes to farmlands and settlements (urban areas) to explore relationships between land use land cover conversions among these classes. Based on our land cover classifications, we obtained overall accuracy of 71% and a moderate Kappa statistic of 0.56. Our results indicate that the LVB has undergone drastic changes in land use land cover, mainly driven by human activities that led to the conversion of forests, woodlands, grasslands, and wetlands to either farmlands or settlements. We conclude that information from this work is useful not only for basin-scale assessments and monitoring of land cover changes but also for targeting, prioritizing, and monitoring of small scale, community led efforts to restore degraded and fragmented areas in the basin. Such efforts could mitigate the loss of ecosystem services previously derived from large contiguous land covers which are no longer tenable to restore. We recommend adoption of a basin scale, operational, Earth observation-based, land use change monitoring framework. Such a framework can facilitate rapid and frequent assessments of gains and losses in specific land cover classes and thus focus strategic interventions in areas experiencing major losses, through mitigation and compensatory approaches.

TI  - Modeling Spatio-Temporal Land Transformation and Its Associated Impacts on land Surface Temperature (LST)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) of city regions is strongly affected by urbanization and affects the thermal environment of urban centers by influencing the surface temperature of core city areas and their surroundings. These issues are addressed in the current study, which focuses on two provincial capitals in Pakistan, i.e., Lahore and Peshawar. Using Landsat data, LULC is determined with the aim to (a) examine the spatio-temporal changes in LULC over a period of 20 years from 1998 to 2018 using a CA-Markov model, (b) predict the future scenarios of LULC changes for the years 2023 and 2028, and (c) study the evolution of different LULC categories and investigate its impacts on land surface temperature (LST). The results for Peshawar city indicate the significant expansion in vegetation and built-up area replacing barren land. The vegetation cover and urban area of Peshawar have increased by 25.6%, and 16.3% respectively. In contrast, Lahore city urban land has expanded by 11.2% while vegetation cover decreased by (22.6%). These transitions between LULC classes also affect the LST in the study areas. Transformation of vegetation cover and water surface into built-up areas or barren land results in the increase in the LST. In contrast, the transformation of urban areas and barren land into vegetation cover or water results in the decrease in LST. The different LULC evolutions in Lahore and Peshawar clearly indicate their effects on the thermal environment, with an increasing LST trend in Lahore and a decrease in Peshawar. This study provides a baseline reference to urban planners and policymakers for informed decisions.

TI  - A model-data fusion approach to analyse carbon dynamics in managed grasslands
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle, with a strong potential for C sequestration. However, an improved capacity to quantify grassland C stocks and monitor their variation in space and time, particularly in response to management, is needed in order to conserve and enhance grassland C reservoirs. To meet this challenge we outline and test here an approach to combine C cycle modelling with observational data. We implemented an intermediate complexity model, DALEC-Grass, within a probabilistic model-data fusion (MDF) framework, CARDAMOM, at two managed grassland sites (Easter Bush and Crichton) in the UK. We used 3 years (Easter Bush, 2002-2004) of management data and observations of leaf area index (LAI) and Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) from eddy covariance to calibrate the distributions of model parameters. Using these refined distributions, we then assimilated the remaining 7 years (Easter Bush, 2005-2010 and Crichton, 2015) of LAI observations and evaluated the simulated NEE, above and below-ground biomass and other C fluxes against independent data from the two grasslands. Our results show that fusing model predictions with LAI observations allowed the CARDAMOM MDF system to diagnose the effects of grazing and cutting realistically. The overlap of MDF-predicted and measured NEE (both sites) and ecosystem respiration (Easter Bush) was 92% and 83% respectively while the correlation coefficient (r) was 0.79 for both variables. This study lays the foundation for using MDF with satellite data on LAI to produce the spatially and temporally-resolved estimates of C cycling needed in shaping and monitoring the implementation of relevant policies and farm-management decisions.

TI  - Beyond Cultural Identity: A Critique of <i>Horizon</i>: <i>Zero Dawn</i> as an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Simulator
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The post-apocalyptic game Horizon: Zero lawn is a role-playing game that simulates the adventures of Aloy, a female protagonist, in a world where human civilization has returned to its premodern stage of development and the world's fauna has mysteriously become robotic. The cause for this regress into premodernity is revealed by the game's embedded narrative which explains that life on earth had almost become extinct as a result of a military AI going rogue. Implicit in the game's embedded narrative is a strong critique of global capitalism that highlights how neoliberal ideas such as corporate governance, deregulation, and automation imperil life on the planet. Despite its critique, gameplay is structured on the very principles that the game's narrative claims to reject. The world of Horizon: Zero Dawn simulates an entrepreneurial ecosystem in which the player must identify opportunities and manage resources in such a manner as to successfully beat the game. The in-game economy encourages the accumulation of natural resources and features no in-built mechanic to account for the environmental consequences of the playable character's actions, notwithstanding the environmental critique of the game's narrative. This article argues that, contrary to its scripted narrative, Horizon: Zero Dawn naturalizes capitalism by means of its procedural rhetoric. I further argue that the overt critique of capitalism diverts the player's attention from the capitalist principles that support gameplay, thus, paradoxically, consolidating the ideological nature of gameplay. The game's endorsement of capitalism dovetails with a meritocratic worldview which inflects the game's approach to cultural identity and diversity.

TI  - Analyses of land use land cover (LULC) change and built-up expansion in the suburb of a metropolitan city: Spatio-temporal analysis of Delhi NCR using landsat datasets
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - During past four decades, in post economic reforms period, Delhi and its surrounding regions has attracted a large number of populations which led to the rapid transformation of its LULC pattern. Therefore, this study is aimed to analyze the LULC changes during 1990-2018 as well as the growth and pattern of built-up surfaces in relation to the population growth and migration in the suburbs of Delhi metropolitan city which is also known as the National Capital Region (NCR). The Landsat 5 (TM) and Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) data has been used for the LU/LC classification of Delhi NCR. The K means clustering technique was applied on the Landsat data for the LULC classification and then the change detection technique was used to quantify the LULC change. The result shows that the considerable changes in LULC have occurred with continuous increase in built-up area and open/fallow land and decrease in agriculture land and vegetation over the study time period. Built-up area increased by about 326 percent and open/fallow land by 44 percent while the agricultural land and vegetation cover have decreased by 12 percent and 34 percent of the total area of study respectively during the study period. Built-up area has mostly increased at the expense of agricultural land and vegetation cover while vegetation cover has been transformed into Built-up area, Ridge and Agriculture. The statistical analysis shows that the association between built-up expansion and the population and migrants varies from weak to high but the coefficient of determination was always positive.

TI  - Regression Analysis of Subsidence in the Como Basin (Northern Italy): New Insights on Natural and Anthropic Drivers from InSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural and anthropogenic subsidence such as that in the Como urban area (northern Italy) can cause significant damage to structures and infrastructure, and expose the city's lakefront to an increasing risk of inundation from Lake Como. This phenomenon affecting the Como basin has been studied by several researchers, and the major drivers of subsidence are known. However, the availability of historical InSAR data allowed us to reconsider the relationship between subsidence predisposing factors (i.e., the thicknesses of reworked and compressible layers, overburden stress, and the piezometric level) and ground surface displacements with higher precision over the entire basin. Benefiting from the deep knowledge of the hydromechanical setting of the Como basin and the availability of InSAR measurements from 1992 to 2010, in this paper we model subsidence-related movements using linear and nonlinear regression methods in order to determine the combination of natural and anthropic factors that have caused subsidence in the Como basin over the past decades. The results of this study highlight peculiar patterns of subsidence that suggest the influence of two further causes, namely tectonic control of the sedimentary architecture and diversion of local streams, which have never been considered before. This analysis aims to assess the spatial distribution of subsidence through InSAR analysis in order to enhance the knowledge and understanding of the phenomenon in the Como urban area. The interferometric data could be used to better plan urban risk management strategies.

TI  - Exploring the Relationship Between Land Surface Temperature and Land Use Change in Lahore Using Landsat Data
T2  - Pakistan Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research Series A-Physical Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study focuses on determining the correlation of land surface temperature (LST) with normalized difference builtup index (NDBI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of Lahore, a metropolitan city of Pakistan using landsat 5 and 8 dataset. This study also categorizes different types of land use through supervised image classification scheme and maximum likelihood algorithm (MLA), and assess the correlation between LST and land use type of different classes. The results of the study indicate that modifications in type of land use altered spatial variations of land surface temperature in 1990 and 2015. The findings also show that the ever increasing temperature caused by impervious surfaces such as builtup area, roads, construction sites and vacant land considerably contributes to heat island effect. However, vegetation cover, green and blue spaces decrease LST and effectively relieve the effect of heat island. LST builds a strong positive correlation with NDBI and strong negative correlation with NDVI. Based on the regression analysis between LST and NDBI and NDVI, these indices can be utilized as a sign to assess the impact of LU changes on temperature. The results further indicates that LST changes follow the pattern of LU changes in Lahore and the warmness intensity has been observed highest in the high density builtup area and vacant land, while low at the green and blue spaces. The analysis reveals that an increase in LST by 1.98 degrees C during the period of 25 years at the rate of 0.079 degrees C/year in high density builtup area was due to the excessive increase in settlement growth. The study concludes that change of land use has an effect on the LST in Lahore.

TI  - Interesting case of an abdominal wall Merkel cell carcinoma highlighting the importance of developing an Australian clinical practice guideline
T2  - BMJ CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A 66-year-old Australian male farmer was referred for management of an asymptomatic, rapidly expanding, anterior abdominal wall mass. It was firm and well circumscribed. There were no overlying skin changes, constitutional symptoms or weight loss. His medical history included small bowel obstruction and resection from a Meckel's diverticulitis and a 40-pack-year smoking history. Core biopsy was suggestive of a neuroendocrine tumour and Gallium-68-Dodecane-Tetraacetic-Acid (68GaTate) positron emission tomography revealed an avid solitary lesion confined to the subcutaneous space in the left anterior abdominal wall. Wide local excision was performed, and histopathology revealed Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). Although classically regarded as a primary cutaneous neuroendocrine tumour, MCC may originate from the subcutaneous fat without obvious skin involvement. Older patients with asymptomatic, rapidly enlarging lesions, particularly if immunosuppressed, with significant ultraviolet sunlight exposure, should raise a high index of suspicion for MCC. Like melanoma, non-metastatic MCC should be treated aggressively for best prognosis.

TI  - Modeling and mapping aboveground biomass of the restored mangroves using ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 in East Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) using remote sensing is a requisite for monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system of the United Nations Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation. However, attaining high accuracy remains a great challenge in the diverse tropical forests. Among available technologies, L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) estimates AGB with reasonably high accuracy in the terrestrial tropical forests. Nevertheless, the accuracy is relatively low in the mangrove forests. In this context, the study was carried out to model and map AGB using backscatter coefficients of Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array L-band SAR-2 (PALSAR-2) in part of the restored mangrove forest at Mahakam Delta, Indonesia. PALSAR-2 data was acquired with image scene observation during the peak low tide on 30 July 2018 from Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. The forest parameters namely tree height and diameter at breast height were measured from 71 field plots in September-October 2018. The parameters were used in mangrove allometry to calculate the field AGB. Finally, HV polarized backscatter coefficients of PALSAR-2 were used to model AGB using linear regression. The model demonstrated a comparatively high performance using three distinct methods viz. independent validation (R-2 of 0.89 and RMSE of 23.16 tons ha(-1)), random k-fold cross validation (R-2 of 0.89 and RMSE of 24.59 tons ha(-1)) and leave location out cross validation (LLO CV) (R-2 of 0.88 and RMSE of 24.05 tons ha(-1)). The high accuracy of the LLO CV indicates no spatial overfitting in the model. Thus, the model based on LLO CV was used to map AGB in the study area. This is the first study that successfully obtains high accuracy in modeling AGB in the mangrove forest. Therefore, it offers a significant contribution to the MRV mechanism for monitoring mangrove forests in the tropics and sub-tropics.

TI  - Mixed-Species Gardens Increase Monarch Oviposition without Increasing Top-Down Predation
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryThe North American monarch butterfly is an iconic insect that has recently declined by over 80%, largely due to habitat loss. The primary approach to mitigate population declines is to plant milkweed, the primary host plant that monarch caterpillars feed and develop on. Recently, researchers have focused on optimizing monarch conservation habitats (i.e., milkweed plantings) in urban green spaces by studying habitat design and plant species selection. In many cases, as plant diversity increases, predatory and parasitic insect diversity increases and insect herbivore colonization and establishment decrease. We compared milkweed monocultures to a mixture of milkweed and other wildflower species to see what effects plant diversity have on monarchs and potential predators. We found that monarchs laid 22% more eggs on milkweed planted in mixed-species plots than milkweed in monoculture. We also found more predators in the mixed-species plantings, but this did not affect monarch disappearance rates. These results can be used to create evidence-based guidelines for monarch conservation habitats.Monarch butterfly populations have declined by over 80% in the last 20 years. Conservation efforts focus on the creation of milkweed habitats to mitigate this decline. Previous research has found monarchs lay more eggs per milkweed stem in urban gardens than natural habitats and recent work identified specific garden designs that make urban gardens more attractive to monarchs. Increasing plant diversity can reduce specialist insect herbivore colonization via bottom-up (e.g., plant) and top-down (e.g., predation) regulatory factors. Although this is beneficial for pest management efforts, it contradicts conservation efforts. In this study, we explored if adding multiple flowering species to garden-sized milkweed plantings affected monarch oviposition or top-down regulation of larvae. We compared monarch egg abundance, natural enemy abundance and richness, and biological control of monarch larvae in milkweed monocultures and milkweed mixed with four additional wildflower species. We found that monarchs laid 22% more eggs on sentinel milkweed plants in mixed-species plots with no effect of plant diversity on monarch survival. We also found higher natural enemy richness, wasp, and predatory bug abundance in the mixed-species plots and this did not translate to higher biological control rates. Our results provide more evidence that plant selection and habitat design are important for monarch conservation.

TI  - A Simple Empirical Band-Ratio Algorithm to Assess Suspended Particulate Matter from Remote Sensing over Coastal and Inland Waters of Vietnam: Application to the VNREDSat-1/NAOMI Sensor
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - VNREDSat-1 is the first Vietnamese satellite enabling the survey of environmental parameters, such as vegetation and water coverages or surface water quality at medium spatial resolution (from 2.5 to 10 m depending on the considered channel). The New AstroSat Optical Modular Instrument (NAOMI) sensor on board VNREDSat-1 has the required spectral bands to assess the suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration. Because recent studies have shown that the remote sensing reflectance,R-rs(lambda), at the blue (450-520 nm), green (530-600 nm), and red (620-690 nm) spectral bands can be assessed using NAOMI with good accuracy, the present study is dedicated to the development and validation of an algorithm (hereafter referred to as V1SPM) to assessSPMfromR(rs)(lambda) over inland and coastal waters of Vietnam. For that purpose, an in-situ data set of hyper-spectralR(rs)(lambda) andSPM(from 0.47 to 240.14 g center dot m(-3)) measurements collected at 205 coastal and inland stations has been gathered. Among the different approaches, including four historical algorithms, the polynomial algorithms involving the red-to-green reflectance ratio presents the best performance on the validation data set (mean absolute percent difference (MAPD) of 18.7%). Compared to the use of a single spectral band, the band ratio reduces the scatter around the polynomial fit, as well as the impact of imperfect atmospheric corrections. Due to the lack of matchup data points with VNREDSat-1, the full VNREDSat-1 processing chain (atmospheric correction (RED-NIR) and V1SPM), aiming at estimatingSPMfrom the top-of-atmosphere signal, was applied to the Landsat-8/OLI match-up data points with relatively low to moderateSPMconcentration (3.33-15.25 g center dot m(-3)), yielding aMAPDof 15.8%. An illustration of the use of this VNREDSat-1 processing chain during a flooding event occurring in Vietnam is provided.

TI  - A New Hybrid Firefly-PSO Optimized Random Subspace Tree Intelligence for Torrential Rainfall-Induced Flash Flood Susceptible Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash flood is one of the most dangerous natural phenomena because of its high magnitudes and sudden occurrence, resulting in huge damages for people and properties. Our work aims to propose a state-of-the-art model for susceptibility mapping of the flash flood using the decision tree random subspace ensemble optimized by hybrid firefly-particle swarm optimization (HFPS), namely the HFPS-RSTree model. In this work, we used data from a flood inventory map consisting of 1866 polygons derived from Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and a field survey conducted in the northwest mountainous area of the Van Ban district, Lao Cai Province in Vietnam. A total of eleven flooding conditioning factors (soil type, geology, rainfall, river density, elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), plant curvature, and profile curvature) were used as explanatory variables. These indicators were compiled from a geological and mineral resources map, soil type map, and topographic map, ALOS PALSAR DEM 30 m, and Landsat-8 imagery. The HFPS-RSTree model was trained and verified using the inventory map and the eleven conditioning variables and then compared with four machine learning algorithms, i.e., the support vector machine (SVM), the random forests (RF), the C4.5 decision trees (C4.5 DT), and the logistic model trees (LMT) models. We employed a range of statistical standard metrics to assess the predictive performance of the proposed model. The results show that the HFPS-RSTree model had the best predictive performance and achieved better results than those of other benchmarks with the ability to predict flash flood, reaching an overall accuracy of over 90%. It can be concluded that the proposed approach provides new insights into flash flood prediction in mountainous regions.

TI  - Validation of Sentinel-3A Based Lake Level over US and Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry is an important contributor for measuring the water level of continental water bodies. The technique has been applied for almost three decades. In this period the data quality has increased and the applications have evolved from the study of a few large lakes and rivers, to near global applications at various scales. Products from current satellite altimetry missions should be validated to continuously improve the measurements. Sentinel-3A has been operating since 2016 and is the first mission operating in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode globally. Here we evaluate its performance in capturing lake level variations based on a physical and an empirical retracker provided in the official level 2 product. The validation is performed for more than 100 lakes in the United States and Canada where the altimetry based water levels are compared with in situ data. As validation measures we consider the root mean squared error, the Pearson correlation, and the percentage of outliers. For the US sites the median of the RMSE value is 25 cm and 19 cm and the median of the Pearson correlations are 0.86 and 0.93 for the physical and empirical retracker, respectively. The percentage of outliers (median) is 11% for both retrackers. The validations measures are slightly poorer for the Canadian sites; the median RMSE is approximately 5 cm larger, the Pearson correlation 0.1 lower, and the percentage of outliers 5% larger. The poorer performance for the Canadian sites is mainly related to the presence of lake ice in the winter period where the surface elevations are not able to map the surface correctly. The validation measures improve considerably when evaluated for summer data only. For both areas we show that the reconstruction of the water level variations based on the empirical retracker is significantly better compared to that of the physical retracker in terms of the RMSE and the Pearson correlation.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy and economic impact of three work-up strategies identifying risk groups in endometrial cancer, fully incorporating sentinel lymph node algorithm
T2  - FACTS VIEWS AND VISION IN OBGYN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: According to the European Society for Medical Oncology/ European Society of Gynaecological Oncology/European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESMO/ESGO/ESTRO) Consensus Conference, the role of preoperative risk groups (RGs) in endometrial cancer (EC) is to direct surgical nodal staging. We compared diagnostic accuracy and economic impact of three work-up strategies to identify RGs.Methods: A retrospective multicentre study including patients with early-stage EC. The three different work-up strategies were as follows:-Mondovi Hospital: transvaginal ultrasonography, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); frozen section examination of the uterus in case of imaging discordance. High-risk patients underwent abdominal computed tomography.-Gemelli Hospital: transvaginal ultrasonography, MRI, One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) of sentinel lymph node (SLN); frozen section examination of the uterus in case of imaging discordance.-Negrar Hospital: positron emission tomography (PET), frozen section examination of the uterus and of SLN. For statistical purposes patients were assigned, preoperatively and postoperatively, to two groups: group A (high-risk) and group B (not high-risk).Results: Three hundred eighty-five patients were included (93 Mondovi, 215 Gemelli, 77 Negrar). Endometrial biopsy errors led to 47.3% misclassifications. Test accuracy of Mondovi, Gemelli and Negrar strategies was 0.83 (95%CI 0.734-0.901), 0.95 (95%CI 0.909-0.975) and 0.94 (95%CI 0.866-0.985), respectively. Preoperative work-up mean cost per patient in group A was (sic)514.5 at Mondovi, (sic)868.5 at Gemelli, and (sic)1212.8 at Negrar hospital (p-value < 0.001), while in group B was (sic)378.8 at Mondovi, (sic)941.2 at Gemelli, and (sic)1848.4 at Negrar hospital (p-value < 0.001).Conclusions: In our study, work-up strategies with more relevant economic impact showed a better diagnostic accuracy. Upcoming guidelines should specify recommendations about the gold standard work-up strategy, including the role of SLN.

TI  - BODY as PLACE and ARCHIVE of EXPERIENCE
T2  - GEOGRAFICIDADE
M3  - Article
AB  - From the experience, my own, as a practitioner of the artistic-cultural manifestation of Capoeira Angola, I have researched about this body that ginga, which carries a gesture, which now also constitutes as part of my body. Based on the idea of the corporal archives of the geographer Chaveiro, at the intersection with the fought of the historian Castro Junior, of the philosopher Eduardo de Oliveira and the anthropologist Tavares, who address the question of a sign file as a memory of the African Diaspora, I seek to foment the discussion of the gestuality presented in the capoeira like reference to a spatiality, a place of the world. The experiences and worldview of the black people, who were victims of a brutal kidnapping that brought them to Brazil, where they marked our culture with their bodies, the language of the body, presenting a different, non-Western philosophy, who thinks the world "upside down".

TI  - Land Subsidence Measurement in Reclaimed Coastal Land: Noksan Using C-Band Sentinel-1 Radar Interferometry
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been 27 years since the beginning of the Noksan national industrial complex construction at downstream of the Nakdong River in Busan. The complex was built by landfilling a coastal area over one of Korea's deepest soft ground areas. Land subsidence occurred since the start of construction due to primary consolidation and secondary consolidation after the creation finished. Since secondary consolidation directly affects the structure over Noksan, it is crucial to monitor the subsidence rate. This study found that land subsidence happened in four areas of Noksan National Industrial Complex from 2017 to 2020 by applying Stamford Methods for Persistent Scatterer (StaMPS) time-series method using C-band Sentinel-1 SAR datasets from descending and ascending track. The results show land subsidence with a maximum velocity of 20.98 mm/year from descending track datasets and 20.92 mm/year from ascending track datasets. The highest rate area of land subsidence occurred in the south part of Noksan. Mean vertical deformation maps between descending and ascending track have been compared and show a good relationship with 0.93 of coefficient correlation. These approach methods in this study that using StaMPS could be used to monitor slow rate of land subsidence in reclaimed coastal land.

TI  - Evaluation of <i>Escherichia coli</i> as an indicator for antimicrobial resistance in <i>Salmonella</i> recovered from the same food or animal ceca samples
T2  - FOOD CONTROL
M3  - Review
AB  - National one health monitoring programs for antimicrobial-resistant enteric pathogens often include Escherichia coli as a sentinel for resistance to antimicrobials with Gram-negative activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate if antimicrobial resistance for E. coli can predict resistance in Salmonella when they occur together in the same surveillance sample of raw retail meat or food animal cecal contents collected by the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS). One colony of each bacterium was isolated from each culture-positive sample and assayed for antimicrobial susceptibility by broth microdilution using the standard NARMS panel of 14 antimicrobial agents. A total of 1305 raw retail meats and 348 slaughter animal cecal samples contained both bacteria. Likelihood ratios were used to assess the extent to which antimicrobial resistance in E. coli coincides with resistance in Salmonella from the same sample. Results showed that for 8 out of 10, and 5 out of 10 antimicrobials tested in retail meat and cecal respectively, there was a statistically significant increase in the probability of finding Salmonella resistant to a particular antimicrobial when E. coli from the same sample was resistant to the same drug. Among those 8 and 5, likelihood ratios show that E. coli resistant predicted Salmonella resistance to ceftriaxone, ceftiofur, cefoxitin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in retail meat, and to gentamicin, ceftriaxone and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in cecal samples. Although E. coli is used as a sentinel for integrated antimicrobial resistance surveillance, these results suggest that E. coli may have limited value as the sole predictor of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella except for beta lactams antimicrobials.

TI  - Ice extent in sub-arctic fjords and coastal areas from 2001 to 2019 analyzed from MODIS imagery
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Results examining variations in the ice extent along the Norwegian coastline based on the analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images from 2001 to 2019, February through May, are presented. A total of 386 fjords and coastal areas were outlined and grouped into ten regions to assess seasonal and long-term trends in ice extent. In addition, three fjords were examined to investigate how ice extent may vary over short distances (<100 km). Of the 386 outlined, 47 fjords/coastal areas held >5 km(2) of ice at least once between 2001 and 2019. Over this span of time, no statistically significant trend in ice extent is found for all ten regions; however, variations between regions and years are evident. Ice extent is assessed through comparison to three weather variables - freezing degree days (FDD), daily new snowfall and daily freshwater supply from rainfall plus snowmelt. Six out of ten regions are significantly positively correlated (p < 0.05) to FDD. In addition, ice in two regions is significantly positively correlated to daily new snowfall, and in one region negatively correlated to rainfall plus snowmelt. The importance of fjord geometry and bathymetry as well as other weather variables including wind is discussed.

TI  - Improved Remote Sensing Methods to Detect Northern Wild Rice (<i>Zizania palustris L.</i>)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Declining populations of Zizania palustris L. (northern wildrice, or wildrice) during the last century drives the demand for new and innovative techniques to support monitoring of this culturally and ecologically significant crop wild relative. We trained three wildrice detection models in R and Google Earth Engine using data from annual aquatic vegetation surveys in northern Minnesota. Three different training datasets, varying in the definition of wildrice presence, were combined with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to map wildrice in 2015 using random forests. Spectral predictors were derived from phenologically important time periods of emergence (June-July) and peak harvest (August-September). The range of the Vertical Vertical (VV) polarization between the two time periods was consistently the top predictor. Model outputs were evaluated using both point and area-based validation (polygon). While all models performed well in the point validation with percent correctly classified ranging from 83.8% to 91.1%, we found polygon validation necessary to comprehensively assess wildrice detection accuracy. Our practical approach highlights a variety of applications that can be applied to guide field excursions and estimate the extent of occurrence at landscape scales. Further testing and validation of the methods we present may support multiyear monitoring which is foundational for the preservation of wildrice for future generations.

TI  - Tree extraction from multi-scale UAV images using Mask R-CNN with FPN
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree detection and counting have been performed using conventional methods or high costly remote sensing data. In the past few years, deep learning techniques have gained significant progress in the remote sensing area. Namely, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been recognized as one of the most successful and widely used deep learning approaches and they have been used for object detection. In this paper, we employed a Mask R-CNN model and feature pyramid network (FPN) for tree extraction from high-resolution RGB unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data. The main aim of this paper is to explore the employed method in images with different scales and tree contents. For this purpose, UAV images from two different areas were acquired and three big-scale test images were created for experimental analysis and accuracy assessment. According to the accuracy analyses, despite the scale and the content changes, the proposed model maintains its detection accuracy to a large extent. To our knowledge, this is the first time a Mask R-CNN model with FPN has been used with UAV data for tree extraction.

TI  - The influence of seasonal land-use-land-cover transformation on thermal characteristics within the city of Pietermaritzburg
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanisation has been identified as a major threat to the environment as it increases demand for urban spaces and transforms natural landscapes to impervious surfaces, leading to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. Natural landscapes such as vegetation and water bodies act as thermal sinks that absorb heat while impervious surfaces such as buildings and concrete pavements act as thermal sources that retain and emit heat. The thermal emission results in several negative effects such as temperature inversion, compromised human health, pollution, species loss, high energy consumption and climate change at a local, regional and global scales. Whereas studies on UHI are abound, there is paucity in literature on the influence of seasonal urban Land Use Land Cover (LULC) transformation on urban thermal characteristics. Specifically, the proportional seasonal variability and contribution of individual LULCs to urban heat is often poorly understood. Using the freely available Landsat 8 optical and thermal bands, this study examined the seasonal characteristics of the UHI phenomenon in relation to LULCs in the Pietermaritzburg city, South Africa. Results in this study revealed that UHIs exist in both winter and summer, but with more intensity in summer. The study also established that LULCs varied with seasons. Bare surfaces and dense vegetation had the most thermal influence during winter while dense vegetation and low density buildings had the most thermal influence during summer. These findings provide a better understanding of thermal distribution based on LULC seasonality changes, valuable for sustainable urban planning and climate change mitigation.

TI  - Automated Processing for Flood Area Detection Using ALOS-2 and Hydrodynamic Simulation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and frequent mapping of flood areas are essential for monitoring and mitigating flood disasters. The Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) carries an L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) capable of rapid and frequent disaster observations. In this study, we developed a fully automatic, fast computation, and robust method for detecting flood areas using ALOS-2 and hydrodynamic flood simulation data. This study is the first attempt to combine flood simulation data from the Today's Earth system (TE) with SAR-based disaster mapping. We used Bayesian inference to combine the amplitude/coherence data by ALOS-2 and the flood fraction data by TE. Our experimental results used 12 flood observation sets of data from Japan and had high accuracy and robustness for use under various ALOS-2 observation conditions. Flood simulation contributed to improving the accuracy of flood detection and reducing computation time. Based on these findings, we also assessed the operability of our method and found that the combination of ALOS-2 and TE data with our analysis method was capable of daily flood monitoring.

TI  - Validation of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer Height Estimated from the MODIS Atmospheric Profile Data at an Equatorial Site
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric boundary layer height is important for constraining air pollution and meteorological models. This study attempted to validate the MODIS-estimated atmospheric boundary layer height (ABLH), and variation in the ABLH in Uganda was evaluated. The ABLH was estimated from MODIS data using the mixing ratio profile gradient method and compared to the ABLH estimated from radiosonde data using three different methods. Unlike in studies in other regions of the world, correlations between ABLH estimated using MODIS and radiosonde data were weak, implying limited usefulness of MODIS data for determining ABLH. However, the diurnal variation in MODIS-derived ABLH and particulate matter (PM10) was consistent with the expected inverse relationship between PM10 mass concentration and ABLH, and the mean MODIS-derived ABLH values were significantly lower during wet seasons than dry seasons, as expected.

TI  - Crop Type Classification Using Fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data: Assessing the Impact of Feature Selection, Optical Data Availability, and Parcel Sizes on the Accuracies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type classification using Earth Observation (EO) data is challenging, particularly for crop types with similar phenological growth stages. In this regard, the synergy of optical and Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables a broad representation of biophysical and structural information on target objects, enhancing crop type mapping. However, the fusion of multi-sensor dense time-series data often comes with the challenge of high dimensional feature space. In this study, we (1) evaluate how the usage of only optical, only SAR, and their fusion affect the classification accuracy; (2) identify the combination of which time-steps and feature-sets lead to peak accuracy; (3) analyze misclassifications based on the parcel size, optical data availability, and crops' temporal profiles. Two fusion approaches were considered and compared in this study: feature stacking and decision fusion. To distinguish the most relevant feature subsets time- and variable-wise, grouped forward feature selection (gFFS) was used. gFFS allows focusing analysis and interpretation on feature sets of interest like spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs), or data sensing time rather than on single features. This feature selection strategy leads to better interpretability of results while substantially reducing computational expenses. The results showed that, in contrast to most other studies, SAR datasets outperform optical datasets. Similar to most other studies, the optical-SAR combination outperformed single sensor predictions. No significant difference was recorded between feature stacking and decision fusion. Random Forest (RF) appears to be robust to high feature space dimensionality. The feature selection did not improve the accuracies even for the optical-SAR feature stack with 320 features. Nevertheless, the combination of RF feature importance and time- and variable-wise gFFS rankings in one visualization enhances interpretability and understanding of the features' relevance for specific classification tasks. For example, by enabling the identification of features that have high RF feature importance values but are, in their information content, correlated with other features. This study contributes to the growing domain of interpretable machine learning.

TI  - ASSESMENT OF SERBIAN HYMNOGRAPHY BY RUSSIAN SLAVISTS OF THE 19TH CENTURY AND THEIR FOLLOWERS
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper discusses the works of Serbian medieval hymnography dedicated to St. Prince Lazar of Kosovo, distinguishes the cultural and historical context of Serbian national traditions, in terms of reflection of archetypical features of the Serbian mentality in the works of hymnology and interest to Slavic scholars and thinkers of the nineteenth century. According to I. I. Sreznevsky, P. I. Preis, V. I. Lamansky, K. N. Leontiev, heroic and volitional principle are inextricably linked for the Serbian archetype and national consciousness with the Christian worldview. The article provides a number of examples that show that the high pathos of Serbian literary texts is characteristic of both medieval and modern Serbian literature. Their representatives with high fervour praise the feats of arms, military valor, resistance to evil which goes back to the ancient tradition. In this regard, the epic songs of the Kosovo cycle and works of Church hymnography - Canon, stichera, praiseworthy words, etc., dedicated to Prince Lazarus and other Kosovar martyrs are particularly illustrative. The article notes that the works of Church hymnography and folk epic tradition developed in parallel, fueling each other in ideological, thematic and artistic terms. Special attention is paid to the facts of studying self-consciousness of the Serbian people and their collective memory in the works of outstanding Russian Slavists of the 19th century. These works were continued with by number of famous researchers of the 20th - early 21st century (V. A. Moshin, O. N. Trubachev, N. I. Tolstoy, I. F. Priyma, I. A. Charota, etc.). The paper considers some of these researchers' positions as the basis for further study of works of Serbian Church hymnography and folk songs of the Kosovo cycle, aiming to include them in the modern scientific context.

TI  - Crops monitoring and yield estimation using sentinel products in semi-arid smallholder irrigation schemes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of earth observation data for crop mapping and monitoring in West Africa has concentrated on rainfed systems due to its pre-dominance in the sub-region. However, irrigated systems, though of limited extent, provide critical livelihood support to many. Accurate statistics on irrigated crops are, thus, needed for effective management and decision making. This study explored the use of Sentinel 1 (S-1) and Sentinel 2 (S-2) data to map the extent and yield of irrigated crops in an informal irrigation scheme in Burkina Faso. Random Forest classification and regression were used together with an extensive field data comprising 842 polygons. Four irrigated crops (tomoto, onion, green bean and other) were classified while the yield of tomatoes was modelled through regression analysis. Apart from spectral bands, derivatives (e.g. biophysical parameters and vegetation indices) from S-2 were used. Different data configuration of S-1, S-2 and their derivatives were tested to ascertain optimal temporal windows for accurate irrigated crop mapping and yield estimation. Results of the crop classification revealed a greater overall accuracy (76.3%) for S-2 compared to S-1 (69.4%), with S-2 biophysical parameters (especially the fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation i.e fAPAR) being prominent. For yield prediction, however, S-1 VV polarization came up as the most prominent predictor in the regression analysis (R-adj(2) = 0.63), while the addition of S-2 fAPAR marginally improved the fit (R-adj(2) = 0.64). Tomato yield in the study area was found to range from 1 to 16 kg m(-2), although about 83% of the area have yields of less than 10 kg m(-2). Our study revealed that early season images (acquired in December) perform better in classifying irrigated crop compared to mid or late season. On the other hand, the use of early to mid-season (December to February) images for yield modelling produced reasonable prediction accuracy. This indicates the possibility of using S-1 and S-2 data to predict crop yield prior to harvest season for efficient planning and food security attainment.

M3  - Article
AB  - Under the conditions of present-day modernization of education, the urgency of dealing with educational issues and challenges in terms of the coronavirus pandemic, the teacher's technological culture enhancement who is capable to effectively apply innovative technologies in the educational process has acquired particular significance. Therefore, special attention is paid today to the formation of future music teachers' technological culture by means of applying innovative technologies in vocal training at the institution of higher artistic and artistic-pedagogical education. The technological culture of the teacher is considered as a professional and personal phenomenon based on value-and-technology worldview and way of thinking, skills in the application of technological knowledge, those formed and implemented in creative artistic and pedagogical activities as well as the ability to creatively use pedagogical tools. Students have to master a wide range of technologies for teaching singing and then use them in their practical activities as music teachers, namely: technologies aimed at mastering performing and methodological foundations of singing for future teachers; information and computer technologies, including remote ones, aimed at teaching the art of singing in remote access and mastering the basics of sound amplification equipment by both future performers and music teachers; technologies that have a music therapy and healthcare effect. The methodological basis for technological culture formation of future music teachers in the process of vocal training features such scientific approaches as: culturological, technological, competence approach along with creative one. In order to effectively form the technological culture of future musical art teachers, the following elements have been determined: the structure of this phenomenon, which includes axiological-culturological, epistemological-emotional, technological and activity approaches as well as creative-professional one; their level of formation is determined by the identified criteria, in particular: value-axiological, cognitive-emotional, vocal-operational and creative-professional.

TI  - Assessment of Terrain and Land Use/Land Cover Changes of Mine Sites using Geospatial Techniques in Plateau State, Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we report a geospatial assessment of the selected mine sites in the Plateau State, Nigeria. The aim of this work is to determine the impact of mining on the terrain as well as the Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) of the host communities. The Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) is used for the terrain mapping. The derived impact of mining on LULC between 1975 and 2014 is determined by classifying the relevant Landsat imageries. The digital terrain map reveal that the mining activity is not well-coordinated. Hence, the parts of the mine sites that are rich in the desired minerals are punctuated with low depth, while the other parts have high terrain as a result of the haphazard mining activity. The analysis of the LULC change show that the degraded land (DL), built-up area (BU), water bodies (WB), and exposed rock outcrop (RO) increase by 15.68%, 4.68%, 0.06%, and 14.5%, respectively, whereas the arable farmland (FL) and forest reserve (FR) decrease by 28.29% and 6.63%, respectively. Mining has adversely affected the natural ecology of the studied area. Therefore, the mine sites should be monitored, and their environmental damages should be pre-determined and mitigated. There should be regular inspections to keep these activities under control. The existing laws and regulations to conserve the natural ecosystems of the host communities should be enforced to curtail the excesses of the operators of the mining industries. Restoration of the minefields to reduce the existing hazards prevent further environmental degradation, and facilitating the socio-economic development of the area is also suggested.

TI  - Analyzing the effect of cutting parameters and tool nose radius on forces, machining power and tool life in face milling of ductile iron and validation using finite element analysis
T2  - ENGINEERING RESEARCH EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the effect of cutting speed, feed rate, and tool nose radius on the forces, cutting power and tool life has been investigated in machining ductile iron. Face milling inserts with 0.8 mm and 2 mm corner radii were tested at three different cutting speeds and feed rates. The experiments were conducted using a full factorial design method and the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) technique was used to determine the significance of each variable that is responsible for the variation in forces and machining power. AdvantEdge finite element analysis software was used to study the stress zones and temperature distribution on the cutting edge. The study shows that when the feed rate is increased, there is a linear increase in the radial (Fx) and cutting (Fy) forces. The contribution of feed rate on Fx and Fy forces was around 80% and 87%, respectively. However, with a significance of around 17%, the effect of the tool nose radius was pronounced more in the axial direction (Fz force). The finite element analysis showed higher temperature and stress regions in the nose radius zone of the tool with 2 mm corner radius. The lesser contact area between the tool and workpiece of the insert with 0.8 mm nose radius resulted in lower axial force, lower friction, and increased tool life by around 57%.

TI  - Identification of Tyre and Plastic Waste from Combined Copernicus Sentinel-1 and-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of tightened waste regulation across Europe, reports of waste crime have been on the rise. Significant stockpiles of tyres and plastic materials have been identified as a threat to both human and environmental health, leading to water and livestock contamination, providing substantial fuel for fires, and cultivating a variety of disease vectors. Traditional methods of identifying illegal stockpiles usually involve laborious field surveys, which are unsuitable for national scale management. Remotely-sensed investigations to tackle waste have been less explored due to the spectrally variable and complex nature of tyres and plastics, as well as their similarity to other land covers such as water and shadow. Therefore, the overall objective of this study was to develop an accurate classification method for both tyre and plastic waste to provide a viable platform for repeatable, cost-effective, and large-scale monitoring. An augmented land cover classification is presented that combines Copernicus Sentinel-2 optical imagery with thematic indices and Copernicus Sentinel-1 microwave data, and two random forests land cover classification algorithms were trained for the detection of tyres and plastics across Scotland. Testing of the method identified 211 confirmed tyre and plastic stockpiles, with overall classification accuracies calculated above 90%.

TI  - Detection of Irrigated and Rainfed Crops in Temperate Areas Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of irrigated areas by means of remote sensing is essential to improve agricultural water resource management. Currently, data from the Sentinel constellation offer new possibilities for mapping irrigated areas at the plot scale. Until now, few studies have used Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data to provide approaches for mapping irrigated plots in temperate areas. This study proposes a method for detecting irrigated and rainfed plots in a temperate area (southwestern France) jointly using optical (Sentinel-2), radar (Sentinel-1) and meteorological (SAFRAN) time series, through a classification algorithm. Monthly cumulative indices calculated from these satellite data were used in a Random Forest classifier. Two data years have been used, with different meteorological characteristics, allowing the performance of the method to be analysed under different climatic conditions. The combined use of the whole cumulative data (radar, optical and weather) improves the irrigated crop classifications (Overall Accuary (OA) approximate to 0.7) compared to the classifications obtained using each data separately (OA < 0.5). The use of monthly cumulative rainfall allows a significant improvement of the Fscore of irrigated and rainfed classes. Our study also reveals that the use of cumulative monthly indices leads to performances similar to those of the use of 10-day images while considerably reducing computational resources.

TI  - Damming effects on the degree of hydrological alteration and stability of wetland in lower Atreyee River basin
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have discovered damming effect on downstream river eco-hydrological state but little is thought about its consequences on eco-hydrology of riparian wetlands. Hydrological data scarcity at a spatial scale is one of the major constraints. The present study intends to explore the damming effect on eco-hydrological components like wetland depth, consistency in water appearance, hydrological stability, eco-hydrological failure and eco-deficit using spectral indices from remote sensing data taking Atreyee river basin as a case. Time series Normalized differences water index and Modified normalized differences water index are taken as the database. Range of variability approach and flow duration curve methods are adopted for the computing failure rate of ecological water appearance and eco-deficit in the wetland. The result shows a statistically acceptable positive relation (0.76 to 0.89) between normalized differences water index and modified normalized differences water index value and depth of water in wetland inferring the substitutability of spectral values to depth data. In the post-dam phase (2012 onward) about 82% and 96% wetland area in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season has turned into a hydrologically unstable state leading to a growing failure rate for attaining ecologically essential water volume and eco-hydro deficit state of wetland. Damming has converted only 100% wetland area into the eco-deficit zone which is ecologically not viable. Based on the findings study recommends that for the survival of the river and wetland ecological flow is required to release from the dam.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy rice occupied higher position among the staple food crops in the world. Paddy being a wetland crop; it requires more water than the other crops. India is one of the largest paddy producers in the world. Andhra Pradesh is the second largest paddy producer in India after West Bengal. In the latest era of technology, microwave remote sensing play major role in large scale monitoring of crop growth irrespective of environmental condition. In the present study dual polarized pencil beam SCATSAT-1 (Scatterometer Satellite 1) scatterometer and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) datasets are used to study paddy crop growth. Horizontal and vertical polarisation brightness temperatures were used to derive Dual Polarization Difference Index (DPDI) for paddy and forest classes. The DPDI was related with 16-day composite of NDVI data of MODIS sensor. To test the hypothesis, z-test was performed for testing significance between DPDI and NDVI. In the z-test the calculated value 11.455 is greater than table value 2.576, hence alternate hypothesis is accepted. Therefore, it is statistically proved that DPDI-NDVI relationship is influenced by soil moisture.

TI  - A Review on Drone-Based Data Solutions for Cereal Crops
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Review
AB  - Food security is a longstanding global issue over the last few centuries. Eradicating hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030 is still a key challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed additional stress on food production, demand, and supply chain systems; majorly impacting cereal crop producer and importer countries. Short food supply chain based on the production from local farms is less susceptible to travel and export bans and works as a smooth system in the face of these stresses. Local drone-based data solutions can provide an opportunity to address these challenges. This review aims to present a deeper understanding of how the drone-based data solutions can help to combat food insecurity caused due to the pandemic, zoonotic diseases, and other food shocks by enhancing cereal crop productivity of small-scale farming systems in low-income countries. More specifically, the review covers sensing capabilities, promising algorithms, and methods, and added-value of novel machine learning algorithms for local-scale monitoring, biomass and yield estimation, and mapping of them. Finally, we present the opportunities for linking information from citizen science, internet of things (IoT) based on low-cost sensors and drone-based information to satellite data for upscaling crop yield estimation to a larger geographical extent within the Earth Observation umbrella.

TI  - Canadian Biomass Burning Aerosol Properties Modification during a Long-Ranged Event on August 2018
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to study the spatio-temporal evolution of a long-lasting Canadian biomass burning event that affected Europe in August 2018. The event produced biomass burning aerosol layers which were observed during their transport from Canada to Europe from the 16 to the 26 August 2018 using active remote sensing data from the space-borne system Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). The total number of aerosol layers detected was 745 of which 42% were identified as pure biomass burning. The remaining 58% were attributed to smoke mixed with: polluted dust (34%), clean continental (10%), polluted continental (5%), desert dust (6%) or marine aerosols (3%). In this study, smoke layers, pure and mixed ones, were observed by the CALIPSO satellite from 0.8 and up to 9.6 km height above mean sea level (amsl.). The mean altitude of these layers was found between 2.1 and 5.2 km amsl. The angstrom ngstrom exponent, relevant to the aerosol backscatter coefficient (532/1064 nm), ranged between 0.9 and 1.5, indicating aerosols of different sizes. The mean linear particle depolarization ratio at 532 nm for pure biomass burning aerosols was found equal to 0.05 +/- 0.04, indicating near spherical aerosols. We also observed that, in case of no aerosol mixing, the sphericity of pure smoke aerosols does not change during the air mass transportation (0.05-0.06). On the contrary, when the smoke is mixed with dessert dust the mean linear particle depolarization ratio may reach values up to 0.20 +/- 0.04, especially close to the African continent (Region 4).

TI  - Parameterization of Vegetation Scattering Albedo in the Tau-Omega Model for Soil Moisture Retrieval on Croplands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate radiative transfer model (RTM) is essential for the retrieval of soil moisture (SM) from microwave remote sensing data, such as the passive microwave measurements from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. This mission delivers soil moisture products based upon L-band brightness temperature data, via retrieval algorithms for surface and root-zone soil moisture, the latter is retrieved using data assimilation and model support. We found that the RTM based on the tau-omega (tau-omega) model can suffer from significant errors over croplands in the simulation of brightness temperature (Tb) (in average between -9.4K and +12.0K for single channel algorithm (SCA); -8K and +9.7K for dual-channel algorithm (DCA)) if the vegetation scattering albedo (omega) is set constant and temporal variations are not considered. In order to reduce this uncertainty, we propose a time-varying parameterization of omega for the widely established zeroth order radiative transfer tau-omega model. The main assumption is that omega can be expressed by a functional relationship between vegetation optical depth (tau) and the Green Vegetation Fraction (GVF). Assuming allometry in the tau-omega relationship, a power-law function was established and it is supported by correlating measurements of tau and GVF. With this relationship, both tau and omega increase during the development of vegetation. The application of the proposed time-varying vegetation scattering albedo results in a consistent improvement for the unbiased root mean square error of 16% for SCA and 15% for DCA. The reduction for positive and negative biases was 45% and 5% for SCA and 26% and 12% for DCA, respectively. This indicates that vegetation dynamics within croplands are better represented by a time-varying single scattering albedo. Based on these results, we anticipate that the time-varying omega within the tau-omega model will help to mitigate potential estimation errors in the current SMAP soil moisture products (SCA and DCA). Furthermore, the improved tau-omega model might serve as a more accurate observation operator for SMAP data assimilation in weather and climate prediction model.

T2  - FWU JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently the international politics is marked by major developments as military intervention, oil politics, strategic power calculations and pre-emptive wars. The American policy contours in Afghanistan consequent to 9/11 were to defeat, dismantle and disrupt Al-Qaeda and Taliban through military engagement in order to have a less violent world. The US military engagement under Operation Enduring Freedom remained of Combating Terrorism till the end of 2014 while in the first half of 2015 it transformed into Operation Freedom Sentinel under Resolute Support Mission in order to restrict the very role of NATO to Assist, Advice and Train the military personnel only. The grounds for investigation are that what are the US policy contours in Afghanistan and how much the US military engagement has worked? What are main problems in the region and reasons for problems also need to be checked. For this research mixed method design is used with descriptive statistics. The hypothesis of study is that Afghanistan is significant for the United States for not only curbing terrorism but also for relative power maximization as expounded by realist paradigm. Despite US military engagement for one and half decade, the momentum of militancy and insurgency inside Afghanistan is mounting whereby IS has also been an addition to the scene and there are various obstacles in peace talks. The viable solution for Afghanistan problem is not military but negotiation based on pluralism, constitutionalism and recognition of minorities' rights.

AB  - In the present study, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager multispectral data covering Gujarat's Kachchh district have been analyzed to map the Deccan Traps. The study area is covered by different lithological units from Middle Jurassic to Holocene rock formation. Deccan Volcanics of Upper Cretaceous to Eocene age consist of Alkali Gabbro, Andesitic Trachyte, Basalt Flows, Intertrappean sediments, Dolerite dykes and Olivine Gabbro. The study aims to distinguish the basalts of Deccan Volcanics using remote sensing data. The basalts were segregated using image processing techniques such as false color composite based on the optimal index factor, band rationing, minimum noise fraction and principal component analysis. Conclusively, entire techniques used differentiated the basalts from other lithological units. The data were validated using laboratory reflectance spectra of rock samples. The map of basalt in Kachchh district was created from the processed Landsat 8 OLI image manifesting different flows, and it covers an area of total 1913.95 sq km.

TI  - Snow depth and snow water equivalent retrieval using X-band PolInSAR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the dynamics of snow and glaciers in the Indian Himalaya has always attracted the attention of the remote sensing community. The snow water equivalent (SWE) represents the amount of water contained in the snowpack, and it is a product of snow depth (SD) and snow density (rho s). The estimation of SD at high spatial and temporal resolution is still a challenge, especially in rugged mountainous terrain, like the Himalayas. In this paper, bistatic TerraSAR-X quad-polarization data is used to retrieve the SD using the Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (PolInSAR) coherences. The PolInSAR coherence at hv polarization shows a linear relationship with SD, which is verified with the field data. This relationship is utilized for the retrieval of SD using the proposed algorithm. Spatially variable rho sis used to retrieve the SWE. The coefficient of determination (R2) values of the retrieved SD on 8 January 2016 and 19 January 2016 are 0.62 and 0.80, respectively. Likewise, it is 0.61 and 0.72 for retrieved SWE. The root mean square error (RMSE) in SD on 8 January 2016 and 19 January 2016 are 7.00 cm and 5.48 cm, respectively; for SWE, it is 2.02 cm and 1.48 cm, respectively.

TI  - Evaluation Framework of Landsat 8-Based Actual Evapotranspiration Estimates in Data-Sparse Catchment
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has revolutionized the assessment of evapotranspiration by continuous monitoring of the variable at a global scale. However, it is difficult to accurately estimate actual evapotranspiration (AET) in areas with high spatial heterogeneity along with very little ancillary data available. The presence of spatial heterogeneity is observed over India and being a country, whose economy largely depends on agriculture, estimation of AET is crucial for efficient water management. This study proposed a new framework to evaluate AET at a fine spatial scale suitable for such heterogeneous and data-sparse environments, with spatial and temporal validation using global datasets. Landsat 8 data were used to estimate AET for eight cloud-free days of 2014 over the Malaprabha River Basin in India using the modified surface energy balance algorithm for land (M-SEBAL) and two-source energy balance (TSEB) models. These two AET estimates were compared with Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) AET for spatial and temporal validation respectively. M-SEBAL outperformed TSEB in capturing the magnitude and spatial variability of AET (e.g., spatial correlation between M-SEBAL and MODIS AET was 0.56 and 0.45 for day of year (DOYs) 040 and 136, respectively, whereas for the same DOYs the correlation between TSEB and MODIS AET was 0.16 and 0.36). The results demonstrate the challenge in AET estimation at a fine spatial resolution and highlight the importance of choosing a suitable algorithm.

TI  - Investigating the Effect of Cross-Modeling in Landslide Susceptibility Mapping
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application Landslide Susceptibility Mapping using landslide inventory generated for the surrounding area can be generally carried out. However, the low reliability of such susceptibility map was observed in areas of critical geological structures. Thus, this should be borne in mind, when performing such a modeling in complex geological regions. To mitigate the negative effects of landslide occurrence, there is a need for effective landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM). The fundamental source for LSM is landslide inventory. Unfortunately, there are still areas where landslide inventories are not generated due to financial or reachability constraints. Considering this led to the following research question: can we model landslide susceptibility in an area for which landslide inventory is not available but where such is available for surrounding areas? To answer this question, we performed cross-modeling by using various strategies for landslide susceptibility. Namely, landslide susceptibility was cross-modeled by using two adjacent regions ("Lososina" and "Grodek") separated by the Ro(z) over dotnow Lake and Dunajec River. Thus, 46% and 54% of the total detected landslides were used for the LSM in "Lososina" and "Grodek" model, respectively. Various topographical, geological, hydrological and environmental landslide-conditioning factors (LCFs) were created. These LCFs were generated on the basis of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Sentinel-2A data, a digitized geological and soil suitability map, precipitation, the road network and the Ro(z) over dotnow lake shapefile. For LSM, we applied the Frequency Ratio (FR) and Landslide Susceptibility Index (LSI) methods. Five zones showing various landslide susceptibilities were generated via Natural Jenks. The Seed Cell Area Index (SCAI) and Relative Landslide Density Index were used for model validation. Even when the SCAI indicated extremely high values for "very low" susceptibility classes and very small values for "very high" susceptibility classes in the training and validation areas, the accuracy of the LSM in the validation areas was significantly lower. In the "Lososina" model, 90% and 57% of the landslides fell into the "high" and "very high" susceptibility zones in the training and validation areas, respectively. In the "Grodek" model, 86% and 46% of the landslides fell into the "high" and "very high" susceptibility zones in the training and validation areas, respectively. Moreover, the comparison between these two models was performed. Discrepancies between these two models exist in the areas of critical geological structures (thrust and fault proximity), and the reliability for such susceptibility zones can be low (2-3 susceptibility zone difference). However, such areas cover only 11% of the analyzed area; thus, we can conclude that in remaining regions (89%), LSM generated by the inventory for the surrounding area can be useful. Therefore, the low reliability of such a map in areas of critical geological structures should be borne in mind.

TI  - Abandonment and Recultivation of Agricultural Lands in Slovakia-Patterns and Determinants from the Past to the Future
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Central and Eastern Europe has experienced fundamental land use changes since the collapse of socialism around 1990. We analyzeanalyzed the patterns and determinants of agricultural land abandonment and recultivation in Slovakia during the transition from a state-controlled economy to an open-market economy (1986 to 2000) and the subsequent accession to the European Union (2000 to 2010). We quantified agricultural land-use change based on available maps derived from 30-m multi-seasonal Landsat imagery and analyzeanalyzed the socioeconomic and biophysical determinants of the observed agricultural land-use changes using boosted regression trees. We used a scenario-based approach to assess future agricultural land abandonment and recultivation until 2060. The maps of agricultural land use analysis reveal that cropland abandonment was the dominant land use process on 11% of agricultural land from 1986 to 2000, and on 6% of the agricultural land from 2000 to 2010. Recultivation occurred on approximately 2% of agricultural land in both periods. Although most abandoned land was located in the plains, the rate of abandonment was twice as high in the mountainous landscapes. The likelihood of abandonment increased with increased distance from the national capital (Bratislava), decreased with an increase of annual mean temperatures and was higher in proximity to forest edges and on steeper slopes. Recultivation was largely determined by the opposite effects. The scenario for 2060 suggests that future agricultural land abandonment and recultivation may largely be determined by climate and terrain conditions and, to a lesser extent, by proximity to economic centers. Our study underscores the value of synergetic use of satellite data and land-use modeling to provide the input for land planning, and to anticipate the potential effects of changing environmental and policy conditions.

TI  - Risk Assessment for Use of a Porcine Circovirus-Contaminated Reagent in a Barrier Maintained Rodent Colony
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A proposal for the use of porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) to develop a mouse model of pulmonary emphysema raised concerns about introducing contaminating porcine viruses into our barrier facility. Porcine Circovirus (PCV) is a known contaminant of vaccines and cell cultures that have been exposed to porcine-derived reagents. Endemic infection of PCV3 in laboratory mice has been reported, and some evidence supports natural PCV infection in wild mice. PPE samples from 2 different vendors tested positive for DNA from both PCV2 and 3. To allow model development with these reagents to proceed, we developed a protocol that would meet scientific objectives, minimize exposure of mice, and provide information on the potential for the virus to spread. Five d after BALB/c mice received intralaryngeal administration of PPE, lungs were harvested and analyzed for evidence of disease. Tissues from other major organs were submitted to test for disseminated PCV2 and 3 DNA. Similarly, tissues (including lungs) from direct contact nude sentinel mice were analyzed for the presence of the virus. To evaluate the possibility of endemic PCV2/3 infection, we also surveyed non-porcine reagent exposed mice on other studies. PCV2 and 3 was not detected in any of the tissues submitted. Although this study provided no evidence of infection and transmission of PCV2/3 from the contaminated PPE sample over the 5 d study, further work is needed to understand the risks and impact of introducing PCV contaminated cells or reagents into barrier maintained rodent colonies.

TI  - Applying transfer function-noise modelling to characterize soil moisture dynamics: a data-driven approach using remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of remotely sensed soil moisture data offers new opportunities for data-driven modelling approaches as alternatives for process-based modelling. This study presents the applicability of transfer function-noise (TFN) modelling for predicting unsaturated zone conditions. The TFN models are calibrated using SMAP L3 Enhanced surface soil moisture data. We found that soil moisture conditions are accurately represented by TFN models when exponential functions are used to define impulse-response functions. A sensitivity analysis showed the importance of using a calibrated period which is representative of the hydrological conditions for which the TFN model will be applied. The IR function parameters provide valuable information on water system characteristics, such as the total response and the response times of soil moisture to precipitation and evapotranspiration. Finally, we encourage exploring the possibilities of TFN soil moisture modelling, as predicting soil moisture conditions is promising for operational settings.

TI  - Mapping croplands of Europe, Middle East, Russia, and Central Asia using Landsat, Random Forest, and Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely information on croplands is important for environmental, food security, and policy studies. Spatially explicit cropland datasets are also required to derive information on crop type, crop yield, cropping intensity, as well as irrigated areas. Large area - defined as continental to global - cropland mapping is challenging due to differential manifestation of croplands, wide range of cultivation practices and limited reference data availability. This study presents the results of a cropland extent mapping of 64 countries covering large parts of Europe, Middle East, Russia and Central Asia. To cover such a vast area, roughly 160,000 Landsat scenes from 3351 footprints between 2014 and 2016 were processed within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We used a pixel-based Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm with a set of satellite data inputs capturing diverse spectral, temporal and topographical characteristics across twelve agroecological zones (AEZs). The reference data to train the classification model were collected from very high spatial resolution imagery (VHRI) and ancillary datasets. The result is a binary map showing cultivated/non-cultivated areas ca. 2015. The map produced an overall accuracy of 93.8% with roughly 14% omission and commission errors for the cropland class based on a large set of independent validation samples. The map suggests the entire study area has a total 546 million hectares (Mha) of net croplands (nearly 30% of global net cropland areas) occupying 18% of the study land area. Comparison between national cropland area estimates from United Nations Food and Agricultural Organizations (FAO) and those derived from this work also showed an R-square value of 0.95. This Landsat-derived 30-m cropland product (GFSAD30) provided 10-30% greater cropland areas compared to UN FAO in the 64 Countries. Finally, the map-to-map comparison between GFSAD30 with several other cropland products revealed that the best similarity matrix was with the 30 m global land cover (GLC30) product providing an overall similarity of 88.8% (Kappa 0.7) with producer's cropland similarity of 89.2% (errors of omissions = 10.8%) and user's cropland similarity of 81.8% (errors of commissions = 8.1%). GFSAD30 captured the missing croplands in GLC30 product around significantly irrigated agricultural areas in Germany and Belgium and rainfed agriculture in Italy. This study also established that the real strengths of GFSAD30 product, compared to other products, were: 1. identifying precise location of croplands, and 2. capturing fragmented croplands. The cropland extent map dataset is available through NASA's Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) at tps://doi.org,10.5067/MEaSUREs/GFSAD/GFSAD30EUMARUMECE.001, while the training and reference data as well as visualization are available at the Global Croplands <https://croplands.org > website, GEE code is accessible at: https://code.earthengine.google.com/1666e8bed34e0ce2b2aaf1235ad8c6bd.

M3  - Article
AB  - Facing the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in France, Sante Publique France has set up an evolutionary surveillance system based on definitions of possible, probable and confirmed cases. But only cases confirmed by SARS-CoV-2, RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) or serology, hospitalized cases and in-hospital deaths have been recorded on a daily basis. COVID-19 actual incidence has thus been estimated through additional indicators such as specific calls to emergency services (Samu) and SOS doctors, emergency rooms visits, or consultations in a sentinel network of general practitioners. Surveillance of non-hospital mortality has been impaired by delays and diagnostic inaccuracies of death certificates. Only in-hospital lethality could be reliably monitored. With a few essential statistical precautions and working hypotheses, models made it possible to anticipate the evolution of the epidemic based on two essential indicators: the reproduction ratio R, and the epidemic doubling time. In Ile-de-France region, the Greater Paris University Hospitals Group has used its data warehouse to complete this epidemic dashboard, including a fine modeling of patients' care pathways. All these indicators have proved essential to plan the response to this unprecedented crisis.

T2  - LINHA D AGUA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes the record of an episode of the Repente Brazilian oral poetry known as 'peleja historico' (historical battle), which took place in the city of Patos, Paraiba, in 1874, between the singers lncicio do Catingueira and Romano Caluete. Based on some concepts by Mikhail Bakhtin and Valentin Volochinov, the analysis seeks to understand how the dominant values contribute to constitute, in the poetic discourse, a counterpoint to the carnivalesque worldview strongly present in a genre known as repente, characteristic of the popular culture. Moreover, the observation sought to investigate how a certain social orientation can reaffirm a racist discourse as a source of axiological conflict in the analyzed work. Discursive elements were found in the research, which demonstrate the value of the poetry found in the repente as a literary genre and the clash between conflicting social values marked in the popular culture of northeastern Brazil, during the period of production regarding the analyzed work

TI  - Continuous Time and Instantaneous Speed in the Works of William Heytesbury and Richard Swineshead
T2  - EARLY SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The term 'instantaneous speed' that appears explicitly in the works of famous Oxford fourteenth-century natural philosophers, William Heytesbury and Richard Swineshead (nicknamed The Calculator), seems odd in the context of the then accepted Aristotelian worldview for at least two reasons. First, Aristotle himself stated unambiguously that no motion can occur in an instant. Second, after fourteenth-century atomism was rejected, the majority of thinkers denied the existence of instants, understood as indivisibles. Nevertheless, both Oxford philosophers describe instantaneous speed, also in the context of the mean-speed theorem, in a way that allowed them to preserve the continuity of time. This description may seem similar to the one formulated by Newtonians in the seventeenth century, but is so only superficially, however, as their backgrounds and contexts were different.

TI  - Implementation of an ice crystal single-scattering property database in the radiative transfer model SCIATRAN
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice crystal single-scattering properties (single-scattering albedo, extinction cross section, scattering matrix) determine the radiative transfer through ice clouds and snow layers. In the radiative transfer model SCIATRAN, only a limited range of particle sizes and shapes were available. Consequentially, and to achieve a much more realistic representation, a new database of nine ice crystals (droxtals, solid and hollow columns, aggregates of eight hexagonal solid columns, hexagonal plates, aggregates of five or 10 hexagonal plates, and solid and hollow bullet rosettes) with maximum dimensions from 2 to 10000 mu m has been implemented and tested. SCIATRAN now includes the relevant single-scattering albedo, extinction cross section, and scattering matrix. Additionally, the scattering matrix is expanded in generalized spherical functions based on a combination of trapezoidal and Gaussian quadrature. This implemented database in conjunction with a built in user-defined particle size distribution and an arbitrary habit ratio enable the radiative transfer through a variety of layers, composed of polydisperse ice particles having particular habit mixtures. A comparison of satellite measured snow surface reflectances with respective simulations demonstrates that assuming ice crystal habit mixtures rather than single-habits as snow crystals reduces significantly the differences between the model and satellite data from 8.5 % to 2 %.

T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The threat of the increasing global temperature is now of global concern than ever before. This prompted the authors to gain insights on the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon in a medium-sized city of Akure, Nigeria. A random sampling of three hundred and twenty-five (325) structured questionnaires was administered and analyzed with the aid of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Landsat satellite imagery for the years 2000; 2007; 2013 and 2018 were acquired and used for the computation of land use-land cover (LULC) and the Land Surface Temperature (LST) of the study area using ArcGIS 10.5. Between the years 2000 and 2018, built-up area increased by 8.78% at the expense of the non-built up land use. The residents were aware of UHI and climate change but characterized by superficiality. The study recommends a community awareness program on the menace of climate change and the integration of climate education into the curriculum of schools and other institutions of higher learning.

Understanding and assessing how forests react to these changes is key for forest managers to develop and follow sustainable practices. A strategy to remotely monitor the development of the canopy after thinning using satellite imagery time-series data is presented. The aim was to identify optimal remote sensing Vegetation Indices (VIs) to use as time-sensitive indicators of the early response of vegetation after the thinning of sweet chestnut (Castanea SativaMill.) coppice. For this, the changes produced at the canopy level by different thinning treatments and their evolution over time (2014-2019) were extracted from VI values corresponding to two trials involving 33 circular plots (r = 10 m). Plots were subjected to one of the following forest management treatments: Control with no intervention (2800-3300 stems ha(-1)), Treatment 1, one thinning leaving a living stock density of 900-600 stems ha(-1)and Treatment 2, a more intensive thinning, leaving 400 stems ha(-1). Time series data from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 were collected to calculate values for different VIs. Canopy development was computed by comparing the area under curves (AUCs) of different VI time-series annually throughout the study period. Soil-Line VIs were compared to the Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) revealing that the Second Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (MCARI2) more clearly demonstrated canopy evolution tendencies over time than theNDVI.MCARI2data from both L8 and S2 reflected how the influence of treatment on the canopy cover decreases over the years, providing significant differences in the thinning year and the year after. Metrics derived from theMCARI2time-series also demonstrated the capacity of the canopy to recovery to pretreatment coverage levels. TheAUCmethod generates a specific V-shaped time-signature, the vertex of which coincides with the thinning event and, as such, provides forest managers with another tool to assist decision making in the development of sustainable forest management strategies.

TI  - Flood-inundation modeling in an operational context: sensitivity to topographic resolution and Manning's<i>n</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Streamflow forecasts from operational hydrologic models can be converted into forecasts of flood-inundation extent using either physically based hydraulic models or simpler terrain-based approaches. Two factors that influence simulated flood-inundation extent are spatial resolution of topographic data and in-channel and overland-flow roughness characterized by the Manning'snparameter. Here, AutoRoute, a raster-based flood-inundation model, was used to simulate two recent flood events in Florida (a forested floodplain) and Texas (an urban floodplain) using two different topographic resolutions and a range of Manning'snvalues. The AutoRoute-simulated flood-inundation extents were evaluated using observed extents from remotely sensed imagery. For comparison, the same flood events were also simulated using a one-dimensional Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model. Results indicated that model performance was much improved with higher topographic resolution for the forested floodplain site and that the urban site was more sensitive to Manning'sn. For the three different rivers analyzed, the fit for HEC-RAS was 5-10% higher than that for AutoRoute. Despite being only slightly less accurate than HEC-RAS in its simulation of flood extent, AutoRoute was much simpler to set up and required less computational time to run.

TI  - Yukaghir language vocabulary associated with the word <i>Qojl</i> "<i>God</i>": semantics and formation
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the theme under consideration is determined by the need to study the traditional worldview of the people, the formation and development of their spiritual knowledge. The paper analyzes the semantic content and the formation of the vocabulary of the Yukaghir language, originating from the word Qojl (qojl), identifies the original semantics of this word, examines the evolution of the religious beliefs of the Yukaghir. The word Qojl (qojl) is associated originally with shamanistic beliefs and was representing the image of the shaman-patron of the family in the traditional culture of the Yukaghir. Later, it came to be referred to the name of the Christian God and to designate icons and saints.In the modern Yukaghir language, the word concerned is used only in the meanings of "God," "divinity," "icon," "saint." The prevalence of Qojl (qojl)-derived words in the languages of two local Yukaghir groups, the similarity of the structure and meanings of many of the lexemes indicate the archaicity of the word and the presence of a semantic relationship between the original and late sememes. An assumption has been made that the etymology of the ancient root of the word is associated with the concepts of "supernatural," "sacred," "divine," "supreme," "powerful." The fact that the word originally comprised the concept of the supernatural and divine determined the expansion of the semantics of the word. Under the influence of Christianity, new words derived from Qojl (qojl), with the semantic content "referring to God," appear in the Yukaghir language.

TI  - Human Blood Feeding by <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) in the Florida Keys and a Review of the Literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Aedes aegypti L. is considered to have a proclivity for feeding on human blood even when other hosts are available. However, few studies have demonstrated host use by this mosquito in the continental United States, where local transmission of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses has been recently documented.This study investigated the bloodmeal sources of female Ae. aegypti in the subtropical city of Key West and the surrounding county in Florida with the goal of identifying preferred hosts. Blood-engorged Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were collected from BG Sentinel traps used as part of a routine surveillance program in the Florida Keys (Monroe County, Florida). Bloodmeal samples were analyzed using PCR assays, sequencing, and comparison with reference sequences in GenBank. Aedes aegypti females from Key West fed predominantly on humans (79.6%) and did not differ statistically from females collected from the rest of the Florida Keys (69.5%). Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae), considered a host generalist, was collected and analyzed from the same sites for comparative purposes. Females of Cx. quinquefasciatus fed predominantly (70.7%) on birds and nonhuman mammals in the Florida Keys, corroborating the validity of molecular assay breadth and demonstrating that given the same group of available hosts Ae. aegypti selects humans. Our results indicated that Ae. aegypti has a high rate of human-biting in a subtropical area within the United States, supporting its role in recent local transmission of dengue and other viruses.

TI  - Investigating the Correlation of Tectonic and Morphometric Characteristics with the Hydrological Response in a Greek River Catchment Using Earth Observation and Geospatial Analysis Techniques
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Morphometric analysis can be used to investigate catchment dynamics and tectonic processes responsible for the development of drainage catchments and to support flood risk assessment. In this study, a comparative GIS-based morphometric analysis between the main southern and northern sub-catchments of the Sperchios River basin, Central Greece, was performed, using geospatial and remote sensing data. The goal was to investigate their correlation with the peculiar geotectonic activity and the frequent flash-flood events that occur in the river floodplain. All sub-catchments characteristics are linked with the geological formation types of the area, in combination with ongoing tectonic activity. The results indicate that drainage network development is significantly controlled by the region's overall tectonic activity. The morphometric characteristics-i.e., bifurcation ratio, drainage density, circularity ratio, elongation ratio and water concentration-time values, reflect the flood-prone character of the southern part of Sperchios River catchment in comparison to the northern part, especially during intense rainfall events. The study can provide valuable insight into identifying how morphometric characteristics are associated with increased flood hazard.

TI  - A Method to Automatically Detect Changes in Multitemporal Spectral Indices: Application to Natural Disaster Damage Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new method, based on clustering and thresholding, to automatically perform binary change detection in multitemporal spectral indices. The method is denoted as Buffer-From-Cluster Approach (BFCA). To estimate the distributions of changed and unchanged pixels, as needed for the purpose of a reliable thresholding of a spectral index, a clustering algorithm is preliminarily applied to identify image objects possibly corresponding to areas where significant changes occurred. Then, a buffer zone is created around the selected cluster to identify unchanged areas surrounding changed ones. The cluster and the buffer zone are jointly analyzed to estimate the distributions of changed and unchanged pixels and to verify that they can be distinguished from each other. Finally, the results of thresholding and clustering are combined to generate the binary change map. The BFCA has been conceived to map the extent of the areas affected by a natural disaster like wildfire. To validate the proposed method, burned area maps produced by applying the BFCA to spectral indices derived from Sentinel-2 data have been compared to maps produced by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. For testing the multi-hazard detection capability, the same kind of exercise has been carried out for a flooding test case too. The positive results of the comparison have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Multiband (X, C, L) radar amplitude analysis for a mixed sand- and gravel-bed river in the eastern Central Andes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) amplitude measurements from spaceborne sensors are sensitive to surface roughness conditions near their radar wavelength. These backscatter signals are often exploited to assess the roughness of plowed agricultural fields and water surfaces, and less so to complex, heterogeneous geological surfaces. The bedload of mixed sand- and gravel-bed rivers can be considered a mixture of smooth (compacted sand) and rough (gravel) surfaces. Here, we assess backscatter gradients over a large high-mountain alluvial river in the eastern Central Andes with aerially exposed sand and gravel bedload using X-band TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X, C-band Sentinel-1, and L-band ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 radar scenes. In a first step, we present theory and hypotheses regarding radar response to an alluvial channel bed. We test our hypotheses by comparing backscatter responses over vegetation-free endmember surfaces from inside and outside of the active channel-bed area. We then develop methods to extract smoothed backscatter gradients downstream along the channel using kernel density estimates. In a final step, the local variability of sand-dominated patches is analyzed using Fourier frequency analysis, by fitting stretched-exponential and power-law regression models to the 2-D power spectrum of backscatter amplitude. We find a large range in backscatter depending on the heterogeneity of contiguous smooth- and rough-patches of bedload material. The SAR amplitude signal responds primarily to the fraction of smooth-sand bedload, but is further modified by gravel elements. The sensitivity to gravel is more apparent in longer wavelength L-band radar, whereas C- and X-band is sensitive only to sand variability. Because the spatial extent of smooth sand patches in our study area is typically< 50 m, only higher resolution sensors (e.g., TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X) are useful for power spectrum analysis. Our results show the potential for mapping sand-gravel transitions and local geomorphic complexity in alluvial rivers with aerially exposed bedload using SAR amplitude.

TI  - Diagnostic Accuracy of Fine-Needle Aspiration Cytology and Core-Needle Biopsy in the Assessment of the Axillary Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer-A Meta-Analysis
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The present study aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy between ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (US-FNAC) and core needle biopsy (CNB) of axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) in patients with breast cancer through a meta-analysis and a diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) review. Methods: The present meta-analysis and DTA review included 67 eligible studies. The diagnostic accuracy of various preoperative assessments, including US-FNAC and CNB, was evaluated for ALNs assessments in patients with breast cancer. In addition, a subgroup analysis based on methods of cytologic preparation was performed. In the DTA review, the sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (OR) and area under the curve (AUC) on the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve were calculated. Results: The diagnostic accuracy of the preoperative assessments of ALNs was 0.850 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.833-0.866) for patients with breast cancer. The diagnostic accuracy of CNB was significantly higher than that of US-FNAC (0.896, 95% CI 0.844-0.932 vs. 0.844, 95% CI 0.825-0.862; p = 0.044 in a meta-regression test). In the subgroup analysis based on cytologic preparation, the diagnosis accuracies were 0.860, 0.861 and 0.859 for the methods of conventional smear, liquid-based preparation and cell block, respectively. In the DTA review, CNB showed higher sensitivity than US-FNAC (0.849 vs. 0.760). However, there was no difference in specificity between US-FNAC and CNB (0.997 vs. 1.000). US-FNAC with liquid-based preparation and CNB showed the highest diagnostic OR and AUC on the SROC, respectively. Conclusion: Both US-FNAC and CNB are useful in preoperative assessments of ALNs in patients with breast cancer. Although the most sensitive test was found to be CNB in this study, there was no difference in specificity between various preoperative evaluations and the application of US-FNAC or CNB may be impacted by various factors.

TI  - A Model-Based Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Changes of the Urban Expansion in Arid Area of Western China: A Case Study in North Xinjiang Economic Zone
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigation of urban expansion can provide a better understanding of the urbanization process and its driving forces, which is critical for environmental management and land use planning. Total of 514 sampling points from the aerial photos and field sampling were applied to assess the image accuracy. A Conversion of Land Use and its Effect at Small Region Extent (CLUE-S) model was established to simulate the urbanization process at the township level in the North Xinjiang Economic Zone (NXEZ) of western China. Historical land use and land cover changes with multi-temporal remote sensing data were retrieved, and the underlying driving forces were explored by training the CLUE-S model. Moreover, future changes in urban development were simulated under different scenarios. Results showed that the overall accuracy reaches larger than 80% for the years of 2002, 2005, and 2007, and the corresponding kappa coefficient is bigger than 0.8. The NXEZ is at a premature development stage compared with urban clusters in eastern China. Before 1999, the driving force in this region was primary industry development. In recent years, secondary industries started to show significance in urbanization. These findings indicate that the industrial base and economic development in the NXEZ are still relatively weak and have not taken a strong leading role. When industry and population become the main driving factors, the regional economy will enter a new stage of leap-forward development, which in turn will stimulate a new round of rapid urbanization.

TI  - TCDNet: Trilateral Change Detection Network for Google Earth Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection is a very important technique for remote sensing data analysis. Its mainstream solutions are either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised methods, most of the existing change detection methods using deep learning are related to semantic segmentation. However, these methods only use deep learning models to process the global information of an image but do not carry out specific trainings on changed and unchanged areas. As a result, many details of local changes could not be detected. In this work, a trilateral change detection network is proposed. The proposed network has three branches (a main module and two auxiliary modules, all of them are composed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs)), which focus on the overall information of bitemporal Google Earth image pairs, the changed areas and the unchanged areas, respectively. The proposed method is end-to-end trainable, and each component in the network does not need to be trained separately.

TI  - Cirrus clouds that adversely affect Landsat 8 images: What are they and how to detect them?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed an algorithm called Cmask (Cirrus cloud mask) for cirrus cloud detection in Landsat 8 imagery using time series of Cirrus Band (1.36-1.39 mu m) observations. For each pixel, a harmonic model, which includes a water vapor regressor, based on all available Cirrus Band observations is estimated using the Robust Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (RIRLS) regression approach, and pixels affected by cirrus cloud are identified by comparing model predictions and actual satellite observations of the Cirrus Band Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of increasing Cirrus Band TOA reflectance on the surface reflectance of the Blue, Green, Red, Near Infrared (NIR), and two Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) (SWIR 1 and SWIR 2) Bands based on a set of globally distributed random samples. The goal of this study is to answer the question of what are cirrus clouds in the context of a Landsat observation, or more specifically, when should we identify a pixel as cirrus cloud such that we know the reflectance in the other spectral bands has been seriously affected by cirrus clouds. The challenge is to then develop a simple and operational algorithm for accurate detection of cirrus clouds in Landsat 8 images. The Cmask algorithm reduced almost by half the errors found in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Quality Assessment (QA) Band for distinguishing cirrus cloud and clear observations (8% versus 15% error).

TI  - A Remotely Sensed Assessment of Surface Ecological Change over the Gomishan Wetland, Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the excessive use of natural resources in the contemporary world, the importance of ecological and environmental condition modeling has increased. Wetlands and cities represent the natural and artificial strategic areas that affect ecosystem conditions. Changes in the ecological conditions of these areas have a great impact on the conditions of the global ecosystem. Therefore, modeling spatiotemporal variations of the ecological conditions in these areas is critical. This study was aimed at comparing degrees of variation among surface ecological conditions due to natural and unnatural factors. Consequently, the surface ecological conditions of Gomishan city and Gomishan wetland in Iran were modeled for a period of 30 years, and the spatiotemporal variations were evaluated and compared with each other. To this end, 20 Landsat 5, 7, and 8, and 432 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), monthly land surface temperature (LST) (MOD11C3) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (MOD13C3) products were utilized. The surface ecological conditions were modeled according to the Remote Sensing-based Ecological Index (RSEI), and the spatiotemporal variation of the RSEI values in the study area (Gomishan city, Gomishan wetland) were evaluated and compared with each other. According to MODIS products, the mean of the LST and NDVI variance values for the study area (Gomishan city, Gomishan wetland) were obtained to be 6.5 degrees C (2.1, 12.1) and 0.009 (0.005, 0.013), respectively. The highest LST and NDVI temporal variations were found for Gomishan wetland near the Caspian Sea. According to Landsat images, Gomishan wetland and Gomishan city have the highest and lowest temporal variations in surface biophysical characteristics, respectively. The mean RSEI for the study area (Gomishan city, Gomishan wetland) was 0.43 (0.65, 0.29), respectively. Additionally, the mean Coefficient of Variation (CV) of RSEI for the study area (Gomishan city, Gomishan wetland) was 0.10 (0.88, 0.51), respectively. The surface ecological conditions of Gomishan city were worse than those of the Gomishan wetland at all dates. Temporal variations in the surface ecological conditions of Gomishan wetland were greater than those of the study area and Gomishan city. These results can provide useful and effective information for environmental planning and decision-making to improve ecological conditions, protect the environment, and support sustainable ecosystem development.

TI  - Evaluating the Effects of Digital Elevation Models in Landslide Susceptibility Mapping in Rangamati District, Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEMs) are the most obvious data sources in landslide susceptibility assessment. Many landslide casual factors are often generated from DEMs. Most studies on landslide susceptibility assessments rely on freely available DEMs. However, very little is known about the performance of different DEMs with varying spatial resolutions on the accurate assessment of landslide susceptibility. This study compared the performance of four different DEMs including 30 m Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM), 30-90 m Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), 12.5 m Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array Type L band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), and 25 m Survey of Bangladesh (SOB) DEM in landslide susceptibility assessment in the Rangamati district in Bangladesh. This study used three different landslide susceptibility assessment techniques: modified frequency ratio (bivariate model), logistic regression (multivariate model), and random forest (machine-learning model). This study explored two scenarios of landslide susceptibility assessment: using only DEM-derived causal factors and using both DEM-derived factors as well as other common factors. The success and prediction rate curves indicate that the SRTM DEM provides the highest accuracies for the bivariate model in both scenarios. Results also reveal that the ALOS PALSAR DEM shows the best performance in landslide susceptibility mapping using the logistics regression and the random forest models. A relatively finer resolution DEM, the SOB DEM, shows the lowest accuracies compared to other DEMs for all models and scenarios. It can also be noted that the performance of all DEMs except the SOB DEM is close (72%-84%) considering the success and prediction accuracies. Therefore, anyone of the three global DEMs: ASTER, SRTM, and ALOS PALSAR can be used for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area.

AB  - Airborne and spaceborne remote sensing in archaeology generates at least two important issues for discussion: technology and visualization. Technology seems to open new cognitive perspectives for archaeology and keeps researchers increasingly fascinated in its capabilities (archaeological science being a case in point). Acquired data, especially via remote sensing methods, can be studied after processing and visualizing. The paper raises several issues related to the new cognitive situation of archaeologists facing the development of new technologies within remote sensing methods. These issues are discussed from ontological, epistemological, and discursive perspectives, supporting an exploration of the role of technology and visualization. The ontological perspective places the visualization of remote sensing data in the context of understanding Virtual Reality and Jean Baudrillard's simulacra. The epistemological perspective generates questions related to visualization as mimesis, the issue of cultural neutrality, and the use of sophisticated classifications and analytical techniques. The level of discursiveness of visualization includes categories such as persuasion, standardization, and aesthetics. This discussion is framed in relation to Martin Heidegger's understanding of technology and a dichotomy of naturalism versus antinaturalism.

TI  - Impact of urbanisation on formation of urban heat island in Tirupur region using geospatial technique
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the recent times, considerable urbanisation has taken place in few places around the world. This urbanisation has occurred due to rapid development in various industries. Furthermore, urbanisation has lead to an increase in movement of the people from rural to urban centres in search of employment. As people kept moving from urban to rural areas there has been a constant demand for the extension of built-up area. As a result of which, the land which was once covered by green vegetation having permeable and low emissivity is now replaced by built-up area with impermeable land and high emissivity. In addition to this, the surface of these built up areas absorbs solar radiation during the day time and emit radiation during the night time and causes increase in surface temperature. The rate of temperature is higher in urban built up area when compared to the rural counterpart making Urban Heat Island (UHI). In this study, an attempt is made to investigate the impact of urbanisation and formation of UHI in the Tirupur region around the corporation limit. The land use land cover (LULC) pattern mapping was carried out through maximum likelihood supervised classification technique for the years 1991, 2001, 2009, 2011 and 2018. Along with this study, Land Surface Temperature (LST) was estimated using Landsat satellite data of the years 2001 and 2018. Furthermore, the impact on LST shows that the urban area has relatively higher LST when compared to the surrounding rural area. Thus it is found that UHI has formed in the region.

TI  - Land Cover Influences on LST in Two Proposed Smart Cities of India: Comparative Analysis Using Spectral Indices
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Elucidating the impact of Land Surface Temperature (LST) is an important aspect of urban studies. The impact of urbanization on LST has been widely studied to monitor the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. However, the sensitivity of various urban factors such as urban green spaces (UGS), built-up area, and water bodies to LST is not sufficiently resolved for many urban settlements. By using remote sensing techniques, this study aimed to quantify the influence of urban factors on LST in the two traditional cities (i) Panaji and (ii) Tumkur of India, proposed to be developed as smart cities. Landsat data were used to extract thematic and statistical information about urban factors using the Enhanced Built-up and Bareness Index (EBBI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). The multivariate regression model revealed that the value of adjusted R(2)was 0.716 with a standard error of 1.97 for Tumkur city, while it was 0.698 with a standard error of 1.407 for Panaji city. The non-parametric correlation test brought out a strong negative correlation between MNDWI and LST with a value of 0.83 for Panaji, and between SAVI and LST with a value of 0.77 for Tumkur. The maximum percentage share of cooling surfaces are water bodies in Panaji with 35% coverage and green spaces in Tumkur with 25% coverage. Apparently, the UGS and water bodies can help in bringing down the LST, as well as facilitating healthy living conditions and aesthetic appeal. Therefore, the significance of ecosystem services (green spaces and water bodies) should be given priority in the decision-making process of sustainable and vibrant city development.

M3  - Article
AB  - Investigations were performed on a group utilizing (General Purpose Unit) GPU and executions were evaluated for the utilization of the created parallel usages to process satellite pictures from satellite Landsat7. The usage on a realistic group gives execution change from 2 to 18 times. The nature of the considered techniques was assessed by relative dimensionless global error in synthesis (ERGAS) and Quality Without Reference (QNR) measurements. The outcomes demonstrate execution picks ups and holding of value with the bunch of GPU contrasted with the outcomes and different analysts for a CPU and single GPU. The errand of upgrading the view of a scene by combining data caught from various picture sensors is usually known as multisensor picture combination. This paper displays a territory based picture combination calculation to consolidate SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical pictures. The co-enlistment of the two images is first led utilizing the proposed enrollment method prior to picture combination. The paper displays a parallel execution of existing picture combination techniques on a graphical group. Parallel executions of techniques in view of discrete wavelet changes are created. Division into dynamic and motionless regions is then executed on the SAR surface picture for particular injection of the SAR picture into panchromatic (PAN) picture. An integrated image in view of these two pictures is produced by the novel region based combination plot, which forces diverse combination rules for each fragmented region. At long last, this picture is melded into a multispectral(MS) picture through the half breed skillet honing technique proposed in past research. Exploratory outcomes exhibit that the proposed strategy demonstrates preferred execution over different fusion algorithms and can possibly be connected to the multisensory combination of SAR and optical pictures.

TI  - Using a Panchromatic Image to Improve Hyperspectral Unmixing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral unmixing is a widely studied field of research aiming at estimating the pure material signatures and their abundance fractions from hyperspectral images. Most spectral unmixing methods are based on prior knowledge and assumptions that induce limitations, such as the existence of at least one pure pixel for each material. This work presents a new approach aiming to overcome some of these limitations by introducing a co-registered panchromatic image in the unmixing process. Our method, called Heterogeneity-Based Endmember Extraction coupled with Local Constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization (HBEE-LCNMF), has several steps: a first set of endmembers is estimated based on a heterogeneity criterion applied on the panchromatic image followed by a spectral clustering. Then, in order to complete this first endmember set, a local approach using a constrained non-negative matrix factorization strategy, is proposed. The performance of our method, in regards of several criteria, is compared to those of state-of-the-art methods obtained on synthetic and satellite data describing urban and periurban scenes, and considering the French HYPXIM/HYPEX2 mission characteristics. The synthetic images are built with real spectral reflectances and do not contain a pure pixel for each endmember. The satellite images are simulated from airborne acquisition with the spatial and spectral features of the mission. Our method demonstrates the benefit of a panchromatic image to reduce some well-known limitations in unmixing hyperspectral data. On synthetic data, our method reduces the spectral angle between the endmembers and the real material spectra by 46% compared to the Vertex Component Analysis (VCA) and N-finder (N-FINDR) methods. On real data, HBEE-LCNMF and other methods yield equivalent performance, but, the proposed method shows more robustness over the data sets compared to the tested state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, HBEE-LCNMF does not require one to know the number of endmembers.

TI  - The Transitional Medical Model: An innovative methodology for a community's disease outbreak and pandemic preparedness and response plan.
T2  - American journal of disaster medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, and subsequent pandemics are not typical disasters in the sense that they often lack clearly delineated phases. As in any event that is biological in nature, its onset may be gradual with signs and symptoms that are so subtle that they go unrecognized, thus missing opportunities to invoke an early response and implement containment strategies. An infectious disease outbreak-whether caused by a novel virus, a particularly virulent influenza strain, or newly emerging or resistant bacteria with the capability of human-to-human transmission-can quickly degrade a community's healthcare infrastructure in advance of coordinated mitigation, preparation, and response activities. The Transitional Medical Model (TMM) was developed to aid communities with these crucial phases of disaster response as well as to assist with the initial steps within the recovery phase. The TMM is a methodology that provides a crosswalk between the routine operations and activities of a community's public health infrastructure with action steps associated with the mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery phases of an infectious disease outbreak.

TI  - The Dark Target Algorithm for Observing the Global Aerosol System: Past, Present, and Future
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The Dark Target aerosol algorithm was developed to exploit the information content available from the observations of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS), to better characterize the global aerosol system. The algorithm is based on measurements of the light scattered by aerosols toward a space-borne sensor against the backdrop of relatively dark Earth scenes, thus giving rise to the name "Dark Target". Development required nearly a decade of research that included application of MODIS airborne simulators to provide test beds for proto-algorithms and analysis of existing data to form realistic assumptions to constrain surface reflectance and aerosol optical properties. This research in itself played a significant role in expanding our understanding of aerosol properties, even before Terra MODIS launch. Contributing to that understanding were the observations and retrievals of the growing Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) of sun-sky radiometers, which has walked hand-in-hand with MODIS and the development of other aerosol algorithms, providing validation of the satellite-retrieved products after launch. The MODIS Dark Target products prompted advances in Earth science and applications across subdisciplines such as climate, transport of aerosols, air quality, and data assimilation systems. Then, as the Terra and Aqua MODIS sensors aged, the challenge was to monitor the effects of calibration drifts on the aerosol products and to differentiate physical trends in the aerosol system from artefacts introduced by instrument characterization. Our intention is to continue to adapt and apply the well-vetted Dark Target algorithms to new instruments, including both polar-orbiting and geosynchronous sensors. The goal is to produce an uninterrupted time series of an aerosol climate data record that begins at the dawn of the 21st century and continues indefinitely into the future.

TI  - Detection and Prediction of Water Body and Aquatic Plants Cover Changes of Choghakhor International Wetland, Using Landsat Imagery and the Cellular Automata-Markov Model
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantitative and qualitative study of wetland ecosystems is the main base for their sustainable use. In arid and semi-arid regions such as Iran, importance of wetlands is more obvious. Providing new information of changes in wetlands during several decades help us finding the reasons of alteration and making programs and policies. One of the most effective techniques in this field is remote sensing. Choghakhor international wetland, one of the most important wetlands in Iran. In this study, satellite images of MSS, TM, ETM +, and OLI were used during 1976-2017 to identify changes within the wetland. Also, the distribution of aquatic plants has been evaluated with NDVI index as an environmental indicator due to their key role on these aquatic ecosystems. After mapping the changes in wetland patterns over times, a cellular automata model (CA) was used to simulate changes up to the 2030s. The results of the time processing map data of the maps show the gradual decrease of the area (water body) of the wetland in the spring and more in the autumn season, which is more evident in recent years. However, the aquatic plants of the wetland in recent years has been. In general, three life periods for the Choghakhor wetland could be defined: "natural period", "developmental period" and "dehydration period". According to the CA model, the water body of the wetland shows a decreasing trend by 2030. On the other hand, aquatic plants growing in the wetland and its surroundings, which could be due to the high nutrient and organic load in future. Therefore, having an integrated strategy and program to improve the status of this unique ecosystem is necessary more than ever.

TI  - HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance surveillance: shifting trends in study design and prevalence estimates
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance (TDR) prevalence increased during the initial years of the antiretroviral therapy (ART) global scale-up. Few studies have examined recent trends in TDR prevalence using published genetic sequences and described the characteristics of ART-naive persons from whom these published sequences have been obtained. Methods We identified 125 studies published between 2014 and 2019 for which HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) with or without protease from >= 50 ART-naive adult persons were submitted to the GenBank sequence database. The population characteristics and TDR prevalence were compared to those in 122 studies published in the preceding five years between 2009 and 2013. TDR prevalence was analysed using median study-level and person-level data. Results and discussion The 2009 to 2013 and 2014 to 2019 studies reported sequence data from 32,866 and 41,724 ART-naive persons respectively. Studies from the low- and middle-income country (LMIC) regions in sub-Saharan Africa, South/Southeast Asia and Latin America/Caribbean accounted for approximately two-thirds of the studies during each period. Between the two periods, the proportion of studies from sub-Saharan Africa and from South/Southeast Asia countries other than China decreased from 43% to 32% and the proportion of studies performed at sentinel sites for recent HIV-1 infection decreased from 33% to 22%. Between 2014 and 2019, median study-level TDR prevalence was 4.1% in South/Southeast Asia, 6.0% in sub-Saharan Africa, 9.1% in Latin America/Caribbean, 8.5% in Europe and 14.2% in North America. In the person-level analysis, there was an increase in overall, NNRTI and two-class NRTI/NNRTI resistance in sub-Saharan Africa; an increase in NNRTI resistance in Latin America/Caribbean, and an increase in overall, NNRTI and PI resistance in North America. Conclusions Overall, NNRTI and dual NRTI/NNRTI-associated TDR prevalence was significantly higher in sub-Saharan Africa studies published between 2014 and 2019 compared with those published between 2009 and 2013. The decreasing proportion of studies from the hardest hit LMIC regions and the shift away from sentinel sites for recent infection suggests that global TDR surveillance efforts and publication of findings require renewed emphasis.

TI  - Grippenet: A New Tool for the Monitoring, Risk-Factor and Vaccination Coverage Analysis of Influenza-Like Illness in Switzerland
T2  - VACCINES
M3  - Article
AB  - Implemented in Switzerland in November 2016, Grippenet provides Internet-based participatory surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI). The aim of this research is to test the feasibility of such a system and its ability to detect risk factors and to assess ILI-related behaviors. Participants filled in a web-based socio-demographic and behavioral questionnaire upon registration, and a weekly symptoms survey during the influenza season. ILI incidence was calculated weekly, and risk factors associated to ILI were analyzed at the end of each season. From November 2016 to May 2019, 1247 participants were included. The crossing of the Sentinel System (Sentinella) epidemic threshold was associated with an increase or decrease of Grippenet ILI incidence, within the same week or earlier. The number of active users varied according to ILI incidence. Factors associated with ILI were: ages 0-4 compared with 5-14 (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19-0.99), 15-29 (AOR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15-0.60), and 65+ (AOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16-0.93); female sex (male AOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.7-0.95); respiratory allergies (AOR 1.58, 95% CI 1.38-1.96), not being vaccinated (AOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.9-3.04); and self-employment (AOR 1.97, 95% CI 1.33-3.03). Vaccination rates were higher than those of the general population but not high enough to meet the Swiss recommendations. Approximately, 36.2% to 42.5% of users who reported one or more ILIs did not seek medical attention. These results illustrate the potential of Grippenet in complementing Sentinella for ILI monitoring in Switzerland.

TI  - Tracking Red Palm Mite Damage in the Western Hemisphere Invasion with Landsat Remote Sensing Data
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The red palm mite is a destructive pest for palm trees, impacting their productivity. Detection of their presence is important for management and the prevention of spread. Remote sensing may provide an opportunity to monitor and detect red palm mite presence using readily available land surface remote sensing, such as the Landsat satellite constellation. A study was conducted to determine if Landsat products are able to detect infestations at select sites in the Caribbean, Central, and South America. After a time series analysis, we determined that there are several impediments to detecting red palm mite damage at palm plantations. Red palm mites (Raoiella indicaHirst, Acari: Tenuipalpidae) were first observed in the western hemisphere on the islands and countries surrounding the Caribbean Sea, infesting the coconut palm (Cocos nuciferaL.). Detection of invasive pests usually relies upon changes in vegetation properties as result of the pest activity. These changes may be visible in time series of satellite data records, such as Landsat satellites, which have been available with a 16-day repeat cycle at a spatial resolution of 30 m since 1982. Typical red palm mite infestations result in the yellowing of the lower leaves of the palm crown; remote sensing model simulations have indicated that this feature may be better detected using the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI). Using the Google Earth Engine programming environment, a time series of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data was generated for plantations in northern and northeast Brazil, El Salvador, and Trinidad-Tobago. Considering the available studied plantations, there were little or no differences of GNDVI before and after the dates when red palm mites were first revealed at each location. A discussion of possible alternative approaches are discussed related to the limitations of the current satellite platforms.

TI  - Observing Rivers With Varying Spatial Scales
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Centre national d'etudes spatiales Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will estimate global river discharge using remote sensing. Synoptic remote sensing data extend in situ point measurements but, at any given point, are generally less accurate. We address two questions:(1)What are the scales at which river dynamics can be observed, given spatial sampling and measurement noise characteristics? (2) Is there an equation whose variables are the averaged hydraulic quantities obtained by remote sensing and which describes the dynamics of spatially averaged rivers?We use calibrated hydraulic models to examine the power spectra of the different terms in the momentum equation and conclude that the measurement of river slope sets the scale at which rivers can be observed. We introduce thereach-averaged Saint Venant equationsthat involve only observable hydraulic variations and which parametrize within-reach variability with a variability index that multiplies the friction coefficient and leads to an increased "effective" friction coefficient. An exact expression is derived for the increase in the effective friction coefficient, and we propose an approximation that requires only estimates of the hydraulic parameter variances. We validate the results using a large set of hydraulic models and find that the approximated variability index is most faithful when the river parameters obey lognormal statistics. The effective friction coefficient, which can vary from a few percent to more than 50% of the point friction coefficient, is proportional to the riverbed elevation variance and inversely proportional to the depth. This has significant implications for estimating discharge from SWOT data.Plain Language Summary Information about the amount of fresh water in rivers is decreasing globally due to a loss of maintained gauges. Remote sensors, such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Centre national d'etudes spatiales Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, offer the possibility of extending the decaying gauge network by providing global open access data for rivers. However, the SWOT data are unlike the data that hydrologists know. Due to instrument noise, the river width, elevation, and slope will need to be averaged over distances as long as 10 km. Here, we show that these average parameters can be treated using the equations for point measurements, provided the equations replace the friction from the riverbed by a larger effective friction. This increase accounts for the river scales that are unobserved due to averaging. We relate the increase in effective friction to river width, area, and slope variability that may be available through statistical studies or data from complimentary sensors. We find that the effective friction is dependent on the depth of the river, increasing as the river discharge decreases. The predictions from this paper can be incorporated to improve river discharge retrievals from the SWOT mission that will improve our understanding of global river networks.

TI  - The Relationship Between the Follow-up to Discharge Ratio and Length of Stay
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Average length of stay (ALOS) is used as a measure of the effectiveness of care delivery and therefore is an important operational measure when evaluating both the hospitalist group and individual hospitalist performance. No metric within the control of the individual hospitalist has been identified to support the individual hospitalist's contribution to the hospitalist group's ALOS goals. This study's objective was to evaluate the correlation between the follow-up to discharge ratio (F:D ratio) and ALOS and assess the relationship between F:D ratio and hospitalist experience.STUDY DESIGN: We systematically evaluated the relationship between hospitalist-level billing data for daily inpatient follow-up encounters and discharge visits (F:D ratio) and the attributed ALOS across consecutive hospitalist encounters at a tertiary care center.RESULTS: Over the study period of 10 quarters from 2017 to 2019, there were 103,080 follow-up or discharge inpatient encounters. The mean (SD) provider F:D ratio and ALOS were 3.94 (0.36) and 4.45 (0.24) days, respectively. The mean (SD) case mix index (CMI) was 1.68 (0.04). There was a strong linear relationship between the F:D ratio and both ALOS and CMI-adjusted ALOS (r = 0.807; P =.014; and r = 0.814; P =.001, respectively). The mean (SD) F:D ratio for hospitalists with 1 year or less of experience compared with those with more than 1 year of experience was 4.23 (0.80) vs 3.88 (0.39), respectively (P =.012).CONCLUSIONS: A strong linear relationship exists between the F:D ratio and ALOS. Additionally, the F:D ratio improves with experience. Provider-level billing data applied as the F:D ratio can be used as a hospitalist management and assessment tool.

TI  - Is the extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy in the staging of endometrial cancer associated with the yield of metastatic nodes? An Israeli Gynecologic Oncology Group study
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Primary, to explore correlation between the extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy in the surgical staging of endometrial cancer and the number of nodes with metastasis. Secondary, evaluate survival measures in relation to the number of excised nodes.Methods: A retrospective multi-center study of prospectively collected information of 2014 women with endometrial cancer, 1032 of whom underwent lymph node staging. Spearman's rank correlation was used to assess the correlation between the number of pelvic nodes excised and the number of metastatic nodes. Women's data were dichotomized by the median number of excised pelvic nodes. Kaplan-Meier and log rank tests were used to examine the effect of the number of pelvic nodes excised on survival.Results: There was no significant correlation between the number of pelvic nodes harvested and the number of metastatic lymph nodes (r = 0.301; p = 0.28). The median number of excised pelvic nodes was 9 (range 1-77). There was no difference between women with up to 9 and women with more than 9 lymph nodes excised in the 5-year recurrence-free survival (82.4% vs. 83.9%; p = 0.90), disease-specific survival (83.6% vs. 86.7%; p = 0.37), or overall survival (75.8% vs. 82.8%; p = 0.11).Conclusions: The extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy in the surgical staging of endometrial cancer is not associated with a higher yield of metastatic nodes or with longer survival. Current focus should be on sentinel node procedures that offer women the benefit of accurate staging without the complications associated with extensive lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Consolidated recommendations to change GST patterns for managing the impact of Covid-19: A case in India
T2  - EURASIAN CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Finance Commission of India stated that FY 2020-21 was full of uncertainties and the pandemic led to the creation of an uncertain economic environment of the SME sector in India. However, the implications of COVID-19 have been relatively more devastating for small and medium-sized business enterprises in India. The literature review based on the analysis of the secondary journals showed that the filing of GST returns led to a constraint of working capital faced by business owners of SMEs. Moreover, it was also inferred that the denial of credit on input taxes on GST resulted in a further deterioration of business for SMEs, which were a part of the food sector. However, results from secondary research signified that the financial situation of rural SMEs has become volatile due to job losses, weak financial quarterly income, salary cuts and lower volume of sales. A majority of 61% of business owners of SMEs in India decided to lower their respective scale of business operations during the pandemic. The feasible recommendation will be to exempt the business owners from paying penalties. Also, GST charges would be levied after the deduction of ITC charges. It can be concluded that the optimal way for managing the way entrepreneurs of SMEs manage business operations is to file GST returns in a quarterly manner, rather than per month. Besides, additional recommendations such as computing ITC and GST charges via the auto-generated system and re-setting the rate of interest subvention were proposed by the researcher.

TI  - Integrated Archaeological Research: Archival Resources, Surveys, Geophysical Prospection and Excavation Approach at an Execution and Burial Site: The German Nazi Labour Camp in Treblinka
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the results of multidisciplinary research undertaken in 2016-2019 at the German Nazi Treblinka I Forced Labour Camp. Housing 20,000 prisoners, Treblinka I was established in 1941 as a part of a network of objects such as forced labour camps, resettlement camps and prison camps that were established in the territory of occupied Poland from September 1939. This paper describes archaeological research conducted in particular on the execution site and burial site-the area where the "death pits" have been found-in the so-called Las Maliszewski (Maliszewa Forest). In this area (poorly documented) exhumation work was conducted only until 1947, so the location of these graves is only approximately known. The research was resumed at the beginning of the 21st century using, e.g., non-invasive methods and remote-sensing data. The leading aim of this article is to describe the comprehensive research strategy, with a particular stress on non-invasive geophysical surveys. The integrated archaeological research presented in this paper includes an analysis of archive materials (aerial photos, witness accounts, maps, plans, and sketches), contemporary data resources (orthophotomaps, airborne laser scanning-ALS data), field work (verification of potential objects, ground penetrating radar-GPR surveys, excavations), and the integration, analysis and interpretation of all these datasets using a GIS platform. The results of the presented study included the identification of the burial zone within the Maliszewa Forest area, including six previously unknown graves, creation of a new database, and expansion of the Historical-GIS-Treblinka. Obtained results indicate that the integration and analyses within the GIS environment of various types of remote-sensing data and geophysical measurements significantly contribute to archaeological research and increase the chances to discover previously unknown "graves" from the time when the labour camp Treblinka I functioned.

TI  - Continuous Forest Monitoring Using Cumulative Sums of Sentinel-1 Timeseries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest degradation is recognized as a major environmental threat on a global scale. The recent rise in natural and anthropogenic destruction of forested ecosystems highlights the need for developing new, rapid, and accurate remote sensing monitoring systems, which capture forested land transformations. In spite of the great technological advances made in airborne and spaceborne sensors over the past decades, current Earth observation (EO) change detection methods still need to overcome numerous limitations. Optical sensors have been commonly used for detecting land use and land cover changes (LULCC), however, the requirement of certain technical and environmental conditions (e.g., sunlight, not cloud-coverage) restrict their use. More recently, synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based change detection approaches have been used to overcome these technical limitations, but they commonly rely on static detection approaches (e.g., pre and post disturbance scenario comparison) that are slow to monitor change. In this context, this paper presents a novel approach for mapping forest structural changes in a continuous and near-real-time manner using dense Sentinel-1 image time-series. Our cumulative sum-spatial mean corrected (CUSU-SMC) algorithm approach is based on cumulative sum statistical analysis, which allows the continuous monitoring of radar signal variations, derived from forest structural change. Taking advantage of the high data availability offered by the Sentinel-1 (S-1) C-band constellation, we used an S-1 ground range detected (GRD) dual (VV, VH) polarization timeseries, formed by a total of 84 images, to monitor clear-cutting operations carried out in a Scottish forest during 2019. The analysis showed a user's accuracy of 82% for the (conservative) detection approach. The use of a post-processing neighbor filter increased the detection performance to a user's accuracy of 86% with an overall accuracy of 77% for areas of a minimum extent of 0.4 ha. To further validate the detection performance of the method, the CUSU-SMC change detector was tested against commonly-used pairwise change detection approaches for the same period. These results emphasize the capabilities of dense SAR time-series for environmental monitoring and provide a useful tool for optimizing national forest inventories.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Analysis of Urban Growth and Its Effects on Wetlands in Rwanda: The Case of Rwampara Wetland in the City of Kigali
T2  - Journal of Applied Sciences & Environmental Management
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed at analyzing the spatio-temporal patterns of urban growth and its effects on Rwampara wetland, located in the City of Kigali, Rwanda. First, the study was based on the application of remote sensing technology, where 4 Landsat images (1987, 1999, 2009 & 2018) were classified using maximum likelihood classification algorithm. This helped in analyzing the Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) trends in the study area. Secondly, it used the existing LULC data for the years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2018 in order to investigate the overall changes in LULC in Kigali City. Finally, semi-structured interviews were used to collect data from local people and decision-makers about their past and future management strategies of Rwampara wetland. In this regard, 30 local communities (mainly natives from the study area), 15 local government authorities at sector and district levels as well as 4 senior government authorities in the central administration were interviewed. The findings revealed that over the past 4 decades, urban growth in Kigali City has rapidly increased at the expense of resource degradation in Rwampara wetland. Specifically, there has been an increase of about 77% of the built-up area over the last 31 years (1987-2018) which has led to the decrease of the wetland surface area from 24 ha in 1987 to only 7.7 ha in 2018. The results also revealed that demographic factors (i.e. a high population growth rate and high population densities) were mainly responsible for urban growth and degradation of wetland resources in the area under investigation.

TI  - Inter-Comparison of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Measured from Different Footprint Sizes in Cropland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques using visible and near-infrared wavelengths are useful for monitoring terrestrial vegetation. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a widely used proxy of vegetation conditions, and it has been measured at various footprint sizes using satellite, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and ground-installed sensors. The goal of this study was to analyze the spatial characteristics of NDVI data by comparing the values obtained at different footprint sizes. In particular, the NDVI was evaluated in garlic and onion fields that featured ridges and furrows. The evaluation was performed using data from a leaf spectrometer, field spectrometers, ground-installed spectral reflectance sensors, a multispectral camera onboard a UAV, and Sentinel-2 satellites. The correlation coefficients between NDVIs evaluated from the various sensors (excluding the satellite-mounted sensors) ranged from 0.628 to 0.944. The UAV-based NDVI (NDVIUAV) exhibited the lowest root mean square error (RMSE = 0.088) when compared with field spectrometer data. On the other hand, the satellite-based NDVI data (NDVISentinel-2) were poorly correlated with those obtained from the other sensors as a result of the footprint mismatch. However, by upscaling the NDVIUAV data to the pixel size of Sentinel-2, the comparison was improved, and the following statistics were obtained: correlation coefficient: 0.504-0.785; absolute bias: 0.048-0.078; RMSE: 0.063-0.094. According to the aforementioned results, ground-based NDVI data can be used to validate NDVIUAV data without further processing and NDVIUAV data can be used to validate NDVISentinel-2 data after upscaling to the Sentinel-2 pixel size. Overall, the results presented in this study may be helpful to understand and integrate NDVI data at different spatial scales.

TI  - Perception of Cultural Identity in the Early Period of Azerbaijan Enlightenment
T2  - BILIG
M3  - Article
AB  - In the history of Azerbaijan's political and philosophical ideas enlightenment has, as a paradigm, an important place in national historic literature despite its contradictions and some inconsistencies. The philosophical, scientific and cultural arrangements that Russia has imposed on Azerbaijan since the 19th century have led to the formation of new life. We can say that the activities of A. Bakikhanov, M. Kazim Bay, M. F. Akhundov and H. Zerdabi who are representatives of the educating-humanist worldview, are based on the assumption of setting a new society's lifestyle. Being a form of expression, modernization realized mostly under the influence of West brought a new quality into the life of thought and national-cultural notion in Azerbaijan and it is possible to see the effect almost in all areas of life. Discrimination and irredentist policy of Tsarist Russia against Azerbaijani people is an obvious reflection of political and ideological parallels on national identity. In the period of modernization the central problem of the national culture and identity has been seen to be composed of subjective approaches of views connected with the world. Categorization of socio-political and philosophical ideas on the basis of modernization discourse that express characteristic features on recognition of identity obviously paved the way for new consciousness to come out.

TI  - The amino-terminal region of dense granule protein 6 of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> stimulates IFN-γ production by microglia
T2  - MICROBES AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined activities of dense granule proteins (GRAs), which Toxoplasma gondii secretes within infected cells, to stimulate microglial IFN-gamma production in vitro. We identified that the N-terminal region (amino acids 41-152) of GRA6 (GRA6Nt) stimulates IFN-gamma production by both a microglia cell line and primary microglia purified from the brains of uninfected adult mice. In contrast, neither of GRA1, GRA2, GRA5Nt, nor the carboxyl-terminal (amino acids 174-224) of GRA6 stimulated microglial IFN-gamma production. GRA6Nt appears to be a target molecule of the sentinel function of microglia to detect cerebral proliferation of T. gondii and activate their IFN-gamma production for facilitating the protective immunity to control the pathogen.

TI  - Aerosol climatology and determination of different types over the semi-arid urban area of Tehran, Iran: Application of multi-platform remote sensing satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the combination of multiple satellite data was used to improve the assessments of aerosol properties including the aerosol optical depth, Angstrom exponent, UV aerosol index, and single scattering albedo over a semi-arid urban area during the period from 2008 to 2017. The data sets were derived from MODIS and OMI. The critical threshold values for each of the aerosol properties have been defined according to the previous studies to determine different aerosol types.Results of long term analysis of aerosol properties show that all parameters present a distinct monthly variation. A slightly increasing trend is detected for aerosol index values and this indicates the presence of more absorbing aerosols in recent years. There also is an obvious, consistent cooling effect of aerosols based on the variation of single scattering albedo. The aerosol optical depth relative frequency histogram shows a wide range of values with a maximum of about 40% around the range of 0.3 which is generally higher than some other polluted cities in the world. However, the Angstrom exponent peak around 0.8 likely means the dominance of aerosols in coarse mode.The results of the determination of different aerosol type show that, right after the mixed type aerosols, the urban/industrial aerosol type is the second-highest contributor to the aerosol composition and that it is followed by dust aerosols. On the other hand, maritime aerosols and smoke, present in less than 5% of the days studied, do not have a significant contribution. Seasonal analysis of different aerosol types indicates the dominance of large absorbing aerosols, i.e. dust during summertime, and small aerosols with non-absorbing properties, i.e. urban/industrial aerosols, mostly during cold seasons.

TI  - A global near-real-time soil moisture index monitor for food security using integrated SMOS and SMAP
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil Moisture (SM) is a direct measure of agricultural drought. While there are several global SM indices, none of them directly use SM observations in a near-real-time capacity and as an operational tool. This paper presents a near-real-time global SM index monitor based on integrated SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) remote sensing data. We make use of the short period (2015-2018) of SMAP datasets in combination with two approaches-Cumulative Distribution Function Mapping (CDFM) and Bayesian conditional process-and integrate them with SMOS data in a way that SMOS data is consistent with SMAP. The integrated SMOS and SMAP (SMOS/SMAP) has an increased global revisit frequency and a period of record from 2010 to the present. A four-parameter Beta distribution was fitted to the SMOS/SMAP dataset for each calendar month of each grid cell at similar to 36 km resolution for the period from 2010 to 2018. We used an asymptotic method that guarantees the values of the bounding parameters of the Beta distribution will envelop both the smallest and largest observed values. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test showed that more grids globally will pass if the integrated dataset is from the Bayesian conditional approach. A daily global SM index map is generated and posted online based on translating each grid's integrated SM value for that day to a corresponding probability percentile relevant to the particular calendar month from 2010 to 2018. For validation, we use the Canadian Prairies Ecozone (CPE). We compare the integrated SM with the SMAP core validation and RISMA sites from ISMN, compare our indices with other models (VIC, ESA's CCI SM v04.4 integrated satellite data, and SPI-1), and make a two-by-two comparison of candidate indices using heat maps and summary CDF statistics. Furthermore, we visually compare our global SM-based index maps with those produced by other organizations. Our Global SM Index Monitor (GSMIM) performed, in many tests, similarly to the CCI's product SM index but with the advantage of being a near-real-time tool, which has applications for identifying evolving drought for food security conditions, insurance, policymaking, and crop planning especially for the remote parts of the globe.

TI  - Influence of 99m-Tc-Nanocolloid Activity Concentration on Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Endometrial Cancer: A Quantitative SPECT/CT Study
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates quantitative combined single photon emission tomography/computed x-ray tomography (SPECT/CT) to assess the influence of radiotracer concentration on detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in endometrial cancer (EC). Eighty EC patients underwent pericervical 99m-Tc-nanocolloid injection followed by SPECT/CT. The subgroup of patients with failed SLN detection in SPECT/CT (n= 20) was compared to match-paired patients showing at least two SLNs. Results of intraoperative gamma probe measurements and quantitative SPECT/CT were used for comparison. In patients with detection failure, the percentage of injected dose, absolute activity, and volume of the injection site were significantly lower (30 +/- 24% vs. 55 +/- 19%;p= 0.01, 43 +/- 36 MBq vs. 73 +/- 33 MBq;p= 0.04, and 183 +/- 164 mL vs. 266 +/- 164 mL;p= 0.03) while mean activity concentration in liver, spleen, and bone marrow was significantly higher (p= 0.02). Activity concentration (>33 KBq/mL) and absolute activity (>73 MBq) of injection areas correlated with successful intraoperative SLN detection. In a subgroup of 19 SLNs, a correlation between SPECT/CT-derived uptake and intraoperative count rate was found (R-2= 0.8;p< 0.001). SLN detection in EC patients depended on high radiotracer activity at the cervical injection site. Quantitative SPECT/CT could predict successful intraoperative SLN detection and may help to optimize injection technique.

TI  - Estimating ground level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations and associated health risk in India using satellite based AOD and WRF predicted meteorological parameters
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 concentrations in most of the Indian cities are in alarming levels. However, the current network of 308 monitoring stations are heterogeneously placed and do not cover many parts of the country. This limits the ability of agencies to measure the concentration which people are exposed to. In this study, ground level PM2.5 concentrations and the associated risk and mortality in India using satellite based AOD data for the year 2015 was estimated to identify the state specific number of more monitoring sites required. Results indicate that average PM2.5 concentrations were 89 mu g/m(3), which caused 1.61 million deaths including 0.34 million Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) deaths, 0.2 million Lung Cancer (LC) deaths, 0.53 million Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) deaths and 0.70 million deaths due to Stroke. The years of life lost (YLL) per 1000 population due to exposure to PM2.5 indicated Delhi (North-India) to be severely affected by PM2.5 resulting in 227.47 years of life lost and was closely followed by Bihar (Eastern-India) (225.18), Rajasthan (Western-India) (225.05) and Uttar Pradesh (Northern-India) (213.16). Eastern India had the highest population weighted concentration (102.09 mu g/m(3)) and contributed to 23.46% of premature mortality and was followed by Central (75.32 mu g/m(3)) and Northern India (75.12 mu g/m(3)), thus indicating severity of air pollution in India and need for its constant monitoring. As per Indian regulatory agency's guidelines, India still needs 1638 more air quality monitoring stations, of which North-Indian states require maximum number of additional stations i.e. 400, followed by 382 in eastern states.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Data Fusion for Spatiotemporal Geostatistical Analysis of Forest Fire Hazard
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are a natural phenomenon which might have severe implications on natural and anthropogenic ecosystems. Future projections predict that, under a climate change environment, the fire season would be lengthier with higher levels of droughts, leading to higher fire severity. The main aim of this paper is to perform a spatiotemporal analysis and explore the variability of fire hazard in a small Greek island, Skiathos (a prototype case of fragile environment) where the land uses mixture is very high. First, a comparative assessment of two robust modeling techniques was examined, namely, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) knowledge-based and the fuzzy logic AHP to estimate the fire hazard in a timeframe of 20 years (1996-2016). The former technique was proven more representative after the comparative assessment with the real fire perimeters recorded on the island (1984-2016). Next, we explored the spatiotemporal dynamics of fire hazard, highlighting the risk changes in space and time through the individual and collective contribution of the most significant factors (topography, vegetation features, anthropogenic influence). The fire hazard changes were not dramatic, however, some changes have been observed in the southwestern and northern part of the island. The geostatistical analysis revealed a significant clustering process of high-risk values in the southwestern and northern part of the study area, whereas some clusters of low-risk values have been located in the northern territory. The degree of spatial autocorrelation tends to be greater for 1996 rather than for 2016, indicating the potential higher transmission of fires at the most susceptible regions in the past. The knowledge of long-term fire hazard dynamics, based on multiple types of remotely sensed data, may provide the fire and land managers with valuable fire prevention and land use planning tools.

TI  - Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data Product Analysis: Investigating Anthropogenic and Naturogenic Impacts on Mangroves in Southeast Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the drivers of degradation in Southeast Asian mangroves through multi-source remote sensing data products. The degradation drivers that affect approximately half of this area are unidentified; therefore, naturogenic and anthropogenic impacts on these mangroves were studied. Various global land cover (GLC) products were harmonized and examined to identify major anthropogenic changes affecting mangrove habitats. To investigate the naturogenic factors, the impact of the water balance was evaluated using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and evapotranspiration and precipitation data. Vegetation indices' response in deforested mangrove regions depends significantly on the type of drivers. A trend analysis and break point detection of percentage of tree cover (PTC), percentage of non-tree vegetation (PNTV), and percentage of non-vegetation (PNV) datasets can aid in measuring, estimating, and tracing the drivers of change. The assimilation of GLC products suggests that agriculture and fisheries are the predominant drivers of mangrove degradation. The relationship between water balance and degradation shows that naturogenic drivers have a wider impact than anthropogenic drivers, and degradation in particular regions is likely to be a result of the accumulation of various drivers. In large-scale studies, remote sensing data products could be integrated as a remarkably powerful instrument in assisting evidence-based policy making.

TI  - Remote sensing-based detection of agricultural land losses around Greater Cairo since the Egyptian revolution of 2011
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last four decades, the loss of agricultural land has been observed in Egypt at high rates. However, the highest rates of losses have occurred since the January 25th revolution in 2011. Greater Cairo (GC), which is the largest metropolitan in Egypt, has witnessed a massive loss of agricultural land since the 2011 revolution. However, until now, no study or official report has revealed the volume of agricultural land losses in this region. This study quantifies agricultural land losses around the GC using Landsat satellite images from 2010 and 2018. Supervised classification was performed using the maximum likelihood algorithm in QGIS software. A post-classification comparison method was applied to detect the land use/land cover changes between the classified images; then, the loss of agricultural land was quantified using Arc GIS software. Visualizations of the gains and losses in agricultural land and the spatial trends of agricultural land losses were created using TerrSet software. The results show that 9600 ha of agricultural land were converted to urban use during 2010-2018, which means that the annual rate of agricultural land loss has tripled and now reaches approximately 1200 ha per year. Decay of executive authority, rapid population growth, real estate market speculation and fragmentation of agricultural land were the main driving factors of agricultural land losses during this period. The results of this research may help decision makers understand the current high rate of agricultural land loss. Hence, appropriate strategies may be adopted to prevent future losses of this valuable land.

TI  - Burned Area Mapping Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Data by Applying the Relative Differenced Aerosol-Free Vegetation Index (RdAFRI)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the development of wildfire scars during a period of consecutive active fires and smoke overcast is a challenge. The study was conducted during nine months when Israel experienced massive pyro-terrorism attacks of more than 1100 fires from the Gaza Strip. The current project strives at developing and using an advanced Earth observation approach for accurate post-fire spatial and temporal assessment shortly after the event ends while eliminating the influence of biomass burning smoke on the ground signal. For fulfilling this goal, the Aerosol-Free Vegetation Index (AFRI), which has a meaningful advantage in penetrating an opaque atmosphere influenced by biomass burning smoke, was used. On top of it, under clear sky conditions, the AFRI closely resembles the widely used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and it retains the same level of index values under smoke. The relative differenced AFRI (RdAFRI) set of algorithms was implemented at the same procedure commonly used with the Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdBRN). The algorithm was applied to 24 Sentinel-2 Level-2A images throughout the study period. While validating with ground observations, the RdAFRI-based algorithms produced an overall accuracy of 90%. Furthermore, the RdAFRI maps were smoother than the equivalent RdNBR, with noise levels two orders of magnitude lower than the latter. Consequently, applying the RdAFRI, it is possible to distinguish among four severity categories. However, due to different cloud cover on the two consecutive dates, an automatic determination of a threshold level was not possible. Therefore, two threshold levels were considered through visual inspection and manually assigned to each imaging date. The novel procedure enables calculating the spatio-temporal dynamics of the fire scars along with the statistics of the burned vegetation species within the study area.

TI  - An efficient protocol for accurate and massive shoreline definition from mid-resolution satellite imagery
T2  - COASTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images may constitute a useful source of information for coastal monitoring as long as it is possible to manage them in an efficient way and to derive precise indicators of the state of the beaches. In the present work, SHOREX system is employed for managing and processing Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images to automatically define the instantaneous shoreline position at sub-pixel level. Between the years 2013 and 2017, 91 satellite-derived shorelines (SDS) were assessed by comparing with high-resolution shorelines obtained simultaneously through video-monitoring. The analysis allowed identifying the combination of parameters to perform the extraction algorithm with the highest accuracy. Furthermore, an efficient self-contained workflow is proposed, more robust and independent from inaccuracies in the approximate input line and from multiple morphological and oceanographic issues that may condition the radiometric response near the shore. An iterative procedure ensures firstly a suitable kernel of analysis representing the water-land interface to get, afterward, the definition of the sub-pixel shoreline with high accuracy (below 3 m RMSE).

T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The appeal to mythopoetics is emerging in modern design with the focus on its environmental and information spheres. The analysis of literature leads to considering mythopoetics as a design and research method, whose subject is a specific type of mythological consciousness and the product of its work - the system of ideas about the world, formed into a model. Mythopoetics appears in cognitive, sense- forming, value-modeling and environmental aspects.The essence of mythopoetic design is becoming more relevant in the modern worldview due to the need for reproducing the world model. At the stage of mythological consciousness, practical activity was regulated by ritual reproduction of the model. In the modern worldview, the regulating function is performed by culture. Therefore, the task of mythopoetic design is to form a concept of a project filled with value cultural meanings.The basic terms of mythopoetics include traditionally used concepts (an archetype, a mythologeme, a mytheme), philosophical and cultural terms (a concept, a cultural meanings, an imaginative invariant of thinking, a chronotope), and specific concepts (axiomatic state of individual consciousness, artistic and imaginative invariants, a spatiotemporal context of a project, an artistic and imaginative model of the world). In design, the result of work of artistic consciousness and design thinking is the concept of a project shaped into the artistic and imaginative model of the world.The semantic core of the design concept is based on cultural meanings and axioms, which are comprehended by means of axiomatic state of individual consciousness and expressed as consumer's value orientations. The periphery of the design concept is formed by the spatial and time context of project.The artistic and imaginative model of the world appears as a compositional integrity consisting of structural elements, i.e. artistic and imaginative invariants. The conducted analysis of mythopoetic models of the world yields a system of artistic and imaginative invariants, including natural, anthropomorphic, social, sacred, objective, spatial, and dynamic. The structural elements of the model are organized into blocks using the principles of organization. The principles of semantic organization are applied in the creation of a semantic block. The spatiotemporal context of the design concept is formed by the principles of space and time organization. The method of mythopoetics presupposes the sequence of design stages: recognition of cultural meanings, their "implantation" into the individual worldview, and visualization of artistic and imaginative invariants in design objects.The method of mythopoetic design solves the task of synthesis of traditional and innovative aspects, natural and cultural aspects, universal cultural and individual meanings, and value orientations in the design concept.

TI  - LSTM based prediction of malaria abundances using big data
T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Malaria prevails in subtropical countries where health monitoring facilities are minimal. Time series prediction models are required to forecast malaria and minimize the effect of this disease on the population. This study proposes a novel scalable framework to predict the instances of malaria in selected geographical locations. Satellite data and clinical data, along with a long short-term memory (LSTM) classifier, were used to predict malaria abundances in the state of Telangana, India. The proposed model provided a 12 months seasonal pattern for selected regions in the state. Each region had different responses based on environmental factors. Analysis indicated that both environmental and clinical variables play an important role in malaria transmission. In conclusion, the Apache Spark-based LSTM presents an effective strategy to identify locations of endemic malaria.

TI  - NRCS-CN Estimation from Onsite and Remote Sensing Data for Management of a Reservoir in the Eastern Pyrenees
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Onsite and Earth observation (EO) data are used for the calibration of the Natural Resources Conservation Service curve number (NRCS-CN) value in a hydrological simulation model. The model was developed for La Muga catchment (eastern Pyrenees) highly vulnerable to flood and drought episodes. It is an integral part of a regional reservoir management tool, which aims at minimizing the flood risk while maximizing the preservation of water storage. The CN values were optimized for five recorded events for the model to match the observed hydrographs at the reservoir when supported with the measured rainfall intensities. This study also investigates the possibilities of using antecedent moisture conditions (AMC) retrieved from satellite data to inform the selection of the NRCS-CN losses parameter. A good correlation was found between the calibrated CN values and the AMC obtained from satellite data. This correlation highlights the interest in using EO data to update NRCS-CN estimates. This advances in hydrologic-hydraulic coupled modeling combined with new remote sensing datasets present valuable opportunities and potential benefits for flood risk management and water resources preservation.

TI  - An Integrated Method for Identifying Present Status and Risk of Drought in Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence and severity of agricultural droughts may not be dependent upon climatic variables alone. Rather increasingly, drought is affected by human interventions such as irrigation. Anthropogenic activity has introduced uncertainty in the assessment of current drought and future drought risk in many parts of the world; neither climatic nor remote sensing data alone are able to assess drought conditions effectively. In response, we present a simple approach to assess drought by combining a remote sensing-based drought index, the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI), climate data (i.e., rainfall and temperature), and field observations to evaluate recent drought conditions in northwestern Bangladesh (NWB). Applying this approach, we gained five insights: (i) the TVDI successfully indicated the drought conditions of NWB and agrees with field observations, (ii) the integrated use of TVDI and climate data (such as rainfall and temperature) provides the best understanding of the difference between meteorological drought and droughts resulting from surface moisture conditions, (iii) the TVDI results agree with rainfall data (r(2)= 0.40 in March and r(2)= 46 in April) in a part of the study area (NWB) where irrigation is not available, (iv) the TVDI can be used along with climate data to predict the potential risk of drought, and (v) while meteorological drought exists due to low rainfall and high temperature in this NWB in pre-monsoon season, because of widespread irrigation practices, meteorological drought is unable to trigger agricultural drought over most parts of the study area. The findings imply that there is a potential risk of drought in NWB, since any disruption of irrigation water supply could trigger a severe agricultural drought over the whole region. This is similar to what is currently observed over a small part of NWB.

M3  - Article
AB  - During the change of the paradigm of development of science towards the formation of a different worldview of the modern scientific picture of the world, accompanied both by humanization and natural science humanitarization, and expansion of the basic fundamentals of scientific and rational construction of humanities. It is timely to analyze the epic locus of the head of the pantheon of Sakha ancestors - Urung Aiyy Toyon perspective of the natural science picture of the world. The article reveals the key importance of the ordering factor of the geometric model in the reconstruction of the structural frame of the pantheon of deities, and then an attempt is made to establish the location of the head of the Yakut Olympus. Their definitions will serve as the first step for a more efficient use of actual material available to date, replete with fragments of informative data. The study is based on the structural-semiotic approach of E.M. Meletinsky, the concept of the synthesis of sciences V.S. Stepin, some statements on the problems of scientific rationality in the humanities of S.P. Kurdyumov, on the semiotics of geometric symbolism in the myths of V.N. Toporov, systemic M.S. Kagan's approach. In addition to the wellknown methods of folklore, methods of extrapolation, empathy, hermeneutical interpretation are used. As a result of interdisciplinary research, the geometric model of the universe of the Yakut worldview is a pyramid-shaped structure, and in accordance with the physical theory of the unified field of the Universe, the patriarch Urung Aiyy Toyon's locus is located in the upper part of the pyramid, which is confirmed by the revelation of the essence of the numerical symbolism of this deity.

TI  - Importance of anatomical site in the metastases of auricular cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: an observational study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Malignancies of the auricular skin tend to metastasise to preauricular, parotid, facial, and level II (possibly to levels IV and V) lymph nodes in an unpredictable manner. Over the years, we have observed that this pattern of metastasis is commonly linked to lesions that involve the lower half of the ear. To find conclusive evidence based on this hypothetical observation, we retrospectively studied 108 patients who presented with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the ear, and looked at the exact auricular site of the lesion at presentation, incidence of metastasis, nodal involvement, treatment, and survival outcome. The literature was reviewed extensively to ensure detailed presentation of the lymphatic drainage pathway. The pattern of spread and outcome were evaluated. This study has shown that there is a significant correlation between anatomical position and risk of metastasis, and that lesions of the lower half of the ear are more prone to metastasis. These patients therefore may warrant early imaging, possible sentinel node biopsy, or even selective neck dissection with simultaneous primary excision.

TI  - Land use/land cover changes and bare soil surface temperature monitoring in southeast Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface temperature (LST) provides important information about energy exchange processes, which are influenced by land use/land cover (LULC). Thus, our objective was to evaluate LST patterns driven by LULC changes, detected over a time series of Landsat images. The study area of 2990 km(2) is located in the Piracicaba region, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. We acquired Landsat images from 1985 to 2019, in dry and moist seasons. Six LULC classes (agriculture, bare soil, straw, forest, water, and pasture) were identified by maximum-likelihood supervised classification every five years and then LST was estimated using the inversion of Planck's function in the thermal band. Spectral indices representing vegetation, water, bare soil, and straw were calculated and correlated to LST in specific years. Bare soil images and their respective LST in both seasons were used annually to approach the influence of bare soil areas on the LST, considering soil class, time and rainfall. LULC alterations over 1985-2015 were an important factor on the LST change, which varied on average from 21.46 degrees C to 41.31 degrees C in the moist season and 17.05 degrees C to 31.67 degrees C in the dry one. Water bodies and vegetation had the lowest LST values, whereas bare soil and straw had the highest ones. The correlation between LST and spectral indices somewhat agreed with such patterns. Arenosols presented the highest LST mean values in both seasons and differed from Acrisols in the dry season, which is probably related to their texture and mineralogical composition. In the moist season, LST was negatively correlated to rainfall, suggesting the influence of soil moisture content on its surface temperature. In the dry season, the LST of bare soil areas increased by an average of 0.13 degrees C per year, indicating a warming trend. In general, LST increased in the studied period, probably due to the increase of anthropic activity, such as the expansion of agricultural areas. These findings can assist future studies on the influence of soils and land use on climate alterations. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impacts of topographic factors on regional snow cover characteristics
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - At a local scale, snow cover is influenced by terrain properties, and it affects water availability across some arid and semiarid regions. This study aimed to quantify the spatial heterogeneity of snow cover due to topographic effects based on moderate-resolution image spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow cover products, processed with spatial and backward temporal filters. A snow-dominant region in the middle section of the northern Tianshan Mountains in China was selected, and the snow cover ratio (SCR) and the number of snow cover days (SCD) were investigated. The results suggest that MODIS images are biased toward underestimation of the snow cover in the study region, and the error is primarily manifested within the elevation band of 1500-2 500 m. The snow cover is mainly affected by elevation, and snow mostly accumulates above 3 800 m. In addition, the differences in SCR and SCD between the southand north-facing slopes are more significant than those between the eastand west-facing slopes. Notably, the north-facing slopes have the maximum values of SCR and SCD, whereas the south-facing slopes have the minimum values of SCR and SCD. Furthermore, the impact of slope gradients on snow cover varies across seasons. Snow cover on a sloped surface decreases with the slope gradient during winter, while it tends to increase with the slope gradient during the other seasons. Overall, this study presents a useful perspective on the variance in regional snow cover and provides guidance for the water resources management of snow meltwater with different terrain features.

TI  - How Long Is Too Long? Variogram Analysis of AERONET Data to Aid Aerosol Validation and Intercomparison Studies
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Geophysical data sets derived from satellite sensors, ground/airborne instrumentation, and computational models are often compared against each other. A common example is the validation of satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals against measurements from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Sun photometers. Spatiotemporal mismatch between data set sampling means that uncaptured variation in the underlying geophysical field introduces apparent disagreement into such comparisons, known as representation or collocation matchup uncertainty. This study uses variogram analysis of AERONET data to estimate temporal mismatch uncertainties and decorrelation time scales for the global AERONET record. As well as total AOD, the fine- and coarse-mode AODs, Angstrom Exponent (AE), and fine-mode fraction (FMF) of AOD are analyzed. Globally, a time difference of 30 min typically induces from 0.011-0.035 variation in AOD. For total, fine, and coarse AODs the typical time to decorrelation is around 2-10 days. For AE and FMF it is 3-33 days; that is, aerosol systems often persist significantly longer than individual events in them. Biomass burning regions tend to show the largest and fastest subdaily AOD variability and also longest times to decorrelation. Some sites show significant season-to-season variations in behavior. These results can be used to inform site-specific time collocation thresholds for aerosol validation analyses and account for temporal variation when estimating data set uncertainty. They also have implications for comparisons between different satellite products or models, data aggregation, and time series analyses. Results are provided on a site-by-site basis to facilitate use by other researchers.Plain Language Summary It is common to compare different data sets that are measuring the same thing against each other, to check how consistent they are. Satellite data sets measuring aerosols-small particles in the atmosphere such as dust, smoke, smog, or volcanic ash-are often compared with ground-based data sets, which are very accurate but sparse. When comparing data sets like this, often the ground measurements are not made at exactly the same time as the satellite flies over. This time mismatch leads to a source of uncertainty in such comparisons, because a difference in the data could be from both measurement error and real variability. This study presents a method to quantify the typical level of variability of aerosols for different time mismatches, to allow for a better understanding of differences in such comparisons between different data sets.

TI  - Long-Term Discharge Estimation for the Lower Mississippi River Using Satellite Altimetry and Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite increasing interest in monitoring the global water cycle, the availability of in situ gauging and discharge time series is decreasing. However, this lack of ground data can partly be compensated for by using remote sensing techniques to observe river stages and discharge. In this paper, a new approach for estimating discharge by combining water levels from multi-mission satellite altimetry and surface area extents from optical imagery with physical flow equations at a single cross-section is presented and tested at the Lower Mississippi River. The datasets are combined by fitting a hypsometric curve, which is then used to derive the water level for each acquisition epoch of the long-term multi-spectral remote sensing missions. In this way, the chance of detecting water level extremes is increased and a bathymetry can be estimated from water surface extent observations. Below the minimum hypsometric water level, the river bed elevation is estimated using an empirical width-to-depth relationship in order to determine the final cross-sectional geometry. The required flow gradient is derived from the differences between virtual station elevations, which are computed in a least square adjustment from the height differences of all multi-mission satellite altimetry data that are close in time. Using the virtual station elevations, satellite altimetry data from multiple virtual stations and missions are combined to one long-term water level time series. All required parameters are estimated purely based on remote sensing data, without using any ground data or calibration. The validation at three gauging stations of the Lower Mississippi River shows large deviations primarily caused by the below average width of the predefined cross-sections. At 13 additional cross-sections situated in wide, uniform, and straight river sections nearby the gauges the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) varies between 10.95% and 28.43%. The Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) for these targets is in a range from 0.658 to 0.946.

TI  - Sentinel-1 time series data for monitoring the phenology of winter wheat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of time series metrics based on optical sensors for monitoring of crops and their phenological stages has long been recognized. SAR (synthetic aperture radar) sensors such as Sentinel-1 can provide dense time series, but their potential for retrieving time series metrics is to date underexplored. The backscatter coefficient in VH (vertical-horizontal) and VV (vertical-vertical) polarization as well as the interferometric coherence of Sentinel-1 was retrieved in a German agricultural area in order to obtain a time series with a temporal resolution of 6 days. The backscatter coefficient ratio of VH and VV polarization was also calculated. Local extrema and breakpoints were detected in the locally smoothed time series data in wheat fields for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. Breakpoints in the VH/VV ratio time series have high potential for detecting the date of shooting and harvesting of the studied wheat fields. The root mean squared differences between detected date and in situ observed date were 4.6 days in 2017, 5.3 days in 2018 and 9.5 days in 2019 for the shooting and 5.1 days in 2017, 8.2 days in 2018 and 10.4 days in 2019 for the harvest. Ripeness stages could not be detected with a high degree of accuracy. The results suggest that the VH/VV ratio has a high potential for monitoring the phenological stages of wheat fields, which can be used for large-scale crop productivity monitoring and risk assessment in agricultural cropping systems.

TI  - The many meanings of organic farming: framing food security and food sovereignty in Indonesia
T2  - Organic Agriculture
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper contributes to the discourse on food policy, particularly in relation to organic farming in Indonesia. Organic farming was first adopted by non-state actors in Indonesia, by faith-based organisations and then by small farmer associations, while the state support for organic agriculture followed at a later date. The three groups, represented in this study by three case studies, adopt different positions with regard to the definition of organic agriculture and its relevance to food self-sufficiency, food security and food sovereignty. For Bina Sarana Bhakti Foundation (BSB), organic farming is both a spiritual worldview and a practical philosophy. For the Indonesian Peasant Union (SPI), organic agriculture foremost is a political tool to resist global capitalist agriculture. Despite their very different outlooks, both these two civil society organisations see organic agriculture as a post-materialist enterprise directed towards explicitly social-political goals. By contrast, the government's engagement in organic agriculture, although laced with evocative phrases such as "back to nature", is driven primarily by visions of developing a new niche market for Indonesian exports. The Indonesian State adopts a one-dimensional productivist definition that excludes different meanings and traditions of organic farming. The reduction of the meaning of 'organic' to 'organically certified products' excludes farmers who consider that they are practicing organic agriculture. We conclude that there is a strong case to be made that the State should relax its regulatory grip on the organic sector, to create room for sorely needed innovation and cooperation among the different actors involved.

TI  - Perennial Supraglacial Lakes in Northeast Greenland Observed by Polarimetric SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial liquid water at the margins of ice sheets has an important impact on the surface energy balance and can also influence the ice flow when supraglacial lakes drain to the bed. Optical imagery is able to monitor supraglacial lakes during the summer season. Here we developed an alternative method using polarimetric SAR from Sentinel-1 during 2017-2020 to distinguish between liquid water and other surface types at the margin of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream. This allows the supraglacial hydrology to be monitored during the winter months too. We found that the majority of supraglacial lakes persist over winter. When comparing our results to optical data, we found significantly more water. Even during summer, many lakes are partly or fully covered by a lid of ice and snow. We used our classification results to automatically map the outlines of supraglacial lakes, create time series of water area for each lake, and hence detect drainage events. We even found several winter time drainages, which might have an important effect on ice flow. Our method has problems during the peak of the melt season, but for the rest of the year it provides crucial information for better understanding the component of supraglacial hydrology in the glaciological system.

TI  - Mapping urban-rural gradients of settlements and vegetation at national scale using Sentinel-2 spectral-temporal metrics and regression-based unmixing with synthetic training data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing impact of humans on land and ongoing global population growth requires an improved understanding of land cover (LC) and land use (LU) processes related to settlements. The heterogeneity of built-up areas and infrastructures as well as the importance of not only mapping, but also characterizing anthropogenic structures suggests using a sub-pixel mapping approach for analysing related LC from space. We implement a regression-based unmixing approach for mapping built-up surfaces and infrastructure, woody vegetation and non-woody vegetation for all of Germany and Austria at 10 m resolution to demonstrate the potential of sub-pixel mapping. We map LC fractions for one point in time, using all available Sentinel-2 data from 2017 and 2018 (< 70% cloud cover). We combine the concept of synthetically mixed training data with statistical aggregations from spectral-temporal metrics (STM) derived from Sentinel-2 reflectance time series. We specifically examine how STM can be used for creating synthetically mixed training data. STM are known to facilitate large area mapping by being largely independent of image acquisition dates and inherently incorporate phenological information. Vegetation is an important part of settlements and time series information supports its mapping. Synthetically mixed training data facilitates a streamlined training by using pure reference spectra to generate artificial mixtures as input to regression modelling of LC fractions in mixed pixels. We here show how combining both offers great potential for wall-to-wall LC fraction mapping. We further investigate the positive effect of STM on map results by comparing the performance of different subsets of STM combinations. Our results indicate that many STM combinations containing spectral variability and vegetation indices provide suitable input to creating synthetic training data for regression-based fraction mapping. Results for built-up surfaces and infrastructure (MAE 0.13/RMSE 0.18 at 20 m resolution), woody vegetation (0.18, 0.22) and non-woody vegetation (0.14, 0.19) are highly consistent across Germany and Austria. Only a few surface types were not accurately predicted in our nation-wide mapping. Further research is required to optimize mapping of temporally invariant bare soil and rock surfaces that show spectral similarity to built-up surfaces and infrastructure. The proposed methodology combines benefits of both regression-based modelling with synthetically mixed training data and STM, and thus facilitates mapping of LC fractions on a national scale and at high resolution. Such information will allow to better characterize settlements and identifying processes such as densification that are best represented by continuous LC mapping.

TI  - From the history of one quote ... (The role of the French language in the international arena in the XVI century: diachronic aspect)
T2  - FILOLOGICHESKIE NAUKI-NAUCHNYE DOKLADY VYSSHEI SHKOLY-PHILOLOGICAL SCIENCES-SCIENTIFIC ESSAYS OF HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to analyzing the role of the French language in the European society of the XVI century, when la langue francoyse becomes the common language of the communication to both in the field of the official correspondence and in the literature. The research is conducted in the diachronic aspect, concerning different extralinguistic factors (political, ideological, historical and cultural). The origins of this phenomenon are considered: for example, since the XI century, French language was the official language of the court of England and the aristocracy, and then became the working language of the court (le francais du loi) and Parliament (the so-called Norman French). Gradually, the tendency to use French as a means of communication between the king and his entourage became the norm of court etiquette in Europe. The XVI century is not only the period of active formation of the French language as the national literary language of France, but also the time of its distribution in Europe as the language of diplomacy, international business and cultural communication of the European elite. The work shows how, due to the compositions of encyclopedic scientists, the work of Francophone teachers outside of France, and the popularization of the French language by translators-humanists (who served at the court of the king Francois I and his descendants), la langue francoyse consolidated its position in the international arena in the XVI century. At the same time, with the spread of translations into French from the ancient languages (Latin, ancient Greek) the interest of the secular elite of France increases to the past of Europe. And the translations into French from the "living" languages (Italian and Spanish) contributed to the interest to the current problems of modern European literature, as well as history, politics and culture, which was typical for the Renaissance. The article deals with the special attitude of the Renaissance to the French language through the prism of the language worldview of that epoch.

TI  - Use of multi-temporal satellite data for monitoring pool surface areas occurring in non-perennial rivers in semi-arid environments of the Western Cape, South Africa
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological monitoring networks do not adequately cover non-perennial rivers in most parts of Africa partly because river flows do not frequently occur on these rivers. However, in the arid and semi-arid regions flows occurring on these rivers are an important resource that have to be managed judiciously. The lack of data on magnitudes, timing and frequency of non-perennial river flows constrain sustainable management of their water resources. The availability of moderate resolution satellite data (e.g. Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager) offers an opportunity to monitor the surface water availability specifically changes in surface areas covered with water in pools along these rivers. In this study, we investigated the use of remote sensing data to detect and monitor changes of water surface areas of pools along three non-perennial rivers and one perennial river in the Western Cape, South Africa, from 2016 to 2017, using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 datasets. We assessed a range of image pre-processing and image classification techniques to determine the most suitable method for surface water identification and pool area estimation along the selected rivers. The following indices were used; Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Automated Water Extraction Index for shadowed (AWEI(sh)), non-shadowed regions (AWEL(nsh)), and the Multi-Band Water Index (MBWI). The NDWI computed from Sentinel-2 TOA reflectance datasets was found to be the most suitable index for mapping pools, with an overall accuracy ranging between 60 and 86%. This index was used successfully to establish the variations of surface areas of pools covered with water along the Breede, Nuwejaars, Tankwa and Touws Rivers during the 2016-2017 period. The temporal variations of pool areas could be explained as expected by changes of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. Overall, the study demonstrated the feasibility of using moderate resolution datasets to monitor pool changes of areas covered with water in non-perennial rivers, which contributes to improved management of water resources particularly in arid and semi-arid environments.

TI  - The diagnostic utility of PRAME and p16 in distinguishing nodal nevi from nodal metastatic melanoma
T2  - PATHOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - The status of the sentinel lymph node is the strongest predictor of recurrence in patients with malignant melanoma, making accurate distinction between nodal metastases and nodal nevi of paramount importance. We explored the utility of p16 and PRAME in differentiating nodal nevi from metastatic melanoma by immunohistochemistry. We searched our institutional database for cases of nodal nevi and nodal metastatic melanoma. p16 and PRAME expression were assessed with immunolabeling quantified by extent of nuclear positivity (0-25 %, 25 %-50 %, > 50 %-75 % and > 75 %). Sensitivities and specificities were calculated, and discrimination assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Forty-nine cases out of 51 nevi and 56/56 melanoma cases had lesional tissue present for p16, while 44/51 nevi and 54/56 melanoma cases had lesional tissue present for PRAME. 43 nodal nevi (88 %) had > 50 % nuclear staining for p16, while none had > 50 % staining for PRAME. More than half (55 %) of melanoma cases had complete loss of nuclear staining for p16, while majority (94 %) had > 50 % nuclear staining for PRAME. Using a cut-off value of 50 %, higher PRAME expression had a sensitivity and specificity of 94 % and 100 %, respectively, while lower p16 expression had a sensitivity and specificity of 66 % and 88 %, respectively, for detecting metastatic melanoma. PRAME showed significantly better discrimination (AUC = 0.97, 95 % CI 0.94-1.00) than p16 (AUC = 0.77, 95 % CI 0.68-0.86) for differentiating nodal nevi from nodal melanoma (P < 0.001). Our findings suggest that PRAME is more accurate than p16 in discriminating between the two entities, with excellent sensitivity and specificity.

TI  - Sensitivity Analysis and Validation of Daytime and Nighttime Land Surface Temperature Retrievals from Landsat 8 Using Different Algorithms and Emissivity Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a substantial element indicating the relationship between the atmosphere and the land. This study aims to examine the efficiency of different LST algorithms, namely, Single Channel Algorithm (SCA), Mono Window Algorithm (MWA), and Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE), using both daytime and nighttime Landsat 8 data and in-situ measurements. Although many researchers conducted validation studies of daytime LST retrieved from Landsat 8 data, none of them considered nighttime LST retrieval and validation because of the lack of Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) data in the nighttime. Thus, in this paper, we propose using a daytime LSE image, whose acquisition is close to nighttime Thermal Infrared (TIR) data (the difference ranges from one day to four days), as an input in the algorithm for the nighttime LST retrieval. In addition to evaluating the three LST methods, we also investigated the effect of six Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-based LSE models in this study. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were carried out for both in-situ measurements and LST methods for satellite data. Simultaneous ground-based LST measurements were collected from Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) and Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) stations, located at different rural environments of the United States. Concerning the in-situ sensitivity results, the effect on LST of the uncertainty of the downwelling and upwelling radiance was almost identical in daytime and nighttime. Instead, the uncertainty effect of the broadband emissivity in the nighttime was half of the daytime. Concerning the satellite observations, the sensitivity of the LST methods to LSE proved that the variation of the LST error was smaller than daytime. The accuracy of the LST retrieval methods for daytime Landsat 8 data varied between 2.17 K Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and 5.47 K RMSE considering all LST methods and LSE models. MWA with two different LSE models presented the best results for the daytime. Concerning the nighttime accuracy of the LST retrieval, the RMSE value ranged from 0.94 K to 3.34 K. SCA showed the best results, but MWA and RTE also provided very high accuracy. Compared to daytime, all LST retrieval methods applied to nighttime data provided highly accurate results with the different LSE models and a lower bias with respect to in-situ measurements.

TI  - Mapping and assessing limestone as a raw material for the cement industry using satellite data: a case study of areas between Riyadh and Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is a popular method utilized in mineral and natural resource exploration, particularly to reduce reconnaissance and exploration costs. Its use is widely popular for geological mapping of arid regions. The primary objective of this paper is to illustrate how remote sensing satellite data could be used for mapping and assessing potential limestone raw material for the cement industry in Saudi Arabia. Limestone rocks are identified and mapped using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) indices, band combinations, band ratio combination, and relative absorption-band depth (RBD). Band combination of ASTER-thermal infrared (TIR) data 14:12:10, 8:6:1, and QI:CI:MI in R:G:B is also used for mapping limestone rocks with high efficiency as well as differentiating between sandstone and limestone rocks in the study area. Two band ratios 6/8 and 9/8 and RBD of (band 7+band 9)/band 8 are used for detecting limestone rocks as bright pixels. The carbonate index of ASTER-TIR data are subsequently used for mapping limestone areas and categorize them into classes for the purpose of using them as a raw material in the cement industry. Study findings show that high and very high classes of CI are concentrated in the southern and central parts of the study area such as Khashm Mazalij, Jabal Hit, and Jabal Hafafah and correlate with cement limestone and high-Ca limestone sites in the study area. Other very high limestone classes are found distributed in the northwestern part of Banban. Sulaiy Formation, in Khashm Mazalij area, also constitutes the best promising potential for high-purity limestone. It is hoped that the findings of the study provide ample evidence for the usefulness of the reconnaissance tool in assessing the limestone as raw materials, which is a vital process for the cement industry decision-makers in planning and managing natural resources in Saudi Arabia.

TI  - Reporting and Abstracting Variability in Technical Standards for Breast Cancer Operations
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer has incorporated documentation of critical elements outlined in Operative Standards for Cancer Surgery into revised standards for cancer center accreditation. This study assessed the current documentation of critical elements in partial mastectomy (PM) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) operative reports.Materials and methods: Operative reports for PM + SLNB at a single academic institution from 2013 to 2018 were reviewed for compliance and surveyor interobserver reliability with the Oncologic Elements of Operative Record defined in Operative Standards and compared with a nonredundant American Society of Breast Surgeons Mastery of Breast Surgery (MBS) quality measure for specimen orientation.Results: Ten reviewers each evaluated 66 PM + SLNB operative reports for 13 Oncologic Elements and one MBS measure. No operative records reported all critical elements for PM + SLNB or PM alone. Residents completed 36.4% of operative reports: Element documentation was similar for PM but varied significantly for SLNB between resident and attending authorship. Combined reporting performance and interrater reliability varied across all elements and was highest for the use of SLNB tracer (97.1% and kappa = 0.95, respectively) and lowest for intraoperative assessment of SLNB (30.6%, kappa = 0.43). MBS specimen orientation had both high proportion reported (87.0%) and interrater reliability (kappa = 0.84).Conclusions: Adherence to reporting critical elements for PM and SLNB varied. Whether differential compliance was tied to discrepancies in documentation or reviewer abstraction, clarification of synoptic choices may improve reporting consistency. Evolving techniques or technologies will require continuous appraisal of mandated reporting for breast surgery. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - Journal of Biological Control
M3  - Article
AB  - Housefly, Musca domestica is used as an alternate host to rear a eulophid, Nesolynx thymus (Girault), a pupal parasitoid of the tachinid fly, Exorista bombycis (Louis) which in turn is an endolarval parasitoid of Bombyx mori (L.). An attempt was made to evaluate the host factors like pupal size, age and exposure periods of N. thymus for developing robust mass multiplication methods. The host size had significant effect on mean parasitism by N. thymus. Mated females of N. thymus when exposed to host pupae of varying size, revealed that mean per cent parasitisation was significantly higher (74%) in large sized pupae having a volume of 263.89 mm(3). Regarding host age, 24 - 48 h old host pupae had higher level of parasitism (65%) by N. thymus. The parasitism rate declined with an increase in host age after 72 h. In field evaluation, release of N. thymus at weekly interval resulted in the reduction of housefly population as evinced from the higher parasitism (56 %) of the sentinel cards placed in the treated poultry sheds. The information on host factors generated will help to enhance the mass multiplication of parasitoid for the release of which would aid to bring down the M. domestica population in poultry and dairy units.

TI  - A Joint Study of Seismicity and SAR Interferometry Observations for Assessing the Possibility of an Eruption of the Dormant Bolshaya Udina Volcano
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seismicity began to be recorded in October 2017 around the dormant Bolshaya Udina Volcano (B. Udina in what follows) situated 10 km southeast of Plosky Tolbachik Volcano. Seismic tomography showed the existence of a long-lived magma chamber south of B. Udina in the area of the Tolud River. The chamber has its top at a depth of about 15 km, and may probably be connected to the Plosky Tolbachik plumbing system (Koulakov et al., 2017). Saltykov et al. (2018) and Koulakov et al. (2019) related the observed resumption of seismic activity to a hypothetical emplacement of magma beneath the Udina volcanoes, pointing out a high likelihood of the resumption of volcanic activity. The present study examines data from permanent seismic stations showing a systematic displacement of the center of seismic energy southward from B. Udina from October 2017 through August 2019. The center characterizes the location of the volume that generates the bulk of seismicity. We used images of the Sentinel-1A satellite (wavelength 5.6 cm) taken from a descending orbit of track 60 during the period from June 7, 2017 through September 23, 2017 (10 images) and during the period from May 21, 2018 to September 30, 2018 (12 images) to determine time series and average velocities of displacement on the slopes of B. Udina. Persistent scatterers could only be identified at the foot of B. Udina. An analysis of displacement time series for the surface of the volcano showed that the character of displacements in 2017 and 2018 on the southwestern and eastern slopes remained nearly the same, while the average rate of displacement on the northwestern slope decreased in 2018. We used three images of the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 satellite (wavelength 23.5 cm) taken on October 4, 2016, June 13, 2016, and October 2, 2018 from an ascending orbit to construct paired interferograms, which characterize displacements for the time period between images. The displacements on both interferograms did not exceed a few centimeters, except for narrow zones confined to local relief forms. The deformations thus detected were most likely due to surface processes. The deformed volumes related to pressure changes in the magma chamber at a depth of 5 km must have linear dimensions of 10-15 km, while the displacement areas detected in the satellite images are considerably smaller. These results suggested an alternative model that postulates the resumption of seismic activity to accompany the retreat and sinking of magma melt from B. Udina into the chamber in the Tolud R. area as identified by tomographic techniques.

TI  - Cloud thermodynamic phase detection using a directional polarimetric camera (DPC)
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud phase detection via satellites is essential in the accurate estimation of cloud radiative forcing at global and regional scales. The difference in polarized reflectance features between liquid and ice clouds can be used for detecting the cloud phase. The directional polarimetric camera (DPC) onboard the Chinese GaoFen-5 satellite was launched in May 2018. The multidirectional, multispectral, and multipolarization capabilities of the DPC provide essential measurements to better understand the distribution of clouds and their physical properties. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the angular polarization signatures of ice crystals and liquid cloud droplets are effective in the detection of liquid and ice clouds. This study uses cloud phase profiles from Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) to select reliable liquid and ice cloud pixels via the DPC and analyzes the angular polarization signatures of ice and cloud clouds. These extracted angular polarization signatures are compared with the simulated results. Then, based on the earlier POLDER cloud phase algorithm, we propose a cloud phase detection method (P-CP) for DPC using multiple tests developed based on the extracted angular polarization signatures. Finally, P-CP algorithm is applied to the measurements of DPC and POLDER on 1 June 2008, and the analysis indicates that our cloud phase detection results agree well with the MODIS and POLDER cloud phase products.

TI  - Modeling Snow Surface Spectral Reflectance in a Land Surface Model Targeting Satellite Remote Sensing Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow surface spectral reflectance is very important in the Earth's climate system. Traditional land surface models with parameterized schemes can simulate broadband snow surface albedo but cannot accurately simulate snow surface spectral reflectance with continuous and fine spectral wavebands, which constitute the major observations of current satellite sensors; consequently, there is an obvious gap between land surface model simulations and remote sensing observations. Here, we suggest a new integrated scheme that couples a radiative transfer model with a land surface model to simulate high spectral resolution snow surface reflectance information specifically targeting multisource satellite remote sensing observations. Our results indicate that the new integrated model can accurately simulate snow surface reflectance information over a large spatial scale and continuous time series. The integrated model extends the range of snow spectral reflectance simulation to the whole shortwave band and can predict snow spectral reflectance changes in the solar spectrum region based on meteorological element data. The kappa coefficients (K) of both the narrowband snow albedo targeting Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data simulated by the new integrated model and the retrieved snow albedo based on MODIS reflectance data are 0.5, and both exhibit good spatial consistency. Our proposed narrowband snow albedo simulation scheme targeting satellite remote sensing observations is consistent with remote sensing satellite observations in time series and can predict narrowband snow albedo even during periods of missing remote sensing observations. This new integrated model is a significant improvement over traditional land surface models for the direct spectral observations of satellite remote sensing. The proposed model could contribute to the effective combination of snow surface reflectance information from multisource remote sensing observations with land surface models.

TI  - Residual Encoder-Decoder Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the limitation of the satellite sensor, it is difficult to acquire a high-resolution (HR) multispectral (HRMS) image directly. The aim of pansharpening (PNN) is to fuse the spatial in panchromatic (PAN) with the spectral information in multispectral (MS). Recently, deep learning has drawn much attention, and in the field of remote sensing, several pioneering attempts have been made related to PNN. However, the big size of remote sensing data will produce more training samples, which require a deeper neural network. Most current networks are relatively shallow and raise the possibility of detail loss. In this letter, we propose a residual encoder-decoder conditional generative adversarial network (RED-cGAN) for PNN to produce more details with sharpened images. The proposed method combines the idea of an autoencoder with generative adversarial network (GAN), which can effectively preserve the spatial and spectral information of the PAN and MS images simultaneously. First, the residual encoder-decoder module is adopted to extract the multiscale features from the last step to yield pansharpened images and relieve the training difficulty caused by deepening the network layers. Second, to further enhance the performance of the generator to preserve more spatial information, a conditional discriminator network with the input of PAN and MS images is proposed to encourage that the estimated MS images share the same distribution as that of the referenced HRMS images. The experiments conducted on the Worldview2 (WV2) and Worldview3 (WV3) images demonstrate that our proposed method provides better results than several state-of-the-art PNN methods.

TI  - Flood Mapping Using Relevance Vector Machine and SAR Data: A Case Study from Aqqala, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite imagery to monitor flood areas is essential to determine the damage and prevent related problems in the future. This paper examines thresholding and unsupervised classification for flood mapping using Sentinel-1 SAR image. Thresholding helps us to determine over-detection and under-detection regions in the flooded areas, and so, gamma distribution is used to select the thresholds. Also, the relevance vector machine (RVM) and the object-based classification method have been used for classification. The RVM algorithm obtained better results with overall accuracy = 0.89 andk = 0.95, while for the object-based classification method, these values were 0.87 and 0.91, respectively. According to the results, over- and under-detection occurred in flat areas and man-made structures, respectively. The results demonstrate a great potential of radar imagery for operational detection and delimitation of water in flood risk areas. The automation of satellite radar data processing operation has been tested, and it shows a potential for optimising the system of monitoring and early detection of flood risk.

AB  - For accurate crop classification, it is necessary to use time-series of high-resolution satellite data to better discriminate among certain crop types. This task brings the following challenges: a large amount of satellite data for download, Big data processing and computational resources for utilization of state-of-the-art classification approaches. For solving these problems, we have developed an automated crop classification workflow, which is based on machine-learning techniques. By deployment of the workflow on the cloud platform, we can overcome challenges of Big data downloading and processing.

TI  - A Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Haze Removal Method for Visible Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Visible remotely sensed images usually suffer from the haze, which contaminates the surface radiation and degrades the data quality in both spatial and spectral dimensions. This study proposes a spatial-spectral adaptive haze removal method for visible remote sensing images to resolve spatial and spectral problems. Spatial adaptation is considered from global and local aspects. A globally nonuniform atmospheric light model is constructed to depict spatially varied atmospheric light. Moreover, a bright pixel index is built to extract local bright surfaces for transmission correction. Spectral adaptation is performed by exploring the relationships between image gradients and transmissions among bands to estimate spectrally varied transmission. Visible remote sensing images featuring different land covers and haze distributions were collected for synthetic and real experiments. Accordingly, four haze removal methods were selected for comparison. Visually, the results of the proposed method are completely free from haze and colored naturally in all experiments. These outcomes are nearly the same as the ground truth in the synthetic experiments. Quantitatively, the mean-absolute-error, root-mean-square-error, and spectral angle are the smallest, and the coefficient-of-determination (R2) is the largest among the five methods in the synthetic experiments. R2, structural similarity index measure, and the correlation coefficient between the result of the proposed method and the reference image are closest to 1 in the real data experiments. All experimental analyses demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in removing haze and recovering ground information faithfully under different scenes.

TI  - Planning for the wetland restoration potential based on the viability of the seed bank and the land -use change trajectory in the Sanjiang Plain of China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sanjiang Plain has the largest marsh wetland area in China. Since the 1950s its size has declined due to land development, between 1986 and 2016 nearly 6072 km(2) (57.5% of the area) was lost due to farm land expansion. Since the Wetland for Grain project in 2003, efforts have been made to improve marsh area for animal habitat and ecological protection. A key management concern is prioritizing areas for wetland restoration in scientific planning and polices making. In this study, the natural wetland restoration potentials were evaluated based on land-use change trajectory, seed bank viability and watershed sustainability and restorability. The annual land use maps from 1986 to 2016 were reconstructed using CLUE-S model with land use maps in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2016, which were interpreted from Landsat TM/ETM images. Seed bank viability was determined by field sampling in wetland and farm land with different reclamation years and germination in lab. Sub-catchment was chosen as sustainability analysis unit, which was quantified by the impacts of wetland on peak flow reduction. The watershed restorability was performed with the factors of wetland degradation degree, seed bank viability, and the percentage of wetland to watershed area (PWW) with different restoration years. The results indicated that reclaimed wetland with a time since last development (TLD) of <15 years had a higher recovery potential and accounted for 39.2% of the lost wetland. Seventeen sub-catchments with a total area of 2177 km(2) of farmland could be planned for restoration, which could support more than half of the sub-catchments in the study area. Priority areas were identified for short-, mid- and long-term restoration planning. The results can support the scientific planning demands of various restoration goals in the study area, and provide a new method for wetland restoration.

TI  - Discharge Estimation Using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 Product: Case Studies in the Murray Darling Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying river discharge is a critical component for hydrological studies, floodplain ecological conservation research, and water resources management. In recent years, a series of remote sensing-based discharge estimation methods have been developed. An example is the use of the near infrared (NIR) band of optical satellite images, with the principle of calculating the ratio between a stable land pixel for calibration (C) and a pixel within the river for measurement (M), applying a linear regression between C/M series and observed discharge series. This study trialed the C/M method, utilizing the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) surface reflectance product on relatively small rivers with 30 similar to 100 m widths. Two study sites with different river characteristics and geographic settings in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) of Australia were selected as case studies. Two independent sets of HLS data and gauged discharge data for the 2017 and 2018 water years were acquired for modeling and validation, respectively. Results reveal high consistency between the HLS-derived discharge and gauged discharge at both sites. The Relative Root Mean Square Errors are 53% and 19%, and the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficients are 0.24 and 0.69 for the two sites. This study supports the effectiveness of applying the fine-resolution HLS for modeling discharge on small rivers based on the C/M methodology, which also provides evidence of using multisource synthesized datasets as the input for discharge estimation.

TI  - Trend analysis and first time observations of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide in South Africa using TROPOMI/Sentinel-5 P data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to end extreme poverty and create a healthy, sustainable world by the year 2030. Goal 7 is of interest to this study as it targets access to clean and affordable energy. However, in this study we show that the energy created in South Africa is not necessary clean. South Africa has numerous coal-fired power station located in the Mpumalanga (MP), Gauteng (GP) and Limpopo (LP) provinces. These power station produce tons of toxic pollutants including sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphates (SO4). These pollutants are known to have a negative impact on human health, climate and the environment. In this study we use the sequential Mann-Kendall test to investigate the 39 year (1980-2019) trends of SO2, NO2 and SO4 from these source areas. We also report for the first time on the observations of SO2 and NO2 from the Sentinel-5 P sensor over South Africa. Increasing trends of SO2 were observed in the MP, LP and GP regions. The increase was mostly due to the emissions from coal-fired power stations. Moreover, the increase of SO2 over the years could be due to the increasing demand in electricity, aging power stations and the low quality of coal used. Sentinel-5 P observations of SO2 and NO2 over South Africa were observed in the MP, GP and LP regions as a result of coal-fired power stations. Dispersion of SO2 and NO2 over South Africa were observed in the winter months, while confined SO2 and NO2 in the source region were observed in the summer months.

TI  - Hierarchical Multi-Label Object Detection Framework for Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting objects such as aircraft and ships is a fundamental research area in remote sensing analytics. Owing to the prosperity and development of CNNs, many previous methodologies have been proposed for object detection within remote sensing images. Despite the advance, using the object detection datasets with a more complex structure, i.e., datasets with hierarchically multi-labeled objects, is limited to the existing detection models. Especially in remote sensing images, since objects are obtained from bird's-eye view, the objects are captured with restricted visual features and not always guaranteed to be labeled up to fine categories. We propose a hierarchical multi-label object detection framework applicable to hierarchically partial-annotated datasets. In the framework, an object detection pipeline calledDecoupled Hierarchical Classification Refinement(DHCR) fuses the results of two networks: (1) an object detection network with multiple classifiers, and (2) a hierarchical sibling classification network for supporting hierarchical multi-label classification. Our framework additionally introduces a region proposal method for efficient detection on vain areas of the remote sensing images, calledclustering-guided croppingstrategy. Thorough experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework on our own object detection datasets constructed with remote sensing images from WorldView-3 and SkySat satellites. Under our proposed framework, DHCR-based detections significantly improve the performance of respective baseline models and we achieve state-of-the-art results on the datasets.

TI  - Equatorial Plasma Bubbles: Occurrence Probability versus Local Time
T2  - GEOMAGNETISM AND AERONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - The character of the variability of the LT distributions of the equatorial plasma bubble occurrence probability with an increase of the recording altitude is under consideration. The conditions of the high and maximal solar activity, when the generation of the plasma bubbles is the most active, are examined. For this purpose the detailed comparative analysis of the LT distributions of the equatorial plasma bubble occurrence probability derived from the ISS-b (similar to 972-1220 km), Hinotori (similar to 650 km), ROCSAT-1 (similar to 600 km), AE-E (similar to 300-475 km), and CHAMP (similar to 380-450 km) satellite data was done. The pronounced trend of the local time shift of the bubble occurrence probability maximum with an increase of the altitude is revealed. Thus, if the maximum occurs after sunset (similar to 2030-2200 LT) at the bottom-side of the F-layer, it shifts toward the premidnight (similar to 2100-2400 LT, similar to 600 km), then to the postmidnight (similar to 0100-0300 LT, similar to 650 km), and, finally, to the predawn hours (similar to 0300-0400 LT, similar to 972-1220 km) as the observation altitude increases. The most typical velocities of the equatorial plasma bubble rise are found to be similar to 150-300 m/s, which correspond to the numerous observational data.

TI  - Scale-dependency of Arctic ecosystem properties revealed by UAV
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the face of climate change, it is important to estimate changes in key ecosystem properties such as plant biomass and gross primary productivity (GPP). Ground truth estimates and especially experiments are performed at small spatial scales (0.01-1 m(2)) and scaled up using coarse scale satellite remote sensing products. This will lead to a scaling bias for non-linearly related properties in heterogeneous environments when the relationships are not developed at the same spatial scale as the remote sensing products. We show that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can reliably measure normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at centimeter resolution even in highly heterogeneous Arctic tundra terrain. This reveals that this scaling bias increases most at very fine resolution, but UAVs can overcome this by generating remote sensing products at the same scales as ecological changes occur. Using ground truth data generated at 0.0625 m(2)and 1 m(2)with Landsat 30 m scale satellite imagery the resulting underestimation is large (8.9%-17.0% for biomass and 5.0%-9.7% for GPP(600)) and of a magnitude comparable to the expected effects of decades of climate change. Methods to correct this upscaling bias exist but rely on sub-pixel information. Our data shows that this scale-dependency will vary strongly between areas and across seasons, making it hard to derive generalized functions compensating for it. This is particularly relevant to Arctic greening with a predominantly heterogeneous land cover, strong seasonality and much experimental research at sub-meter scale, but also applies to other heterogeneous landscapes. These results demonstrate the value of UAVs for satellite validation. UAVs can bridge between plot scale used in ecological field investigations and coarse scale in satellite monitoring relevant for Earth System Models. Since future climate changes are expected to alter landscape heterogeneity, seasonally updated UAV imagery will be an essential tool to correctly predict landscape-scale changes in ecosystem properties.

TI  - ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS IN A SITE IN THE APORE AND ITAJA MUNICIPALITIES, GOIAS: SUBSIDY FOR THE CONSERVATION UNIT CREATION
T2  - GEOAMBIENTE ON-LINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, natural ecosystems of Cerrado have lost space for agricultural frontiers, especially grains, sugar cane and livestock. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate environmental changes in physical variables, over an interval of 30 years, in the municipalities of Apore and Itaja, southern region of Goias. Thematic maps of the physical variables were organized through databases made available by the Geoinformation System of Goias State. The land use maps for the years 1985 and 2015 were generated from Landsat (5 and 8) satellite images, using the ArcGIS (R) 10.1 Software. Classes were predefined in agriculture, pasture, remaining vegetation, exposed soil, urban area and water. The research focused on this region, due to the proposal to create a Conservation Unit (UC) at the limit between the aforementioned municipalities. Pasture had a higher percentage of area coverage both in 1985 and in 2015, with an increase of 12.9% in that interval. Remaining vegetation was the class with the greatest decrease, losing 13.1% of the areas, in the same period. The results obtained by the mapping, combined with the high environmental vulnerability of the area indicated for supposed UC, highlight the importance of temporal characterization of the physical environment, through satellite images. This provides knowledge and support for the public policies implementation related to sustainable techniques for the production and conservation of natural resources.

TI  - Introducing the ORIGINS project: a community-based interventional birth cohort
T2  - REVIEWS ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) pose the greatest threat to human health globally. The dramatic rise in early onset NCDs - such as childhood obesity, the allergy epidemic and an increasing burden of mental ill health in children and youth - reflect the profound early impact of modern environments on developing systems. The ORIGINS Project is a research platform enabling world class investigation of early antecedent pathways to NCDs, and how to curtail these. As well as facilitating strategic long-term research capacity, ORIGINS is a pipeline for short-term productivity through a series of clinical trials, early interventions, mechanistic studies, and targeted research questions to improve maternal and paternal health and the early environment.Methods: ORIGINS is a decade-long collaborative initiative between the Joondalup Health Campus (JHC) and the Telethon Kids Institute (TKI) to establish a Western Australian (WA) birth cohort of 10,000 families, enrolled during pregnancy. It is currently funded to follow up participating children and their families to five years of age. Comprehensive data and biological samples are collected from participants at up to 15 different timepoints, from the first antenatal clinic visit. In the process, ORIGINS is creating a major research platform, consisting of an extensive, world class biobank and databank. Of key strength and novelty, ORIGINS includes a series of harmonised nested sub-projects integrated with clinical and diagnostic services and providing real-time feedback to improve the health of individuals and the community.Conclusions: At its core, ORIGINS aims to improve the health and quality of life of the next generation through improved pathways to optimise the early environment and reduce adversity by promoting primary prevention, early detection and early intervention. This dynamic, interactive, community-based project not only provides novel research capacity, productivity, collaboration and translational impact on future generations - it is also anticipated to have flow on benefits for community engagement, cohesion and purpose. This will provide a sentinel example for tailored replication in other communities around the world as part of interconnected grass root strategies to improve planetary health.

TI  - Assessing Lava Flow Subpixel Surface Roughness and Particle Size Distribution for Improved Thermal Inertia Interpretations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Apparent thermal inertia (ATI) is a remote sensing-based thermophysical approximation used to estimate surface properties such as particle size or soil moisture, but is subject to oversimplifications if uniform surface materials are assumed. Geological surfaces realistically contain multiple types of materials that are represented by mixed pixels in a digital image that can dramatically affect the derived thermal response. Thus, the current surface uniformity assumption can lead to erroneous calculations. To define how these mixed particle size surfaces affect ATI, a multi-instrument, multi-spectral study was conducted at the North Coulee rhyolite flow, Mono Domes (California). This flow is compositionally homogenous with particle sizes ranging from silt size to boulders, making it an ideal location to understand the relationship between particle size distributions and ATI. Multispectral data from orbital sensors with increasing spatial resolutions were analyzed in combination with samples, GPS, and photogrammetry data collected in the field. The surface particle size characteristics divided into three broad categories (fine, moderate, and coarse) were mapped based on WorldView-2 visible data and field observations. Broad categories were validated using a 3-dimensional point cloud derived from structure-from-motion (SfM) methods using field photographs. The areal percentage of each category within an ATI pixel was derived to populate a lookup table (LUT) with the corresponding ATI values to quantify the effect of mixed pixels. Lower ATI values are dominated by fine particles (sand and dust) as expected, however, surfaces with the highest values were predominately moderate-sized cobbles. Pixels with a high areal percentage of coarse sizes display an intermediate ATI value, suggesting that either self-shadowing or trapping of fines lowers the ATI value. Alternatively, areas with a majority of moderate particle sizes have less shadowing and efficient vertical sorting of smaller material, as seen in field data, leaving a thermal derived response indicative of the dominating particle size. This study demonstrates how a uniform property assumption can cause erroneous derived thermal modeling, particularly over surfaces with a high percentage of boulders and large particle sizes. Future thermophysical studies of Earth or other planetary surfaces can greatly benefit from a multi-sensor approach combined with a higher spatial resolution visible dataset.

TI  - Discovering anomalous dynamics and disintegrating behaviour in glaciers of Chandra-Bhaga sub-basins, part of Western Himalaya using DInSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier velocity is one of the important parameters to know about glacier dynamics, its mass and health. Understanding glacier velocity also assists in the analysis of ice thickness, ice flux and mass balance. Furthermore, basin/sub-basin wise studies are helpful to understand the climate change over that region instead of monitoring individual glaciers. In the current study, the spatial distribution of glacier velocity is generated for the entire Chandra and Bhaga sub-basins, in the Lahaul-Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh, India, using Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2) differential interferometry pair images with a 14-days temporal gap. The glaciers in Chandra sub-basin are found to have a high flow rate as compared to the glaciers in Bhaga sub-basin. Local slope and ice thickness, which decrease towards the terminus in general, control the movement of valley glaciers, and lower movement rate is observed for most of glaciers towards the terminus/frontal area. However, a few glaciers of Bhaga sub-basin demonstrate an accelerated movement in their frontal areas. This irregular behaviour is also studied in this work and it is discovered that terrain slope and influx of melting water from adjacent glaciers are the major causes for such behaviour of these glaciers. They are, therefore, prone to accelerated mass loss compared to other glaciers in the sub-basin. Another key finding of the anomalous glacier dynamics study is the disintegrating behaviour of glaciers, which is also identified by interpreting the responses of physical scattering mechanisms retrieved from glaciers using fully polarimetric ALOS-2/PALSAR-2. Warming temperatures are expected to cause glacier retreat and separation of tributary glaciers from the main glacier body. Melt water from tributary glaciers can further accelerate glacier flow and ice melt in lower part of glacier trunk. This can lead to formation of dead ice zones and disintegration of Himalayan glaciers, which are supported by numerous tributary glaciers. Therefore, we expect that the loss in glacier area due to warming will be larger than the present prediction, where mass loss is considered from conventional way.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a multidisciplinary concept that can have major impacts on ecological, agricultural, and socio-economic spheres. The accurate monitoring and information of spatio-temporal distribution of agricultural drought are effective means of reducing the farmers' losses. The space-based technology is proven to provide the detail of land information, which helps to quantify different natural resources and even severity of climate extremes. The biophysical parameters such as precipitation, temperature, soil, and vegetation significantly influence drought monitoring in the regions. An artificial Neural Network (ANN) model based on the integration of Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI) and Soil Condition Index (SCI) derived from multi-source remote sensing satellite imagery was applied for assessment and prediction of drought. The study was implemented in Sangli, Maharashtra, India from the period 2003-2016 to assess the efficiency of the ANN model for near real-time drought monitoring. In our research, the investigation results for 2006, 2011, and 2016 (a typical dry year) were accurately explored using the ANN model. The multiyear ANN model results were also checked with the actual drought intensity of government records and observation. The proposed system demonstrated 92% accuracy and matched the trend with the ground base stations, hence the ANN model demonstrates the potential of using as drought monitoring indicator capturing both meteorological and agricultural drought information. The output of the study can be utilized for contingency planning by state and local governments.

TI  - The potential of in-situ hyperspectral remote sensing for differentiating 12 banana genotypes grown in Uganda
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bananas and plantains provide food and income for more than 50 million smallholder farmers in East and Central African (ECA) countries. However, banana productivity generally achieves less than optimal yield potential ( < 30%) in most regions, including Uganda. Numerous studies have been undertaken to identify the key challenges that smallholder banana growers face at different stages of the banana value chain, with one of the main constraints being a lack of policy-relevant agricultural data. The World Bank (WB) initiated a methodological survey design aimed at identifying the distribution of banana varieties across a number of key Ugandan growing regions, at the individual household scale. To achieve this outcome a number of approaches including ground-based surveys, DNA tissue collection of selected banana plants and remote sensing were evaluated. For the remote sensing component, the set objectives were to develop statistical models from the hyperspectral reflectance properties of individual leaves that could differentiate typical ECA banana varieties, as well as their parentage (usage). The study also explored the potential of extrapolating the ground-based hyperspectral measures to high-resolution WorldView-3 (WV3) satellite imagery, therefore creating the potential of mapping the distribution of banana varieties at a regional scale. The DNA testing of 43 banana varieties propagated at the National Banana Research Program site at National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) research station in Kampala, Uganda, identified 12 genetically different varieties. A canonical powered partial least square (CPPLS) model developed from hyperspectral reflectance properties of the sampled banana leaves successfully differentiated BLU, BOG, GON, GRO and KAY genotypes. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was also evaluated to determine if spectral bands coinciding with those provided by WV3 data could segregate banana varieties. The results suggested that this was achievable and as such presents an opportunity to extrapolate the hyperspectral classifications to broader areas of land. The ability to spectrally differentiate these five genotypes has merit as they are not typical east African varieties. As such, identifying the distribution and density of these varieties across Uganda provides vital information to the banana breeders of NARO of where their new varieties are being disseminated too, data that has been previously difficult to obtain. Although the results from this pilot study indicated that not all banana varieties could be spectrally differentiated, the methodology developed and the positive results that were achieved do present remote sensing as a complimentary technology to the ongoing surveying of banana and other crop types grown within Ugandan household farming systems.

TI  - Estimation of Seasonal Sun-Induced Fluorescence Dynamics of Indian Tropical Deciduous Forests using SCOPE and Sentinel-2 MSI
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new approach to estimate spatial Sun-Induced Fluorescence (SIF) using the empirical relationship between simulated Canopy Chlorophyll Concentration (CCC) and simulated SIF. PROSAIL model [PROprietesSPECTrales (PROSPECT) and Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL) models] was used to simulate CCC. CCC maps were generated through an Automated Radiative Transfer Model Operator (ARTMO) using the PROSAIL model and Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) imagery. The Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry, and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model was used to simulate SIF emitted at 740 nm (SIF740), at 760 nm (SIF760), and top of canopy (SIFTOC) (640-850 nm). The SCOPE model, configured with the specification of the Sentinel-2 sensor, simulates SIF within the spectrum range of 640-850 nm. A non-linear logarithmic relationship (R-2 > 0.9, p < 0.05) was observed between simulated SIF and simulated CCC. Simulated CCC was linearly related to observed CCC with R-2 0.88, 0.92 and 0.89 and RMSE = 0.04, 0.17 and 0.09 gm/m(2) at p < 0.05 for summer, post-monsoon and early winter respectively. Whereas, the simulated CCC did not capture the full range of CCC variability for the post-monsoon season. Simulated SIF (SIF 760 ) was well correlated with SIF from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite with R-2 0.68, 0.73 and 0.73 (RMSE = < 1 W/m(2)/sr/mu m, p < 0.05) for the month of summer (April), pre-monsoon (May) and early winter season (November) respectively. Temporal SIF T-OC effectively captured the seasonal variability associated with the phenology of deciduous tree species. Among various Sentinel-2 MSI derived VIs, Red Edge NDVI (RENDVI) exhibited maximum sensitivity with SIF (highest monthly average R-2 > 0.6, p < 0.05). The spatial SIF would serve as an useful link between airborne /satellite derived SIF and in-situ fluorescence measurements to understand multiscale SIF variability of terrestrial vegetation.

TI  - I WALK THE LINE: COMMENT ON MIKAEL LEIDENHAG ON THEISTIC EVOLUTION AND INTELLIGENT DESIGN
T2  - ZYGON
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Is theistic evolution (TE) a philosophically tenable position? Leidenhag argues in his article "The Blurred Line between Theistic Evolution and Intelligent Design" that it is not, since it, Leidenhag claims, espouses a view of divine action that he labels "natural divine causation" (NDC), which makes God explanatory redundant. That is, in so far as TE does not invoke God as an additional cause alongside natural causes, it is untenable. Theistic evolutionists should therefore "reject NDC and affirm a more robust notion of divine agency." However, this will, Leidenhag claims, have the effect that theistic evolutionists "will move their position significantly closer to Intelligent Design," and so the line between TE and intelligent design is (or ought to be?) blurred. If successful, the criticism by Leidenhag would be bad news for theists who want to take science seriously and good news for those scientistic atheists according to whom there simply is no scientifically respectable way of combining theism and modern natural science in an overarching worldview. So, is TE stuck between a rock (of redundancy) and a hard place (of pseudo-science)? No, at least not due to the criticism offered by Leidenhag-but maybe religious naturalism is?

TI  - Evolution of the Geomagnetic Daily Variation at Tatuoca, Brazil, From 1957 to 2019: A Transition From Sq to EEJ
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnetic equator in the Brazilian region has moved over 1,100 km northward since 1957, passing the geomagnetic observatory Tatuoca (TTB), in northern Brazil, around 2013. We recovered and processed TTB hourly mean values of the geomagnetic field horizontal (H) component from 1957 until 2019, allowing the investigation of long-term changes in the daily variation due to the influence of secular variation, solar activity, season, and lunar phase. The H day-to-day variability and the occurrence of the counter electrojet at TTB were also investigated. Until the 1990s, ionospheric solar quiet currents dominated the quiet-time daily variation at TTB. After 2000, the magnitude of the daily variation became appreciably greater due to the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) contribution. The H seasonal and day-to-day variability increased as the magnetic equator approached, but their amplitudes normalized to the average daily variation remained at similar levels. Meanwhile, the amplitude of the lunar variation, normalized in the same way, increased from 5% to 12%. Within the EEJ region, the occurrence rate of the morning counter electrojet (MCEJ) increased with proximity to the magnetic equator, while the afternoon counter electrojet (ACEJ) did not. EEJ currents derived from CHAMP and Swarm satellite data revealed that the MCEJ rate varies with magnetic latitude within the EEJ region while the ACEJ rate is largely constant. Simulations with the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model based on different geomagnetic main field configurations suggest that long-term changes in the geomagnetic daily variation at TTB can be attributed to the main field secular variation.

TI  - Assessing the sensitivity of site index models developed using bi-temporal airborne laser scanning data to different top height estimates and grid cell sizes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Site productivity and forest growth are critical inputs into projecting wood volume and biomass accumulation over time. Site productivity, which is determined most commonly using site index models is also the primary criterion to consider many forest management decisions. Most of the previous research utilizing the remote sensing data for assessment of site index with forest height are based on the existing site index models developed with traditional dendrometric methods. However, these traditional methods are both time-consuming and expensive. This study demonstrates how bi-temporal airborne laser scanning (ALS) data collected within the 8-year period can be used for the development of site index models for Scots pine. The accuracy of ALS-derived models was assessed by comparison to the reference site index model developed based on data from stem analysis of 174 felled Scots pine trees. We evaluated the effect of different height metrics and grid cell size on the trajectory of site index models developed from ALS-derived measurements. Four methods of estimating top height from ALS point clouds were evaluated: 95th, 99th and 100th percentiles of point clouds and an individual tree detection approach (ITD). The models were created for a range of grid cell sizes: 10 x 10 m, 30 x 30 m, and 50 x 50 m. The results indicate that bitemporal ALS data could substitute traditional methods that have been applied to date for stand growth modelling. It was found that top height increment can be estimated by using both ITD approach and the 100th percentile of point cloud giving an appropriate top height (TH) increment estimation. Observed growth curves of reference trees agreed best with the trajectories that were obtained based on TH calculated using ITD method (R-2 = 0.892) and 100th percentile (R-2 = 0.797). In case of TH obtained from 99th and 95th percentiles only weak correlation was found: R-2 = 0.358 and R-2 = 0.213, accordingly. The height growth models developed with 95th and 99th percentiles of point cloud were not compatible with the reference model. We also found that grid cell size did not affect the model height growth trajectories. Irrespective of the grid cell size, the obtained model trajectories for the given method of TH estimation are nearly identical for cells 10 x 10, 30 x 30 and 50 x 50 m.

TI  - <i>POLDEN, POLNOCH</i> IN THE ASPECT OF NOMINATIVE DERIVATION (BASED ON MATERIAL FROM EASTERN SLAVIC LANGUAGES)
T2  - RUSIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the nominative-derivational potential of the words polden and polnoch in the East Slavic languages. The nominative-derivational potential is understood as the ability of lexical units to produce nominative means. The objectives of the study include identifying the composition of the indicated vocabulary and the range of concepts they express for Old Rus and modern times.The analysis has involved about 200 units of nomination and showed that the East Slavic languages significantly developed these word families, with their nominative-derivational capabilities mainly realized in folk speech through rich lexical synonymy. The comparison has revealed a greater power of the word family polden compared to potnoch, as well as a greater formal-semantic variety of its derivatives,which is explained by its numerous meanings due to the special role of daylight in human life. The semantics of the source words determined the nature of the nominative spheres marked with derivative units ("Time", "Nature", "Man"), reflecting the accumulated socio-worldview experience of closely related peoples, their close relationship. The structure and meaning of derivatives in different languages have both common and special features. The commonnes is expressed by the unimodel formations and their synonymy (Rus. opolnoch, Ukr. opivnich, Bls. aponachy, Rusin. opivnich, upunochi), specificity - by their formal and / meaningful uniqueness: Rus. mezhpotden 'south side, odnopoldenok light time of day', poldenoshnikbilking bucket, Ukr. adverbs pivdennishe, pivnichniche, Blr. names of mythological creatures, Rusin. dopoludnyar,'shepherd', upidpoludne' in the first half of the day' and others. Together, they demonstrate the nominative-derivational potential of the names of the light and dark day time climax, which developed, inter alia, under the mutual influence of closely related languages.

TI  - PENTECOSTALISM IN WESTERN UKRAINE: HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT AND CURRENT THEOLOGICAL CHALLENGES
T2  - OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON RELIGION IN EASTERN EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is twofold: firstly, to examine the origins and historical development of Christians of the Evangelical Faith (Pentecostals) in Western Ukraine from 1920 until today; secondly, to give an account of current theological problems of Western Ukrainian Pentecostalism and to explore its theological renewal, which began after the Revolution of Dignity (2013-2014). In doing so, the socio-political, ethnic, and religious contexts of the birth of Pentecostalism in Western Ukraine will be studied; these include the living conditions of Ukrainians in the Second Polish Republic, religious situation in Western Ukraine between the First and Second World Wars, historical development of the Pentecostal movement in this region, as well as the most significant theological influences that informed its doctrinal features and ethical patterns. Concerning the contemporary theological issues Pentecostalism faces in Ukraine, special attention will be paid to the process of the search for theological identity and worldview, development of educational institutions, and dramatic transitions in articulations of Pentecostalism in contemporary Ukraine. Discovering the heritage of other Christian traditions, through participation in the practical ecumenical initiatives and critical study of Pentecostal theology in a university setting, initiated a theological renewal among the younger generation of Pentecostals. Its features are concern for socially responsible theology, promotion of political activism, struggle for justice, and economic liberation. Theological and ethical search Pentecostalism in Ukraine was also stimulated by the dramatic events of the recent Ukrainian history.

TI  - Comparative analysis of different vegetation indices with respect to atmospheric particulate pollution using sentinel data
T2  - APPLIED COMPUTING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Several remote sensing based indices have been developed for studying vegetation using varied combinations of spectral bands. However, for regions like Gautam Buddha Nagar (GBN) district where the atmospheric condition is highly influenced by particulate matter loading and human-induced pollution, such indices produce faulty results because of the effects of scattering and absorption in the atmosphere. To reduce these impacts on vege-tation indices, atmospheric correction becomes essential. The general objective of this study is to evaluate two non-atmospherically corrected vegetation indices viz. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); Soil -Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and two atmospherically corrected vegetation indices viz. Enhanced Vegeta-tion Index (EVI); Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) with particular reference to GBN district which has high atmospheric aerosol presence. The spatio-temporal distribution of Aerosol Optical Density (AOD) and four vegetation indices for three months March (winter), June (summer) and October (post-monsoon) of year 2018 are analysed statistically. The mean AOD in all three seasons was observed to be above 0.05 and near to 1 indicating hazy conditions in the study area. Nine statistical image quality measures were employed such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), entropy, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Relative Average Spectral Error (RASE), Standard Deviation (SD), Correlation Coefficient (CC), ERGAS, Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and Mean Ab-solute Percentage Error (MAPE), respectively to determine the best suitable index to study vegetation in highly polluted areas. The results indicated that the ARVI represents more enhanced vegetation information with respect to quantifying temporal variation of vegetation in all three seasons, especially in areas with high atmospheric particulate pollution.

TI  - Effects of Green Space Patterns on Urban Thermal Environment at Multiple Spatial-Temporal Scales
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) pattern change due to human activity is one of the key components of regional and global climate change drivers. Urban green space plays a critical role in regulating urban thermal environment, and its cooling effect has received widespread attention in urban heat island (UHI) related studies. To fully understand the effects of the landscape pattern of an urban green space in regulating the urban thermal environment, it is necessary to further study the thermal effects of the landscape pattern of the urban green space and its characteristics under varied spatial-temporal scales. In this paper, we took the urban core area of Hangzhou City as the study area and analyzed the relationships between the landscape metrics of the urban green space and land surface temperature (LST) under varied spatial scales by using correlation analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) methods. Multi-temporal Landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor data were used to retrieve the spatial and temporal dynamics of LSTs in four consecutive seasons, and the land use classification was interpreted using SPOT (Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre) satellite imagery. The results showed that landscape dominance metrics-e.g., percentage of landscape (PLAND) and largest patch index (LPI)-were the most influential factors on urban LST. The spatial configuration of urban landscape, as represented by the fragmentation and aggregation and connectedness, also showed significant effects on LST. Furthermore, landscape pattern metrics had varied spatial scale effects on LST. Specifically, the landscape dominance metrics of urban forest showed an increased influence on LST as the spatial scale increased, while for urban water, the trend was opposite. These findings might have some practical significance for urban planning about how to spatially arrange urban green space to alleviate UHI at local and regional scales.

TI  - Changes and Predictions of Vertical Distributions of Global Light-Absorbing Aerosols Based on CALIPSO Observation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the vertical distribution of absorbing aerosols is crucial for radiative forcing assessment, and its quasi real-time prediction is one of the keys for the atmospheric correction of satellite remote sensing. In this study, we investigated the seasonal and interannual changes of the vertical distribution of global absorbing aerosols based on satellite measurement from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) and proposed a neural network (NN) model to predict the vertical distribution of global absorbing aerosols. Gaussian fitting was proposed to derive the maximum fitted particle number concentration (MFNC), altitude corresponding to MFNC (MFA), and standard deviation (MFASD) for vertical distribution of dust and smoke aerosols. Results showed that higher MFA values of dust and smoke aerosols mainly occurred over deserts and tropical savannas, respectively. For dust aerosol, the MFA is mainly observed at 0.5 to 6 km above deserts, and low MFNC values occur in boreal spring and winter while high values in summer and autumn. The MFA of smoke is systematically lower than that of dust, ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 km over tropical rainforest and grassland. Moreover, we found that the MFA of global dust and smoke had decreased by 2.7 m yr(-1)(statistical significancep= 0.02) and 1.7 m yr(-1)(p= 0.02) over 2007-2016, respectively. The MFNC of global dust has increased by 0.63 cm(-3)yr(-1)(p= 0.05), whereas that of smoke has decreased by 0.12 cm(-3)yr(-1)(p= 0.05). In addition, the determination coefficient (R-2) of the established prediction models for vertical distributions of absorbing aerosols were larger than 0.76 with root mean square error (RMSE) less than 1.42 cm(-3), which should be helpful for the radiative forcing evaluation and atmospheric correction of satellite remote sensing.

TI  - A New Model-Based Approach for the Evaluation of the Net Contribution of the European Union Rural Development Program to the Reduction of Water Abstractions in Agriculture
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is an essential driving force in water resources management and has a central role in the European Union's Rural Development Programme (RDP). In this study, the solution developed addresses countries characterised by relatively small farms, vast spatial and temporal variability and severe data scarcity. The proposed model-based approach is directly relevant to the evaluation of agricultural policies affecting water abstraction based on multisource data. The evaluation process utilises an entirely spatially distributed, continuous hydrological model. The model provides a gridded output of the main hydrological balance components, as well as vegetation water deficit and irrigation water requirements, on a daily temporal step on a country scale. It provides information at the farm level and facilitates the estimation of water abstractions in agriculture, taking into consideration all the pertinent information included in the Integrated Administration and Control System database that is maintained by RDPs in Europe. Remote sensing data also are used to validate crop patterns. The obtained results were analysed to estimate the net effect of the RDP to the reduction of water abstractions in agriculture. This work produces valuable information concerning the evaluation of agricultural policies and the assessment of land use, and climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.

T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - V453 Cyg is an eclipsing binary containing 14 and 11 M-circle dot stars in an eccentric short-period orbit. We have discovered beta Cep-type pulsations in this system using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data. We identify seven significant pulsation frequencies, between 2.37 and 10.51 d(-1), in the primary star. These include six frequencies that are separated by yet significantly offset from harmonics of the orbital frequency, indicating they are tidally perturbed modes. We have determined the physical properties of the system to high precision: V453 CygA is the first beta Cep pulsator with a precise mass measurement. The system is a vital tracer of the physical processes that govern the evolution of massive single and binary stars.

TI  - Reconstructing Three Decades of Land Use and Land Cover Changes in Brazilian Biomes with Landsat Archive and Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has a monitoring system to track annual forest conversion in the Amazon and most recently to monitor the Cerrado biome. However, there is still a gap of annual land use and land cover (LULC) information in all Brazilian biomes in the country. Existing countrywide efforts to map land use and land cover lack regularly updates and high spatial resolution time-series data to better understand historical land use and land cover dynamics, and the subsequent impacts in the country biomes. In this study, we described a novel approach and the results achieved by a multi-disciplinary network called MapBiomas to reconstruct annual land use and land cover information between 1985 and 2017 for Brazil, based on random forest applied to Landsat archive using Google Earth Engine. We mapped five major classes: forest, non-forest natural formation, farming, non-vegetated areas, and water. These classes were broken into two sub-classification levels leading to the most comprehensive and detailed mapping for the country at a 30 m pixel resolution. The average overall accuracy of the land use and land cover time-series, based on a stratified random sample of 75,000 pixel locations, was 89% ranging from 73 to 95% in the biomes. The 33 years of LULC change data series revealed that Brazil lost 71 Mha of natural vegetation, mostly to cattle ranching and agriculture activities. Pasture expanded by 46% from 1985 to 2017, and agriculture by 172%, mostly replacing old pasture fields. We also identified that 86 Mha of the converted native vegetation was undergoing some level of regrowth. Several applications of the MapBiomas dataset are underway, suggesting that reconstructing historical land use and land cover change maps is useful for advancing the science and to guide social, economic and environmental policy decision-making processes in Brazil.

TI  - MULTITEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF LAND USE AND COVERAGE IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF SENHOR DO BONFIM (BA), BRAZIL
T2  - GEOAMBIENTE ON-LINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the changes in land use and coverage associated with the growing demand for natural resources consolidates cause and effect relationships on a wide space-time scale. Thus, the understanding and monitoring of land use and coverage is fundamental for understanding the patterns of space organization and for the sustainable planning of environments and the definition of public policies. The change in the coverage of environments associated with the growing demand for natural resources induces terrestrial ecosystems to undergo several changes, consolidating cause and effect relationships on a wide space-time scale. Thus, the understanding and monitoring of land use and coverage is fundamental for understanding the patterns of space organization and for the sustainable planning of environments. In this sense, the objective of this work is to diagnose the main types of land use and coverage in the municipality of Senhor do Bonfim - BA over the years 1986, 1996, 2009 and 2017. For this diagnosis, orbital images were used as a basis of the LANDSAT Satellite, integrated and processed in a Geographic Information System environment, through the hybrid supervised classification. The results obtained attest to the predominance of the Caatinga Shrub and demonstrate the gradual growth of agricultural crops, urban areas and forests on hillsides. In the end, the work carried out intends to collaborate to studies of landscape evolution and to help better planning proposals for the use and coverage of municipalities located in tropical semi-arid regions.

TI  - Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (AAVs) as a Tool for Improving the Spatial Resolution of Snow Albedo Measurements in Mountainous Regions
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present technical advances and methods to measure effective broadband physical albedo in snowy mountain headwaters using a prototype dual-sensor pyranometer mounted on an Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (an AAV). Our test flights over snowy meadows and forested areas performed well during both clear sky and snowy/windy conditions at an elevation of similar to 2650 m above mean sea level (MSL). Our AAV-pyranometer platform provided high spatial (m) and temporal resolution (sec) measurements of effective broadband (310-2700 nm) surface albedo. The AAV-based measurements reveal spatially explicit changes in landscape albedo that are not present in concurrent satellite measurements from Landsat and MODIS due to a higher spatial resolution. This AAV capability is needed for validation of satellite snow albedo products, especially over variable montane landscapes at spatial scales of critical importance to hydrological applications. Effectively measuring albedo is important, as annually the seasonal accumulation and melt of mountain snowpack represent a dramatic transformation of Earth's albedo, which directly affects headwaters' water and energy cycles.

TI  - Exposure assessment of air pollution in Italy 2016-2019 for future studies on air pollution and COVID-19
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGIA & PREVENZIONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with adverse effects related both to short-term and long-term exposure. It has also recently been linked to COVID-19 pandemic. To analyze this possible association in Italy, studies on the entire area of the peninsula are necessary, both urban and non-urban areas. Therefore, there is a need for a homogeneous and applicable exposure assessment tool throughout the country.Experiences of high spatio-temporal resolution models for Italian territory already exist for PM estimation, using space-time predictors, satellite data, air quality monitoring data. This work completes the availability of these estimations for the most recent years (2016-2019) and is also applied to nitrogen oxides and ozone. The spatial resolution is 1x1 km. The model confirms its capability of capturing most of PM variability (R-2=0.78 and 0.74 for PM10 e PM2.5, respectively), and provides reliable estimates also for ozone (R-2=0.76); for NO2 the model performance is lower (R-2=0.57). The model estimations were used to calculate the PWE (population-weighted exposure) as the annual mean, weighted on the resident population in each individual cell, which represents the estimation of the Italian population's chronic exposure to air pollution.These estimates are ready to be used in studies on the association between chronic exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 pathology, as well as for investigations on the role of air pollution on the health of the Italian population.

TI  - Toward a High-Definition Remote Sensing Approach to the Study of Deserted Medieval Cities in the Near East
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The variability of currently available remote sensing datasets raises the question of which specific processing methods should be used for feature detection and feature extraction in both large and small-scale overhead images. In some cases, particular analyses allow us to carry out feature detection much more easily and effectively. The high-definition approach enables enhanced analysis of remote sensing data using all the spectral and graphical potential of multi-temporal ordered components. The deserted urban site of Kona Makhmur, Iraqi Kurdistan, is taken as a case study to demonstrate this fine-grained approach. The analysis described in this paper is based on the complementary use of a variety of overlayed imagery, augmented by data from terrestrial surveys. The resulting map substantially enhances our knowledge of the built environment and the economic and environmental conditions of this early Islamic-period site. Spectral analysis of raster images allowed us to detect the real shapes of features, and with the addition of digital elevation model (DEM) (created via unmanned aerial system (UAV)) we were also able to interpret the state of preservation of the overground relics and the diachronic dynamics of their degradation.

TI  - Albedo Impacts of Changing Agricultural Practices in the United States through Space-Borne Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service's Cropland Data Layer (CDL), the daily albedo of homogenous agricultural fields was derived for 51 common United States field crops by wavelength, sky-type, day of year, crop, and hardiness zone from 2015-2018. This study suggests that crop growth can result in changes in reflectivity up to a factor of 2 at most wavelengths and is unique per crop type in timing and range. Additionally, broadband impacts were studied and found to be less conspicuous than the individual wavelengths, but still significant. The results were used to evaluate a common method of cropland albedo estimation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for albedo, and this method was found to have some significant limitations dependent on wavelength and date. Finally, a database of surface albedo variations as a function of growing period is constructed for common field crops to the United States (as well as additional land-cover types). This database can be used to aid both satellite remote-sensing applications and long-term weather modeling efforts by providing a method for parameter adjustments based on crop driven albedo changes, including changes in cropland composition related to commodity markets and other external factors.

TI  - Victims, Perpetrators, or Both? The Vicious Cycle of Disrespect and Cynical Beliefs About Human Nature
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We tested how cynicism emerges and what maintains it. Cynicism is the tendency to believe that people are morally bankrupt and behave treacherously to maximize self-interest. Drawing on literatures on norms of respectful treatment, we proposed that being the target of disrespect gives rise to cynical views, which predisposes people to further disrespect. The end result is a vicious cycle: cynicism and disrespect fuel one another. Study 1's nationally representative survey showed that disrespect and cynicism are positively related to each other in 28 of 29 countries studied, and that cynicism's associations with disrespect were independent of (and stronger than) associations with lacking social support. Study 2 used a nationally representative longitudinal dataset, spanning 4 years. In line with the vicious cycle hypothesis, feeling disrespected and holding cynical views gave rise to each other over time. Five preregistered experiments (including 2 in the online supplemental materials) provided causal evidence. Study 3 showed that bringing to mind previous experiences of being disrespected heightened cynical beliefs subsequently. Studies 4 and 5 showed that to the extent that people endorsed cynical beliefs, others were inclined to treat them disrespectfully. Study 6's weeklong daily diary study replicated the vicious cycle pattern. Everyday experiences of disrespect elevated cynical beliefs and vice versa. Moreover, cynical individuals tended to treat others with disrespect, which in turn predicted more disrespectful treatment by others. In short, experiencing disrespect gives rise to cynicism and cynicism elicits disrespect from others, thereby reinforcing the worldview that caused these negative reactions in the first place.

M3  - Article
AB  - This publication is a response to the article published in the journal "Voprosy Psikhologii" by A.A. Melia "The notion of a defect in L.S. Vygotsky's works" (2020. N 2).The author of the article A.A. Melia attempts to consider the significance of L.S. Vygotsky's studies of impaired development for the formation of his scientific worldview as a psychologist and defectologist. In particular, A.A. Melia traces the logic of L.S. Vygotsky's movement from studying the situation of the Jewish people to studying the psychological characteristics of children with developmental disabilities, and comes to the conclusion that the key problem of L.S. Vygotsky's scientific work is the study of "excluded groups". Above all, the author A.A. Melia touches upon the question of the correlation between special and inclusive education and makes the following conclusion: "concept of a defect " (the author's term) by L.S. Vygotsky is the ideological basis for building of a system of inclusive education.The problems discussed by A.A.Melia are of fundamental importance both for understanding the place of L.S. Vygotsky's defectological research in the general system of his scientific views, and for finding ways to provide psychological and pedagogical assistance to children with developmental disabilities. It is also important to separate data that have a theoretical basis and have received practical confirmation from statements that are only hypothetical in nature, and therefore not devoid of subjective evaluation.The article summarizes some of the results of studies that are considered to be classical (A.S. Griboyedov, A.N. Graborov, V.P. Kashchenko, L.S. Vygotsky), as well as links to the works of modern scientists who continue these studies. Reference to these sources allows us to draw conclusions that differ from those contained in the work of A.A. Melia. At the same it is noted on the one hand the need and on the other the healing of the special work that reconsiders L.S. Vygodsky scientific contribution through the prism of tasks that face psychology and pedagogy as sciences and educational practice in XXI century.

TI  - Estimating PM<sub>2.5</sub>in Southern California using satellite data: factors that affect model performance
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Studies of PM(2.5)health effects are influenced by the spatiotemporal coverage and accuracy of exposure estimates. The use of satellite remote sensing data such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) in PM(2.5)exposure modeling has increased recently in the US and elsewhere in the world. However, few studies have addressed this issue in southern California due to challenges with reflective surfaces and complex terrain. Methods:We examined the factors affecting the associations with satellite AOD using a two-stage spatial statistical model. The first stage estimated the temporal PM2.5/AOD relationships using a linear mixed effects model at 1 km resolution. The second stage accounted for spatial variation using geographically weighted regression. Goodness of fit for the final model was evaluated by comparing the daily PM(2.5)concentrations generated by cross-validation (CV) with observations. These methods were applied to a region of southern California spanning from Los Angeles to San Diego. Results:Mean predicted PM(2.5)concentration for the study domain was 8.84 mu g m(-3). Linear regression between CV predicted PM(2.5)concentrations and observations had anR(2)of 0.80 and RMSE 2.25 mu g m(-3). The ratio of PM(2.5)to PM(10)proved an important variable in modifying the AOD/PM(2.5)relationship (beta = 14.79, p <= 0.001). Including this ratio improved model performance significantly (a 0.10 increase in CVR(2)and a 0.56 mu g m(-3)decrease in CV RMSE). Discussion:Utilizing the high-resolution MAIAC AOD, fine-resolution PM(2.5)concentrations can be estimated where measurements are sparse. This study adds to the current literature using remote sensing data to achieve better exposure data in the understudied region of Southern California. Overall, we demonstrate the usefulness of MAIAC AOD and the importance of considering coarser particles in dust prone areas.

TI  - Quantifying the Human Health Benefits of Using Satellite Information to Detect Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms and Manage Recreational Advisories in US Lakes
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant recent advances in satellite remote sensing allow environmental managers to detect and monitor cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHAB), and these capabilities are being used more frequently in water quality management. A quantitative estimate of the socioeconomic benefits generated from these new capabilities, known as an impact assessment, was missing from the growing literature on cyanoHABs and remote sensing. In this paper, we present an impact assessment framework to characterize the socioeconomic benefits of satellite remote sensing for detecting cyanoHABs and managing recreational advisories at freshwater lakes. We then apply this framework to estimate the socioeconomic benefits of satellite data that were used to manage a 2017 cyanoHAB event in Utah Lake. CyanoHAB events on Utah Lake can pose health risks to people who interact with the blooms through recreation. We find that the availability of satellite data yielded socioeconomic benefits by improving human health outcomes valued at approximately $370,000, though a sensitivity analysis reveals that this central estimate can vary significantly ($55,000-$1,057,000 in benefits) as a result of different assumptions regarding the time delay in posting a recreational advisory, the number of people exposed to the cyanoHAB, the number of people who experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and the cost per case of illness.

AB  - Reliable information of croplands has useful implications for agriculture. Based on random forest classifier, a cropland extraction method was developed. Multi-temporal image data of Landsat 8 were used for classifying crop and non-crop vegetation, since these data contain useful information. However, there is also large redundancy. To solve this problem, a new feature selection method was proposed in this paper. The primary innovativeness resides in a temporal feature selection criterion. A classification experiment was carried out to validate the proposed technique. The results showed that the proposed method can decrease feature redundancy with little cost on classification performance.

TI  - 'Patriot' games? Visions of a post-liberal international order and how to keep peace
T2  - NEW PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Declaring the so-called Liberal International Order, and Multilateralism in general, obsolete has become fashionable after the Russian invasion of Crimea and Eastern Ukraine in 2014. Among others, Russian and American leaders have emphasized competition and the uncompromising quest for the national interest as the basic and natural elements of inter-state relations. This worldview is reflected within societies throughout the world in populist nationalist movements and smacks of 'strongman politics' with its undertones of toxic masculinity, in which the only check against outright conflict is the balance of power.This worldview is, clearly, bad news for small states. Alternatives such as Xi Jinping's 'Community for the Shared Future of Mankind' would also, at closer look, seem to refer back to the primacy of national sovereignty - in this case that of one particular state, China. Instead, small states with open economies such as Finland would prioritize strengthening multilateral cooperation and the rules-based international order. Adapting the present international order rather than abandoning it wholesale is key to overcoming these challenges. That adaptation should be driven by a constructive critique of the current state of affairs. But we also need to look critically at the 'brave new worlds' that populists and strongmen are promoting. An international order based on the balance of power and a search for absolute national sovereignty will rob us of the ability to overcome global threats as well as to seize opportunities provided by global civil society activism and scientific innovations.

TI  - The underlying changes and predicting role of peripheral blood inflammatory cells in severe COVID-19 patients: A sentinel?
T2  - CLINICA CHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The underlying changes of peripheral blood inflammatory cells (PBICs) in COVID-19 patients are little known. Moreover, the risk factors for the underlying changes of PBICs and their predicting role in severe COVID-19 patients remain uncertain.Material and methods: This retrospective study including two cohorts: the main cohort enrolling 45 patients of severe type serving as study group, and the secondary cohort enrolling 12 patients of no-severe type serving as control group. The PBICs analysis was based on blood routine and lymphocyte subsets. The inflammatory cell levels were compared among patients according to clinical classifications, disease-associated phases, as well as one-month outcomes.Results: Compared with patients of non-severe type, the patients of severe type suffered from significantly decreased counts of lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, but increased counts of neutrophils. These PBICs alterations got improved in recovery phase, but persisted or got worse in aggravated phase. Compared with patients in discharged group, the patients in un-discharged/died group suffered from decreased counts of total T lymphocytes, CD4 + T lymphocytes, CD8 + T lymphocytes, as well as NK cells at 2 weeks after treatment. Clinical classification-critically severe was the independently risk factor for lymphopenia (OR = 7.701, 95%CI:1.265-46.893, P = 0.027), eosinopenia (OR = 5.595, 95%CI:1.008-31.054, P = 0.049), and worse one-month outcome (OR = 8.984; 95%CI:1.021-79.061, P = 0.048).Conclusion: Lymphopenia and eosinopenia may serve as predictors of disease severity and disease progression in COVID-19 patients, and enhancing the cellular immunity may contribute to COVID-19 treatment. Thus, PBICs might become a sentinel of COVID-19, and it deserves attention during COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Deriving the Magnetopause Position from the Soft X-Ray Image by Using the Tangent Fitting Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Imaging is one of the essential techniques to observe astronomical structures. While analyzing the observed images, it is a challenge in many scientific fields to reconstruct the 3-D structures from 2-D image(s). This report discusses this challenge in the context of reconstructing the structure of the Earth's magnetosphere from the X-ray image and presents a new technique. Specifically, it finds the optimum match of tangent directions derived from the X-ray image and the parameterized magnetopause function. We name this approach as the tangent fitting approach (TFA). TFA is further validated based on the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the X-ray images with different viewing geometries. TFA enables the reconstruction of the large-scale magnetopause from a single X-ray image, applicable to time-dependent situations such as cases during magnetic storms. It is also noted that TFA has a potential broader application to remote sensing data, for instance, energetic neutral atom (ENA) observations. Lastly, this new approach is compared with other magnetopause reconstruction approaches.

TI  - An Arctic Gridded Sea Surface Temperature Product Constructed from Spaceborne Radiometer Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A sea surface temperature (SST) record with a grid size of 0.1 degrees for the Arctic region is presented by fusing satellite-derived SST products from three passive-microwave (WindSat, AMSR-E and ASMR2) and four infrared (AVHRR, MODIS onboard Terra and Aqua, and VIIRS) radiometers (RMs). In this study, optimum interpolation (OI) is used to construct the dataset. The fused SST data of Arctic covering the regime north of 60 degrees N span from 2010 to 2018, available with the format of NetcDF. The accuracy of the gridded Arctic SST product was assessed with the drifting buoy measurements. Comparisons with the measurements from Argo buoys show that the Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE) of the fusion SST data obtained in this study is relatively stable with values ranging from 0.54 to 0.75 degrees C. This gridded SST data set is characterized with a high spatiotemporal resolution and an assured accuracy.

TI  - Nation-Scale Mapping of Coastal Aquaculture Ponds with Sentinel-1 SAR Data Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global rapid expansion of the coastal aquaculture industry has made great contributions to enhance food security, but has also caused a series of ecological and environmental issues. Sustainable management of coastal areas requires the explicit and efficient mapping of the spatial distribution of aquaculture ponds. In this study, a Google Earth Engine (GEE) application was developed for mapping coastal aquaculture ponds at a national scale with a novel classification scheme using Sentinel-1 time series data. Relevant indices used in the classification mainly include the water index, texture, and geometric metrics derived from radar backscatter, which were then used to segment and classify aquaculture ponds. Using this approach, we classified aquaculture ponds for the full extent of the coastal area in Vietnam with an overall accuracy of 90.16% (based on independent sample evaluation). The approach, enabling wall-to-wall mapping and area estimation, is essential to the efficient monitoring and management of aquaculture ponds. The classification results showed that aquaculture ponds are widely distributed in Vietnam's coastal area and are concentrated in the Mekong River Delta and Red River delta (85.14% of the total area), which are facing the increasing collective risk of climate change (e.g., sea level rise and salinity intrusion). Further investigation of the classification results also provides significant insights into the stability and deliverability of the approach. The water index derived from annual median radar backscatter intensity was determined to be efficient at mapping water bodies, likely due to its strong response to water bodies regardless of weather. The geometric metrics considering the spatial variation of radar backscatter patterns were effective at distinguishing aquaculture ponds from other water bodies. The primary use of GEE in this approach makes it replicable and transferable by other users. Our approach lays a solid foundation for intelligent monitoring and management of coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Searching for the Backfire Effect: Measurement and Design Considerations
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN MEMORY AND COGNITION
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most concerning notions for science communicators, fact-checkers, and advocates of truth, is the backfire effect; this is when a correction leads to an individual increasing their belief in the very misconception the correction is aiming to rectify. There is currently a debate in the literature as to whether backfire effects exist at all, as recent studies have failed to find the phenomenon, even under theoretically favorable conditions. In this review, we summarize the current state of the worldview and familiarity backfire effect literatures. We subsequently examine barriers to measuring the backfire phenomenon, discuss approaches to improving measurement and design, and conclude with recommendations for fact-checkers. We suggest that backfire effects are not a robust empirical phenomenon, and more reliable measures, powerful designs, and stronger links between experimental design and theory could greatly help move the field ahead.

TI  - Mosaicking Copernicus Sentinel-1 Data at Global Scale
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIG DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a processing chain for handling big volume of remotely sensing data for generating wide extent mosaics. More specifically, the data under consideration are level-1 ground range detected Sentinel-1 products with dual polarisation (VV+VH or HH+HV). Two approaches for a) distribution discretization accompanied by false color composition and b) image rendering and mosaicking are proposed. While these two components are necessary constituents of the presented mosaicking workflow, they can operate independently of each other. The design of the processing chain satisfies three objectives: i) contrasting derivative products of the input Sentinel-1 imagery such as the Global Human Settlement Layer, ii) adapting on a high-throughput computing system for fast execution, and iii) allowing potential extensions to more complex applications such as the image classification. Fast processing, process automation, incremental adjustment and information distinction are the main advantages of the proposed method. Elaboration and focus on these features are carried out during the presentation of the results.

TI  - Ice-Cliff Morphometry in Identifying the Surge Phenomenon of Tidewater Glaciers (Spitsbergen, Svalbard)
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, 110 tidewater glaciers from Spitsbergen were studied to characterize the frontal zone using morphometric indicators. In addition, their time variability was also determined based on features of the active phase of glacier surges. Landsat satellite imagery and topographic maps were used for digitalization of the ice-cliffs line. In recent years (2014-2017) all the glaciers studied can be thus classified as: stagnant (33%), retreating and deeply recessing (33%), starting to move forward/fulfilling the frontal zone (23%), and surging (11%). Indicators of the glacier frontal zone (CfDandCfE) allow to identify the beginning and the end of the active phase through changes in their values by ca. 0.05-0.06 by the year and get even bigger for large glaciers as opposed to typical interannual differences within the limits of +/- 0.01 to 0.02. The active phase lasted an average of 6-10 years. The presence of a "glacier buttress system" and the "pointed arch" structure of the ice-cliff seem to be an important factor regulating the tidewater glacier stability.

TI  - Detection of the first appearance of SARS-CoV-2 virus in Hungary based on retrospective testing of respiratory samples
T2  - ORVOSI HETILAP
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In Hungary, SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in the swab samples of two Iranian patients on March 4, 2020. After finding the first positive cases, the question arose whether the virus had entered Hungary and caused infections before this date. Before March 4, 2020, except for the two above-mentioned samples, none of the 224 swab samples received specifically for SARS-CoV-2 tested positive.Aim: The National Reference Laboratory for Respiratory Viruses of the National Public Health Center aimed to carry out a retrospective study of the swab and other samples taken for testing respiratory virus infections between January 1, and April 19, 2020 sent by sentinel physicians within the influenza surveillance for diagnostic purposes.Method: For the study, we used swab samples taken weekly by sentinel physicians of the influenza surveillance service, and other samples received for diagnostic purposes. Tests were performed using real-time PCR. Results: All the 465 swab samples sent by sentinel physicians were found to be SARS-CoV-2 negative. Also, of the 551 samples collected for diagnostic reasons of other respiratory viruses, no SARS-CoV-2 positive was found among those taken before March 4.Conclusion: Based on our data, it is very likely that prior to the first cases diagnosed on March 4, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 did not cause clinically symptomatic infections in Hungary.

TI  - SOX10 is as specific as S100 protein in detecting metastases of melanoma in lymph nodes and is recommended for sentinel lymph node assessment
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy remains crucial for melanoma staging. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Melanoma Group recommends performing immunohistochemical stainings for reproducible identification of melanoma metastases. S100 protein (pS100) is a commonly used melanocytic antigen because of its high sensitivity in spite of relatively low specificity. SRY-related HMG-box 10 protein (SOX10) is a transcription factor characterising neural crest-derived cells. It is uniformly expressed mostly in the nuclei of melanocytes, neural, and myoepithelial cells. Pathologists sometimes prefer SOX10 as a melanoma marker, but it has not yet been investigated on a large-scale to confirm that it is reliable and recommendable for routine SLN evaluation.Methods: Four hundred one treatment-naive lymph node (LN) metastatic melanomas were included in high-density tissue microarrays and were assessed for the presence of SOX10 and pS100 by immunohistochemistry. The slides were digitalised, shared and evaluated by a panel of experienced melanoma pathologists.Results: The vast majority of melanomas were double-positive for pS100 and SOX10 (93.2%); a small percentage of the cases (3.9%) were double-negative melanomas. Discordance between the two markers was observed: 1.9% pS100(-)/SOX10(+) and 0.75% pS100+)/SOX10-). SOX10 was not expressed by immune cell types in the LN, resulting in a less controversial interpretation of the staining.Conclusions: SOX10 is as equally specific as pS100 for the detection of melanoma metastases in LNs. The interpretation of SOX10 staining is highly reproducible among different centres and different pathologists because of the absence of staining of immune cells. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - S3MPC: Improvement on Inland Water Tracking and Water Level Monitoring from the OLTC Onboard Sentinel-3 Altimeters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B satellites were launched, respectively, on 16 February 2016 and 25 April 2018 as part of the European Copernicus program. The Sentinel-3 Surface Topography Mission makes use of the altimeter instruments onboard Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B to provide elevation measurements not only of the ocean water level but also of the inland waters and ice caps. For the first time, the altimeters onboard Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B are operated in Synthetic Aperture Radar mode over all Earth surfaces. They also benefit from elevation priors (the Open-Loop Tracking Command) allowing them to precisely position their receiving window to track the backscattered signal from the inland water targets to be monitored rather than relying on the traditional Closed-Loop tracking mode. This paper makes use of the Sentinel-3A/Sentinel-3B tandem phase to assess the benefits of the Open-Loop tracking mode compared to Closed-Loop. Longer time series are also used to highlight the improvements in terms of the percentage of points over which the altimeter hooks on water surfaces and water surface height estimation brought by the switch of Sentinel-3A from the Closed-Loop to Open-Loop tracking mode as well as the successive Open-Loop Tracking Command updates. In particular, it is shown that from a Level-3 water level product service perspective, the increase in the number of water bodies with valid water surface height estimates is of the order of 25% in Open-Loop with respect to Closed-Loop with similar precision. It is also emphasized that the Open-Loop Tracking Command update onboard Sentinel-3A from v. 4.2 to v. 5.0 yielded a 30% increase in the number of water bodies over which valid water surface height could be estimated. Eventually, the importance of knowing whether a water target was associated with a fine-tuned Open-Loop Tracking Command or an interpolated one is stressed and the recommendation to provide such a flag in the Sentinel-3 Level2 Payload Data Ground Segment products is emitted.

TI  - Evaluating Post-Fire Vegetation Recovery in Cajander Larch Forests in Northeastern Siberia Using UAV Derived Vegetation Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to monitor post-fire ecological responses and associated vegetation cover change is crucial to understanding how boreal forests respond to wildfire under changing climate conditions. Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer an affordable means of monitoring post-fire vegetation recovery for boreal ecosystems where field campaigns are spatially limited, and available satellite data are reduced by short growing seasons and frequent cloud cover. UAV data could be particularly useful across data-limited regions like the Cajander larch (Larix cajanderi Mayr.) forests of northeastern Siberia that are susceptible to amplified climate warming. Cajander larch forests require fire for regeneration but are also slow to accumulate biomass post-fire; thus, tall shrubs and other understory vegetation including grasses, mosses, and lichens dominate for several decades post-fire. Here we aim to evaluate the ability of two vegetation indices, one based on the visible spectrum (GCC; Green Chromatic Coordinate) and one using multispectral data (NDVI; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), to predict field-based vegetation measures collected across post-fire landscapes of high-latitude Cajander larch forests. GCC and NDVI showed stronger linkages with each other at coarser spatial resolutions e.g., pixel aggregated means with 3-m, 5-m and 10-m radii compared to finer resolutions (e.g., 1-m or less). NDVI was a stronger predictor of aboveground carbon biomass and tree basal area than GCC. NDVI showed a stronger decline with increasing distance from the unburned edge into the burned forest. Our results show NDVI tended to be a stronger predictor of some field-based measures and while GCC showed similar relationships with the data, it was generally a weaker predictor of field-based measures for this region. Our findings show distinguishable edge effects and differentiation between burned and unburned forests several decades post-fire, which corresponds to the relatively slow accumulation of biomass for this ecosystem post-fire. These findings show the utility of UAV data for NDVI in this region as a tool for quantifying and monitoring the post-fire vegetation dynamics in Cajander larch forests.

TI  - A modified flexible spatiotemporal data fusion model
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing spatiotemporal fusion models blend multi-source images of different spatial resolutions to create synthetic images with high resolution and frequency, contributing to time series research where high quality observations are not available with sufficient frequency. However, existing models are vulnerable to spatial heterogeneity and land cover changes, which are frequent in human-dominated regions. To obtain quality time series of satellite images in a human-dominated region, this study developed the Modified Flexible Spatial-temporal Data Fusion (MFSDAF) approach based on the Flexible Spatial-temporal Data Fusion (FSDAF) model by using the enhanced linear regression (ELR). Multiple experiments of various land cover change scenarios were conducted based on both actual and simulated satellite images, respectively. The proposed MFSDAF model was validated by using the correlation coefficient (r), relative root mean square error (RRMSE), and structural similarity (SSIM), and was then compared with the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) and FSDAF models. Results show that in the presence of significant land cover change, MFSDAF showed a maximum increase in r, RRMSE, and SSIM of 0.0313, 0.0109 and 0.049, respectively, compared to FSDAF, while ESTARFM performed best with less temporal difference of in the input images. In conditions of stable landscape changes, the three performance statistics indicated a small advantage of MFSDAF over FSDAF, but were 0.0286, 0.0102, 0.0317 higher than for ESTARFM, respectively. MFSDAF showed greater accuracy of capturing subtle changes and created high-precision images from both actual and simulated satellite images.

TI  - Changes in the Seasonality of Ethiopian Highlands Climate and Implications for Crop Growth
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rain-fed agriculture in North-West (NW) Ethiopia is seasonally modulated, and our objective is to isolate past and future trends that influence crop growth. Statistical methods are applied to gauge-interpolated, reanalysis, and satellite data to evaluate changes in the annual cycle and long-term trends. The June to September wet season has lengthened due to the earlier arrival and later departure of rains. Meteorological composites relate this spreading to local southerly winds and a dry-south/wet-north humidity dipole. At the regional scale, an axis of convection over the Rift Valley (35E) is formed by westerly waves on 15S and an anticyclone over Asia 30N. Coupled Model Intercomparsion Project (CMIP5) Hadley2 data assimilated by the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparision Project (ISIMIP) hydrological models are used to evaluate projected soil moisture and potential evaporation over the 21st century. May and October soil moisture is predicted to increase in the future, but trends are weak. In contrast, the potential evaporation is rising and may put stress on the land and water resources. A lengthening of the growing season could benefit crop yields across the NW Ethiopian highlands.

TI  - Digital mapping of Philip model parameters for prediction of water infiltration at the watershed scale in a semi-arid region of Iran
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling water infiltration rate at the regional scale with the ruler of calcareous conditions is important for a better understanding of infiltration processes and infiltration modeling development. The aim of the present study was to derive and evaluate a digital soil mapping of the Philip model parameters (sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity) to predict water infiltration using environmental data in calcareous soils in northwest Iran. The infiltration data was carried out at 92 locations at the field scale with three replications. At each location, the various basic soil properties were measured, and environmental data obtained from attributes was derived from digital elevation models and remote sensing data. The feed-forward multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks (ANN) model was used to estimate sorptivity (S) and hydraulic conductivity (K-s). For the first type of prediction models, the measured basic soil properties, and for the second type, the measured basic soil properties and principal components (PCs) based on the environmental data were used as input data. The results showed a higher performance of ANN models developed based on environmental data (soil plus PCs data) than that developed based on only soil data for predicting both Philip infiltration model parameters. The R-2 criteria was improved by 0.18 (from 39 to 57) for S-parameter and by 0.15 (from 0.44 to 0.59) for K-s-parameter prediction using ANN models developed based on environmental data. It was concluded that attributes derived from DEMs and remotely sensed information could be a potential environmental data for improving Philip infiltration model parameters and developing high quality infiltration data maps. That would be a first step in site-specific soil utilization, management and protection of the environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Stud of Canopy Urban Heat Island of Baghdad, Iraq
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on different two sets of data such as Landsat satellite imageries and daily air temperatures at 2 m high, canopy urban heat island (CUHI) phenomenon was investigated over Baghdad city for time span of three years: 2008, 2013 and 2019. The detection of changes in built-up areas was carried out to extract built-up index using ArcGIS 10.4.1 software with an overall accuracy of 94%. The results show that the built-up areas in the surface of the city have been increased from 621.7 km(2) in 2008 to 727.3 km(2) in 2019. This increase with high population density produced adverse thermal effects on atmospheric environment represented by CUHI. This was verified by analyzing daily, season and annual means of air temperature at the same years above measured at two different places: 1) urban site located at city center (Mustansiriyah University) and 2) rural site at the countryside of the city (International Baghdad Airport). Using the difference in daily temperatures between the two sites, the intensity of CUHI is computed. The results showed that the maximum daily CUHI is found in summer month (July) in 2019 with value 3.4 degrees C, while the annual means are ranged from 1.5 (in both 2008 and 2013) to 2.4 degrees C (in 2019). Finally, CUHI intensity is related with population density and built-up index in nonlinear variation.

TI  - Spatial Configuration and Extent Explains the Urban Heat Mitigation Potential due to Green Spaces: Analysis over Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green space (UGS) is considered a mitigative intervention for urban heat. While increasing the UGS coverage is expected to reduce the urban heat, studies on the effects of UGS configuration have produced inconsistent results. To investigate this inconsistency further, this study conducted a multi-spatial and multi-temporal resolution analysis in the Addis Ababa city metropolitan area for assessing the relationship between UGS patterns and land surface temperature (LST). Landsat images were used to generate land cover and LST maps. Regression models were developed to investigate whether controlling for the proportion of the green area (PGS), fragmentation, shape, complexity, and proximity distance can affect surface temperature. Results indicated that the UGS patches with aggregated, regular and simple shapes and connectivity throughout the urban landscape were more effective in decreasing the LST as compared to the fragmented and complicated spatial patterns. This finding highlighted that in addition to increasing the amount of UGS, optimizing the spatial structure of UGS, could be an effective and useful action to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) impacts. Changing the spatial size had a significant influence on the interconnection between LST and UGS patterns as well. It also noted that the spatial arrangement of UGS was more sensitive to spatial scales than that of its composition. The relationship between the spatial configuration of UGS and LST could be changed when applying different statistical methods. This result underlined the importance of controlling the effects of the share of green spaces when calculating the impacts of the spatial configuration of UGS on LST. Furthermore, the study highlighted that applying different statistical approaches, spatial scale, and coverage of UGS can help determine the effectiveness of the association between LST and UGS patterns. These outcomes provided new insights regarding the inconsistent findings from earlier studies, which might be a result of the different approaches considered. Indeed, these findings are expected to be of help more broadly for city planning and urban heat mitigation.

TI  - Unsupervised Parameterization for Optimal Segmentation of Agricultural Parcels from Satellite Images in Different Agricultural Landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image segmentation is a cost-effective way to obtain information about the sizes and structural composition of agricultural parcels in an area. To accurately obtain such information, the parameters of the segmentation algorithm ought to be optimized using supervised or unsupervised methods. The difficulty in obtaining reference data makes unsupervised methods indispensable. In this study, we evaluated an existing unsupervised evaluation metric that minimizes a global score (GS), which is computed by summing up the intra-segment uniformity and inter-segment dissimilarity within a segmentation output. We modified this metric and proposed a new metric that uses absolute difference to compute the GS. We compared this proposed metric with the existing metric in two optimization approaches based on the Multiresolution Segmentation (MRS) algorithm to optimally delineate agricultural parcels from Sentinel-2 images in Lower Saxony, Germany. The first approach searches for optimal scale while keeping shape and compactness constant, while the second approach uses Bayesian optimization to optimize the three main parameters of the MRS algorithm. Based on a reference data of agricultural parcels, the optimal segmentation result of each optimization approach was evaluated by calculating the quality rate, over-segmentation, and under-segmentation. For both approaches, our proposed metric outperformed the existing metric in different agricultural landscapes. The proposed metric identified optimal segmentations that were less under-segmented compared to the existing metric. A comparison of the optimal segmentation results obtained in this study to existing benchmark results generated via supervised optimization showed that the unsupervised Bayesian optimization approach based on our proposed metric can potentially be used as an alternative to supervised optimization, particularly in geographic regions where reference data is unavailable or an automated evaluation system is sought.

TI  - New JAXA High-Resolution Land Use/Land Cover Map for Vietnam Aiming for Natural Forest and Plantation Forest Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly detailed and accurate forest maps are important for various applications including forest monitoring, forestry policy, climate change, and biodiversity loss. This study demonstrates a comprehensive and geographically transferable approach to produce a 12 category high-resolution land use/land cover (LULC) map over mainland Vietnam in 2016 by remote sensing data. The map included several natural forest categories (evergreen broadleaf, deciduous (mostly deciduous broadleaf), and coniferous (mostly evergreen coniferous)) and one category representing all popular plantation forests in Vietnam such as acacia (Acacia mangium,Acacia auriculiformis,Acaciahybrid), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus), rubber (Hevea brasiliensis), and others. The approach combined the advantages of various sensor data by integrating their posterior probabilities resulting from applying a probabilistic classifier (comprised of kernel density estimation and Bayesian inference) to each datum individually. By using different synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images (PALSAR-2/ScanSAR, PALSAR-2 mosaic, Sentinel-1), optical images (Sentinel-2, Landsat-8) and topography data (AW3D30), the resultant map achieved 85.6% for the overall accuracy. The major forest classes including evergreen broadleaf forests and plantation forests had a user's accuracy and producer's accuracy ranging from 86.0% to 95.3%. Our map identified 9.55 x 10(6)ha (+/- 0.16 x 10(6)ha) of natural forests and 3.89 x 10(6)ha (+/- 0.11 x 10(6)ha) of plantation forests over mainland Vietnam, which were close to the Vietnamese government's statistics (with differences of less than 8%). This study's result provides a reliable input/reference to support forestry policy and land sciences in Vietnam.

TI  - High Spatiotemporal Resolution Mapping of Surface Water in the Southwest Poyang Lake and Its Responses to Climate Oscillations
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately quantifying spatiotemporal changes in surface water is essential for water resources management, nevertheless, the dynamics of Poyang Lake surface water areas with high spatiotemporal resolution, as well as its responses to climate change, still face considerable uncertainties. Using the time series of Sentinel-1 images with 6- or 12-day intervals, the Sentinel-1 water index (SWI), and SWI-based water extraction model (SWIM) from 2015 to 2020 were used to document and study the short-term characteristics of southwest Poyang Lake surface water. The results showed that the overall accuracy of surface water area was satisfactory with an average of 91.92%, and the surface water area ranged from 129.06 km(2)on 2 March 2017 to 1042.57 km(2)on 17 July 2016, with significant intra- and inter-month variability. Within the 6-day interval, the maximum change of lake area was 233.42 km(2)(i.e., increasing from 474.70 km(2)up to 708.12 km(2)). We found that the correlation coefficient between the water area and the 45-day accumulated precipitation reached to 0.75 (p< 0.001). Moreover, a prediction model was built to predict the water area based on climate records. These results highlight the significance of high spatiotemporal resolution mapping for surface water in the erratic southwest Poyang Lake under a changing climate. The automated water extraction algorithm proposed in this study has potential applications in delineating surface water dynamics at broad geographic scales.

TI  - Development of a Novel Floating Water Spectral Measurement System Based on Skylight-Blocked Approach
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been a long-standing and challenging goal to precisely measure water-leaving radiance (Lw) in ocean color remote sensing. Conventional approaches like in-water profile method, above-water method and other water measurement methods cannot directly measure Lw. Thus, they demand complex post-measurement processes, which cause many uncontrollable factors. Skylight-blocked approach (SBA), proposed by Zhongping Lee in 2013, was an innovative method to directly measure L-w, which can avoid uncertainties caused by post-measurement processes. However, no water spectral measurement system based on SBA has been developed so far. It is of great theoretical and practical significance to develop and test such equipment. Based on SBA, a water spectral measurement system was developed in this study. Firstly, the principles of the field water-spectrum measurement method, SBA is introduced. Then, the hardware structure and system design of the system are described in detail. The field experiment in Pearl River Estuary (113 degrees 32'38 '' E, 22 degrees 25'43 '' N) was carried out on September 20, 2017 to test the continuous measurement ability of the system. The system can measure Lw and downward irradiance of water (E-s) directly and synchronously and then calculated the R-rs. The coefficients of variation (CV) of them are less than which basically proves the effectiveness of the water spectral measurement system in L-w measurement. The measurements results of the system are in good agreement with those of Maya2000 Pro synchronous. The continuous observation experiments show the stability of measurements and the ability to track the change of optical characteristics of water. The existing problems and future development prospects are pointed out, such as self-shading correction, data quality control, high frequency measurement, buoy tilts recording, multi-factor joint measurement, long time series and large range networking, etc. To summarize, the water spectral measurement system based on SBA called the Floating Optical Buoy (FOBY) can measure L-w directly in high the frequency of minutes which can track the rapid dynamic change of water optical characteristics. It is expected to improve the matching efficiency between in-situ measurement data and satellite remote sensing data. Based on the system, big data sets of water spectral can be obtained by means of the network. It is conducive to greatly improve the application potential of various satellite data on ocean color remote sensing.

TI  - Mapping Urban Tree Cover Changes Using Object-Based Convolution Neural Network (OB-CNN)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban trees provide social, economic, environmental and ecosystem services benefits that improve the liveability of cities and contribute to individual and community wellbeing. There is thus a need for effective mapping, monitoring and maintenance of urban trees. Remote sensing technologies can effectively map and monitor urban tree coverage and changes over time as an efficient and low-cost alternative to field-based measurements, which are time consuming and costly. Automatic extraction of urban land cover features with high accuracy is a challenging task, and it demands object based artificial intelligence workflows for efficiency and thematic accuracy. The aim of this research is to effectively map urban tree cover changes and model the relationship of such changes with socioeconomic variables. The object-based convolutional neural network (CNN) method is illustrated by mapping urban tree cover changes between 2005 and 2015/16 using satellite, Google Earth imageries and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) datasets. The training sample for CNN model was generated by Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) using thresholds in a Canopy Height Model (CHM) and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The tree heatmap produced from the CNN model was further refined using OBIA. Tree cover loss, gain and persistence was extracted, and multiple regression analysis was applied to model the relationship with socioeconomic variables. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of tree cover extraction was 96% and 0.77 for 2005 images and 98% and 0.93 for 2015/16 images, indicating that the object-based CNN technique can be effectively implemented for urban tree coverage mapping and monitoring. There was a decline in tree coverage in all suburbs. Mean parcel size and median household income were significantly related to tree cover loss (R-2= 58.5%). Tree cover gain and persistence had positive relationship with tertiary education, parcel size and ownership change (gain: R-2= 67.8% and persistence: R-2= 75.3%). The research findings demonstrated that remote sensing data with intelligent processing can contribute to the development of policy input for management of tree coverage in cities.

TI  - Semi-Automatic Building Extraction from WorldView-2 Imagery Using Taguchi Optimization
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the complex spectral and spatial structures of remotely sensed images, the delineation of land use/land cover classes using conventional approaches is a challenging task. This article tackles the problem of seeking optimal parameters of multi-resolution segmentation for a classification task using WorldView-2 imagery. Taguchi optimization was applied to search optimal parameters using the plateau objective function (POF) and quality rate (Qr) as fitness criteria. Analysis of variance was also used to estimate the contributions of the parameters for POF and Qr, separately. The scale parameter was the most effective one, with contribution levels of 87.45% and 56.87% for POF and Qr, respectively. Linear regression and support-vector regression methods were used to predict the results of the experiment. Test results revealed that Taguchi optimization was more effective than linear regression and support-vector regression for predicting POF and Qr values.

TI  - Land Cover Classification in Mangrove Ecosystems Based on VHR Satellite Data and Machine Learning-An Upscaling Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests grow in the inter-tidal areas along coastlines, rivers, and tidal lands. They are highly productive ecosystems and provide numerous ecological and economic goods and services for humans. In order to develop programs for applying guided conservation and enhancing ecosystem management, accurate and regularly updated maps on their distribution, extent, and species composition are needed. Recent advances in remote sensing techniques have made it possible to gather the required information about mangrove ecosystems. Since costs are a limiting factor in generating land cover maps, the latest remote sensing techniques are advantageous. In this study, we investigated the potential of combining Sentinel-2 and Worldview-2 data to classify eight land cover classes in a mangrove ecosystem in Iran with an area of 768 km(2). The upscaling approach comprises (i) extraction of reflectance values from Worldview-2 images, (ii) segmentation based on spectral and spatial features, and (iii) wall-to-wall prediction of the land cover based on Sentinel-2 images. We used an upscaling approach to minimize the costs of commercial satellite images for collecting reference data and to focus on freely available satellite data for mapping land cover classes of mangrove ecosystems. The approach resulted in a 65.5% overall accuracy and a kappa coefficient of 0.63, and it produced the highest accuracies for deep water and closed mangrove canopy cover. Mapping accuracies improved with this approach, resulting in medium overall accuracy even though the user's accuracy of some classes, such as tidal zone and shallow water, was low. Conservation and sustainable management in these ecosystems can be improved in the future.

AB  - The main objective of this article is to show and give visibility to the intermediate agents of the circulation of literary works, and particularly to a translator forgotten by French and Brazilian literary history, Adrien Delpech. I intend, on the one hand, to theorize on the problematic of translation while (im)migrating, since it is under the prism and from this image and worldview that Machado de Assis was initially translated into French. On the other hand, I make a brief synchronic and diachronic history of the first translations of the stories and novels by Machado de Assis in the world for all languages and cultures. And, finally, I analyze the profile of Adrien Delpech, one of the first translators of Machado, responsible for the dissemination of the author not only in the French literary system, but also in other cultural literary systems.

TI  - Good living and family farming in the Totonacapan of Puebla, Mexico
T2  - ICONOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The search for an answer to the contemporary civilizational crisis, makes it necessary to examine recent proposals originated in Native American ideas about Good Living and forms of social responsibility based on an adequate relationship between human societies and nature. This document describes part of the traditional practices of the Mexican indigenous Totonac group in the municipality of Huehuala, Puebla. Their holistic scientific approach to food production is highlighted, together with established complementarily relations between families and reciprocity towards spiritual entities. These are seen as crucial in maintaining harmony between a productive habitat and communal existence. Participant observation, systematical interviews and surveys were employed as the main methods which allowed the recognition of the sociocultural symbolisms with which the people of Huehuetla interpret their known world. Thus, Tapaxuwan Latamat (Life in Happiness), -the central notion of the Totonac life-, is described and is shown to be buttressed by the experience of coexisting, working, and celebrating the rituality inherent in Nature. This allows them to remain aware of the existence of a living and sacred territory, where even agricultural and livestock practices are exercised as relationships of coexistence and respect of humans with the entities that inhabit and care for the environment and safeguard their sustenance.

TI  - Forest Cover Change Pattern after the Intervention of Community Forestry Management System in the Mid-Hill of Nepal: A Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An account of widespread degradation and deforestation in Nepal has been noticed in various literature sources. Although the contribution of community forests (CF) on the improvement of forest cover and condition in the Mid-hill of Nepal is positive, detailed study to understand the current situation seems important. The study area (Tanahun District) lies in the Gandaki Province of western Nepal. The objective of this study was to estimate the forest cover change over the specified period and to identify factors influencing the change. We used Landsat images from the years 1976, 1991, and 2015 to classify land use and land cover. We considered community perception in addition to the forest cover map to understand the different causes of forest cover change. Forest cover decreased from 1976 to 1991 annually at a rate of 0.96%. After 1991, the forest increased annually at a rate of 0.63%. The overall forest cover in the district regained its original status. Factors related to increasing forest cover were emigration, occupation shift, agroforestry practices, as well as particularly by plantation on barren lands, awareness among forest users, and conservation activities conducted by local inhabitants after the government forest was handed over to community members as a community forest management system.

TI  - "Orthodox yet Modern": Herman Bavinck and Hegel's Speculative Philosophy
T2  - LOGOS & PNEUMA-CHINESE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Herman Bavinck's use of German idealist vocabularies has been a debated topic in the secondary literature. An older Dutch paradigm from around the 1970s, under the influence of Jan Veenhof's study on the German idealist origins of Bavinck's organicism, tends to describe the dogmatician's use of idealist categories as fundamentally at odds with his commitment to confessional Reformed theology. Recent Anglophone interpreters have tended to emphasize the orthodoxy of Bavinck's Reformed faith, and see his employment of idealist terms as primarily polemical in purpose. This article adopts the "orthodox yet modern" and "Reformed eclecticism" trajectories set forth respectively by Cory Brock and Nathaniel Gray Sutanto, in order to examine the role of G. W. F. Hegel's speculative logic in Bavinck's thought. The thesis is that while Bavinck disagrees fundamentally with Hegel's panlogistic starting-point in human consciousness, he is in fact appreciative of important aspects of Hegel's speculative philosophy, and thus uses them to correct the substantialist tendencies in traditional Reformed theology.

TI  - Quantifying local coastal stewardship reveals motivations, models and engagement strategies
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The human footprint on earth is now so great that we must become environmental stewards. To encourage stewardship and achieve better conservation outcomes, research is needed to connect practice with sound theory, and to empirically measure stewardship so we can identify its predictors and motivators.In this study, we use mixed methods to develop a new quantitative indicator for local environmental stewardship in a coastal context. We interviewed 111 people in eastern Australia about their knowledge and use of the coast and extracted information on seven generalised stewardship actions. We combined these into a single indicator which allowed us to evaluate and compare stewardship levels between participants and develop quantitative models. We found that stewardship was predicted by four traits: attraction to marine wildlife, self-identifying as local, size of local social network, and norms regarding informal enforcement. High-stewardship individuals exhibited eco-centric and anthropocentric worldviews and were motivated by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We combined these with stewardship actions in a refined model which highlights the importance of people, policy and place in environmental stewardship.We believe this is the first study to quantify stewardship behaviour and its motivating factors in a broad social-ecological context spanning both terrestrial and marine realms. Our research allows stewardship to be measured, modelled and analysed via a transferable indicator. This enables a deeper understanding of local environmental stewardship and the factors that predict and motivate it and allows us to propose practical strategies to engage people to improve stewardship and conservation outcomes.

TI  - Flood Inundation Mapping by Combining GNSS-R Signals with Topographical Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission collects near-global hourly, pseudo-randomly distributed Global Navigation Satellite System - Reflectometry (GNSS-R) signals in the form of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) point data, which is sensitive to the presence of surface water, due to their operating frequency at L-band. However, because of the pseudo-random nature of these points, it is not possible to obtain continuous flood inundation maps at adequately high resolution. By considering topological indicators, such as height above nearest drainage (HAND) and slope of nearest drainage (SND), which indicate the probability of a certain area being prone to flooding, we hypothesize that combining static topographic information with the dynamic GNSS-R signals can result in large-scale, high-resolution flood inundation maps. Flood mapping was performed and validated with flood extent derived using available Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for flooding in Kerala during August 2018, and North India during August 2017. The results obtained after thresholding indicate that the model exhibits a flooding accuracy ranging from 60% to 80% for lower threshold values. We observed significant overestimation error in mapping inundation across the flooding period, resulting in an optimal critical success index of 0.22 for threshold values between 17-19.

TI  - Quantifying the Dynamics and Drivers of Landscape Change in an Opencast Coal Mining Area of Central India (East Bokaro, Jharkhand)
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates the spatiotemporal dynamics of landscape change and identifies the primary drivers of deforestation in East Bokaro coalfields from 1972 to 2016 using grid-based change detection and spatial statistics. Landsat images for the years 1972, 2001 and 2016 were classified using a supervised maximum likelihood technique to generate the land use and land cover maps for each year. Square grids of 500 m were used to quantify the cumulative changes in land cover from 1972 to 2016. Grid-based correlation and regression analyses were used to identify the drivers of change. The results revealed that the area has undergone major changes in land cover pattern in the last 44 years due to expansion of mining activities. Forests and agriculture have reduced while settlement and barren lands have increased considerably. Extensive plantation activities on mining wastelands in the last few decades have led to an increase in the forest cover by about 8.22%. Correlations indicated that both mining and agriculture increased at the expense of forests to some degree and agricultural lands were sacrificed for the expansion of built-up areas. Regression analysis confirmed that agriculture and mining were the most influential factors driving the changes in forest cover.

M3  - Article
AB  - In late 2019, a new infectious disease (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China, which has now turned into a global pandemic. Countries around the world have implemented some type of blockade to lessen their infection and mitigate it. The blockade due to COVID-19 has drastic effects on the social and economic fronts. However, recent data released by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), European Space Agency (ESA), Copernicus Sentinel-5P Tropomi Instrument and Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) indicate that the pollution in some of the epicenters of COVID-19, such as Wuhan, Italy, Spain, USA, and Brazil, reduced by up to 30%. This study compiled the environmental data released by these centers and discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on environmental pollution. (C) 2020 SEICAP.

TI  - Estimation of global horizontal irradiance using satellite-derived data across Middle East-North Africa: The role of aerosol optical properties and site-adaptation methodologies
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Middle East - North Africa (MENA) region is characterized by increasing energy demand combined with high energy costs and short reserves of fossil fuels. Hence, the knowledge of the spatial and temporal variability of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is necessary for assessing the efficiency of alternative energy sources. In this study, satellite retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, versions 6 and 6.1) and radiative transfer model simulations are used to evaluate the effect of aerosol optical properties on GHI under cloud-free conditions in the MENA region. The modeled GHI is validated against ground-based measurements at six MENA sites. Due to induced uncertainties in modeled GHIs, two site-adaptation methodologies (Empirical Quantile Mapping-EQM and Linear Least Squares-LIN) are further evaluated to diminish the systematic and dispersion errors. EQM is revealed to be more efficient, causing a significant correction to the statistical distribution of the modeled GHI. For almost all sites, modeled GHI values present the best statistical results when MODIS version 6.1 is used. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Object-Based Approach Using Very High Spatial Resolution 16-Band WorldView-3 and LiDAR Data for Tree Species Classification in a Broadleaf Forest in Quebec, Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Species identification in Quebec, Canada, is usually performed with photo-interpretation at the stand level, and often results in a lack of precision which affects forest management. Very high spatial resolution imagery, such as WorldView-3 and Light Detection and Ranging have the potential to overcome this issue. The main objective of this study is to map 11 tree species at the tree level using an object-based approach. For modeling, 240 variables were derived from WorldView-3 with pixel-based and arithmetic feature calculation techniques. A global approach (11 species) was compared to a hierarchical approach at two levels: (1) tree type (broadleaf/conifer) and (2) individual broadleaf (five) and conifer (six) species. Five different model techniques were compared: support vector machine, classification and regression tree, random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors, and linear discriminant analysis. Each model was assessed using 16-band or first 8-band derived variables, with the results indicating higher precision for the RF technique. Higher accuracies were found using 16-band instead of 8-band derived variables for the global approach (overall accuracy (OA): 75% vs. 71%, Kappa index of agreement (KIA): 0.72 vs. 0.67) and tree type level (OA: 99% vs. 97%, KIA: 0.97 vs. 0.95). For broadleaf individual species, higher accuracy was found using first 8-band derived variables (OA: 70% vs. 68%, KIA: 0.63 vs. 0.60). No distinction was found for individual conifer species (OA: 94%, KIA: 0.93). This paper demonstrates that a hierarchical classification approach gives better results for conifer species and that using an 8-band WorldView-3 instead of a 16-band is sufficient.

TI  - Coastal environmental changes in Southeast Asia: A study from Quang Nam Province, Central Vietnam
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal environments are highly dynamic in nature and are sensitive to natural phenomena such as climate change and anthropogenic activities such as aquaculture or infrastructure development. At the same time, these areas are important in the economic development of the whole country, in which they are situated. Coastal areas in Vietnam are affected by a number of factors, such as climate change, sea level rise, aquaculture, pollution and tourism-related activities. This study investigated the coastal environmental changes in Quang Nam, which is a poorly developed province in Central Vietnam during the 31-year period between 1988 and 2019. For this, we analyzed spaceborne data such as Landsat series and Sentinel 2A, and digital elevation models. The coastal environmental variables analyzed were shoreline changes, changes in overall vegetation and mangrove forests, and the expansion of aquaculture ponds. In order to understand the variations in sea level heights, we analyzed HYCOM data for the period between 1994 and 2014. It has been noted that rapid shoreline erosion occurred along the Cua Dai Beach in recent years and the implementation of soft measures, such as sand bags, helped to reduce shoreline erosion to some extent. The current study also contributes to the global inventory of mangroves as most of the study area was missing in the previously available databases such as the world mangrove atlas.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of mangrove forests in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (India)
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests provide multiple ecosystem services, such as primary production, coastal area protection, carbon fixation, and function as habitat for various plant and animal species. Despite the fact that these plant communities have proven effective in coastal area protection against typhoons and tsunamis, the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami caused the destruction of a large areas of mangrove forests in the Andaman and Nicobar islands in the Bay of Bengal. In this study, we investigated the decadal changes in mangrove forests in this region, including the decline in the mangrove areas before and after the 2004 Tsunami and the recent changes in the tsunami devastated mangrove areas since then, using Landsat series and Sentinel 2 data. In order to understand how these mangrove forests survive under the sea level rising scenarios, we estimated the possible changes in the land cover when a 1m rise in the current sea level occurs. It is estimated that 15% of the mangrove areas in this region were lost between 1988 and 2018. Even though the overall mangrove areas were shrinking, its causes are relatively different from the north to the south of the Andaman Islands. While the mangrove forests in the southern regions can be affected by natural phenomena such as tsunamis and sea level rise, those in the northern region are being depleted due to logging and land use changes. It is estimated that a 1m rise in the current sea level will result in the loss of 17% (117 km(2)) of the mangrove areas (the inward migration of mangrove vegetation was not considered).

TI  - Mapping of corn phonological stages using NDVI from OLI and MODIS sensors
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop phenology knowledge is relevant to a series of actions related to its management and can be accessed through vegetation indexes. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), from images of OLI and MODIS sensors, to obtain phenological information from corn crops. To this end, we evaluated two corn cropping areas, irrigated by a central pivot, and located western Bahia state, Brazil. These areas were managed with high technology and had no record of biotic and abiotic stresses. NDVI showed a well-defined temporal pattern throughout the corn cycle, with a rapid increase at the beginning, stabilization at intermediate stages, and decreases at the end of the cycle. Excellent fits for polynomial equations were obtained to estimate NDVI as a function of days after sowing (DAS), with R-2 values of 0.96 and 0.95 for images of OLI and MODIS sensors, respectively. This demonstrates that both sensors could characterize corn canopy changes over time. NDVI ranges were correlated with the main phenological stages (PE), using the direct relationship between both variables (NDVI and PE) with days after sowing (DAS). For the beginning and end of each phenological stage, NDVI ranges were validated through model identity testing. NDVI proved to be a suitable parameter to assess corn phenology accurately and remotely. Finally, NDVI was also an important tool for detecting biotic and abiotic stresses throughout the crop cycle, and hence for decision making based on corn phenology.

TI  - Applications of the Google Earth Engine and Phenology-Based Threshold Classification Method for Mapping Forest Cover and Carbon Stock Changes in Siem Reap Province, Cambodia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital and scalable technologies are increasingly important for rapid and large-scale assessment and monitoring of land cover change. Until recently, little research has existed on how these technologies can be specifically applied to the monitoring of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) activities. Using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform, we applied the recently developed phenology-based threshold classification method (PBTC) for detecting and mapping forest cover and carbon stock changes in Siem Reap province, Cambodia, between 1990 and 2018. The obtained PBTC maps were validated using Google Earth high resolution historical imagery and reference land cover maps by creating 3771 systematic 5 x 5 km spatial accuracy points. The overall cumulative accuracy of this study was 92.1% and its cumulative Kappa was 0.9, which are sufficiently high to apply the PBTC method to detect forest land cover change. Accordingly, we estimated the carbon stock changes over a 28-year period in accordance with the Good Practice Guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We found that 322,694 ha of forest cover was lost in Siem Reap, representing an annual deforestation rate of 1.3% between 1990 and 2018. This loss of forest cover was responsible for carbon emissions of 143,729,440 MgCO2 over the same period. If REDD+ activities are implemented during the implementation period of the Paris Climate Agreement between 2020 and 2030, about 8,256,746 MgCO2 of carbon emissions could be reduced, equivalent to about USD 6-115 million annually depending on chosen carbon prices. Our case study demonstrates that the GEE and PBTC method can be used to detect and monitor forest cover change and carbon stock changes in the tropics with high accuracy.

TI  - Mapping the Natural Distribution of Bamboo and Related Carbon Stocks in the Tropics Using Google Earth Engine, Phenological Behavior, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although vegetation phenology thresholds have been developed for a wide range of mapping applications, their use for assessing the distribution of natural bamboo and the related carbon stocks is still limited, especially in Southeast Asia. Here, we used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to collect time-series of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 images and employed a phenology-based threshold classification method (PBTC) to map the natural bamboo distribution and estimate carbon stocks in Siem Reap Province, Cambodia. We processed 337 collections of Landsat 8 OLI for phenological assessment and generated 121 phenological profiles of the average vegetation index for three vegetation land cover categories from 2015 to 2018. After determining the minimum and maximum threshold values for bamboo during the leaf-shedding phenology stage, the PBTC method was applied to produce a seasonal composite enhanced vegetation index (EVI) for Landsat collections and assess the bamboo distributions in 2015 and 2018. Bamboo distributions in 2019 were then mapped by applying the EVI phenological threshold values for 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery by accessing 442 tiles. The overall Landsat 8 OLI bamboo maps for 2015 and 2018 had user's accuracies (UAs) of 86.6% and 87.9% and producer's accuracies (PAs) of 95.7% and 97.8%, respectively, and a UA of 86.5% and PA of 91.7% were obtained from Sentinel-2 imagery for 2019. Accordingly, carbon stocks of natural bamboo by district in Siem Reap at the province level were estimated. Emission reductions from the protection of natural bamboo can be used to offset 6% of the carbon emissions from tourists who visit this tourism-destination province. It is concluded that a combination of GEE and PBTC and the increasing availability of remote sensing data make it possible to map the natural distribution of bamboo and carbon stocks.

TI  - Influence of preoperative breast cancer localization techniques on rates of sentinel lymph node visualization with preoperative lymphoscintigraphy
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The use of preoperative image-guided lesion localization for impalpable breast cancer may interfere with lymphatic drainage and cause delayed or reduced visualization of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. The goal of this audit was to compare rates of SLN visualization in patients undergoing preoperative breast cancer localization with either Iodine 125 seeds (radio-guided occult lesion localization using Iodine 125 seeds, ROLLIS) or hook wire and those with palpable lesions where no localization was required. Patients and methods We reviewed the records of 482 patients, who underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy with hook wire, ROLLIS, or no localization, at three major tertiary hospitals from January 2013 to December 2017. Static lymphoscintigraphy images are performed post administration of subcutaneous periareolar(99m)Tc antimony colloid injection. The rate of SLN visualization in the three groups and time to node visualization were analyzed. Results Four hundred and eighty-two patients underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy: 102 after no localization, 211 in hook wire, and 169 following ROLLIS. Very high overall rates of SLN visualization on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy were noted in all three groups; no localization group: 99% [95% confidence interval (CI), 94.7-99.8%], hook wire: 98.6% (95% CI, 95.9-99.7%) and ROLLIS: 98.8% (95% CI, 95.8-99.9%). For time to node visualization, a statistically significant difference was found between the no localization versus hook-wire group (P = 0.0015) and no localization versus ROLLIS group (P = 0.00011) but no statistically significant difference between the hook-wire and ROLLIS groups (P = 0.16) was demonstrated. Conclusion High rates of SLN visualization on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy were noted in all groups, with no significant reduction when breast lesion localization techniques were used. There was; however, an increased rate of delayed imaging required for SLN visualization in women who had undergone either type of preoperative localization compared with those who had not.

TI  - Pansharpening: Context-Based Generalized Laplacian Pyramids by Robust Regression
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening refers to the combination of panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images, designed to obtain a fused product retaining the fine spatial resolution of the former and the high spectral content of the latter. One of the most popular and successful approaches to pansharpening is the method known as context-based generalized Laplacian pyramid, which requires as a key ingredient for the estimation of the so-called injection coefficients. In this article, we propose the adoption of robust techniques for the estimation of the injection coefficients and detection strategies to select the clusters for which robust regression is needed, providing a suitable balancing between fusion performance and computational burden. Experimental results conducted on five real data sets acquired by the sensors QuickBird, WorldView-3, and WorldView-4, show the superiority of the proposed method with respect to current state-of-the-art pansharpening techniques.

TI  - Extreme Climate Event and Its Impact on Landscape Resilience in Gobi Region of Mongolia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thedzud, a specific type of climate disaster in Mongolia, is responsible for serious environmental and economic damage. It is characterized by heavy snowfall and severe winter conditions, causing mass livestock deaths that occur through the following spring. These events substantially limit socioeconomic development in Mongolia. In this research, we conducted an analysis of severaldzudevents (2000, 2001, 2002, and 2010) to understand the spatial and temporal variability of vegetation conditions in the Gobi region of Mongolia. The present paper also establishes how these extreme climatic events affect vegetation cover and local grazing conditions using the seasonal aridity index ((a)AI(Z)), time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and livestock data. We also correlated(a)AI(Z), NDVI, and seasonal precipitation in the varied ecosystems of the study area. The results illustrate that under certaindzudconditions, rapid regeneration of vegetation can occur. A thick snow layer acting as a water reservoir combined with high livestock losses can lead to an increase of the maximum August NDVI. The Gobi steppe areas showed the highest degree of vulnerability to climate, with a drastic decline of grassland in humid areas. Another result is that snowy winters can cause a 10 to 20-day early peak in NDVI and a following increase in vegetation growth. During a drought year with dry winter conditions, the vegetation growth phase begins later due to water deficiency, which leads to weaker vegetation growth. Livestock loss and the reduction of grazing pressure play a crucial role in vegetation recovery after extreme climatic events in Mongolia.

TI  - Trends in Long-Term Drought Changes in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, short droughts in the dry season have occurred more frequently and caused serious damages to agriculture and human living in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam (MRD). The paper attempts to quantify the trends of drought changes in the dry seasons from 2001 to 2015 in the region, using daily MODIS MOD09GQ and MOD11A1 data products. Here, we exploit the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) to assess levels of droughts. For each image-acquisition time, the TVDI image is computed, based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from red and near infrared reflectance data, and the Land Surface Temperature (LST), derived from thermal infrared data. Subsequently, a spatiotemporal pattern of drought changes is estimated, based on mean TVDI values of the dry seasons during the observed period, by a linear regression. As a result, the state of drought in the dry seasons in the MRD has mostly been at light and moderate levels, occupying approximately 62% and 34% of the total area. Several sub-areas in the center have an increased trend of drought change, occupying approximately 12.5% of the total area, because impervious surface areas increase, e.g., the obvious land use change, from forest land and land for cultivation for perennial trees being strongly converted to built-up land for residence and public transportation. Meanwhile, several sub-areas in the coastal regions have a negative trend of drought change because water and absorbent surface areas increase, e.g., most of land for cultivation for perennial trees has been converted to aquaculture land. These cases usually occur in and surrounding forest and wet land, also occupying approximately 12.5% of the total area.

TI  - Reinventions of an Old Tradition: Orthodox Processions and Pilgrimage in Contemporary Finland
T2  - NUMEN-INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR THE HISTORY OF RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines two cases of Finnish Orthodox traditions of procession and pilgrimage that are currently being reframed in response to physical, political, and religious disruption. Annual Orthodox processions are now held in Northern Karelia close to and across the Finnish-Russian border, while the pilgrimage of St. Tryphon of Pechenga, the patron saint of the Skolt Saami in northeastern Finland, crosses the border between Finland and Norway to visit their lost home area, as an act of remembrance and recognition of the history of the Skolt Saami. Here I argue that, contrary to some trends within pilgrimage studies to blur tourism and pilgrimage, these journeys are primarily religious, understood only with an appreciation of Orthodox theology and worldview. Each case demonstrates both continuity and change in Orthodox pilgrimage praxis and its theological underpinnings. It highlights the pragmatism of the priests and congregations involved in adapting traditional forms to complex new contexts involving the loss of tangible and intangible heritage. The analysis shows that both events include the active agency of both the institution and local participants and a significant amount of invention in relation to new contexts of loss.

TI  - Statistical Approach to Observe the Atmospheric Density Variations Using Swarm Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over time, the initial algorithms to derive atmospheric density from accelerometers have been significantly enhanced. In this study, we discussed one of the accurate accelerometers-the Earth's Magnetic Field and Environment Explorers, more commonly known as the Swarm satellites. Swarm satellite-C level 2 (measurements from the Swam accelerometers) density, solar index (F-10.7), and geomagnetic index (Kp) data have been used for a year (mid 2014-2015), and the different types of temporal (the diurnal, multi-day, solar-rotational, semi-annual, and annual) atmospheric density variations have been investigated using the statistical approaches of correlation coefficient and wavelet transform. The result shows the density varies due to the recurrent geomagnetic force at multi-day, solar irradiance during the day, appearance and disappearance of the Sun's active region, Sun-Earth distance, large scale circulation, and the formation of an aurora. Additionally, a correlation coefficient was used to observe whether F-10.7 or Kp contributes strongly or weakly to annual density, and the result found a strong (medium) correlation with F-10.7 (Kp). Accurate density measurement can help to reduce the model's bias correction, and monitoring the physical mechanisms for the density variations can lead to improvements in the atmospheric density models.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Data in Classification of Mountain Vegetation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The electromagnetic spectrum registered via satellite remote sensing methods became a popular data source that can enrich traditional methods of vegetation monitoring. The European Space Agency Sentinel-2 mission, thanks to its spatial (10-20 m) and spectral resolution (12 spectral bands registered in visible-, near-, and mid-infrared spectrum) and primarily its short revisit time (5 days), helps to provide reliable and accurate material for the identification of mountain vegetation. Using the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm and reference data (botanical map of non-forest vegetation, field survey data, and high spatial resolution images) it was possible to classify eight vegetation types of Giant Mountains: bogs and fens, deciduous shrub vegetation, forests, grasslands, heathlands, subalpine tall forbs, subalpine dwarf pine scrubs, and rock and scree vegetation. Additional variables such as principal component analysis (PCA) bands and selected vegetation indices were included in the best classified dataset. The results of the iterative classification, repeated 100 times, were assessed as approximately 80% median overall accuracy (OA) based on multi-temporal datasets composed of images acquired through the vegetation growing season (from late spring to early autumn 2018), better than using a single-date scene (70%-72% OA). Additional variables did not significantly improve the results, showing the importance of spectral and temporal information themselves. Our study confirms the possibility of fully available data for the identification of mountain vegetation for management purposes and protection within national parks.

TI  - An examination of forest cover change at Angkor, Cambodia, using satellite imagery, interviews and interpretation of historical events
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the three decades since the mid-1970s through to the early 2000s forest cover at the Angkor World Heritage Site, Cambodia has not progressed linearly but in response to different historical events. This research uses multiple methods in comparing satellite image classification with key informant interviews and other forms of data at the landscape scale and at case studies to provide an historical perspective on forest cover change. The earliest date corresponds to the beginning of the civil war in Cambodia through to a time when a number of events had contributed to significant change in forest pattern and extent at Angkor. The change observed is a result of regulatory controls on land use, ongoing subsistence resource use activities and other events and processes, and more broadly reflects a country in transition and a history of conflict relating to resource governance. The research demonstrates that multiple methods combining medium resolution satellite imagery with interview data and processes detectable at specific time periods can be used to understand patterns of forest change and establish links to processes on the ground.

TI  - Toll-Like Receptor Agonists and Radiation Therapy Combinations: An Untapped Opportunity to Induce Anticancer Immunity and Improve Tumor control
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - The premise that therapies targeting immune checkpoints can enhance radiation therapy (RT)-induced antitumor immunity is being explored rigorously in the preclinical setting, and early clinical trials testing this hypothesis are beginning to report. Although such approaches might prove efficacious in certain settings, it is likely that many tumor types, particularly those that have a deeply immune-suppressed microenvironment with little or no T cell infiltration, will require alternative approaches. Thus, there is now considerable drive to develop novel immune modulatory therapies that target other areas of the cancer immunity cycle. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are expressed on sentinel immune cells and play a key role in the host defense against invading pathogens. Innate sensing via TLR-mediated detection of pathogen-derived molecular patterns can lead to maturation of antigen-presenting cells and downstream activation of adaptive immunity. After demonstrating promising efficacy in preclinical studies, drugs that stimulate TLR have been approved for use clinically, albeit to a limited extent. There is a growing body of preclinical evidence that novel agonists targeting TLR3, TLR7/8, or TLR9 in combination with RT might lead to enhanced antitumor immunity. Mechanistic studies have revealed that TLR agonists enhance dendritic cell-mediated T cell priming after RT, in some cases leading to the generation of systemic antitumor immunity and immune memory. In this report, we describe results from precinical studies that advocate the strategy of combining RT with TLR agonists, discuss reported mechanisms of action, and explore the exciting opportunities of how this approach may be successfully translated into clinical practice.

TI  - Multi-scale Spectral-Spatial Remote Sensing Classification of Coral Reef Habitats Using CNN-SVM
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, coral reefs have undergone serious degradation globally, prompting the use of remote sensing as an effective means to monitor these reefs on a large scale. Deep learning, which is a state-of-the-art image processing technique suitable for remote-sensing applications, can be used to learn nonlinear characteristics of images and is therefore applicable to the classification of small-scale coral reefs. This paper proposes a multi-scale method based on a convolutional neural network and support vector machine (CNN-SVM) to classify the coral reef habitats of Zhaoshu Island and Zhong Island in the Xisha Archipelago, China. This method combines spectrum, texture, and bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) based scale separation algorithm to fully learn multi-scale information of coral reefs. Remote-sensing images captured by the WorldView-2 and Gaofen-2 (GF-2) satellites are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed CNN-SVM framework. The results indicate that the proposed method performs accurately and efficiently. Compared with SVM, random forest (RF), CNN, and CNN-RF, the overall accuracy is improved by 10.57 %, and the accuracy of classifying reef-clumping areas is improved by 17.44 %.

TI  - Evaluation of the Significant Wave Height Data Quality for the Sentinel-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeters represent a new method of microwave remote sensing for ocean wave observations. The adoption of SAR technology in the azimuthal direction has the advantage of a high resolution. The Sentinel-3 altimeter is the first radar altimeter to acquire global observations in SAR mode; hence, the data quality needs to be assessed before extensively applying these data. The European Space Agency (ESA) evaluates the Sentinel-3 accuracy on a global scale but has yet to perform a detailed analysis in terms of different offshore distances and different water depths. In this paper, Sentinel-3 and Jason-2 significant wave height (SWH) data are matched in both time and space with buoy data from the United States East and West Coasts and the Central Pacific Ocean. The Sentinel-3 SWH data quality is evaluated according to different offshore distances and water depths in comparison with Jason-2 SWH data. In areas more than 50 km offshore, the Sentinel-3 SWH accuracy is generally high and less affected by the water depth and sea conditions (root-mean-square error of 0.28 m and correlation coefficient of 0.98); in areas less than 50 km offshore, the SWH data accuracy is slightly affected by water depth and sea conditions (especially the former). Compared with Jason-2, the observation ability of the Sentinel-3 altimeter in nearshore areas with water depths of 0 m-500 m is greatly improved, but in some deep water areas with stable sea conditions, the Jason-2 SWH data accuracy is higher than that of Sentinel-3. This work provides a reference for the refined application of Sentinel-3 SWH data in offshore deep water areas and nearshore shallow water areas.

TI  - Generating spatiotemporally consistent fractional vegetation cover at different scales using spatiotemporal fusion and multiresolution tree methods
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is considered one of the most important vegetation parameters and is relevant to characterizing vegetation status and ecosystem function. An FVC with a fine spatial resolution of 30 m is essential for monitoring vegetation change and regional studies, while an FVC with a coarse spatial resolution of hundreds to thousands of metres plays an important role in global change studies. However, high spatial resolution data usually have low temporal resolution and are often affected by cloud cover. The objective of this study is to propose a practical way to generate spatiotemporally consistent FVC products at Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) scales, which are 30 m and 250 m, respectively. The geostatistical neighbourhood similar pixel interpolator (GNSPI) was first used to fill in the missing values caused by unscanned gaps and clouds/shadows on Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM + ) data and to generate spatially continuous Landsat reflectance. Then, the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) was used to generate time series Landsat reflectance data with the same temporal resolution as that of Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) FVC generated from MODIS data. The high temporal resolution Landsat reflectance was preliminarily used to estimate FVC at the Landsat scale. Finally, MultiResolution Tree (MRT) was employed to fuse the Landsat FVC and GLASS FVC to generate spatiotemporally consistent FVC products at different scales. The results show that the missing Landsat-7 ETM + data were filled well and spatial texture features were well preserved. The temporal resolutions of the Landsat and GLASS FVC products became consistent with an interval of one day at most. After MRT fusion, most of the root mean square error (RMSE) between the GLASS FVC and aggregated Landsat FVC dramatically decreased. The accuracy of the Landsat FVC validated by the ground-measured FVC improved after MRT fusion (before MRT: RMSE = 0.1031, R-2 = 0.9172, bias = - 0.0697; after MRT: RMSE = 0.0958, R-2 = 0.9173, bias = - 0.054). In addition, in the GNSPI-filled unscanned gaps and the ESTARFM-generated images, the Landsat FVC accuracy also improved slightly (before MRT: RMSE = 0.1065, R-2 = 0.9011, bias = - 0.0644; after MRT: RMSE = 0.1022, R-2 = 0.9023, bias = - 0.051). The accuracy of the GLASS FVC also improved (before MRT: RMSE = 0.0913, R-2 = 0.884, bias = - 0.0504; after MRT: RMSE = 0.0673, R-2 = 0.9483, bias = - 0.0444). Therefore, MRT could decrease the inconsistencies of different scales and reduce uncertainties in the FVC. In addition, MRT could fill in the missing data of the Landsat FVC directly, but there were a certain number of outliers in the fusion results, and the spatial transition was poor.

TI  - Deriving Natural Coastlines Using Multiple Satellite Remote Sensing Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The exact boundary of a coastline is difficult to define accurately, and it is even more difficult to determine from remote sensing images. One definition of coastlines is the average spring tide lines. However, establishing the position of this time-sensitive location accurately from temporally sparse remote sensing observations is challenging, especially for natural coastlines such as sandy and muddy coasts. This paper proposes a method that uses multiple remote sensing images to derive coastlines under the assumption that shorelines are invariable over short periods. First, instantaneous water edges between water and non-water regions are extracted from multiple remote sensing images. Second, the extracted water edges are clustered into two groups through application of the K-means algorithm. Next, two average water edges are calculated separately from the two groups. Then, in combination with known tidal levels (amplitudes) at the image capture times, a method for deriving coastline is presented under the assumption that the coastal slope is gentle and the water depths of the locations in the same water edges are equal. Five images acquired by the Operational Land Image sensor of Landsat 8 are used to extract a coastline with known tidal amplitudes to validate the method. Experimental results show that our proposed method could derive highly accurate coastlines from multiple remote sensing images for the regions of artificial coasts and muddy coasts (except estuary areas).

TI  - Remote sensing approach for the estimation of particulate organic carbon in coastal waters based on suspended particulate concentration and particle median size
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The particulate organic carbon (POC) content retrieved by remote sensors is influenced by the suspended particulate concentration (SPC) and the particle size distribution (PSD). The objective of this study was to provide study case of remote sensing monitoring of non-optical activity substance POC in Hangzhou bay, China. A modified empirical remote sensing algorithm was established based on SPC and median particle size (D-50) to describe the influence of PSD variation on remote sensing reflectance (R-rs). The algorithm was applied to MODIS data to reveal POC spatial and temporal variations. The results show that the accuracy of the remote sensing estimation algorithm, established on the basis of Mie theory, is relatively higher than the empirical model simply based on the statistical correlation between R-rs and POC. The POC in Hangzhou bay caused by spring and neap fides vary significantly.

TI  - Analysis of Short-term Cloud Feedback in East Asia Using Cloud Radiative Kernels
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud radiative kernels were built by BCC_RAD (Beijing Climate Center radiative transfer model) radiative transfer code. Then, short-term cloud feedback and its mechanisms in East Asia (0.5 degrees S-60.5 degrees N, 69.5 degrees-150.5 degrees E) were analyzed quantitatively using the kernels combined with MODIS satellite data from July 2002 to June 2018. According to the surface and monsoon types, four subregions in East Asia-the Tibetan Plateau, northwest, temperate monsoon (TM), and subtropical monsoon (SM)-were selected. The average longwave, shortwave, and net cloud feedbacks in East Asia are -0.68 +/- 1.20, 1.34 +/- 1.08, and 0.66 +/- 0.40 W m(-2)K(-1)(+/- 2 sigma), respectively, among which the net feedback is dominated by the positive shortwave feedback. Positive feedback in SM is the strongest of all subregions, mainly due to the contributions of nimbostratus and stratus. In East Asia, short-term feedback in spring is primarily caused by marine stratus in SM, in summer is primarily driven by deep convective cloud in TM, in autumn is mainly caused by land nimbostratus in SM, and in winter is mainly driven by land stratus in SM. Cloud feedback in East Asia is chiefly driven by decreases in mid-level and low cloud fraction owing to the changes in relative humidity, and a decrease in low cloud optical thickness due to the changes in cloud water content.

TI  - Ecosystem Health Assessment of Shennongjia National Park, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem health assessment is an important part of improving the management of national parks. In this paper, Shennongjia National Park is taken as the study region. By using satellite remote sensing data from 2000 to 2018, based on the Vitality Organization Resilience (VOR) model, an ecosystem health assessment is created and its spatiotemporal characteristics are analyzed. In the whole region, the ecosystem's health level has gradually improved; the rate of improvement of the ecosystem's health level from 2016 to 2018 has been 2.5-times that of the overall rate and the trend of improvement has been obvious. The rate of improvement of the ecosystem's health level of non-nature protection areas has improved two-fold; the same is true of nature protection areas, and the stability change trend of the two areas has basically been the same. The establishment of national parks has played a significant role in promoting the health of the regional ecosystem. In future planning, relevant departments should pay attention to the ecological protection and restoration of the area and optimize the traditional area layout of Shennongjia National Park.

TI  - Hundred-year spatial trajectory of lake coverage changes in response to human activities over Wuhan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental changes induced by ongoing anthropogenic activities have caused severe lake degradation. Because of the lack of long-term records, few studies have investigated the change in Wuhan lakes, and the effect of human activities on regional lake changes prior to 1973 has not been systematically studied yet. Therefore, in this study, historical maps and Landsat images were combined to track these changes from the 1920s to 2015. Three phases could be identified over the nearly 100-year study period. The most dramatic lake reduction (-21.53 km(2)yr(-1)) occurred during Phase II (1950s-1980s) rather than Phase III (after the 1980s), as indicated by previous studies; the decreased lake area in Phase II was almost double that in Phase III. This reduction could be attributed to major hydraulic engineering projects during Phase II based on the watershed-scale analysis. In addition, land-use conversion over the past 45 years was used to quantify the impact of human exploitation on lakes. The shrinkage of lakes was predominately driven by agricultural activities, such as reclamation (39.2%) and aquaculture development (29.0%), and urbanization was a secondary driving force (19.8%), despite the rapid economic development of Wuhan. This study therefore provides a practical guide for lake protection in other areas similar to Wuhan.

TI  - Estimation of Aboveground Vegetation Nitrogen Contents in the Yellow River Estuary Wetland Using GaoFen-1 Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen storage is a key indicator of vegetation growth, and the spatial distribution of nitrogen storage provides important information about the ecological status of wetland ecosystems. In this study, the aboveground vegetation nitrogen content (AVNC) in the Yellow River estuary wetland is estimated based on GaoFen-1 wide field of view (GF-1 WFV) image. Based on the spatial distribution of vegetation and the fractional vegetation coverage (FVC), the characteristics of AVNC are analyzed. On the basis of this study, the best model for estimating AVNC based on vegetation indices is the sample rate index (SRI), whose determination coefficient (R-2) is 0.72 and root mean square error (RMSE) is 1.5 g/m(2). Per the results of this model, the total AVNC of the study area is obtained, which is 620.6 tons.The total ANVC for freshwater Phragmites australis (FPA), Tamarix chinesis shrub (TCS), Spartina altemiflora (SA), Suaeda salsa (SS), and tidal flat Phragmites australis (TFPA) communities are 296.2 t, 115.3 t, 97.1 t, 86.3 t and 25.7 t, respectively. The average AVNC per unit area for SA, FPA, TCS, TFPA, and SS communities are 4.2 g/m(2), 4.8 g/m(2), 3.1 g/m(2), 1.7 g/m(2) and 1.4 g/m(2), respectively. The correlation between FVC and AVNC is also analyzed, from which, the spatial distribution of AVNC and FVC is found to be in good agreement. Results of this study thus provide a valuable reference for determining AVNC in coastal wetland ecosystems with implications for ecological health and other ecological characteristics.

TI  - Multi-scale integration of satellite remote sensing improves characterization of dry-season green-up in an Amazon tropical evergreen forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical forests, leaf phenology-particularly the pronounced dry-season green-up-strongly regulates biogeochemical cycles of carbon and water fluxes. However, uncertainties remain in the understanding of tropical forest leaf phenology at different spatial scales. Phenocams accurately characterize leaf phenology at the crown and ecosystem scales but are limited to a few sites and time spans of a few years. Time-series satellite observations might fill this gap, but the commonly used satellites (e.g. MODIS, Landsat and Sentinel-2) have resolutions too coarse to characterize single crowns. To resolve this observational challenge, we used the PlanetScope constellation with a 3 m resolution and near daily nadir-view coverage. We first developed a rigorous method to cross-calibrate PlanetScope surface reflectance using daily BRDF-adjusted MODIS as the reference. We then used linear spectral unmixing of calibrated PlanetScope to obtain dry-season change in the fractional cover of green vegetation (GV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) at the PlanetScope pixel level. We used the Central Amazon Tapajos National Forest k67 site, as all necessary data (from field to phenocam and satellite observations) was available. For this proof of concept, we chose a set of 22 dates of PlanetScope measurements in 2018 and 16 in 2019, all from the six drier months of the year to provide the highest possible cloud-free temporal resolution. Our results show that MODIS-calibrated dry-season PlanetScope data (1) accurately assessed seasonal changes in ecosystem-scale and crown-scale spectral reflectance; (2) detected an increase in ecosystem-scale GV fraction (and a decrease in NPV fraction) from June to November of both years, consistent with local phenocam observations with R-2 around 0.8; and (3) monitored large seasonal trend variability in crown-scale NPV fraction. Our results highlight the potential of integrating multi-scale satellite observations to extend fine-scale leaf phenology monitoring beyond the spatial limits of phenocams.

TI  - Prevalence and intensity of persistent post-surgical pain following breast cancer surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The prevalence and intensity of persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP) after breast cancer surgery are uncertain. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to further elucidate this issue.Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO, from inception to November 2018, for observational studies reporting persistent pain (>= 3 months) after breast cancer surgery. We used random-effects meta-analysis and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach to rate quality of evidence.Results: We included 187 observational studies with 297 612 breast cancer patients. The prevalence of PPSP ranged from 2% to 78%, median 37% (inter-quartile range: 22-48%); the pooled prevalence was 35% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 32-39%). The pooled pain intensity was 3.9 cm on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (95% CI: 3.6-4.2 cm). Moderate-quality evidence supported the subgroup effects of PPSP prevalence for localized pain vs any pain (29% vs 44%), moderate or greater vs any pain (26% vs 44%), clinician-assessed vs patient-reported pain (23% vs 36%), and whether patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy vs axillary lymph node dissection (26% vs 43%). The adjusted analysis found that the prevalence of patient-reported PPSP (any severity/location) was 46% (95% CI: 36-56%), and the prevalence of patient-reported moderate-to-severe PPSP at any location was 27% (95% CI: 10-43%).Conclusions: Moderate-quality evidence suggests that almost half of all women undergoing breast cancer surgery develop persistent post-surgical pain, and about one in four develop moderate-to-severe persistent post-surgical pain; the higher prevalence was associated with axillary lymph node dissection. Future studies should explore whether nerve sparing for axillary procedures reduces persistent post-surgical pain after breast cancer surgery.

TI  - Reconstructing the Seasonality and Trend in Global Leaf Area Index During 2001-2017 for Prognostic Modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a vegetation structural parameter that modulates the interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere and therefore is used in many terrestrial biosphere models. However, there are still large uncertainties in simulating the global LAI in Earth system models. In this study, we used climate and soil variables and the Farquhar's biochemical model to reconstruct global LAI, explore the mechanisms controlling global LAI seasonality, and analyze the feasibility of Farquhar's biochemical model in estimating the effect of CO(2)fertilization on global LAI. The results show that the reconstructed LAI (RLAI) based on climate and soil variables can explain 93% of the seasonal dynamics of global LAI. However, RLAI only explained 27.3% of the global LAI trend and captured 29.8% of the land area with a significant trend. RLAI after incorporating the CO(2)fertilization effect, which is estimated by Farquhar's biochemical model, can explain 68.8% (41.5% improvement from RLAI) of the global LAI trend and capture 63.3% (33.5% improvement from RLAI) of the area with a significant LAI trend. These results suggest that it is feasible to use Farquhar's biochemical model to estimate the effect of CO(2)fertilization on the global trend in LAI. The statistical model for reconstructing the seasonal dynamics of LAI and the Farquhar model-based method for estimating the LAI temporal trend developed in this study would be useful for improving or evaluating the performance of prognostic models for future global carbon cycle research. Furthermore, this study may provide a new way to simulate global LAI for prognostic modeling.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and GF-1 Data for Retrieving Soil Moisture over Wheat Farmlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important variable in ecological, hydrological, and meteorological studies. An effective method for improving the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval is the mutual supplementation of multi-source data. The sensor configuration and band settings of different optical sensors lead to differences in band reflectivity in the inter-data, further resulting in the differences between vegetation indices. The combination of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with multi-source optical data has been widely used for soil moisture retrieval. However, the influence of vegetation indices derived from different sources of optical data on retrieval accuracy has not been comparatively analyzed thus far. Therefore, the suitability of vegetation parameters derived from different sources of optical data for accurate soil moisture retrieval requires further investigation. In this study, vegetation indices derived from GF-1, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 were compared. Based on Sentinel-1 SAR and three optical data, combined with the water cloud model (WCM) and the advanced integral equation model (AIEM), the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval was investigated. The results indicate that, Sentinel-2 data were more sensitive to vegetation characteristics and had a stronger capability for vegetation signal detection. The ranking of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values from the three sensors was as follows: the largest was in Sentinel-2, followed by Landsat-8, and the value of GF-1 was the smallest. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) value of Landsat-8 was larger than that of Sentinel-2. With reference to the relative components in the WCM model, the contribution of vegetation scattering exceeded that of soil scattering within a vegetation index range of approximately 0.55-0.6 in NDVI-based models and all ranges in NDWI1-based models. The threshold value of NDWI2 for calculating vegetation water content (VWC) was approximately an NDVI value of 0.4-0.55. In the soil moisture retrieval, Sentinel-2 data achieved higher accuracy than data from the other sources and thus was more suitable for the study for combination with SAR in soil moisture retrieval. Furthermore, compared with NDVI, higher accuracy of soil moisture could be retrieved by using NDWI1 (R-2= 0.623, RMSE = 4.73%). This study provides a reference for the selection of optical data for combination with SAR in soil moisture retrieval.

TI  - Vegetation Growth Status and Topographic Effects in the Pisha Sandstone Area of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) plays an important role in monitoring vegetation growth status and evaluating restoration efforts in ecological environments. In this study, FVC was calculated using a binary pixel model and analyzed in the Pisha Sandstone area of China, using MODIS-EVI data from 2000 to 2019. Topographic effects were analyzed from elevation, slope and aspect using a terrain niche index model. The results were as follows. (1) From 2000 to 2019, FVC in the Pisha Sandstone area of China gradually increased at a mean rate of 0.0074/a, and the growth status of vegetation gradually improved. (2) The spatial distribution of FVC steadily decreased from southeast to northwest. FVC was the lowest in bare parts of the Pisha Sandstone area, whereas those in the sand- and soil-covered parts were the middle and highest, respectively. (3) With increasing elevation, the inferior coverage area and terrain niche index increased, and inferior coverage distribution changed from non-dominant to dominant. Meanwhile, the low, medium and high coverage areas decreased, and their distributions changed from dominance to non-dominance. (4) With increasing slope, distributions of the inferior, medium and high coverage areas changed from dominant to non-dominant, while the low coverage area had a dominant distribution. (5) Analyses of aspect effects revealed that the inferior coverage area was the dominant distribution in shady slopes but was non-dominant in semi-shady, semi-sunny and sunny slopes. The low, medium and high coverage areas were non-dominant in shady slopes, but dominant in semi-shady, semi-sunny and sunny slopes.

TI  - Estimating Land Surface Temperature from Satellite Passive Microwave Observations with the Traditional Neural Network, Deep Belief Network, and Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Neural networks, especially the latest deep learning, have exhibited good ability in estimating surface parameters from satellite remote sensing. However, thorough examinations of neural networks in the estimation of land surface temperature (LST) from satellite passive microwave (MW) observations are still lacking. Here, we examined the performances of the traditional neural network (NN), deep belief network (DBN), and convolutional neural network (CNN) in estimating LST from the AMSR-E and AMSR2 data over the Chinese landmass. The examinations were based on the same training set, validation set, and test set extracted from 2003, 2004, and 2009, respectively, for AMSR-E with a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees. For AMSR2, the three sets were extracted from 2013, 2014, and 2016 with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees, respectively. MODIS LST played the role of "ground truth" in the training, validation, and testing. The examination results show that CNN is better than NN and DBN by 0.1-0.4 K. Different combinations of input parameters were examined to get the best combinations for the daytime and nighttime conditions. The best combinations are the brightness temperatures (BTs), NDVI, air temperature, and day of the year (DOY) for the daytime and BTs and air temperature for the nighttime. By adding three and one easily obtained parameters on the basis of BTs, the accuracies of LST estimates can be improved by 0.8 K and 0.3 K for the daytime and nighttime conditions, respectively. Compared with the MODIS LST, the CNN LST estimates yielded root-mean-square differences (RMSDs) of 2.19-3.58 K for the daytime and 1.43-2.14 K for the nighttime for diverse land cover types for AMSR-E. Validation against the in-situ LSTs showed that the CNN LSTs yielded root-mean-square errors of 2.10-4.72 K for forest and cropland sites. Further intercomparison indicated that similar to 50% of the CNN LSTs were closer to the MODIS LSTs than ESA's GlobTemperature AMSR-E LSTs, and the average RMSDs of the CNN LSTs were less than 3 K over dense vegetation compared to NASA's global land parameter data record air temperatures. This study helps better the understanding of the use of neural networks for estimating LST from satellite MW observations.

TI  - Mapping Crop Types in Southeast India with Smartphone Crowdsourcing and Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High resolution satellite imagery and modern machine learning methods hold the potential to fill existing data gaps in where crops are grown around the world at a sub-field level. However, high resolution crop type maps have remained challenging to create in developing regions due to a lack of ground truth labels for model development. In this work, we explore the use of crowdsourced data, Sentinel-2 and DigitalGlobe imagery, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for crop type mapping in India. Plantix, a free app that uses image recognition to help farmers diagnose crop diseases, logged 9 million geolocated photos from 2017-2019 in India, 2 million of which are in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in India. Crop type labels based on farmer-submitted images were added by domain experts and deep CNNs. The resulting dataset of crop type at coordinates is high in volume, but also high in noise due to location inaccuracies, submissions from out-of-field, and labeling errors. We employed a number of steps to clean the dataset, which included training a CNN on very high resolution DigitalGlobe imagery to filter for points that are within a crop field. With this cleaned dataset, we extracted Sentinel time series at each point and trained another CNN to predict the crop type at each pixel. When evaluated on the highest quality subset of crowdsourced data, the CNN distinguishes rice, cotton, and "other" crops with 74% accuracy in a 3-way classification and outperforms a random forest trained on harmonic regression features. Furthermore, model performance remains stable when low quality points are introduced into the training set. Our results illustrate the potential of non-traditional, high-volume/high-noise datasets for crop type mapping, some improvements that neural networks can achieve over random forests, and the robustness of such methods against moderate levels of training set noise. Lastly, we caution that obstacles like the lack of good Sentinel-2 cloud mask, imperfect mobile device location accuracy, and preservation of privacy while improving data access will need to be addressed before crowdsourcing can widely and reliably be used to map crops in smallholder systems.

TI  - Development and Application of HECORA Cloud Retrieval Algorithm Based On the O<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>2</sub> 477 nm Absorption Band
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present the Hefei EMI Cloud Retrieval Algorithm (HECORA), which uses information from the O-2-O-2 absorption band around 477 nm to retrieve effective cloud fraction and effective cloud pressure from satellite observations. The retrieved cloud information intends to improve the atmospheric trace gas products based on the Environment Monitoring Instrument (EMI) spectrometer. The HECORA method builds on OMCLDO2 and presents some evolutions. The Vector Linearized Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (VLIDORT) model has been used to produce the Top of the Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance Look-up Tables (LUT) as a function of the cloud fraction and cloud pressure. Applying the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique to the synthetic reflectance LUT, the reflectance spectra can be associated with O-2-O-2 geometrical vertical column densities (VCDgeo) and continuum reflectance. This is the core of the retrieval method, since there is a one-to-one relationship between O-2-O-2 VCDgeo and continuum reflectance, on the one hand, and effective cloud fraction and effective cloud pressure, on the other hand, for a given illumination and observing geometry and given surface height and surface albedo. We first used the VLIDORT synthetic spectra to verify the HECORA algorithm and obtained good results in both the Lambertian cloud model and the scattering cloud model. Secondly, HECORA is applied to OMI and TROPOMI and compared with OMCLDO2, FRESCO+, and OCRA/ROCINN cloud products. Later, the cloud pressure results from TROPOMI observations obtained using HECORA and FRESCO+ are compared with the CALIOP Cloud Layer product. HECORA is closer to the CALIOP results under low cloud conditions, while FRESCO+ is closer to high clouds due to the higher sensitivity of the O-2 A-band to cloud vertical information. Finally, HECORA is applied to the TROPOMI NO2 retrieval. Validation of the tropospheric NO2 VCD with ground-based MAX-DOAS measurements shows that choosing HECORA cloud products to correct for photon path variations on the TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 VCD retrievals has better performance than using FRESCO+ under low cloud conditions. In conclusion, this paper shows that the HECORA cloud products are in good agreement with the well-established cloud products and that they are suitable for correcting the effect of cloud in trace gas retrievals. Therefore, HECORA has the potential to be applied to EMI.

TI  - Thoracic aortic aneurysm: Optimal surveillance and treatment
T2  - CLEVELAND CLINIC JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Aneurysm of the thoracic aorta is less common than in the abdominal aorta, but it is clinically important because of the risk of rupture and death. Cases are often found incidentally. Indications for surgical or endovascular repair are based on aneurysm location and risk factors for rupture such as aneurysm size, rate of growth, and associated conditions, while medical management is also important. Surveillance with various imaging tests is critical before and after intervention to guide treatment.

TI  - Expression of Small Noncoding RNAs in Urinary Exosomes Classifies Prostate Cancer into Indolent and Aggressive Disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This is the first report of the development and performance of a platform that interrogates small noncoding RNAs (sncRNA) isolated from urinary exosomes. The Sentinel (TM) PCa Test classifies patients with prostate cancer from subjects with no evidence of prostate cancer, the miR Sentinel CS Test stratifies patients with prostate cancer between those with low risk prostate cancer (Grade Group 1) from those with intermediate and high risk disease (Grade Group 2-5), and the miR Sentinel HG Test stratifies patients with prostate cancer between those with low and favorable intermediate risk prostate cancer (Grade Group 1 or 2) and those with high risk (Grade Group 3-5) disease.Materials and Methods: sncRNAs were extracted from urinary exosomes of 235 participants and interrogated on miR 4.0 microarrays. Using proprietary selection and classification algorithms, informative sncRNAs were selected to customize an interrogation OpenArray (TM) platform that forms the basis of the tests. The tests were validated using a case-control sample of 1,436 subjects.Results: The performance of the miR Sentinel PCa Test demonstrated a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 92%.

TI  - Photochemical reflectance index (PRI) can be used to improve the relationship between gross primary productivity (GPP) and sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite much progress has been made in recent years, the estimation of terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) remains highly uncertain. Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from plants for estimating GPP. In this study, the relationships of GPP to SIF and Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) under different environmental conditions are established using carbon flux data at 61 sites distributed globally and coincident SIF data from OCO-2 and PRI data from MODIS. We analyzed OCO-2 SIF data at both 757 nm and 771 nm against instantaneous and daily GPP values derived from the tower flux data. Our results for these four cases are similar, and those with SIF at 757 nm and daily GPP show that: (1) a significant relationship is found between GPP and observed SIF (SIFobs) for all vegetation types (R-2 = 0.53, RMSE = 4.28 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) p < .001); (2) NIRv, a product of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and near-infrared reflectance, can be used as an approximation of the canopy-escaping probability of emitted SIF to convert observed SIF at one angle to the hemispherical SIF emission that is better correlated to GPP. The relationship between GPP and SIFobs/NIRv was considerably improved from that between GPP and SIFobs (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 3.39 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), p < .001); (3) The remaining scatter in the relationship between GPP and SIFobs/NIRv is significantly negatively correlated to PRI (R-2 = 0.28-0.34, p < .001), and PRI can be used to improve the relationship between GPP and SIFobs/NIRv, (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 3.04 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), p < .001); and (4) After the use of PRI in the regression, the variability of the slope of GPP against SIF among different plant functional types is greatly reduced from 33% to 19%. As PRI is an indicator of the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), a pathway that is in parallel of photochemical quenching and chlorophyll fluorescence, these improvements suggest that the information of NPQ from PRI can be used in addition to SIF for better GPP estimation.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution Characteristics in Ecosystem Service Values Based on Land Use/Cover Change in the Tarim River Basin, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores the watershed land use and ecosystem services value (ESV) space-time evolution characteristics in the Tarim River Basin in China's arid northwest. The study applies spatial correlation analysis using Landsat TM remote sensing images for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2018. The land use data are extracted and the ESV coefficients are adjusted accordingly. The results show as follows: (1) From 1990 to 2018, land use in the Tarim River Basin changed significantly. Construction land, cultivated land, and water exhibited an increasing trend, while grassland, forest land, and water indicated a decreasing trend. Construction land increased the most, while water decreased the most. (2) Overall, ESV in the Tarim Basin charted a downward trend, from 872.884 billion RMB in 1990 to 767.165 billion RMB in 2018. From 2015 to 2018, the Basin's ESV suffered the largest declines, with grassland ESV accounting for over 39% of the loss and adjustment services accounting for over 62%. (3) During the study period, the spatial distribution of ESV in the study area showed spatial distribution characterized that was either high in all directions or low in the middle, with significant positive spatial autocorrelation. The spatial distribution of ESV dynamic changes showed that ESV value-added regions were distributed in the southeast portion of the study area, while the ESV loss regions were distributed in the western and northern portions of the study area.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Estimation Based on Remote Sensing and the SEBAL Model in the Bosten Lake Basin of China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important part of both water balance and energy balance. Accordingly, the estimation of ET plays a key role in research related to regional water resources and energy balance. Using the largest inland freshwater lake in China-Bosten Lake Basin-as a target area, this study employs the SEBAL model combined with actual surface ET from the 2013 MODIS ET data to estimate ET in the Bosten Lake Basin from a time and space perspective. The findings include the following: (1) Evapotranspiration in the Bosten Lake Basin shows a unimodal distribution in terms of time distribution, with the highest ET occurring in July and August. In terms of spatial distribution, the overall trend is more apparent in the northwest portion of the basin than the southeast portion, as there are more mountains in the northwest as well as fewer desert areas. (2) Grassland and unused land were the main types of land cover, and ET exhibited a clear relationship to vegetation coverage and water supply. The distribution of land use types from northwest to southeast ET show a significant downward trend. (3) During the growing season, the average daily ET level of land use/cover type was the greatest over water bodies (5.61 mm/d), followed by grassland (4.6 mm/d) and snow/ice (4.29 mm/d), with unused land giving the smallest amounts of ET.

TI  - Changes of inundation area and water turbidity of Tonle Sap Lake: responses to climate changes or upstream dam construction?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using long-term Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat satellite observations, the inundation changes of Tonle Sap Lake between 1988 and 2018 were investigated. The results show that the inundation area was stable before 2000, followed by a significant shrinking trend between 2000 and 2018. Quantitative remote sensing retrievals for concentrations of the total suspended sediments (TSS) also demonstrate an evident increasing trend (7.92 mg l(-1)yr(-1)) since 2000. A strong correlation (R-2= 0.67) was found between the annual mean inundation area and concurrent precipitation in a region located in the lower basin of the Mekong River (mostly outside the drainage basin of Tonle Sap Lake). A multiple general linear model (GLM) regression further pointed to the precipitation variation as a major contributor (76.1%) to the interannual fluctuation of the inundation area, while the dams constructed in China only contributed to 6.9%. The limited impacts of Chinese dams on the inundation area of the lake could be revealed through the limited fraction of water discharge from the Mekong River within China (similar to 17%). The analysis also found significant impacts of inundation changes on the recent lake turbidity increase in the dry seasons. We clearly revealed that the contribution of dam construction in China to the recent lake shrinkage was insignificant when compared with the impacts of the precipitation decrease. The results of this study provide important scientific evidence for settling water volume-related transboundary disputes regarding the control of the inundation area and water turbidity of Tonle Sap Lake.

TI  - An Effective Method for Detecting Clouds in GaoFen-4 Images of Coastal Zones
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud-cover information is important for a wide range of scientific studies, such as the studies on water supply, climate change, earth energy budget, etc. In remote sensing, correct detection of clouds plays a crucial role in deriving the physical properties associated with clouds that exert a significant impact on the radiation budget of planet earth. Although the traditional cloud detection methods have generally performed well, these methods were usually developed specifically for particular sensors in a particular region with a particular underlying surface (e.g., land, water, vegetation, and man-made objects). Coastal regions are known to have a variety of underlying surfaces, which represent a major challenge in cloud detection. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement for developing a cloud detection method that could be applied to a variety of sensors, situations, and underlying surfaces. In the present study, a cloud detection method based on spatial and spectral uniformity of clouds was developed. In addition to having a spatially uniform texture, a spectrally approximate value was also present between the blue and green bands of the cloud region. The blue and green channel data appeared more uniform over the cloudy region, i.e., the entropy of the cloudy region was lower than that of the cloud-free region. On the basis of this difference in entropy, it would be possible to categorize the satellite images into cloud region images and cloud-free region images. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method was validated by applying it to the data from various sensors across the coastal zone of the South China Sea. The experimental results demonstrated that compared to the existing operational algorithms, EN-clustering exhibited higher accuracy and scalability, and also performed robustly regardless of the spatial resolution of the different satellite images. It is concluded that the EN-clustering algorithm proposed in the present study is applicable to different sensors, different underlying surfaces, and different regions, with the support of NDSI and NDBI indices to remove the interference information from snow, ice, and man-made objects.

TI  - Assessment of Sentinel-2 Satellite Images and Random Forest Classifier for Rainforest Mapping in Gabon
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is focused on the assessment of the potential of Sentinel-2 satellite images and the Random Forest classifier for mapping forest cover and forest types in northwest Gabon. The main goal was to investigate the impact of various spectral bands collected by the Sentinel-2 satellite, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and digital elevation model (DEM), and their combination on the accuracy of the classification of forest cover and forest type. Within the study area, five classes of forest type were delineated: semi-evergreen moist forest, lowland forest, freshwater swamp forest, mangroves, and disturbed natural forest. The classification was performed using the Random Forest (RF) classifier. The overall accuracy for the forest cover ranged between 92.6% and 98.5%, whereas for forest type, the accuracy was 83.4 to 97.4%. The highest accuracy for forest cover and forest type classifications were obtained using a combination of spectral bands at spatial resolutions of 10 m and 20 m and DEM. In both cases, the use of the NDVI did not increase the classification accuracy. The DEM was shown to be the most important variable in distinguishing the forest type. Among the Sentinel-2 spectral bands, the red-edge followed by the SWIR contributed the most to the accuracy of the forest type classification. Additionally, the Random Forest model for forest cover classification was successfully transferred from one master image to other images. In contrast, the transferability of the forest type model was more complex, because of the heterogeneity of the forest type and environmental conditions across the study area.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Trends in Wildfires across the Western United States (1950-2019)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire regimes are changing across the globe with several ecosystems witnessing more frequent fires across longer fire seasons. The western United States is one such region. The NASA RECOVER Historic Fires Database (HFD) contains all documented wildfires across the western United States occurring between 1950 and 2019 (n= 55,566). This study analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of these wildfires using ArcGIS Pro Geographic Information System (GIS) software to characterize changes in fire frequency, size, and severity over time. Analysis of annual fire frequency and acres burned reveals a near exponential growth in fire frequency (R-2= 0.71,P< 0.001) and size (R-2= 0.67,P< 0.001) since 1950. A comparison of mean and median acres burned annually suggests the occurrence of mega-fires (wildfires burning more than 100,000 acres) is also increasing. To illustrate this, this study found the mean size of fires occurring in the decade of the 1950s was 1204 acres while in the most recent decade (2010-2019) mean fire size has more than doubled, reaching an average of 3474 acres. The trend in fire severity between 2001 and 2017 used 365 Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) layers calculated using Landsat or Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Results suggest fire severity has remained relatively stable in light of increasing fire frequency and size, however more research is required to more fully understand changes in fire severity. The results of this study and other related studies are important as they provide useful information to land managers and policy makers regarding the changing wildfire regime currently being witnessed across the western United States.

TI  - Minimum Redundancy Array-A Baseline Optimization Strategy for Urban SAR Tomography
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR) is able to separate multiple scatterers layovered inside the same resolution cell in high-resolution SAR images of urban scenarios, usually with a large number of orbits, making it an expensive and unfeasible task for many practical applications. Targeting at finding out the minimum number of images necessary for tomographic reconstruction, this paper innovatively applies minimum redundancy array (MRA) for tomographic baseline array optimization. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted by means of Two-step Iterative Shrinkage/Thresholding (TWIST) and Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) to fully evaluate the tomographic performance of MRA orbits in terms of detection rates, Cramer Rao Lower Bounds, as well as resistance against sidelobes. Experiments on COSMO-SkyMed and TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X data are also conducted in this paper. The results from simulations and experiments on real data have both demonstrated that introducing MRA for baseline optimization in SAR tomography can benefit from the dramatic reduction of necessary orbit numbers, if the recently proposed TWIST method is used for tomographic reconstruction. Although the simulation and experiments in this manuscript are carried out using spaceborne data, the outcome of this paper can also give examples for airborne TomoSAR when designing flight orbits using airborne sensors.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution of land ecological sensitivity in arid inland river basin based on remote sensing index: A case of Wuwei City in Shiyang River Basin
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the effectiveness of the Shiyang River Basin governance project, with Wuwei, a key area of the river basin, as the research area. Based on the remote sensing data and analysis of GIS, with four indices including soil erosion, soil desertification, soil water content and soil salinization, the evaluation system of land ecological sensitivity in Wuwei was established. With the principal component analysis, we analyzed spatial distribution of land ecological sensitivity in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018 and the temporal and spatial evolution patterns. Results showed that: (1) land ecological sensitivity was generally lower in the south. west and higher in the northeast, with a gradual distribution pattern. Some moderately/intensively sensitive land had been transformed into mildly/slightly sensitive land, resulting in a reduction of the overall sensitivity. (2) Over 50% of the land had a relatively low frequency of sensitivity changes, without large-scale high-frequency conversion. The frequency of different land types varied significantly, while the internal distribution was relatively concentrated. (3) More than 90% of land ecological sensitivity change was stable or fluctuating, and in some areas, the pat. tern was in fluctuating declining or rising. Overall, the restored land area was larger than the degraded area and the land ecological environment was tending good. (4) The fluctuation range of land ecological sensitivity was from 0 to 1.8, which was unstable. A deteriorating process was recorded from 1995 to 2005 and gradually recovering process from 2005 to 2018, indicating that ecological environment in the Shiyang River Basin had been improved and that the outputs of ecological management were remarkable.

TI  - Evaluation of Different Radiative Transfer Models for Microwave Backscatter Estimation of Wheat Fields
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to analyze existing microwave surface (Oh, Dubois, Water Cloud Model "WCM", Integral Equation Model "IEM") and canopy (Water Cloud Model "WCM", Single Scattering Radiative Transfer "SSRT") Radiative Transfer (RT) models and assess advantages and disadvantages of different model combinations in terms of VV polarized radar backscatter simulation of wheat fields. The models are driven with field measurements acquired in 2017 at a test site near Munich, Germany. As vegetation descriptor for the canopy models Leaf Area Index (LAI) was used. The effect of empirical model parameters is evaluated in two different ways: (a) empirical model parameters are set as static throughout the whole time series of one growing season and (b) empirical model parameters describing the backscatter attenuation by the canopy are treated as non-static in time. The model results are compared to a dense Sentinel-1 C-band time series with observations every 1.5 days. The utilized Sentinel-1 time series comprises images acquired with different satellite acquisition geometries (different incidence and azimuth angles), which allows us to evaluate the model performance for different acquisition geometries. Results show that total LAI as vegetation descriptor in combination with static empirical parameters fit Sentinel-1 radar backscatter of wheat fields only sufficient within the first half of the vegetation period. With the saturation of LAI and/or canopy height of the wheat fields, the observed increase in Sentinel-1 radar backscatter cannot be modeled. Probable cause are effects of changes within the grains (both structure and water content per leaf area) and their influence on the backscatter. However, model results with LAI and non-static empirical parameters fit the Sentinel-1 data well for the entire vegetation period. Limitations regarding different satellite acquisition geometries become apparent for the second half of the vegetation period. The observed overall increase in backscatter can be modeled, but a trend mismatch between modeled and observed backscatter values of adjacent time points with different acquisition geometries is observed.

TI  - A novel approach to optimize hierarchical vegetation mapping from hyper-temporal NDVI imagery, demonstrated at national level for Namibia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel methodological approach to countrywide vegetation mapping. We used green vegetation biomass over the year as captured by coarse resolution hyper-temporal NDVI satellite-imagery, to generate vegetation mapping units at the biome, ecoregion and at the next lower hierarchical level for Namibia, excluding the Zambezi Region. Our method was based on a time series of 15 years of SPOT-VGT-MVC images each representing a specific 10-day period (dekad). The ISODATA unsupervised clustering technique was used to separately create 2-100 NDVI-cluster maps. The optimal number of temporal NDVI-clusters to represent the information on vegetation contained in the imagery was established by divergence separability statistics of all generated NDVI-clusters. The selected map consisted of legend of 81 cluster-specific temporal NDVI-profiles covering each a 15-year period of averaged NDVI data representing all pixels classified to that cluster. Then, by legend-entry using the dekad-medians of all 15 annual repeats, we produced generalized legend-entries without year-specific anomalies for each cluster. Subsequently, a hierarchical cluster analysis of these temporal NDVI-profiles was used to produce a dendrogram that generated grouping options for the 81 legend-entries. Maps with cluster-groups of 8 and 4 legend-entries resulted. The 81-cluster map and its 65 legend-entries vector version have no equivalent in published vegetation maps. The 8 cluster-group map broadly corresponds with published ecoregion level maps and the 4 cluster-group map with the published biome maps in their number of legend units. The published vegetation maps varied considerably from our NDVI-profile maps in the location of mapping unit boundaries. The agreement index between our map and published biome maps ranges from 70- 93. For the ecoregion level, the agreement index is much lower, namely 51 - 75. Our methodological approach showed a considerably higher discretionary power for hierarchical levels and the number of vegetation mapping units than the approaches applied to previously published maps. We recommended an approach to transform our three hyper-temporal NDVI-profiles based legend-entries into more specific vegetation units. This might be accomplished by re-analysis of available, spatially-comprehensive plant species occurrence data.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Psychedelic-Assisted Psychotherapy for Mental Health: An Evaluation of the Current Wave of Research and Suggestions for the Future
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF CONSCIOUSNESS-THEORY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Research on psychedelics has seen a recent revival, with many clinical trials focused on their therapeutic potential to treat a range of mental health conditions. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for mental health conditions from the present wave of psychedelic research (1990s to present). A total of 43 studies met criteria and were included. The conditions reviewed were substance use disorders; anxiety and/or depression, often associated with terminal illness; posttraumatic stress disorder; and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Quantitative results indicate that psychedelics can significantly reduce clinical outcomes associated with these mental health conditions. Common themes identified from qualitative reports included increased acceptance and processing of emotions, connectedness to others, forgiveness, self-compassion, insights into the self, peak or mystical experiences, ego dissolution, positive changes in worldview, motivation and commitment to change, changes in the relationship to the substance of abuse for those with substance use disorder, and acceptance of death for those with terminal illness. No serious, long-term adverse events were reported directly attributable to drug ingestion. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the research base, along with suggestions for clinical practice, potential therapeutic mechanisms, and directions for future research. Despite promising results, further work is needed to determine which psychedelic is best suited for diverse mental health conditions, the most appropriate type of psychotherapy to employ, and the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying clinical benefits.

TI  - Victim to Victor: The Appeal of Apocalyptic Hope
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Jewish apocalyptic literature emerged as a form of resistance literature during the intertestamental period. A product of marginalized communities, such literature is highly political, articulating the worldview of the politically oppressed and those who considered their religious freedoms to be under threat. As resistance literature, apocalypses cathartically utilize vivid descriptions of violence and poetic symbols of hope to encourage those who identify as victims to maintain their resistance to political pressure or injustice. This paper explores the ways the Christian Book of Revelation builds on this tradition to envisage hope in the face of systemic evil, political oppression, and injustice. Neither the noun nor verb for hope appear in Revelation, yet its eschatological vision of vindication, victory, and shared rule in New Jerusalem for those who are oppressed has inspired many Christians to hope for a new world order with significant implications for the present. After considering the historical context of Revelation, this paper will examine the ways the apocalyptic imagination of Revelation continues to be invoked and (mis)used in contemporary Christianized political discourse. I argue that the Book of Revelation continues to appeal precisely because it offers a framework for believing that the victim will become the victor in the eschaton.

TI  - State of Science Assessment of Remote Sensing of Great Lakes Coastal Wetlands: Responding to an Operational Requirement
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this research was to develop a state of science synthesis of remote sensing technologies that could be used to track changes in Great Lakes coastal vegetation for the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Adaptive Management (GLAM) Committee. The mapping requirements included a minimum mapping unit (MMU) of either 2 x 2 m or 4 x 4 m, a digital elevation model (DEM) accuracy in x and y of 2 m, a "z" value or vertical accuracy of 1-5 cm, and an accuracy of 90% for the classes of interest. To determine the appropriate remote sensing sensors, we conducted an extensive literature review. The required high degree of accuracy resulted in the elimination of many of the remote sensing sensors used in other wetland mapping applications including synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical imagery with a resolution >1 m. Our research showed that remote sensing sensors that could at least partially detect the different types of wetland vegetation in this study were the following types: (1) advanced airborne "coastal" Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with either a multispectral or a hyperspectral sensor, (2) colour-infrared aerial photography (airplane) with (optimum) 8 cm resolution, (3) colour-infrared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography with vertical accuracy determination rated at 10 cm, (4) colour-infrared UAV photography with high vertical accuracy determination rated at 3-5 cm, (5) airborne hyperspectral imagery, and (6) very high-resolution optical satellite data with better than 1 m resolution.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer using methylene blue: a new anatomical landmark involving intercostobrachial and medial pectoral nodes
T2  - MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDONESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using blue dye is becoming popular in Indonesia given that knowledge on new anatomical landmarks involving intercostobrachial and medial pectoral nodes have replaced the need for radioisotope tracers. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of the proposed landmark involving intercostobrachial and medial pectoral nodes to determine axillary lymph node status during SLNB.METHODS A prospective study was conducted involving 55 patients with early-stage breast cancer who had clinically negative lymph nodes (T1-T2, cN0) between 2018 and 2019 at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. During SLNB, methylene blue 1% was injected at the subareolar area to identify intercostobrachial and medial pectoral nodes followed by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Histopathological results of sentinel nodes (SNs) were then compared to those of other axillary nodes.RESULTS SNs were identified in 54 patients (98%), 33 (61%) of whom had both intercostobrachial and medial pectoral SNs. Among patients with SNs, there were 1 patient without intercostobrachial SNs, 10 patients without medial pectoral SNs, and 1 patient with medial pectoral SNs but no intercostobrachial SNs. Accordingly, SNs had a negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.77% for axillary metastasis (95% confidence interval = 81.54-99.51), with a false negative rate of 4.7%. No serious adverse events was observed.CONCLUSIONS The high identification rate and NPV, as well as the low false negative rate of the new anatomical landmark involving intercostobrachial and medial pectoral nodes during SLNB, suggest its reliability in determining axillary lymph node status.

TI  - Comparing simple albedo scaling methods for estimating Arctic glacier mass balance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mass balance measurements in the Canadian Arctic are limited, particularly for smaller glaciers, which introduces significant uncertainties in regional mass balance assessment. Here we report on the correlations between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra albedo measurements (Version 6) and net annual mass balance for five glaciers in the Canadian Arctic over the period 2002-2016. Three glacier albedo aggregation methods are tested for the melt season (June, July and August): minimum, raw average, and interpolated average. These are evaluated in terms of a 53-71% reduction in observations due to cloud cover in the raw albedo time series. For the minimum method, the whole glacier albedo is calculated from the average of the minimum melt season albedo of each grid cell, irrespective of the day on which they occurred, resulting in R-2 values between 0.20 and 0.87. In the raw average method, averaging all albedo values within a glacier outline over the melt season improves the correlation to mass balance to a range of 0.61-0.95. In the interpolated average method, linear interpolation of the raw average albedo values to fill cloud gaps, then averaging them, improves the raw average correlations for all ice masses by similar to 5% (R-2 range 0.68-0.97). Overall, the interpolated average albedo method performs substantially better for the smallest glacier than the minimum or the raw average methods. The most negative net mass balance occurs at Grise Fiord Glacier, which is the smallest (<4.0 km(2)), but not the lowest elevation, glacier analysed. For this glacier, the interpolated average albedo improves the correlation with mass balance to an R-2 = 0.68 (p-value < .05), compared to an R-2 = 0.17 for the minimum albedo method (p-value > .05). When the five glaciers' interpolated average albedo is correlated to their ensemble mass balance, an R-2 = 0.82 is achieved. These results show that interpolated MODIS Terra melt season albedo measurements can realistically approximate net annual glacier mass balance for Arctic glaciers and ice caps, without additional information about precipitation or temperature, and in the absence of a melt model.

TI  - Estimating Mangrove Above-Ground Biomass Loss Due to Deforestation in Malaysian Northern Borneo between 2000 and 2015 Using SRTM and Landsat Images
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are highly productive ecosystems and play an important role in the global carbon cycle. We used Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data to estimate mangrove above-ground biomass (AGB) in Sabah, Malaysian northern Borneo. We developed a tree-level approach to deal with the substantial temporal discrepancy between the SRTM data and the mangrove's field measurements. We predicted the annual growth of diameter at breast height and adjusted the field measurements to the SRTM data acquisition year to estimate the field AGB. A canopy height model (CHM) was derived by correcting the SRTM data with ground elevation. Regression analyses between the estimated AGB and SRTM CHM produced an estimation model (R-2: 0.61) with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.24 Mg ha(-1) (RMSE%: 5.47). We then quantified the mangrove forest loss based on supervised classification of multitemporal Landsat images. More than 25,000 ha of mangrove forest had disappeared between 2000 and 2015. This has resulted in a significant decrease of about 3.96 million Mg of mangrove AGB in Sabah during the study period. As SRTM elevation data has a near-global coverage, this approach can be used to map the historical AGB of mangroves, especially in Southeast Asia, to promote mangrove carbon stock conservation.

TI  - Surface water detection in the Caucasus
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Caucasus is an important global diversity hotspot and hosts a wide variety of surface water features, including major transboundary wetlands, in addition to large areas with irrigated agriculture and newly developed fishponds. In this study, we aim to establish the best performing methodology to produce surface water maps with a high degree of accuracy in the Caucasus. We evaluate optical data from Landsat 8 in both the dry and we season for three study areas in the Caucasus. We test the performance of four different optical water indices derived from Landsat data, a method by Lou et al (2017) also applied to Landsat data, and the European Commission Joint Research Centre (ECJRC) Global Surface Water dataset. We evaluate the performance of each water index using 5744 land cover validation/training points over all three study areas, which we manually classified by evaluating imagery from Google Earth. Using all validation points from all three study areas and both the we and dry season, we find that the application of a logistic regression model using an optical surface water index (MNDWI) resulted in the most accurate open surface water maps. This approach achieved an overall accuracy of 93.0%, which is better than was found for freely available global surface water products.

TI  - Landscape evolution and the environmental context of human occupation of the southern pampa del tamarugal, Atacama Desert, Chile
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - As with most living organisms, human populations respond to climatic, environmental, and population pressures by transforming their range and subsistence strategies over space and time. An understanding of human ecology can be gained when the archaeological record is placed within the context of dynamic landscape changes and alterations in natural resource availability. We reconstructed the landscape evolution of the Quebrada Mani fan complex, situated along the west-facing slope of the Central Andes in the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert, an area that contains an archaeological record that spans almost 13,000 years. Surficial geologic mapping and dating of three 2-12 km(2) study sites, in conjunction with archaeological records and analysis of remotely sensed data for the similar to 400 km(2) fan complex, was conducted to reconstruct the landscape evolution and the way of life of Paleoindian (ca. 12.8-11.5 ka) and early/late Formative (ca 2.5 to 0.7 ka) social groups.Just prior to any known human occupation, a large pluvial event in the high Andes, regionally referred to as CAPE I, impacted the Quebrada Mani fan complex from ca.18-16.5 ka. During CAPE I, the Mani fan complex was dominated by perennial stream systems that deposited well-sorted conglomerates in the upper reaches of the fan (Unit T2) and perennial wetlands (Unit B1). This pluvial period was followed by the onset of an extreme drought sometime after 15 ka, but before 13 ka, when wetlands desiccated and the distal reaches of the fan deflated. Sand sheets and sand dunes were deposited across broad reaches of the landscape and Quebrada Mani incised 3-5 m into its floodplain. This drought had profound implications for the distribution of natural resources during the subsequent pluvial event (CAPE II) that ensued from ca. 12.5-9.5 ka. Incision along the upper reaches of the fan caused a more restricted floodplain and allowed the deposition of extensive wetlands along the more distal central reaches of the fan where groundwater emerged. Paleoindian residential open-air camps were placed in these areas. Wetlands were replaced by a tree-covered floodplain during the latter portion of this pluvial event (ca. 10.5-9 ka).We found no archaeological evidence for human occupations between similar to 8-2.5 ka, suggesting a lack of natural resources and/or very low hunter-gatherer population densities. During this time, Quebrada Mani incised up to 8 m into the floodplain. Mudflow deposition - typical of the present-day fan complex - initiated around 2.5 ka, likely responding to an increase in precipitation. This triggered a re-population of the fan surface by Formative agricultural groups that irrigated and extensively farmed these flood-plains. By the end of the Formative, these socio-cultural groups became increasingly vulnerable to climatic changes as cut-and-fill cycles in the drainage necessitated major infrastructure adjustments, until the technologies and social-cultural convention of the epoch could not cope with environmental change and investments were abandoned by similar to 0.8 ka.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics and Environmental Controlling Factors of the Lake Tana Water Hyacinth in Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The largest freshwater lake in Ethiopia, Lake Tana, has faced ecological disaster due to water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) infestation. The water hyacinth is a threat not only to the ecology but also to the socioeconomic development of the region and cultural value of the lake, which is registered as a UNESCO reserve. This study aims to map the spatiotemporal dynamics of the water hyacinth using high-resolution PlanetScope satellite images and assesses the major environmental variables that relate to the weed spatial coverage dynamics for the period August 2017 to July 2018. The plausible environmental factors studied affecting the weed dynamics include lake level, water and air temperature, and turbidity. Water temperature and turbidity were estimated from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite image and the water level was estimated using Jason-1 altimetry data while the air temperature was obtained from the nearby meteorological station at Bahir Dar station. The results indicated that water hyacinth coverage was increasing at a rate of 14 ha/day from August to November of 2017. On the other hand, the coverage reduced at a rate of 6 ha/day from December 2017 to June 2018. However, the length of shoreline infestation increased significantly from 4.3 km in August 2017 to 23.4 km in April 2018. Lake level and night-time water temperatures were strongly correlated with water hyacinth spatial coverage (p< 0.05). A drop in the lake water level resulted in a considerable reduction of the infested area, which is also related to decreasing nutrient levels in the water. The water hyacinth expansion dynamics could be altered by treating the nutrient-rich runoff with best management practices along the wetland and in the lake watershed landscape.

TI  - The moving of high emission for biomass burning in China: View from multi-year emission estimation and human-driven forces
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning (BB) has significant impacts on air quality, climate and human health. In China, the BB emission has changed substantially over the past decades while the mull-year variation held high uncertainty and the driving forces have addressed little attention. Here, this research aimed to conduct a comprehensive and systematic analysis of BB variation in China and provided precise and targeted BB emission reduction suggestions. The moving of high emission for BB from 2003 to 2014 was clearly identified, by the view of reliable emission estimation and anthropogenic impacts. Multiple satellite products, field survey, time varying biomass loading data and measured emission factors were adopted to better estimating BB emission and reducing the uncertainty. Social-economic analysis was added to assess the anthropogenic impacts on high emission variation quantitatively. Results showed that the cumulative BB emissions of OC, EC, CH4, NOx, NMVOC, SO2, NH3, CO, CO2, PM2.5 and PM10 during 2003-2014 were 1.6 x 10(4), 5.64 x 10(3), 3.57 x 10(4), 1.7 x 10(4), 5.44 x 10(4), 2.96 x 10(3), 6.77 x 10(3), 6.5 x 10(5), 1.15 x 10(7), 5.26 x 10(4) and 6.04 x 10(4) Gg, respectively. Crop straw burning (in-field and domestic) in northeast China plain (NEP), north China plain (NCP), northern arid and semiarid region and loess plateau were the key sources, averagely contributed 73% for all the pollutants emission. While domestic straw burning and firewood burning in Sichuan basin (SB), Yunnan-Guizhou plateau and southern China were main contributors, averagely accounting for 70% of all the pollutants emission. On regional level, high emissions were mainly found in SB, NCP and NEP. Temporally, high emissions were mainly found in crop sowing harvesting and heating seasons. From 2003 to 2014, the BB emission for different biomass species has changed significantly in different regions. High emission has gradually moved from SB to NCP and NEP. Firewood burning and domestic straw burning emission decreased by 47% and 14% in SB, respectively. Infield straw burning emission increased by 52% and 231% in NCP and NEP respectively and domestic straw burning emission increased by 62% in NEP. Emissions from heating season have decreased while emissions in corn harvest season were continuously increased. Analysis of Environmental kuznets curve, agricultural productivity level, human burning habits, rural energy structure and local control policies revealed the internal human driving strength of the variation for BB emission. The unbalanced development of social economy and the policy bias were primary drivers of limiting the BB management. BB emission will alleviate in NCP and aggravate in NEP. For the further emission reduction, effective measures for corn sources management, straw returning and rural energy utilization should be systematically considered. This research provides a clear evidence for the multi-year variation pattern of BB emissions, which is critical for pollution prediction, air quality modeling and targeted mitigation strategies for the key regions of China.

TI  - Comparison of indocyanine green and methylene blue use for axillary reverse mapping during axillary lymph node dissection
T2  - MEDCOMM
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) is a technique to identify arm lymphatic drainage during axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). This study compared the feasibility of ARM using indocyanine green (ICG) or methylene blue (MB), and accessed the oncologic safety of the procedure. Overall, 158 patients qualified for ALND were enrolled. The characteristics of ARM-identified nodes were recorded with ICG (n = 78) or MB (n = 80) visualization. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the nodes were performed and validated by histologic analysis. The nodal identification rate in the ICG group significantly surpassed that of the MB group (87.2% vs 52.5%, P < .05) with fewer complications. Note that 10.9% of the patients had metastatic involvement of the ARM-identified nodes. Also 80% of the positive nodes were found in areas B and D, while the ARM-identified nodes mainly located in area A. All the 51 nodes diagnosed as negative of malignancy by FNAC were free of metastasis. Nodal metastasis was significantly correlated with extensive nodel involvement, advanced disease, and the characteristics of identified nodes. In conclusion, ICG appears superior to MB for ARM nodes identification. FNAC, together with the features of primary tumors and ARM nodes, can delineate which nodes could be preserved during ALND.

TI  - Surging Dynamics of Glaciers in the Hunza Valley under an Equilibrium Mass State since 1990
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have shown that glacier changes were heterogeneous in the western Karakoram, with the coexistence of retreating, advancing, and surging glaciers. However, it remains unclear that the mechanisms driving these changes. Based on the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM and TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X images (2014), this study presents glacier surface height changes in the Hunza Basin of the western Karakoram, employing the method of differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR). A slight negative glacier mass balance was observed in the Hunza Basin during 2000-2014. Surge-type glaciers would not have an obvious effect on overall mass balance in regional assessments over long-time scales. Further, glacier surface velocities in the Hunza Basin were estimated from Landsat images for the period of 1990-2018 by utilizing published data sets and Landsat images. Compared to the annual glacier surface velocities, 22 surge events were observed in seven surge-type glaciers in the Hunza Basin. Glacier flow can be attributed to thermally and hydrologically control, and the geomorphological characteristics of different individuals. This study gives us a new insight into the situation of the "Karakoram anomaly" under the background of glacier mass loss in the high mountains of Asia (HMA).

TI  - Remote Sensing of Spatial-Temporal Variation of Chlorophyll-a in the Jiaozhou Bay Using 32 Years Landsat Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla, mu g/L) is a vital indicator of water quality and eutrophication, yet optical complexity and significant variability of coastal waters make the accurate estimation of Chla challenging. Monitoring spatial-temporal distribution and variation of Chla and comprehending the correlation between Chla and environmental factors are necessary for long-term water quality assessment. This study calibrated and validated the Chla estimation model with satisfactory performance (R-2, RMSE, and MRE values are 0.77, 0.64 mu g/L, and 32.5 %) and further characterized the spatial-temporal variation of Chla in Jiaozhou Bay (JZB) based on 381 cloud-free Landsat images of 32 years (1986-2017). The annual mean Chla in JZB reached the highest value in 1997 and decreased gradually in the following two decades. The seasonal variation of Chla is obvious: the highest value of Chla appeared in summer, followed by spring, autumn and winter. Accordingly, the monthly averaged Chla peaked in July, while the minimum occurred in January. The spatial distribution of Chla on different time scales shared a similar pattern. High Chla appeared in the northwestern part of JZB and decreased gradually to the southwest, resulting in the lowest Chla near the water channel connected to the open sea. The spatial heterogeneity mainly arose from river discharge, while the temporal heterogeneity may be caused by seasonal variations in precipitation, temperature, and river discharge. This study indicated that the empirical models for the Landsat data could effectively monitor the long-term Chla variation in JZB.

TI  - FY-3D MERSI On-Orbit Radiometric Calibration from the Lunar View
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Limited by the on-orbital calibration capability, scaling the measured radiance in accuracy and stability is challenging for the Earth observation satellites in the reflective solar bands (RSBs). Although the lunar calibration is a well-developed technique in the RSBs, limited work has been done for Chinese Earth observation satellites. To improve the on-orbital calibration performance, the advanced MEdium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI II), which is the primary payload of the fourth satellite of the Fengyun 3 Series (FY-3D), expands the space view angle of the imager in order to capture better lunar images. In this study, we propose an absolute radiometric calibration method based on the FY-3D/MERSI lunar observation data. A lunar irradiance model named ROLO/GIRO has been used together with the necessary data procedures, including dark current count estimation, single pixel irradiance calculation, and full disk lunar irradiance calculation. The calibration coefficients obtained by the lunar calibration are compared with the pre-launch laboratory calibration. The results show that the deviations between the two calibration procedures are in a reasonable range in general. However, a relatively high non-linear response was found in the low energy incidence for some detectors, which leads to the large deviation in the corresponding bands. This study explored an ideal and independent method to validate MERSI on-orbit radiometric performance. The lunar calibration practiced for MERSI also gave a valuable example that can be recommended to the other Chinese Earth observation satellites.

TI  - Vehicle detection of multi-source remote sensing data using active fine-tuning network
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vehicle detection in remote sensing images has attracted increasing interest in recent years. However, its detection ability is limited due to lack of well-annotated samples, especially in densely crowded scenes. Furthermore, since a list of remotely sensed data sources is available, efficient exploitation of useful information from multi-source data for better vehicle detection is challenging. To solve the above issues, a multi-source active fine-tuning vehicle detection (Ms-AFt) framework is proposed, which integrates transfer learning, segmentation, and active classification into a unified framework for auto-labeling and detection. The proposed Ms-AFt employs a fine-tuning network to firstly generate a vehicle training set from an unlabeled dataset. To cope with the diversity of vehicle categories, a multi-source based segmentation branch is then designed to construct additional candidate object sets. The separation of high quality vehicles is realized by a designed attentive classifications network. Finally, all three branches are combined to achieve vehicle detection. Extensive experimental results conducted on two open ISPRS benchmark datasets, namely the Vaihingen village and Potsdam city datasets, demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed Ms-AFt for vehicle detection. In addition, the generalization ability of Ms-AFt in dense remote sensing scenes is further verified on stereo aerial imagery of a large camping site.

TI  - Comparison of water cloud models with different layers for rice yield estimation from a single TerraSAR image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses the estimation of rice yield from Water Cloud Models (WCM) with different layers by a single X-band (8-12 GHz) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image, from a satellite named TerraSAR. A simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, with a 'leave-one-out' cross-validation method, was applied. The results were related to actual rice parameters, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.6059, which not only demonstrated that a single-layer WCM was better than a double-layer WCM for grain number estimation, but also indicated the potential to estimate rice production from a single SAR image. A comparison of estimates indicated that the single-layer WCM overcame insufficiencies that existed in the double-layer WCM. The range of backscattering coefficients from the model was also discussed.

TI  - Biomass status and dynamics over Canada's forests: Disentangling disturbed area from associated aboveground biomass consequences
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forested ecosystems dominated by trees, wetlands, and lakes occupy more than 65% of Canada's land base. This treed area is dynamic, subject to temporary reductions in area and biomass due to wildfire and timber harvesting, and increases due to successional processes and growth. As such, the net aboveground biomass accumulated over time is a function of multiple, complex factors: standing forests grow and accrue biomass over time, whereas disturbed forests lose biomass, and subsequent regeneration processes result in biomass accrual once again. Knowledge of these processes behind biomass gain and loss is important for a range of considerations including habitat provision, economic opportunities, and exchange of carbon between forests and the atmosphere. Herein, we used a 33 year satellite-derived time series of aboveground biomass estimates for Canada's forested ecosystems to quantify biomass dynamics partitioned by the presence or absence of disturbance, and by disturbance type. Findings suggest that over the analysis period considered (1984-2016), undisturbed forests accounted for accrual of 3.90 Petagrams (Pg) of biomass. In contrast, while occupying similar to 75% less area, disturbed forests accounted for a loss of 3.94 Pg biomass. Of this total biomass reduction, 45.4% can be attributed to wildfire, 43.8% to harvesting, 8.3% to non-stand replacing disturbances, and 2.5% to detectable roads and infrastructure development. Following disturbance, an additional 1.32 Pg of biomass were accrued during the analysis period, along with an additional 4.09 Pg in newly treed areas. Overall, Canada's forested ecosystems have realized a net increase in biomass of 5.38 Pg. Results of this analysis demonstrate the decoupling of area disturbed from the resulting biomass consequences by disturbance type, with large areas of wildfire accounting for a change in biomass that is similar to that of forest harvesting, which occurs over a much smaller area of mature and productive forest.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation of Snow Depth in the Northern Hemisphere from 1992 to 2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive and hemispheric-scale snow cover and snow depth analysis is a prerequisite for all related processes and interactions investigation on regional and global surface energy and water balance, weather and climate, hydrological processes, and water resources. However, such studies were limited by the lack of data products and/or valid snow retrieval algorithms. The overall objective of this study is to investigate the variation characteristics of snow depth across the Northern Hemisphere from 1992 to 2016. We developed long-term Northern Hemisphere daily snow depth (NHSnow) datasets from passive microwave remote sensing data using the support vector regression (SVR) snow depth retrieval algorithm. NHSnow is evaluated, along with GlobSnow and ERA-Interim/Land, for its accuracy across the Northern Hemisphere against meteorological station snow depth measurements. The results show that NHSnow performs comparably well with a relatively high accuracy for snow depth with a bias of -0.6 cm, mean absolute error of 16 cm, and root mean square error of 20 cm when benchmarked against the station snow depth measurements. The analysis results show that annual average snow depth decreased by 0.06 cm per year from 1992 to 2016. In the three seasons (autumn, winter, and spring), the areas with a significant decreasing trend of seasonal maximum snow depth are larger than those with a significant increasing trend. Additionally, snow cover days decreased at the rate of 0.99 day per year during 1992-2016. This study presents that the variation trends of snow cover days are, in part, not consistent with the variation trends of the annual average snow depth, of which approximately 20% of the snow cover areas show the completely opposite variation trends for these two indexes over the study period. This study provides a new perspective in snow depth variation analysis, and shows that rapid changes in snow depth have been occurring since the beginning of the 21st century, accompanied by dramatic climate warming.

TI  - Time-Series Model-Adjusted Percentile Features: Improved Percentile Features for Land-Cover Classification Based on Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Percentile features derived from Landsat time-series data are widely adopted in land-cover classification. However, the temporal distribution of Landsat valid observations is highly uneven across different pixels due to the gaps resulting from clouds, cloud shadows, snow, and the scan line corrector (SLC)-off problem. In addition, when applying percentile features, land-cover change in time-series data is usually not considered. In this paper, an improved percentile called the time-series model (TSM)-adjusted percentile is proposed for land-cover classification based on Landsat data. The Landsat data were first modeled using three different time-series models, and the land-cover changes were continuously monitored using the continuous change detection (CCD) algorithm. The TSM-adjusted percentiles for stable pixels were then derived from the synthetic time-series data without gaps. Finally, the TSM-adjusted percentiles were used for generating supervised random forest classifications. The proposed methods were implemented on Landsat time-series data of three study areas. The classification results were compared with those obtained using the original percentiles derived from the original time-series data with gaps. The results show that the land-cover classifications obtained using the proposed TSM-adjusted percentiles have significantly higher overall accuracies than those obtained using the original percentiles. The proposed method was more effective for forest types with obvious phenological characteristics and with fewer valid observations. In addition, it was also robust to the training data sampling strategy. Overall, the methods proposed in this work can provide accurate characterization of land cover and improve the overall classification accuracy based on such metrics. The findings are promising for percentile-based land cover classification using Landsat time series data, especially in the areas with frequent cloud coverage.

TI  - Comparisons of passive microwave remote sensing sea ice concentrations with ship-based visual observations during the CHINARE Arctic summer cruises of 2010-2018
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to apply satellite data to guiding navigation in the Arctic more effectively, the sea ice concentrations (SIC) derived from passive microwave (PM) products were compared with ship-based visual observations (OBS) collected during the Chinese National Arctic Research Expeditions (CHINARE). A total of 3 667 observations were collected in the Arctic summers of 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018. PM SIC were derived from the NASA-Team (NT), Bootstrap (BT) and Climate Data Record (CDR) algorithms based on the SSMIS sensor, as well as the BT, enhanced NASA-Team (NT2) and ARTIST Sea Ice (ASI) algorithms based on AMSR-E/AMSR-2 sensors. The daily arithmetic average of PM SIC values and the daily weighted average of OBS SIC values were used for the comparisons. The correlation coefficients (CC), biases and root mean square deviations (RMSD) between PM SIC and OBS SIC were compared in terms of the overall trend, and under mild/normal/severe ice conditions. Using the OBS data, the influences of floe size and ice thickness on the SIC retrieval of different PM products were evaluated by calculating the daily weighted average of floe size code and ice thickness. Our results show that CC values range from 0.89 (AMSR-E/AMSR-2 NT2) to 0.95 (SSMIS NT), biases range from -3.96% (SSMIS NT) to 12.05% (AMSR-E/AMSR-2 NT2), and RMSD values range from 10.81% (SSMIS NT) to 20.15% (AMSR-E/AMSR-2 NT2). Floe size has a significant influence on the SIC retrievals of the PM products, and most of the PM products tend to underestimate SIC under smaller floe size conditions and overestimate SIC under larger floe size conditions. Ice thickness thicker than 30 cm does not have a significant influence on the SIC retrieval of PM products. Overall, the best (worst) agreement occurs between OBS SIC and SSMIS NT (AMSR-E/AMSR-2 NT2) SIC in the Arctic summer.

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing Methods and Fire Simulation Models to Estimate Fire Hazard in a South-East Mediterranean Protected Area
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Unlike low intensity fire which promotes landscape heterogeneity and important ecosystem services, large high-intensity wildfires constitute a significant destructive factor despite the increased amount of resources allocated to fire suppression and the improvement of firefighting tactics and levels of organization. Wildfires also affect properties, while an increasing number of fatalities are also associated with wildfires. It is now widely accepted that an effective wildfire management strategy can no longer rely on fire suppression alone. Scientific advances on fire behavior simulation and the increasing availability of remote sensing data, along with advanced systems of fire detection can significantly reduce fire hazards. In the current study remote sensing data and methods, and fire behavior simulation models are integrated to assess the fire hazard in a protected area of the southeast Mediterranean region and its surroundings. A spatially explicit fire hazard index was generated by combining fire intensity estimations and proxies of fire ignition probability. The results suggest that more than 50% of the study area, and the great majority of the protected area, is facing an extremely high hazard for a high-intensity fire. Pine forest formations, characterized by high flammability, low canopy base height and a dense shrub understory are facing the most critical hazard. The results are discussed in relation to the need for adopting an alternative wildfire management strategy.

TI  - Surface soil temperature seasonal variation estimation in a forested area using combined satellite observations and in-situ measurements
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil temperature is the soil temperature from the surface to 10 cm in depth. Surface soil temperature plays a significant role in agricultural drought monitoring, ecosystem energy transfer modeling, and global carbon cycle evaluation. Studies have been proposed to estimate surface soil temperature, but surface soil temperature monitoring within forested areas still poses a significant challenge. In this study, we proposed a surface soil temperature retrieval method using combined satellite observations and in-situ measurements for the Great Dismal Swamp (GDS). The GDS is a U.S. protected area managed and protected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It is located along the boundary of Virginia and North Carolina, with maple gum, Atlantic white cedar, and pine pocosin as the main forest cover types. Ground-based surface soil temperature measurements were collected for these forest types from May 2015 to April 2017. Both the Land Remote Sensing Satellite (Landsat) Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) carry two thermal infrared (TIR) channels. The TIR channels with similar corresponding wavelengths were first fused using an improved fusing model to generate high resolution TIR measurements. Then the enterprise algorithm was applied to calculate land surface temperature (LST) from the fused TIR bands. An improved soil temperature retrieval method was applied to generate surface soil temperature based on LST and vegetation index (VI) within the study area for the three forest types. In-situ measurements were used to build the surface soil temperature retrieval method, and results were then validated. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were integrated separately as VIs in the model to monitor surface soil temperature. The R-2 for retrieved surface soil temperature through satellite observations was 0.76, and the RMSE was 1.96 degrees C when NDVI was integrated in the model; the R-2 was 0.78, and the RMSE was 1.85 degrees C when EVI was used.

TI  - Tree Line Identification and Dynamics under Climate Change in Wuyishan National Park Based on Landsat Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The alpine tree line ecotone, reflecting interactions between climate and ecology, is very sensitive to climate change. To identify tree line responses to climate change, including intensity and local variations in tree line advancement, the use of Landsat images with long-term data series and fine spatial resolution is an option. However, it is a challenge to extract tree line data from Landsat images due to classification issues with outliers and temporal inconsistency. More importantly, direct classification results in sharp boundaries between forest and non-forest pixels/segments instead of representing the tree line ecotone (three ecological regions-tree species line, tree line, and timber line-are closely related to the tree line ecotone and are all significant for ecological processes). Therefore, it is important to develop a method that is able to accurately extract the tree line from Landsat images with a high temporal consistency and to identify the appropriate ecological boundary. In this study, a new methodology was developed based on the concept of a local indicator of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) to extract the tree line automatically from Landsat images. Tree line responses to climate change from 1987 to 2018 in Wuyishan National Park, China, were evaluated, and topographic effects on local variations in tree line advancement were explored. The findings supported the methodology based on the LISA concept as a valuable classifier for assessing the local spatial clusters of alpine meadows from images acquired in nongrowing seasons. The results showed that the automatically extracted line from Landsat images was the timber line due to the restriction in spatial autocorrelation. The results also indicate that parts of the tree line in the study area shifted upward vertically by 50 m under a 1 degrees C temperature increase during the period from 1987 to 2018, with local variations influenced by slope, elevation, and interactions with aspect. Our study contributes a novel result regarding the response of the alpine tree line to global warming in a subtropical region. Our method for automatic tree line extraction can provide fundamental information for ecosystem managers.

TI  - Forest and Crop Leaf Area Index Estimation Using Remote Sensing: Research Trends and Future Directions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important vegetation leaf structure parameter in forest and agricultural ecosystems. Remote sensing techniques can provide an effective alternative to field-based observation of LAI. Differences in canopy structure result in different sensor types (active or passive), platforms (terrestrial, airborne, or satellite), and models being appropriate for the LAI estimation of forest and agricultural systems. This study reviews the application of remote sensing-based approaches across different system configurations (passive, active, and multisource sensors on different collection platforms) that are used to estimate forest and crop LAI and explores uncertainty analysis in LAI estimation. A comparison of the difference in LAI estimation for forest and agricultural applications given the different structure of these ecosystems is presented, particularly as this relates to spatial scale. The ease of use of empirical models supports these as the preferred choice for forest and crop LAI estimation. However, performance variation among different empirical models for forest and crop LAI estimation limits the broad application of specific models. The development of models that facilitate the strategic incorporation of local physiology and biochemistry parameters for specific forests and crop growth stages from various temperature zones could improve the accuracy of LAI estimation models and help develop models that can be applied more broadly. In terms of scale issues, both spectral and spatial scales impact the estimation of LAI. Exploration of the quantitative relationship between scales of data from different sensors could help forest and crop managers more appropriately and effectively apply different data sources. Uncertainty coming from various sources results in reduced accuracy in estimating LAI. While Bayesian approaches have proven effective to quantify LAI estimation uncertainty based on the uncertainty of model inputs, there is still a need to quantify uncertainty from remote sensing data source, ground measurements and related environmental factors to mitigate the impacts of model uncertainty and improve LAI estimation.

TI  - Sensing Images for Assessing the Minimum Ecological Flux by Automatically Extracting River Surface Width
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming and economic development have intensified the evaporation and exploitation of river waters, resulting in reduced global river runoff. In minimum ecological flux management, objective determination of the minimum ecological flux and evaluation of whether a river complies with standards are urgently required. Satellite remote sensing allows for rapid, large-scale, and dynamic monitoring. Herein, the Tangmazhai cross-section of the Taizi River was analyzed using the Chinese Gaofen (GF) series satellite that comprises panchromatic multi-spectral sensors and the Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images to automatically extract the water surface width. We applied the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)-Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm (ISODATA) to 225 cloudless scenes from January 2015 to November 2019. We proposed a method to evaluate the minimum ecological flux using water surface width. The river surface width at this location increased from January 2015 to November 2019, and all widths exceeded the minimum river surface water width for the month. The degree of the minimum ecological flux guarantee was determined to be satisfactory. Because there are less clouds and rain in the North China than South China, our results may be used for evaluating the degree of minimum ecological flux guarantee of many river sections in the north China through monthly monitoring.

AB  - This work seeks an understanding of the elaboration of ceramic whistles in the community of Uayma, Yucatan. As part of the objectives, the tangible and intangible characteristics that involve the process of creating six selected aerophones from a larger sample of twelve sound artifacts were documented. The research frames the links of material culture, knowledge and technology used in the manufacture of aerophones, as well as the worldview of producers. The results of the morphology, acoustics and functionality of these artifacts are presented through an X-ray imaging study applied to the sample in order to understand the variants existing in the internal and external forms that regulate the conditions of execution, as well as the acoustics and functionality of the instrument. The present study adds, as an interpretive option, to the multiple proposals derived from the theme of production of ceramic sound artifacts for the Maya area.

TI  - Nahmanides' Disputes with Rashi as a Gateway to His Worldview
T2  - REVIEW OF RABBINIC JUDAISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Although he highly praises Rashi's Torah commentary, Nahmanides emphasizes that Rashi's work is not beyond criticism. This article points out one aspect of Nahmandes' disagreement with Rashi. Rashi, for his part, is willing to cite traditional Midrashic commentaries without significant additions, assuming that tradition is an effective tool for transmitting reliable information. Nahmanides argued with Rashi over this claim. Rather than sufficing to repeat exegetical traditions, in his Torah commentary, Nahmanides expands them and raises alternatives. In this way, he asserts the importance of analyzing all information critically. This article demonstrates how reservations regarding tradition stand behind several exegetical and halakhic disputes between Rashi and Nahmanides. Through analyzing this principle, the study demonstrates how Nahmanides, under the guise of a guardian of tradition, constructed an original, creative spiritual world in the areas of exegesis, halakha, and kabbalah.

TI  - Calibration and Validation of Antenna and Brightness Temperatures from Metop-C Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study carries out the calibration and validation of Antenna Temperature Data Record (TDR) and Brightness Temperature Sensor Data Record (SDR) data from the last National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) flown on the Meteorological Operational satellite programme (MetOp)-C satellite. The calibration comprises the selection of optimal space view positions for the instrument and the determination of coefficients in calibration equations from the Raw Data Record (RDR) to TDR and SDR. The validation covers the analyses of the instrument noise equivalent differential temperature (NEDT) performance and the TDR and SDR data quality from the launch until 15 November 2019. In particular, the Metop-C data quality is assessed by comparing to radiative transfer model simulations and observations from Metop-A/B AMSU-A, respectively. The results demonstrate that the on-orbit instrument NEDTs have been stable since launch and continue to meet the specifications at most channels except for channel 3, whose NEDT exceeds the specification after April 2019. The quality of the Metop-C AMSU-A data for all channels except channel 3 have been reliable since launch. The quality at channel 3 is degraded due to the noise exceeding the specification. Compared to its TDR data, the Metop-C AMSU-A SDR data exhibit a reduced and more symmetric scan angle-dependent bias against radiative transfer model simulations, demonstrating the great performance of the TDR to SDR conversion coefficients. Additionally, the Metop-C AMSU-A data quality agrees well with Metop-A/B AMSU-A data, with an averaged difference in the order of 0.3 K, which is confirmed based on Simultaneous Nadir Overpass (SNO) inter-sensor comparisons between Metop-A/B/C AMSU-A instruments via either NOAA-18 or NOAA-19 AMSU-A as a transfer.

TI  - Investigating Seasonal Effects of Dominant Driving Factors on Urban Land Surface Temperature in a Snow-Climate City in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter in surface urban heat island (SUHI) studies. A better understanding of the driving mechanisms, influencing variations in LST dynamics, is required for the sustainable development of a city. This study used Changchun, a city in northeast China, as an example, to investigate the seasonal effects of different dominant driving factors on the spatial patterns of LST. Twelve Landsat 8 images were used to retrieve monthly LST, to characterize the urban thermal environment, and spectral mixture analysis was employed to estimate the effect of the driving factors, and correlation and linear regression analyses were used to explore their relationships. Results indicate that, (1) the spatial pattern of LST has dramatic monthly and seasonal changes. August has the highest mean LST of 38.11 degrees C, whereas December has the lowest (-19.12 degrees C). The ranking of SUHI intensity is as follows: summer (4.89 degrees C) > winter with snow cover (1.94 degrees C) > spring (1.16 degrees C) > autumn (0.89 degrees C) > winter without snow cover (-1.24 degrees C). (2) The effects of driving factors also have seasonal variations. The proportion of impervious surface area (ISA) in summer (49.01%) is slightly lower than those in spring (56.64%) and autumn (50.85%). Almost half of the area is covered with snow (43.48%) in winter. (3) The dominant factors are quite different for different seasons. LST possesses a positive relationship with ISA for all seasons and has the highest Pearson coefficient for summer (r = 0.89). For winter, the effect of vegetation on LST is not obvious, and snow becomes the dominant driving factor. Despite its small area proportion, water has the strongest cooling effect from spring to autumn, and has a warming effect in winter. (4) Human activities, such as agricultural burning, harvest, and different choices of crop species, could also affect the spatial patterns of LST.

TI  - Molecular design of a non-fullerene acceptor enables aP3HT-based organic solar cell with 9.46% efficiency
T2  - ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The advantage of low cost makesP3HTone of the most attractive electron donors for photovoltaic applications, but the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of theP3HT-based organic solar cells (OSCs) remains low (7-8%). Herein, to modulate the phase separation morphology so as to enhance the PCE inP3HT-based OSCs, a new NFA, namelyZY-4Cl, is designed and synthesized by modifying the cyano-substituted end groups inBTP-4Cl. TheP3HT:ZY-4Clbased OSC exhibits a significantly improved PCE of similar to 9.5%, which is a new record for theP3HT-based OSCs. Furthermore, two model compounds,TT-CNandTT-O, are synthesized to simulate the end groups ofBTP-4ClandZY-4Cl, respectively. The calculated Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, the DSC and the AFM results clearly indicate that the cyano-substituted compoundTT-CNshows much stronger miscibility withP3HTcompared toTT-O, the one without cyano groups. This molecular design strategy is also verified in the other two representative NFAs. Therefore, this work not only reports an NFA with a high PCE forP3HT-based OSCs, but also suggests guidance for the molecular design of NFAs from the aspect of morphology control.

TI  - Attenuated Interferon and Proinflammatory Response in SARS-CoV-2-Infected Human Dendritic Cells Is Associated With Viral Antagonism of STAT1 Phosphorylation
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vary from asymptomatic virus shedding, nonspecific pharyngitis, to pneumonia with silent hypoxia and respiratory failure. Dendritic cells and macrophages are sentinel cells for innate and adaptive immunity that affect the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and these cell types remains unknown. We investigated infection and host responses of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and macrophages (MDMs) infected by SARS-CoV-2. MoDCs and MDMs were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and protein expression but did not support productive virus replication. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 launched an attenuated interferon response in both cell types and triggered significant proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression in MDMs but not moDCs. Investigations suggested that this attenuated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in moDCs was associated with viral antagonism of STAT1 phosphorylation. These findings may explain the mild and insidious course of COVID-19 until late deterioration.

TI  - Integration of remote sensing, county-level census, and machine learning for century-long regional cropland distribution data reconstruction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV) was home to about ten million hectare bottomland hardwood (BLH) forests in the Southern U.S. It experienced over 80 % area loss of the BLH forests in the past centuries and large-scale afforestation in recent decades. Due to the lack of a high-resolution cropland dataset, impacts of land use change (LUC) on the LMAV ecosystem services have not been fully understood. In this study, we developed a novel framework by integrating the machine learning algorithm, county-level agricultural census, and satellite-based cropland products to reconstruct the LMAV cropland distribution during 1850-2018 at a 30-m resolution. Results showed that the LMAV cropland area increased from 0.78 x 10(4) km(2) in 1850 to 6.64 x 10(4) km(2) in 1980 and then decreased to 6.16 x 10(4) km(2) in 2018. Cropland expansion rate was the largest in the 1960s (749 km(2) yr(-1)) but decreased rapidly thereafter, whereas cropland abandonment rate increased substantially in recent decades with the largest rate of 514 km(2) yr(-1) in the 2010s. Our dataset has three notable features: (1) the depiction of fine spatial details, (2) the integration of the county-level census, and (3) the inclusion of a machine-learning algorithm trained by satellite-based land cover product. Most importantly, our dataset well captured the continuous increasing trend in cropland area from 1930-1960, which was misrepresented by other cropland datasets reconstructed from the state-level census. Our dataset would be important to accurately evaluate the impacts of historical deforestation and recent afforestation efforts on regional ecosystem services, attribute the observed hydrological changes to anthropogenic and natural driving factors, and investigate how the socioeconomic factors control regional LUC pattern. Our framework and dataset are crucial to developing managerial and policy strategies for conserving natural resources and enhancing ecosystem services in the LMAV.

TI  - Investigation and validation of algorithms for estimating land surface temperature from Sentinel-3 SLSTR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important indicator of global ecological environment and climate change. The Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) onboard the recently launched Sentinel-3 satellites provides high-quality observations for estimating global LST. The algorithm of the official SLSTR LST product is a split-window algorithm (SWA) that implicitly assumes and utilizes knowledge of land surface emissivity (LSE). The main objective of this study is to investigate alternative SLSTR LST retrieval algorithms with an explicit use of LSE. Seventeen widely accepted SWAB, which explicitly utilize LSE, were selected as candidate algorithms. First, the SWAB were trained using a comprehensive global simulation dataset. Then, using simulation data as well as in-situ LST, the SWAB were evaluated according to their sensitivity and accuracy: eleven algorithms showed good training accuracy and nine of them exhibited low sensitivity to uncertainties in LSE and column water vapor content. Evaluation based on two global simulation datasets and a regional simulation dataset showed that these nine SWAB had similar accuracy with negligible systematic errors and RMSEs lower than 1.0 K. Validation based on in-situ LST obtained for six sites further confirmed the similar accuracies of the SWAB, with the lowest RMSE ranges of 1.57-1.62 K and 0.49 - 0.61 K for Gobabeb and Lake Constance, respectively. While the best two SWAB usually yielded good accuracy, the official SLSTR LST generally had lower accuracy. The SWAB identified and described in this study may serve as alternative algorithms for retrieving LST products from SLSTR data.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Regional Snow Avalanches with Scattering and Interference of C-band SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Avalanche disasters are extremely destructive and catastrophic, often causing serious casualties, economic losses and surface erosion. However, far too little attention has been paid to utilizing remote sensing mapping avalanches quickly and automatically to mitigate calamity. Such endeavors are limited by formidable natural conditions, human subjective judgement and insufficient understanding of avalanches, so they have been incomplete and inaccurate. This paper presents an objective and widely serviceable method for regional auto-detection using the scattering and interference characteristics of avalanches extracted from Sentinel-1 SLC images. Six indices are established to distinguish avalanches from surrounding undisturbed snow. The active avalanche belts in Kizilkeya and Aktep of the Western TianShan Mountains in China lend urgency to this research. Implementation found that smaller avalanches can be consistently identified more accurately in descending images. Specifically, 281 and 311 avalanches were detected in the ascending and descending of Kizilkeya, respectively. The corresponding numbers on Aktep are 104 and 114, respectively. The resolution area of single avalanche detection can reach 0.09 km(2). The performance of the model was excellent in all cases (areas under the curve are 0.831 and 0.940 in descending and ascending of Kizilkeya, respectively; and 0.807 and 0.938 of Aktep, respectively). Overall, the evaluation of statistical indices are POD > 0.75, FAR < 0.34, FOM < 0.13 and TSS > 0.75. The results indicate that the performance of the innovation proposed in this paper, which employs multivariate comprehensive descriptions of avalanche characteristics to actualize regional automatic detection, can be more objective, accurate, applicable and robust to a certain extent. The latest and more complete avalanche inventory generated by this design can effectively assist in addressing the increasingly severe avalanche disasters and improving public awareness of avalanches in alpine areas.

TI  - Selecting the Best Image Pairs to Measure Slope Deformation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing images can be used to monitor slope deformation in mountain regions. Abundant optical sensors onboard various platforms were designed to provide increasingly high spatial-temporal resolution images at low cost; however, finding the best image pairs to derive slope deformation remains difficult. By selecting a location in the east Tibetan Plateau, this work used the co-registration of optically sensed images and correlation (COSI-Corr) method to analyze 402 Sentinel-2 images from August 2015 to February 2020, to quantify temporal patterns of uncertainty in deriving slope deformation. By excluding 66% of the Sentinel-2 images that were contaminated by unfavorable weather, uncertainties were found to fluctuate annually, with the least uncertainty achieved in image pairs of similar dates in different years. Six image pairs with the least uncertainties were selected to derive ground displacement for a moving slope in the study area. Cross-checks among these image pairs showed consistent results, with uncertainties less than 1/10 pixels in length. The findings from this work could help in the selection of the best image pairs to derive reliable slope displacement from large numbers of optical images.

TI  - Water Body Extraction from Sentinel-3 Image with Multiscale Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Mapping
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Water body mapping is significant for water resource management. In the view of 21 spectral bands and a short revisit time of no more than two days, a Sentinel-3 OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) image could be the optimum data source in the near-real-time mapping of water bodies. However, the image is often limited by its low spatial resolution in practice. Super-resolution mapping (SRM) is a good solution to generate finer spatial resolution maps than the input data allows. In this paper, a multiscale spatiotemporal super-resolution mapping (MSST_SRM) method for water bodies is proposed, particularly for Sentinel-3 OLCI images. The proposed MSST_SRM method employs the integrated Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) images calculated from four near-infrared (NIR) bands and Green Band 6 of the Sentinel-3 OLCI image as input data and combined the spectral, multispatial, and temporal terms into one objective function to generate a fine water body map. Two experiments in the Tibet Plate and Daye lakes were employed to test the effectiveness of the MSST_SRM method. Results revealed that by using multiscale spatial dependence under the framework of spatiotemporal super-resolution Mapping, MSST_SRM could generate finer water body maps than the hard classification method and the other three SRM-based methods. Therefore, the proposed MSST_SRM method shows marked efficiency and potential in water body mapping using Sentinel-3 OLCI images.

TI  - Deep Learning Signature Based on Staging CT for Preoperative Prediction of Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer
T2  - ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale and Objectives: To evaluate the noninvasive predictive performance of deep learning features based on staging CT for sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis of breast cancer.Materials and Methods: A total of 348 breast cancer patients were enrolled in this study, with their SLN metastases pathologically con-firmed. All patients received contrast-enhanced CT preoperative examinations and CT images were segmented and analyzed to extract deep features. After the feature selection, deep learning signature was built with the selected key features. The performance of the deep learning signatures was assessed with respect to discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness in the primary cohort (184 patients from January 2016 to March 2017) and then validated in the independent validation cohort (164 patients from April 2017 to December 2018).Results: Ten deep learning features were automatically selected in the primary cohort to establish the deep learning signature of SLN metastasis. The deep learning signature shows favorable discriminative ability with an area under curve of 0.801 (95% confidence interval: 0.736-0.867) in primary cohort and 0.817 (95% confidence interval: 0.751-0.884) in validation cohort. To further distinguish the number of metastatic SLNs (1-2 or more than two metastatic SLN), another deep learning signature was constructed and also showed moderate performance (area under curve 0.770).Conclusion: We developed the deep learning signatures for preoperative prediction of SLN metastasis status and numbers (1-2 or more than two metastatic SLN) in patients with breast cancer. The deep learning signature may potentially provide a noninvasive approach to assist clinicians in predicting SLN metastasis in patients with breast cancer.

TI  - Land Use Transition and Its Eco-Environmental Effects in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration: A Production-Living-Ecological Perspective
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of urbanization and industrialization, China's metropolitan areas have experienced dramatic transitions of land use, which has had a profound impact on the eco-environment. Accordingly, the contradictions of regional production, living, and ecological spaces have intensified. In this context, analysis of the dynamics of regional production-living-ecological (PLE) spaces has become an important entry point for studying land use transition and its eco-environmental effects, by constructing a classification system of PLE land functions. Using remote sensing data from four periods from 1985 to 2018, this paper explores the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of PLE spaces and their eco-environmental effects in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration, based on GIS and the InVEST model. The results revealed that from 1985 to 2018, the living space of the BTH region expanded rapidly, the production space gradually shrank, and the ecological land remained relatively stable. The eco-environmental quality index within the study area shows obvious regional differences, demonstrating the spatial distribution of "high in the northwest and low in the southeast", and an overall deteriorating trend in the past 33 years. Moreover, the carbon density decreased gradually from northwest to southeast, and the transformations from production land into living land and from ecological land into production land were the major types of eco-environment deterioration. Our findings will provide guidelines for land use management, and offer references for the functional division of PLE spaces and ecological civilization construction, especially in terms of the coordinated development of the BTH region.

TI  - Detection of Japanese Encephalitis Virus in <i>Culex</i> Mosquitoes in Singapore
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are emerging pathogens of an increasing global public health concern because of their rapid increase in geographical range and the impact of climate change. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) are of concern because of the risk of reemergence and introduction by migratory birds. In Singapore, human WNV infection has never been reported and human JEV infection is rare. Four sentinel vector surveillance sites were established in Singapore to understand the potential risk posed by these viruses. Surveillance was carried out from August 2011 to December 2012 at Pulau Ubin, from March 2011 to March 2013 at an Avian Sanctuary (AS), from December 2010 from October 2012 at Murai Farmway, and from December 2010 to December 2013 at a nature reserve. The present study revealed active JEV transmission in Singapore through the detection of JEV genotype II in Culex tritaeniorhynchus collected from an Avian Sanctuary. Culex flavivirus (CxFV), similar to the Quang Binh virus isolated from Cx. tritaeniorhynchus in Vietnam and CxFV-LSFlaviV-A20-09 virus isolated in China, was also detected in Culex spp. (vishnui subgroup). No WNV was detected. This study demonstrates the important role that surveillance plays in public health and strongly suggests the circulation of JEV among wildlife in Singapore, despite the absence of reported human cases. A One Health approach involving surveillance, the collaboration between public health and wildlife managers, and control of mosquito populations remains the key measures in risk mitigation of JEV transmission in the enzootic cycle between birds and mosquitoes.

TI  - Potential for offshore aquaculture development in North Korea: Focusing on Atlantic salmon farming
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the potential for Atlantic salmon farming in North Korea. Farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar) are aquaculture products commonly consumed in East Asia, but they are not commercially produced in large quantities. One barrier to Atlantic salmon farming is that the marine environmental conditions (i.e., water temperatures) in much of East Asia are unsuitable. North Korea has recently initiated Atlantic salmon farming assuming it has appropriate locations for it. If North Korea indeed has suitable locations for successful Atlantic salmon aquaculture and the United Nations' sanctions were lifted, the country's Atlantic salmon farming project might have potential for successful inter-Korean economic collaborations. The current study analyzed North Korea's possible farming sites using remote sensing data, and it used those findings to evaluate the feasibility of inter-Korean Atlantic salmon fishery collaborations and to propose policy implications. Remote sensing information estimated sea surface temperatures and hydrodynamic modeling extended that to estimate the sea temperatures at various depths to precisely propose appropriate farming locations in North Korea. The results indicated that most of North Korea's sea surface temperatures were below 20 degrees C in January through June. However, the surface temperatures in July and August exceeded 20 degrees C, indicating unsuitability for Atlantic salmon farming during that period. The water temperatures at the 25-m depth were below 20 degrees C year round, and Atlantic salmon farming would be possible there using submersible farming technologies, such as plant-type offshore fish farming systems.

TI  - Coastal Wetland Monitoring and Mapping along the Turkish Mediterranean: Determining the Impact of Habitat Inundation on Breeding Bird Species
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Within this study, bird species composition, spatial distribution of nests of the most common breeding bird species-the Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus L.)-coastal habitat types, and spatiotemporal change on lagoon surface area were monitored. Field work and water-level monitoring occurred during a 2-year period form 2009 to 2011. Habitat mapping was accomplished through a combination of remote sensing (unsupervised classification of vegetation types) combined with ground truthing. Eleven habitat types were mapped in GIS software to create a dynamic habitat map for analyzing distribution and abundance of waterfowl. Annual changes in water levels and its effect on adjacent habitats are explored. Fifty-two nests were located in 2009 on places that were inundated by the spring flood and were, thus, potentially endangered by the flood. For change detection of the wetland, 13 Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus scenes, covering the period between January 2009 and October 2009, were used for pair-wise comparisons. For land cover classification, a WorldView-2 data was used and the information obtained was used in delineating boundaries of habitats. During the point surveys at the six observation points, 44 bird species were observed, whereas 65 bird species in total were recorded in the course of the project. At the salt marshes, 36 species were recorded, whereas at the freshwater marsh habitat, there were 28 species. In total, 247 Kentish plover nests were found during 2 years. The date eggs were laid was known for 198 nests; most nests were laid during May. The overall objective of this article was to develop a monitoring methodology for predicting the effect of inundation on reproductive success, understanding the habitat features of nesting waterfowl species, and estimating their population size for future monitoring of coastal wetlands.

TI  - Monitoring cropland abandonment with Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland abandonment is a widespread land-use change, but it is difficult to monitor with remote sensing because it is often spatially dispersed, easily confused with spectrally similar land-use classes such as grasslands and fallow fields, and because post-agricultural succession can take different forms in different biomes. Due to these difficulties, prior assessments of cropland abandonment have largely been limited in resolution, extent, or both. However, cropland abandonment has wide-reaching consequences for the environment, food production, and rural livelihoods, which is why new approaches to monitor long-term cropland abandonment in different biomes accurately are needed. Our goals were to 1) develop a new approach to map the extent and the timing of abandoned cropland using the entire Landsat time series, and 2) test this approach in 14 study regions across the globe that capture a wide range of environmental conditions as well as the three major causes of abandonment, i.e., social, economic, and environmental factors. Our approach was based on annual maps of active cropland and non-cropland areas using Landsat summary metrics for each year from 1987 to 2017. We streamlined per-pixel classifications by generating multi-year training data that can be used for annual classification. Based on the annual classifications, we analyzed land-use trajectories of each pixel in order to distinguish abandoned cropland, stable cropland, non-cropland, and fallow fields. In most study regions, our new approach separated abandoned cropland accurately from stable cropland and other classes. The classification accuracy for abandonment was highest in regions with industrialized agriculture (area-adjusted F1 score for Mato Grosso in Brazil: 0.8; Volgograd in Russia: 0.6), and drylands (e.g., Shaanxi in China, Nebraska in the U.S.: 0.5) where fields were large or spectrally distinct from non-cropland. Abandonment of subsistence agriculture with small field sizes (e.g., Nepal: 0.1) or highly variable climate (e.g., Sardinia in Italy: 0.2) was not accurately mapped. Cropland abandonment occurred in all study regions but was especially prominent in developing countries and formerly socialist states. In summary, we present here an approach for monitoring cropland abandonment with Landsat imagery, which can be applied across diverse biomes and may thereby improve the understanding of the drivers and consequences of this important land-use change process.

TI  - Changes in landscape composition and configuration in the Beressa watershed, Blue Nile basin of Ethiopian Highlands: historical and future exploration
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing long-term dynamics of landscape patterns can provide important insights into the changes in landscape functions, that are necessary for optimizing resource management strategies. This study primarily aimed at quantifying landscape structural change. The Land use/land cover (LULC) layers of 1972, 1987, 2002, and 2017 were mapped from Landsat images, and projected to 2032 and 2047. Factor analysis was then employed to select independent core metrics of landscape composition and configuration to characterize the landscape. A post-classification comparison indicated that, between 1972 and 2017, natural vegetation, grassland, barren land and waterbody covers declined by 89.9%, 67.9%, 67.8 and 15.9%, respectively. On the other hand, plantation increased by 692.1% followed by human settlement (138%) and farmland (21.8%). A similar trend is likely to continue in 2032 and 2047 with a slight decline in the plantation category in 2047. Analysis of landscape metrics revealed that between 1972 and 2017, the number of patches increased. Specifically, plantation, barren land, settlement and grassland increased by 171.4%, 69.7%, 65.8% and 28.6%, respectively. In contrast, natural vegetation, farmland and waterbody declined by 53.1%, 46.3% and 33.9%, respectively. Future predictions showed a declining trend of the number of patches for all LULC types. An increasing trend in the largest patch index and patch size for farmland, plantation, and settlement categories was observed across all years, suggesting intensified human activities in the landscape. Consequently, natural habitat category has declined and become fragmented. Landscape pattern has changed considerably and become more fragmented over the last 45 years. Nevertheless, the future projections suggest a decline in fragmentation and potentially increased assemblage of patches forming simple patterns with fewer number of large size class patches. The results of this study could perhaps be applied in designing strategies for landscape management planning and resource conservation decision-making.

TI  - Specific Bamboo Forest Extraction and Long-Term Dynamics as Revealed by Landsat Time Series Stacks and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of bamboo forests is of critical importance as it characterizes the interaction between forest and agricultural ecosystems and provides essential information for sustainable ecosystem management and decision-making. Thus far, the specific dynamics of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) and other bamboo are still unknown. In this study, we used temporal information extracted from Landsat time series stacks with Google Earth Engine (GEE) to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of bamboo forests, including moso bamboo and other bamboo, in Lin'an County, China, from 2000 to 2019. The bamboo forests were mapped in four periods: the early 2000s (2000-2004), the late 2000s (2005-2009), the early 2010s (2010-2014), and the late 2010s (2015-2019). The overall accuracy of these maps ranged from 97% to 99%. We then analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of the bamboo forests at the county and subdistrict/township scales, and probed the bamboo forest gain and loss with respect to the terrain features. Our findings show that bamboo forests increased by 4% from 2000 to 2014, followed by a sharp decrease of 13% in the late 2010s. The decrease was mainly caused by the loss of other bamboo. Approximately 69% of the bamboo forest gain occurred in non-bamboo forest areas, and the rest occupied non-forest areas. Bamboo forest loss was mainly due to conversion into orchard (59%) and forest plantation (22%). Compared to bamboo forest gain, bamboo forest loss was typically observed in areas with lower elevations and steeper slopes. Our study offers spatially explicit and timely insight into bamboo forest changes at the regional scale. The derived maps can be applied to study the drivers, consequences, and future trends of bamboo forest dynamics, which will contribute to sustainable ecosystem management.

TI  - Automatic Extraction of Green Tide Using Dual Polarization Chinese GF-3 SAR Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional optical images are not suitable for the all-weather observation of green tide due to the fact that they are greatly affected by clouds. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on the other hand, is able to realize all-day and all-weather observation due to a lower sensitivity to clouds, rain and fog. SAR images are therefore an effective supplementary data for the monitoring of green tide. Due to the differences in brightness and noise across the different areas in an image, it is difficult to use the same threshold in order to extract all the green tide information from the image. Based on the iterative threshold method and the histogram bimodal method, this paper presents a new method for the automatic detection of green tide that uses adaptive thresholds for Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite dual polarization SAR remote sensing images. In this study, firstly, a sliding window is used to segment the image into multiple sub-images of the same size; secondly, the iterative threshold method is used to obtain the green tide and seawater samples that have the theoretical bimodal structure from each sub-image; then, using the histogram bimodal method, the detection threshold is calculated automatically; and finally, using the threshold segmentation, the green tide areas are extracted from the images. In order to verify the proposed method, the multi-scale segmentation method and the proposed method are both used to detect green tide in China Yellow Sea. The study results show that in the case of GF-3 SAR FSII images, the proposed automatic detection method is superior to the multi-scale segmentation method, as it not only improves the accuracy of green tide detection, but also realizes the automation of green tide extraction. Furthermore, Cross-polarization (HV) images may be more suitable than co-polarization (HH) images for the extraction of green tide due to their lower noise level.

TI  - Application Study on Double-Constrained Change Detection for Land Use/Land Cover Based on GF-6 WFV Imageries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a new satellite sensor of the GaoFen (GF) series, GF-6 Wide Field of View (WFV) with the resolution of 16 m has the characteristics of wide coverage, high-frequency imaging and has four new bands of two red-edge, yellow, and purple compared with GF-1 WFV. In order to test the validity of the supplementary bands of GF-6WFV data for change detection of land use/land cover (LULC), this study applied the Double-constrained Change Detection Method (DCDM) that uses the double constraints (change vector intensity and correlation coefficient) for change detection on object-level. According to two GF-6WFV imageries acquired in the Xiong'an New Area in June of 2018 and 2019, feature analysis was performed to determine whether the new bands are helpful to detect the change of LULC first. Then, by coupling these selected features, the intensity of change vector and correlation coefficient were used as the double constraints to perform the change detection. The study demonstrates that the relevant features of the two red-edge bands can achieve the overall accuracy of 89% for change detection of LULC and improved by 2% comparing with using the corresponding temporal GF-1WFV data, while the purple and yellow bands cannot provide enough effective information for this detection. This study can provide theoretical support for the in-depth applications of GF-6 WFV data products in the change detection fields and has explored its applicability and potential in resource and environment monitoring, it is helpful to the further applications.

TI  - An improved estimation of net primary productivity of grassland in the Qinghai-Tibet region using light use efficiency with vegetation photosynthesis model
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of grassland Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is one of the most important steps in monitoring and further analysing the status of the grassland ecosystem. However, the quality of regional or even global grassland NPP estimations are commonly limbed by the two most important input datasets: Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR) and climatic data, which make the NPP estimate unrepresentative or even inaccurate. This paper uses a Light Use Efficiency with Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (LUE-VPM) to estimate the high-quality grassland NPP in Zeku. By using the PAR data derived from high resolution DEM products and the improved land surface temperature data, the NPP produced by LUE-VPM shows that it is statistically the same as in situ converted NPP with a p-value of t-test equalling 0.90 (the RMSE between the two is 97.77 gC/m(2)), while MODIS NPP in Zeku is statically different from the all the in-situ sampling results with a p-value of t-text smaller than 0.03. The results of this paper provided a better estimate than MODIS NPP, and LUE-VPM can be used for the high-quality regional grassland NPP estimation when the quality of PAR data and climatic data improved.

TI  - Examining the Roles of Spectral, Spatial, and Topographic Features in Improving Land-Cover and Forest Classifications in a Subtropical Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have investigated the effects of spectral and spatial features of remotely sensed data and topographic characteristics on land-cover and forest classification results, but they are mainly based on individual sensor data. How these features from different kinds of remotely sensed data with various spatial resolutions influence classification results is unclear. We conducted a comprehensively comparative analysis of spectral and spatial features from ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3), Sentinel-2, and Landsat and their fused datasets with spatial resolution ranges from 2 m, 6 m, 10 m, 15 m, and to 30 m, and topographic factors in influencing land-cover classification results in a subtropical forest ecosystem using random forest approach. The results indicated that the combined spectral (fused data based on ZY-3 and Sentinel-2), spatial, and topographical data with 2-m spatial resolution provided the highest overall classification accuracy of 83.5% for 11 land-cover classes, as well as the highest accuracies for almost all individual classes. The improvement of spectral bands from 4 to 10 through fusion of ZY-3 and Sentinel-2 data increased overall accuracy by 14.2% at 2-m spatial resolution, and by 11.1% at 6-m spatial resolution. Textures from high spatial resolution imagery play more important roles than textures from medium spatial resolution images. The incorporation of textural images into spectral data in the 2-m spatial resolution imagery improved overall accuracy by 6.0-7.7% compared to 1.1-1.7% in the 10-m to 30-m spatial resolution images. Incorporation of topographic factors into spectral and textural imagery further improved overall accuracy by 1.2-5.5%. The classification accuracies for coniferous forest, eucalyptus, other broadleaf forests, and bamboo forest can be 85.3-91.1%. This research provides new insights for using proper combinations of spectral bands and textures corresponding to specifically spatial resolution images in improving land-cover and forest classifications in subtropical regions.

TI  - A Semi-Empirical Chlorophyll-a Retrieval Algorithm Considering the Effects of Sun Glint, Bottom Reflectance, and Non-Algal Particles in the Optically Shallow Water Zones of Sanya Bay Using SPOT6 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration retrieval is essential for water quality monitoring, aquaculture, and guiding coastline infrastructure construction. Compared with common ocean color satellites, land observation satellites have the advantage of a higher resolution and more data sources for retrieving the concentration of Chl-a from optically shallow waters. However, the sun glint (R-sg), bottom reflectance (R-b), and non-algal particle (NAP) derived from terrigenous matter affect the accuracy of Chl-a concentration retrieval using land observation satellite image data. In this paper, we propose a semi-empirical algorithm based on the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) of SPOT6 to retrieve the Chl-a concentration in Sanya Bay (SYB), considering the effect ofR(sg),R-b, and NAP. In this semi-empirical algorithm, the Cox-Munk anisotropic model and radiative transfer model (RTM) were used to reduce the effects ofR(sg)andR(b)onR(rs), and the Chl-a concentration was retrieved by the Chl-a absorption coefficient at 490 nm (a(phy)(490)) to remove the effect of NAP. The semi-empirical algorithm was in the form of Chl-a = 43.3[a(phy)(490)](1.454), wherea(phy)(490) was calculated by the total absorption coefficient and the absorption coefficients of each component by empirical algorithms. The results of the Chl-a concentration retrieval show the following: (1) SPOT6 data are available for Chl-a retrieval using this semi-empirical algorithm in oligotrophic or mesotrophic coastal waters, and the accuracy of the algorithm can be improved by removing the effects ofR(sg),R-b, and NAP (R(2)from 0.71 to 0.93 and root mean square error (RMSE) from 0.23 to 0.11 ug/L); (2) empirical algorithms based on the blue-green band are suitable for oligotrophic or mesotrophic coastal waters, and the algorithm based on the blue-green band difference Chl-a index (DCI) has stronger anti-interference in terms of the effects of sun glint and bottom reflectance than the algorithm based on the blue-green ratio (BGr); (3) in the case of ignoringR(sg)unrelated to inherent optical properties (IOPs), NAP is the biggest interference factor when >9.5 mg/L and the effect of bottom reflectance should be considered when the water depth (H) <5 m in SYB; and (4) the inherent optical properties of the waters in SYB are dominated by NAP (Chl-a = 0.2-2.6 ug/L and NAP = 2.2-30.1 mg/L), and the nutrients are concentrated by enclosed terrain and southeast current. This semi-empirical algorithm for Chl-a concentration retrieval has the potential to monitor Chl-a in oligotrophic and mesotrophic coastal waters using other land observation satellites (e.g., Landsat8 OLI, ASTER, and GaoFen2).

TI  - Fishpond Mapping by Spectral and Spatial-Based Filtering on Google Earth Engine: A Case Study in Singra Upazila of Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland aquaculture in Bangladesh has been growing fast in the last decade. The underlying land use/land cover (LULC) change is an important indicator of socioeconomic and food structure change in Bangladesh, and fishpond mapping is essential to understand such LULC change. Previous research often used water indexes (WI), such as Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), to enhance water bodies and use shape-based metrics to assist classification of individual water features, such as coastal aquaculture ponds. However, inland fishponds in Bangladesh are generally extremely small, and little research has investigated mapping of such small water objects without high-resolution images. Thus, this research aimed to bridge the knowledge gap by developing and evaluating an automatic fishpond mapping workflow with Sentinel-2 images that is implemented on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The workflow mainly includes two steps: (1) the spectral filtering phase that uses a pixel selection technique and an image segmentation method to automatically identify all-year-inundated water bodies and (2) spatial filtering phase to further classify all-year-inundated water bodies into fishponds and non-fishponds using object-based features (OBF). To evaluate the performance of the workflow, we conducted a case study in the Singra Upazila of Bangladesh, and our method can efficiently map inland fishponds with a precision score of 0.788. Our results also show that the pixel selection technique is essential in identifying inland fishponds that are generally small. As the workflow is implemented on GEE, it can be conveniently applied to other regions.

TI  - Soil Moisture Estimation for the Chinese Loess Plateau Using MODIS-derived ATI and TVDI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and effective estimation and monitoring of soil moisture (SM) provides not only an understanding of regional SM status for agricultural management or potential drought but also a basis for characterizing water and energy exchange. The apparent thermal inertia (ATI) and Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) are two widely used indices to reflect SM from remote sensing data. While the ATI-based model is routinely used to estimate the SM of bare soil and sparsely vegetated areas, the TVDI-based model is more suitable for areas with dense vegetation coverage. In this study, we present an iteration procedure that allows us to identify optimal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) thresholds for subregions and estimate their relative soil moisture (RSM) using three models (the ATI-based model, the TVDI-based model, and the ATI/TVDI joint model) from 1 January to 31 December 2017, in the Chinese Loess Plateau. The initial NDVI (NDVI0) was first introduced to obtain TVDI value and two other thresholds of NDVIATI and NDVITVDI were designed for dividing the whole area into three subregions (the ATI subregion, the TVDI subregion, and the ATI/TVDI subregion). The NDVI values corresponding to maximum R-values (correlation coefficient) between estimated RSM and in situ RSM measurements were chosen as optimal NDVI thresholds after performing as high as 48,620 iterations with 10 rounds of 10-fold cross-calibration and validation for each period. An RSM map of the whole study area was produced by merging the RSM of each of the three subregions. The spatiotemporal and comparative analysis further indicated that the ATI/TVDI joint model has higher applicability (accounting for 36/38 periods) and accuracy than the ATI-based and TVDI-based models. The highest average R-value between the estimated RSM and in situ RSM measurements was 0.73 +/- 0.011 (RMSE-root mean square error, 3.43 +/- 0.071% and MAE-mean absolute error, 0.05 +/- 0.025) on the 137th day of 2017 (DOY-day of the year, 137). Although there is potential for improved mapping of RSM for the entire Chinese Loess Plateau, the iteration procedure of identifying optimal thresholds determination offers a promising method for achieving finer-resolution and robust RSM estimation in large heterogeneous areas.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Suspended Particulate Matter in Optically Complex Estuarine and Inland Waters Based on Optical Classification
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration retrieval across complex estuarine to inland waters from ocean color remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) faces challenges. In this paper, an optical classification-based SPM retrieval algorithm in optically complex estuarine and inland waters was proposed and tested in the Yellow River Estuary and Daihai Lake, China. Firstly, the in situ measured R-rs(lambda) (n = 204) were classified into two optical water types with the method defined by Matsushita et al. (2015). Secondly, we designed several mathematical models and selected the optimal algorithm according to the goodness of fit. Optimal algorithms were developed for each water type to achieve accurate SPM retrieval. Through the construction of the optimal retrieval algorithm in each water type, the uncertainty of SPM retrievals has been reduced from 95 % to about 39 % compared with the algorithm without optical classification. The retrieval algorithm based on optical water classification was further applied to the Sentinel-2 MSI L2A data over the study area and produced reliable SPM maps. Independent validation with the in situ-satellite match-ups further demonstrates the algorithm's validity (uncertainty of about 47 %). In contrast, applications of other SPM retrieval algorithms resulted in less reliable SPM results with either unsatisfactory retrieval accuracy in class1 (the lowest value of r can reach 0.02). The optical classification, together with the optimal retrieval algorithm for each optical type, is proved to be a feasible way for SPM retrieval in high accuracy over optically complex waters.

TI  - Assemblage of the Egg Parasitoids of the Invasive Stink Bug <i>Halyomorpha halys</i>: Insights on Plant Host Associations
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryThe Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys, is an invasive polyphagous species that causes extensive damage to fruits and vegetable crops. Available chemical treatments and mechanical measures are often insufficient to keep this pest under control. In the last decade, the scientific community has made several efforts in order to identify and select suitable natural enemies to use in biological control program. Several native and exotic parasitoid species attacking H. halys eggs have been registered in the invaded countries. In this study, the distribution of these parasitoids was examined in Trentino-Alto Adige, in Northern Italy, by combining two different methods. The research revealed the presence of seven parasitoid and one hyperparasitoid species, which are present in different contexts and on several host plants. The most abundant species, Anastatus bifasciatus and Trissolcus mitsukurii, showed different patterns in distribution, with a higher presence of A. bifasciatus in urban areas and Tr. mitsukurii in orchards. Our results proved that H. halys natural enemies are adapted to the environmental conditions of the study area. The gathered data on the plant host-associations will support the development of future biological control programs.Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is an invasive alien species and a key agricultural pest. Its native parasitoids (Trissolcus japonicus Ashmead and Tr. mitsukurii Ashmead) have been registered in several countries where H. halys brought dramatic economic losses and where biological control is considered to be the most effective long-term solution. By searching for stink bug egg masses and exposing sentinel egg masses, we monitored the distribution of native and exotic egg parasitoids in Trentino-Alto Adige (Italy), an area where both the host and parasitoids are in expansion. We recorded ten pentatomids, seven parasitoid species, with the first report of Tr. japonicus in this area and a hyperparasitoid. In the assemblage, Anastatus bifasciatus (Geoffroy) and Tr. mitsukurii were the dominant parasitoids, with a different distribution in terms of context and host plants. Sycamore was the host plant where the highest number of naturally laid parasitized egg masses (26%) were recorded. Trissolcus mitsukurii showed the highest parasitism rate, and was often found in apple orchards. The emergence of exotic parasitoids showed a temporal delay compared to native ones. Sequence analysis of 823 bp of the CO1 mitochondrial gene revealed that the recovered Tr. japonicus and Tr. mitsukurii harbored one single haplotype each. These haplotypes were previously found in 2018 in Northern Italy. While sentinel egg masses proved to be very effective in tracking the arrival of exotic Trissolcus species, the collection of stink bug egg masses provided fundamental data on the plant host species. The results lend strong support to the adaptation of exotic Trissolcus species to the environmental conditions of the range of introduction, providing new information on plant host-associations, fundamental for the development of biological control programs.

TI  - Does environmental data increase the accuracy of land use and land cover classification?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical image classification converts spectral data into thematic information from the spectral signature of each object in the image. However, spectral separability is influenced by intrinsic characteristics of the targets, as well as the characteristics of the images used. The classification process will present more reliable results when aspects associated with natural environments (climate, soil, relief, water, etc.) and anthropic environments (roads, constructions, urban area) begin to be considered, as they determine and guide land use and land cover (LULC). The objectives of this study are to evaluate the integration of environmental variables with spectral variables and the performance of the Random Forest algorithm in the classification of Landsat-8 OLI images, of a watershed in the Eastern Amazon, Brazil. The classification process used 96 predictive variables, involving spectral, geological, pedological, climatic and topographic data and Euclidean distances. The selection of variables to construct the predictive models was divided into two approaches: (i) data set containing only spectral variables, and (ii) set of environmental variables added to the spectral data. The variables were selected through nonlinear correlation analysis, with the Randomized Dependence Coefficient and the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method, using the Random Forest classifier algorithm. The spectral variables NDVI, bands 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the dry season and band 4 of the rainy season were selected in both approaches (i and ii). The Euclidean distance from the urban area, Arenosol soil class, annual precipitation, precipitation in February and precipitation of the wettest quarter were the variables selected from the auxiliary data set. This study showed that the addition of environmental data to the spectral data reduces the limitation of the latter, regarding the discrimination of the different classes of LULC, in addition to improving the accuracy of the classification. The addition of soil classes to spectral variables provided a reduction in errors for vegetation classification (Evergreen Forest and Cerrado Sensu Stricto), as it was able to inform about nutrient availability and water storage capacity. The study demonstrates that the addition of environmental variables to the spectral variables can be an alternative to improve monitoring in areas of ecotone in Neotropical regions.

TI  - Using Analytical Hierarchy Process and Multi-Influencing Factors to Map Groundwater Recharge Zones in a Semi-Arid Mediterranean Coastal Aquifer
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping groundwater recharge zones (GWRZs) is essential for planning artificial recharge programs to mitigate groundwater decline and saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers. We applied two multi-criteria decision-making approaches, namely the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and the multi-influencing factors (MIF), to map GWRZs in the Korba aquifer in northeastern Tunisia. GWRZ results from the AHP indicate that the majority (69%) of the area can be classified as very good and good for groundwater recharge. The MIF results suggest larger (80.7%) very good and good GWRZs. The GWRZ maps improve groundwater balance calculations by providing estimates of recharge-precipitation ratios to quantify percolation. Lithology, land use/cover and slope were the most sensitive parameters followed by geomorphology, lineament density, rainfall, drainage density and soil type. The AHP approach produced relatively more accurate results than the MIF technique based on correlation of the obtained GWRZs with groundwater well discharge data from 20 wells across the study area. The accuracy of the approaches ultimately depends on the classification criteria, mean rating score and weights assigned to the thematic layers. Nonetheless, the GWRZ maps suggest that there is ample opportunity to implement aquifer recharge programs to reduce groundwater stress in the Korba aquifer.

TI  - Automatic Crop Classification in Northeastern China by Improved Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction for Satellite Image Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely information on the spatial distribution of crops is of great significance to precision agriculture and food security. Many cropland mapping methods using satellite image time series are based on expert knowledge to extract phenological features to identify crops. It is still a challenge to automatically obtain meaningful features from time-series data for crop classification. In this study, we developed an automated method based on satellite image time series to map the spatial distribution of three major crops including maize, rice, and soybean in northeastern China. The core method used is the nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique. However, the existing nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique cannot handle missing data, and it is not designed for subsequent classification tasks. Therefore, the nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm Landmark-Isometric feature mapping (L-ISOMAP) is improved. The advantage of the improved L-ISOMAP is that it does not need to reconstruct time series for missing data, and it can automatically obtain meaningful featured metrics for classification. The improved L-ISOMAP was applied to Landsat 8 full-band time-series data during the crop-growing season in the three northeastern provinces of China; then, the dimensionality reduction bands were inputted into a random forest classifier to complete a crop distribution map. The results show that the area of crops mapped is consistent with official statistics. The 2015 crop distribution map was evaluated through the collected reference dataset, and the overall classification accuracy and Kappa index were 83.68% and 0.7519, respectively. The geographical characteristics of major crops in three provinces in northeast China were analyzed. This study demonstrated that the improved L-ISOMAP method can be used to automatically extract features for crop classification. For future work, there is great potential for applying automatic mapping algorithms to other data or classification tasks.

TI  - Recent Abnormal Hydrologic Behavior of Tibetan Lakes Observed by Multi-Mission Altimeters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland lakes in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) with closed catchments and minimal human disturbance are an important indicator of climate change. However, the examination of changes in the spatiotemporal patterns of Tibetan lakes, especially water level variations, is limited due to inadequate access to measurements. This obstacle has been improved by the development of satellite altimetry observations. The more recent studies revealed that the trend of central TP to grow decreased or reversed between 2010 and 2016. However, thus far, this trend has not been investigated to determine whether this pattern would last for the following years. This study aims to combine the traditional (launched before 2010, e.g., TOPEX/POSEIDON, ERS-1, ERS-2, Jason-1/-2, and Envisat) and recently advanced (launched after 2010, e.g., SARAL and Sentinel-3) altimetry observations to understand the Tibetan lake changes further in recent years. Therefore, we acquired information on the continuous lake level changes in Tibetan lakes using the lake level sequence integration method based on multisource altimetry satellites. The results revealed that water level changes in 22 examined lakes showed abrupt rises in 2016-2018, but the onsets and magnitudes of the rises varied among the lakes. During the study period, the water levels of the lakes (except Nam Co) revealed a drastic rising tendency with a mean rate of 0.74 m/a, which was remarkably higher than the average rate of water level rise over the period 2010-2015 (approximately 0.28 m/a). Specifically, the water level of the nine lakes in the Northern TP (NTP) displayed a significant rising trend, with an average rate of 0.82 m/a. In the Central TP (CTP), the lake level changes were generally divided into two categories. The water levels for the lakes in the Western CTP rose rapidly, while, in the Eastern CTP, the lake water levels rose slowly, with an average rising rate less than 0.40 m/a. The water levels for the lakes in the Northeastern TP (NETP) and Northwestern TP (NWTP) kept a stable rising tendency. According to the results of the climate analysis, the spatial differences of the lake level rise rates were primarily caused by the spatial and temporal changes of precipitation over the TP.
