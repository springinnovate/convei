TI  - Drastic hydrodynamic changes in the western Bay of Bengal caused by tropical cyclone Nada
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the interaction between tropical cyclones (TCs) and the upper ocean in the Bay of Bengal (BoB), TC Nada in 2016 is studied by analyzing ocean reanalysis data, ocean satellite remote sensing data and Argo buoy data. The results show that Nada influenced the anticyclonic eddy (ACE) present at 83.8 degrees E,9.8 degrees N, which propagated westward and formed a new ACE east of Sri Lanka, leading to the EICC bifurcation. An Eastern Sri Lankan Jet (ESLJ) was produced. After the ACE disappeared, the boundary current velocity increased from 1.4 m.s-1 to 1.6 m.s-1. Meanwhile, the main axis of the boundary current is shifted westward. The barrier layer thickness (BLT) was thickened by 33 m at the ACE and thinned by 10 m at the cyclonic eddy (approximately 11 degrees N, 82 degrees E). The mixed layer depth (MLD) became shallower within both the CE and the ACE, which can explain why there were no large-scale phytoplankton blooms in the eddies. Additionally, a part of the sea boundary current intruded into the Palk Strait affected by Nada. The chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in the Palk Strait increases from 0.08 to 0.67 mg.m- 3, causing a phytoplankton bloom. This study helps to estimate the ecological impact of TCs in the western BoB.

TI  - Drought monitoring based on temperature vegetation dryness index and its relationship with anthropogenic pressure in a subtropical humid watershed in China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought has serious impacts on agricultural production and ecological environment in China. Study on the causes of drought and drought monitoring technology is crucial for drought mitigation. This study conducts drought monitoring based on temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) and investigates with the impact of anthropogenic pressure in the Poyang Lake basin (PYLB). In the study, the MODIS normalized vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) products from 2000 to 2021 were selected to construct NDVI-LST feature space processed with elevation correction, from which the monthly TVDI data was calculated. The land use data and nighttime light data were used to construct the anthropogenic pressure index (API). The results indicate that the frequency of drought in the PYLB is higher in the south and lower in the north. According to drought influence scope (DIS), the occurrence frequency of basin-wide drought (DIS & GE; 50%) in the PYLB is the highest, followed by regional drought (33%<DIS < 50%), partial local drought (25%<DIS < 33%), and local drought (10%<DIS < 25%). The basin as a whole showed an obvious wetting trend in spring and a drying trend in autumn. During the study period, API in the north of PYLB was obviously higher than that in the south, and showed a general increasing trend. The contribution of human activities to drought in the PYLB increased exponentially with the improvement of social development level. Meanwhile, the impact of human activities on drought shows spatial differentiation. Ecological protection and green development have been implemented in the northerly region of the PYLB, and anthropogenic pressure inhibited the degree of drought. Oppositely, extensive socioeconomic development in the central and southern parts of the PYLB has caused damage to the environment and indirectly aggravated regional drought. This study makes important contributions to exploring the response between remote sensing drought monitoring and anthropogenic pressure and promoting regional drought mitigation in humid areas.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim This study aimed to investigate the effects of substituting inorganic iron in the diet of weanling piglets with iron-rich Candida utilis on gut morphology, immunity, barrier, and microbiota. Methods and Results Seventy-two healthy 28-day-old Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire desexed male weanling piglets were randomly assigned to 2 groups (n = 6), with 6 pens per group and 6 piglets in each pen. The control group was fed a basal diet containing ferrous sulfate (104 mg kg(-1) iron), while the experimental group was fed a basal diet supplemented with iron-rich C. utilis (104 mg kg(-1) iron). The results show that the growth performance of weanling piglets showed no significantly differences (P > 0.05). Iron-rich C. utilis significantly elevated villus height and decreased crypt depth in the duodenum and jejunum (P < 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant increase in SIgA content, a down-regulated of pro-inflammatory factors expression, and an up-regulated of anti-inflammatory factors expression in the jejunum and ileum of piglets fed iron-rich C. utilis (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression levels of ZO-1, Claudin-1, Occludin, and Mucin2 in the jejunum were significantly increased by iron-rich C. utilis, and were significantly increased ZO-1 and Claudin-1 in the ileum (P < 0.05). The colonic microbiota, however, was not significantly affected by iron-rich C. utilis (P > 0.05). Conclusion Iron-rich C. utilis improved intestinal morphology and structure, as well as intestinal immunity and intestinal barrier function.

TI  - Invasion in the Niger Delta: remote sensing of mangrove conversion to invasive <i>Nypa fruticans</i> from 2015 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Invasive species are a leading threat to biodiversity worldwide. Nypa palm (Nypa fruticans) has emerged as the predominant invasive species in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. While endemic mangroves have high rates of carbon sequestration, stabilize coastlines and protect biodiversity, Nypa does not provide these services outside its native region of Southeast Asia. Oil exploration and urbanization in this region also exacerbate mangrove loss and Nypa spread. As Nypa is difficult to distinguish from endemic mangrove species in remotely sensed data, estimates of mangrove and ecosystem services losses in Nigeria are highly uncertain. Here, we analyse multisensor satellite data with machine learning to quantify the rapid expansion of Nypa from 2015 to 2020 in Nigeria. Using Landsat imagery and random forest classification, we quantify total potential Nypa extent in Nigeria in 2019. We then produced a Nypa extent map using iterative combinations of Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2 MSI and ALOS PALSAR. Random forest classifications using SAR data from ALOS and Sentinel-1 were best suited for mapping Nypa extent with similar accuracies (78% and 75%, respectively). Based on data availability and accuracy, we focussed our change analysis on Sentinel-1 SAR. Our results show similar to 28 000 ha of mangroves were converted to Nypa in Nigeria by 2020 and covered a larger extent than endemic mangroves, compounding the effect of the existing degradation and deforestation in the region. We also compared forest height and complexity estimates from Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation LiDAR to further distinguish between endemic mangroves and Nypa in three dimensions. Nypa structural variability, measured by top-of-canopy height, vegetation cover, plant area index, and foliage height diversity, was lower than that of mangroves. At current rates of Nypa expansion, the entire area of study would be invaded by Nypa by 2028, with potentially detrimental consequences to the ecosystem services provided by mangroves.

TI  - The struggle for the social: rejecting the false separation of 'social' worlds in mental health spaces
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - How are we to best grapple with the notion of the Social in mental health landscapes? This piece of speculative work explores a series of tensions that emerge in our attempt to contemplate, engage with, and address the social in mental health spaces. First, I will explore the tensions created by disciplinary demands for specialisation, questioning the value of this with regard to treating social and emotional bodies which continually reject such fragmentation. This line of inquiry then leads to reflection on the value of a social topology-enabled through the application of intersectionality principles, Black Sociological analytical frameworks, including the worldview approach, and societal psychological perspectives on knowledge and action. I argue the possibilities in actioning these approaches emerge through the application of a social-political economy of mental health, that holds the complexity presented by the totality of social life as it potentially relates to mental health. The piece seeks to advance a space of thinking on how we transition global mental health projects to be more effectively situated in a needed commitment for social justice as a remedy and repair to broken social worlds.

TI  - Exploring the potential for groundwater-related ground deformation in Southern New South Wales, Australia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Unsustainable groundwater extraction can lead to aquifer compaction, damages to infrastructure, changes of water accumulation in rivers and lakes and to a decrease of the aquifer's ability to store water for future generations. While this phenomenon is well identified across the globe, the potential for groundwater-related ground deformation is still largely unknown for most of the heavily exploited aquifers of Australia. This study fills that science gap by exploring signs of this phenomenon across a large region comprising seven of Australia's most intensively exploited aquifers, in the New South Wales Riverina region. To detect ground deformation, we processed 396 Sentinel-1 swaths acquired during 2015-2020 using a multitemporal spaceborne radar interferometry (InSAR), leading to the production of a near-continuous ground deformation maps covering similar to 280,000 km(2). To explore potential groundwater-induced deformation hotspots, four criteria are used in a multiple-line of evidence approach: (1) the amplitude, shape, and extent of the InSAR ground displacement anomaly, (2) the spatial correspondence with groundwater extraction hotspots. (3) The correlations between InSAR deformation time series and change in head levels in 975 wells. Four areas are identified as potentially prone to inelastic, groundwater-related deformations, with average deformation rates ranging from -10 to -30mm/yr, high rates of groundwater extraction, and ample critical head drops. Comparison of ground deformation and groundwater level time series also suggests potential for elastic deformation in some of these aquifers. This study will help water managers mitigating the groundwater-related ground deformation risk.

TI  - Distribution and impacts of long-lasting marine heat waves on phytoplankton biomass
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Warm temperature anomalies are increasing in frequency in the global ocean with potential consequences on the goods and services provided by marine ecosystems. Recent studies have analyzed the distribution and dynamics of marine heat waves (MHWs) and evaluated their impacts on marine habitats. Different drivers can generate those anomalies and the emerging attributes can vary significantly both in space and time, with potentially different effects on marine biology. In this paper we classify MHWs based ontheir attributes and using different baselines, to account for different adaptive responses in phytoplankton dynamics. Specifically, we evaluate the impacts of the most extreme, long-lasting and high-intensity MHWs on phytoplankton communities using remote sensing data. We demonstrate marginal impacts on total chlorophyll concentrations which can be different across different ocean regions. These contrasting effects on phytoplankton dynamics are most likely the results of the different mechanisms generating the MHWs in the first place, including changes in front dynamics, shallower mixed layers, and eddy dynamics. We conclude that those drivers producing extreme MHWs can also induce different phytoplankton responses across the global ocean.

TI  - Leveraging Aqua and Terra satellite data for improved diurnal land surface temperature prediction: a comparative LSTM-based approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our study aimed to enhance the understanding of Land Surface Temperature (LST) dynamics and its impact on environment using remote sensing techniques. By developing LST prediction models based on MODIS data, we analysed both day and night LST patterns in Bharatpur, Rajasthan, India. Multiple evaluation metrics were employed to assess the accuracy of models and performance comprehensive assessment. Our findings revealed valuable insights into the correlation between diurnal LST at different times. Notably, night-time LST predictions exhibited a higher Pearson's correlation coefficient compared to day-time predictions, indicating a stronger linear relationship. The determination coefficient (R (2)) indicated a good fit between the predicted and test LST. Model selection was guided by the Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). The lower AIC and BIC values associated with night-time LST predictions suggested a better balance between model fit and complexity. Our study contributes to the advancement of remote sensing and climate research through a robust LST model-based prediction framework. The insights gained from our results have implications for various fields including environmental monitoring, urban planning and climate change studies. By improved understanding of LST dynamics, we can make informed decisions and develop effective strategies for sustainable development and resource management.

TI  - Acting Strategically During Change: A Process and Dwelling World-view Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Strategic change processes are characterized by high levels of ambiguity and uncertainty. Responding to these changes requires a dynamic approach with a wider set of skills and coping mechanisms. In this article, we argue for a broad focus on change that considers the tacit elements of strategising. We adopted a dwelling worldview as well as a strong process ontology combined with a practice perspective to capture the complexity and richness of a strategic change process with a focus on identity and legitimacy dynamics. This article reports on an emerging process model of how individuals in non-managerial positions respond to and make sense of planned strategic change. The study followed a longitudinal, processual approach using a South African business school as the research setting. The findings of the study contribute towards a deepened understanding of the dynamics that occur within strategic change processes, showing that strategising is a dynamic process involving instinct, adjustment and phronetic action. Understanding how individuals respond, adapt and cope during strategic change processes provides potentially helpful insight into how strategic change is enabled or constrained, which could have future implications on how change processes are designed or implemented.MAD statementThe intention of this article is to Make a Difference (MAD) by presenting a dynamic and temporal account of strategic emergence and change within an evolving organizational context, from the perspective of individuals in non-managerial positions. We adopted an oblique approach to uncover the dynamic and subtle nature of identity and legitimacy 'as-process', viewing these constructs as unstable and always in 'becoming' exposing the tacit elements of strategy during a strategic change process. The emerging process model reconceptualises how agency, process and practice interrelate within a dwelling world-view perspective.

TI  - Vietnam's prudent pivot to the rules-based international order
T2  - INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vietnam's pivot towards a rules-based global order is driven by domestic modernization, integration into the international political economy, and security concerns around China's rise. Yet, it remains cautious about the West's intentions, so it emphasizes the need for universal, rather than western, rules and norms.Abstract Vietnam's conceptualization of the international and regional orders has changed remarkably over the past decades. Previously an outsider if not a challenger of the western-crafted liberal order, Vietnam has in recent years increasingly leaned toward a rules-based international order. This article argues that the reason for Vietnam's changing perceptions about the liberal international order is largely threefold: domestic reform and modernization; deepened integration into the international political economy; as well as growing strategic concerns over great power coercion stemming from China's rise. Vietnam's pivot to the rules-based international order, however, is cautious given Hanoi's lingering worry over western intentions to undermine Vietnam's socialist orientation, the path dependence of Vietnam's relationships with its traditional partners as well as the occasional clashes between the old, conservative worldview and the new, open-minded thinking in shaping its foreign policy. As a result, Vietnam's vision for a rules-based international order emphasizes universally negotiated rules and institutions, rather than western-dominated ones, with a focus on the rules and norms promoted by the United Nations and ASEAN. Amid the current power shift, Vietnam supports an emerging multi-polar and multi-center order in which small and medium states like itself would have a bigger voice and greater agency.

AB  - The aim of this article is to point to the hermeneutical limits of the critique of mainstream Sunnism vis-a-vis the Salafi-jihadist interpretations with particular reference to the literature produced by the proponents of the IS. The main argument the article makes is that by subscribing to what will be termed a "Salafi worldview," mainstream Sunnism shares many interpretationally crucial epistemological and methodological mechanisms with those adopted by the proponents of the ideology behind the IS. As such mainstream Sunnism has strong hermeneutical limits that do not allow it to be in a position to mount an interpretationally effective rebuttal of many beliefs and practices Salafi-jihadists resort to including those pertaining to apostasy, enslavement, and gender-related issues.

T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. The physical state of most of the baryonic matter in the local universe is unknown, commonly referred to as the "missing baryon problem". It has been theorized that at least half of these missing baryons are in a warm-hot, low-density phase, outside of the virialized dark-matter halos.Aims. We attempted to find the signature of this warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) phase in the filaments of the nearby Virgo cluster by using optical and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect data.Methods. Specifically, we used a filament-galaxy catalog created from the HyperLeda database and an all-sky Compton-y map extracted from the Planck satellite data for two-dimensional cross-correlation analysis by applying a spherical harmonics transform. The significance test is based on the null-test simulations, which exploits advanced cut-sky analysis tools for a proper map reconstruction. To place upper limits on the WHIM density in the Virgo filaments, realistic baryonic density modeling within the cosmic filaments was done based on state-of-the-art hydro-simulations, within the signal-boosting routine.Results. The cross-correlation signal is found to be too dim compared to the noise level in the Plancky-map. At a 3  & sigma; confidence level, the upper limit on volume-average WHIM density turns out to be & LeftAngleBracket; n(e) & RightAngleBracket;< 4 x 10(-4) cm(-3), which is indeed consistent with the WHIM parameter space, as predicted from simulations.

TI  - Sentinel-2 accurately estimated wheat yield in a semi-arid region compared with Landsat 8
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat and barley are crucial food resources for the global population, making their growth and monitoring essential to enhance food security worldwide. Effective observation of these crops is necessary to address production issues and mitigate the impacts of weather changes. Advancements in remote sensing technology have significantly improved the observation and estimation processes. In this study, various spectral vegetation indices were utilized, along with canopy biophysical properties (such as LAI) and biochemical properties (like chlorophyll). These properties were derived from satellite data, specifically Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, using tools like Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the R Program. Samples of wheat and barley were collected before reaching their optimal harvest stage, and a correlation was established between the vegetation indices (e.g. NDVI, NDWI, EVI, SAVI, CMFI, SR, RVI, GRVI, and NDRI) and actual production data. Yield prediction algorithms were employed, and the results were used to generate prediction yield maps. The findings revealed a strong relationship between the vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2 and Landsat images and the actual grain yield, with an R-2 of 0.77 and 0.71, respectively. Additionally, the study demonstrated that the most robust relationship was observed between the LAI data obtained from Sentinel-2 and cereal yield data, achieving an R-2 of 0.68. Among the indices derived from Landsat images, NDWI exhibited the highest correlation with an R-2 of 0.59. The root mean square error (RMSE) was found to be the lowest for Sentinel-2 (0.57) and Landsat 8 (1.54). Furthermore, the study indicated that the least significant relationship for grain yield prediction was observed between the NDRI index for Sentinel-2 (R-2 0.1) and the SAVI index for Landsat images (R-2 0.47).

TI  - A Yarn Among Social Workers: Knowing, Being, and Doing Social Work Learning, Expertise, and Practice
T2  - AUSTRALIAN SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Many social workers engage in Yarning and truth-telling. This worldview is important considering that Australian social work literature is historically informed by white western thought. This white lens has obstructed the self-determination of Aboriginal social workers and their communities. We came together as Aboriginal social workers and non-Aboriginal allies. Our authorship engaged dialogue and Dadirri (deep listening) with one another in reciprocal relationships. We thematically analysed, reordered, and preserved our Yarn in written text. Yarning with the use of Dadirri respected oral traditions of knowledge sharing and, in itself, was a decolonising act. Our aim to document Aboriginal knowledge and experience as social workers through Yarning, involved truth-telling about social work, social work learning, expertise, and practice.IMPLICATIONSA priority for decolonisation in social work is to value Yarning as a significant feature of knowledge sharing and a legitimate form of authorship.Decolonising social work requires things to be done differently, e.g., prioritising Indigenous social workers in developing frameworks for education and practice, and leading the implementation of these frameworks.

TI  - Disruption of oogenesis and molting by methoprene and glyphosate in <i>Gammarus fossarum:</i> involvement of retinoic acid?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, the freshwater amphipod Gammarus fossarum proved to be a promising sentinel species in active biomonitoring programs to assess the effects of environmental contamination on non-target organisms. Given that the highly conserved retinoid (RETs) metabolism supports many biological functions and is perturbed by xenobiotics and used as biomarker for vertebrates, we explored the RETs functions in the crustacean model Gammarus fossarum. More specifically, we studied the implication of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) in the reproduction (embryo, oocyte, and juvenile production) and development (success and delay of molting) by exposing G. fossarum females to atRA and citral (CIT), a known inhibitor of RA synthesis. In parallel, we exposed gammarids to methoprene (MET) and glyphosate (GLY), two pesticides suspected to interfere with atRA metabolism and signaling and frequently found in water systems. After 14 days of exposure, atRA, CIT, and MET reduced the number of oocytes, whereas only MET caused a reduced number of embryos. After 44 days, MET and GLY showed a tendency to decrease juvenile production. The duration of the molting cycle increased following the exposures to atRA and MET, while the treatment with CIT caused a typical endocrine disruptive inverted U-shaped curve. The exposure to GLY led to increased duration of the molting cycle at the lowest concentrations and lowered molting success at the highest concentration tested. This study highlights for the first time the implication of RA in the oogenesis and molting of G. fossarum and suggests that it may be a potential mediator of MET-induced effects on these processes. This study adds to the comprehension of the reproductive and developmental control in G. fossarum and opens new research avenues to study the effects of xenobiotics on the RET system in this sentinel species. Ultimately, our study will drive the development of RET-based biomarkers for non-target aquatic invertebrates exposed to xenobiotics.

TI  - Investigation of land-subsidence phenomenon and aquifer vulnerability using machine models and GIS technique
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this study, a land-subsidence vulnerability map has been prepared using Machine Learning (ML) models fusing, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a GIS technique in the Hamadan Province, Iran. The information layers used as input of the ML models in "R" software are comprised of elevation, slope, plan and profile curvatures, slope aspect, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), soil texture, distance from rivers, distance from the fault, geology, land use, and groundwater level drawdown. The accuracy of the results obtained stood at 89% in the SVM, and up to 96% in the RF models. The RF model demonstrates a greater efficiency than the SVM model. To determine each parameter's effect on the land-subsidence of the study area, the Partial Least Squares (PLS) model has been used in the R software. The use of the PLS model shows a greater effect of elevation and groundwater level decline compared to the other parameters on the land-subsidence phenomenon. Finally, the raster vulnerability map in the GIS software was divided into four classes in terms of intensity as 'low,' 'medium,' 'high,' and 'very high' utilizing the natural break method. In the optimal RF model 45% of aquifers were assessed as being low, 23% as moderate, 20% as high, and 12% as very high. The study of the groundwater changing process, using GRACE satellite data in Google Earth Engine environment confirmed a decrease in groundwater level, which has led to land-subsidence in the aquifer.

TI  - Appraising the crop health response to water stress from enhanced crop and soil water estimates using SAR data and machine learning approaches
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise information on soil moisture (SM) and crop water dynamics is essential for hydrological and agricultural applications. The SM measurements from SAR data are influenced by varying degree of soil-water binding and thus affect the reliable assessment of vegetation dynamics. Hence, in this present study, the six SAR-based SM descriptors capable of representing bound and free water in the soil and the corresponding in-situ SM measurements were used to train the four state-of-the-art machine learning regression (MLR) approaches, namely, random forest regression (RFR), gradient boosting regression Tree (GBRT), support vector regression (SVR), and gaussian processes regression (GPR) to retrieve enhanced surface soil moisture (SSM ( enh )) estimates. The SSM ( enh ) results were used in the Water Cloud Model (WCM) to retrieve the PWC (plant water content). Lastly, the crop health schema (CHS) was proposed considering SSM ( enh ) and PWC, to examine the health dynamics of the cotton and sorghum crops. The results demonstrated that the GBRT model (R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.004 m3m - 3, MAE = 0.021) outperformed the other ML models in retrieving SM. The PWC (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 0.014, MAE = 0.019) from WCM and CHS schema (F1 score = 0.86, Kappa = 0.79) have shown good statistical agreement with the field observations. The present study demonstrated the scope of SSM ( enh ) product in investigating vegetation health response to water stress from single-date dual-pol SAR imagery.

TI  - A polarimetric projection-based scattering characteristics extraction tool and its application to PolSAR image classification
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is necessary to adequately extract scattering characteristics from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data for land-cover classification. Current interpretation technologies, such as target decompositions, polarimetric signatures, and polarimetric coherence patterns, have been widely used to explore polarization information. However, because limited scattering models are used to characterize all ground targets, these methods are occasionally limited in the interpretation of PolSAR data. This may reduce the accuracy of the landcover classification. In this study, we attempted to extract the scattering characteristics through another novel method. We understand the PolSAR image interpretation as the projection of the scattering model on the measured matrix. Current methods project only a limited series of scattering models onto a measured matrix. To complement current methods of PolSAR image interpretation, we propose a polarimetric projection-based scattering characteristics extraction (PPSCE) method. It projects scattering models consisting of four changing independent polarization parameters onto the measured matrix. These scattering models, associated with the geometric and physical properties of the ground targets, correspond to the entire polarization space. The PPSCE method, meanwhile, extracts polarization information sufficiently. L-band UAVSAR, C-band Radarsat-2, and Pband AIRSAR images of classical experimental areas are used to validate the PPSCE method. The results show that the proposed PPSCE method can present polarization information that is difficult to investigate by the existing methods. In addition, the scattering features derived using the PPSCE method are superior for land-cover classification. Compared to the classification results based on the coherency matrix and Wishart classifier, the proposed method improves the overall classification accuracy by 23.56% for UAVSAR data. Compared to target decompositions and polarization signatures, the overall classification accuracy of the proposed method is increased by 29.32% (RF) and 22.63% (SVM) for UAVSAR data, 7.96% (RF) and 4.36% (RF) for Radarsat-2 and AIRSAR datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method has significant potential for soil moisture inversion. https://rgdoi.net/10.13140/RG.2.2.14091.26409.

TI  - Cropland abandonment in a shrinking agricultural landscape: Patch-level measurement of different cropland fragmentation patterns in Central Iran
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland abandonment (CA) is a growing socio-economic and ecological concern worldwide. CA is formed as a gradual and spatiotemporally complex pattern of agricultural land change that affect accurate measurement of its magnitude and determinants. In this study, different spatial metrics including Attrition, Shrinkage, Fragmentation and Porosity are introduced and developed to better investigate CA in a highly water-deficient agricultural landscape (1964.5 km2) in Central Iran. Annual cropland layers were successfully produced from 1982 to 2022 using Landsat images and areas with more than 5 consecutive years of fallow in 10-year periods were classified as abandoned croplands. In each period, more than 20% of the relict agricultural land areas experienced CA. Moreover, CA represented a highly uneven spatio-temporal distribution. The majority of abandonment occurred on the periphery of active croplands either along the patch edge (Shrinkage) or deep penetration into crop patches (Fragmentation). The area of Porosity, measured as the abandonment holes inside active croplands, increased with increasing conversion of cropland to built-up areas. The complete abandonment of cropland patches (Attrition) was more dominant in resource deficit downstream parts, exhibiting the final stage of the transition from temporal to permanent CA. Results showed that the classification of CA by their spatial configuration shed light on the occurrence process of CA and its driving forces at different spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Comparing Methods for Targeted Axillary Dissection in Breast Cancer Patients: A Nationwide, Retrospective Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background. Several techniques exist for performing targeted axillary dissection (TAD) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the removal of the sentinel node and a marked metastatic lymph node (LN). Two-step methods include coil-marking of the metastatic LN at diagnosis and re-marking with an intraoperatively identifiable marker before surgery. Because nondetection of the marked lymph node (MLN) warrants axillary clearance and many patients achieve axillary pathological complete response (ax-pCR), the success of TAD is crucial. We compare various two-step TAD methods in a Danish national cohort.Methods. We included patients who received two-step TAD between January 1, 2016 and August 31, 2021. Patients were identified from the Danish Breast Cancer Group database and cross-checked with locally accessible lists. Data were extracted from the patient's medical files.Results. We included 543 patients. In 79.4%, preoperative, ultrasound-guided re-marking was possible. Nonidentification of the coil-marked LN was more likely in patients with ax-pCR. The second markers used were hook-wire, iodine seeds, or ink marking on the axillary skin. Of patients with successful secondary marking, the MLN identification rate (IR) was 91%, and the sentinel node (SN) IR was 95%. Marking with iodine seeds was significantly more successful than ink marking with an odds ratio of 5.34 (95% confidence interval 1.62-17.60). The success rate of the complete TAD with the removal of MLN and SN was 82.3%.Conclusions. With two-step TAD, nonidentification of the coiled LN before surgery is frequent, especially in patients with ax-pCR. Despite successful remarking, the IR of the MLN at surgery is inferior to one-step TAD.

TI  - Mapping urban heat islands and heat-related risk during heat waves from a climate justice perspective: A case study in the municipality of Padua (Italy) for inclusive adaptation policies
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has led to a dramatic increase in extreme events worldwide. Predictions for a + 1.5 degrees C world indicate that 13.8% of the global population will be exposed to heat waves (HWs), a proportion rising to 36.9% in a + 2 degrees C scenario. At present, about 9.6 M people in the EU and UK are exposed to extreme heat every year. Overheating has various impacts on cities, including urban infrastructure failures and changes in ecological processes. However, scarce attention is currently paid to the distribution of HWs impacts and the differential vulnerabilities of different social groups, raising the issue of climate justice in cities. HWs directly impact the health of the most vulnerable social groups resulting in an increase in mortality and morbidity rates. This research focuses on the city of Padua (Italy) as a pilot study to assess the effects of urban HWs and heat islands (UHI) combined. By framing the unequal spatial distribution of socially vulnerable groups, this study aims to i) provide a replicable spatially explicit open-access methodology to assess the heat-related risk of UHI; ii) propose the first climate justice heat-related risk index to be adopted in inclusive and just adaptation plans. Specifically, it aims to i) identify HWs and map critical hotspots during summer 2022 at suburban scale; ii) assess the spatial correlations among impervious areas and UHI; iii) map the climate risk to vulnerable social groups; and iv) propose a global climate justice risk index for all the vulnerable groups considered. Images from Landsat 8-9 were processed, and territorial data were acquired from public databases. It was found that three extreme HWs hit Padua in summer 2022, on 2-7 June, 21-23 July, and 4-8 August, when maximum temperatures were 35.1 degrees C, 36.1 degrees C, and 35.8 degrees C, respectively. The intensity and magnitude of UHIs were considerable, with land surface temperatures of 33.8 degrees C on average (& sigma; = 1.7, min = 27.9, max = 41.4). UHI intensity reached 5-8 degrees C of difference with rural contexts, mainly in strongly urbanized sectors. Ordinary least squares regression indicated a positive correlation with impervious surfaces, with a & beta; coefficient showing an average increase of 0.3 degrees C per 10% of soil sealing. Six different hotspots were identified both in industrial areas and within the city centre. However, the integrated climate risk analyses highlight that most critical areas are in sectors where there is a large number of the elderly, migrants, children, and low-income households. Our findings reveal the need for urgent heat island mitigation measures and that the distributive dimension of climate justice should be respected in adaptation planning.

TI  - Syndromic Surveillance of Health Effects Due to Summer Sun Overexposure: Construction of an Indicator Based on Drug Sales in Pharmacies-Preliminary Study within the PRISME Project.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Solar radiation is classified as a known human carcinogen. In France, people frequently ask local pharmacies to dispense products for sunburns. In the PRISME project, studying this use can be a specific and sensitive way to assess these overexposures.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to construct an indicator for monitoring healthcare consumption in pharmacies after overexposure to solar UV.METHODS: The study, conducted between July and August 2019, covered a sample of pharmacies located in coastal communities of southern France. A list of products for sunburn was defined. When one of the products on this list was sold, the customer was asked to fill out a questionnaire to determine whether the purchase was related to UV overexposure. A positive predictive value (PPV) per active ingredient was calculated.RESULTS: Overall, nine pharmacies participated in the study, and 288 questionnaires were collected. The majority of products purchased were for women (60.7%), for people aged 15 and over (78.1%), and for people not living in the department (68.9%). The most frequently purchased products were our trolamine-containing products which accounted for 53% of sales. With the exception of three products, all PPVs were greater than 0.8.CONCLUSION: The high PPV confirms the suitability of the product selection as an indicator for monitoring healthcare consumption related to solar UV overexposure. Two indicators (one sensitive and one specific) were selected to maximise the chances of identifying UV-related remedies.

TI  - ISAR imaging of space objects using encoded apertures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A major threat to satellites is space debris, which are observed in orbit for a short time due to their low mass and high rotational speed. This major limitation causes them not to be fully illuminated in one snapshot, resulting in their incomplete image reconstruction and identification. In this paper, we propose a method to decrease the number of snapshots in a given observation time and use a limited number of spot beams per snapshot, which we call the encoded aperture. To recover the space debris images, an inverse problem is defined based on compressive sensing methods. Also, we show that for satellite imaging the Total Variation (TV) norm is more appropriate. We develop a procedure to recover space debris and satellites using L-1 and TV norms. Using simulation results, the proposed method is compared with the well-known Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) and S L-0 methods in terms of the number of snapshots, minimum Mean Square Error (MSE), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and running time. It is shown that the proposed method can successfully recover the images of space objects using a fewer number of snapshots.

TI  - Predicting and indexing ungulate browse intensity from local to regional scales
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity of browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter deer) can be influenced directly by deer densities and food availability, and indirectly by landscape characteristics that influence these factors. However, the variables and spatial scales that influence browsing intensity likely differ in landscapes with varying composition and land use. Furthermore, because high browsing intensity can influence the structure and function of forests, determining the most effective and efficient indices of browsing intensity can aid forest management decisions. To evaluate differences in browsing intensity, we used Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate the probability of browsing for twigs from non-avoided species based upon woodlot and landscape-scale variables, which were calculated within 200, 500, 1000, and 1500 m buffers. We then evaluated the efficacy of the twig age, oak sentinel, and herbaceous indicator methods of indexing browsing intensity by correlating these to browsing intensity and deer density. We also evaluated the expense and required work time associated with each index method. Food availability seemed to drive browsing intensities in our study, however, deer density was also important in the region with the lowest cover of forest. When meaningful, landscape characteristics fit data best at the 500 m buffer size. The twig age method showed the strongest correlations to both browsing intensity and deer density and was among the most efficient methods, suggesting it is a reliable index of browsing intensity within Indiana and similar regions. Together, our results highlight that landscape characteristics can mediate the relationship between deer and forest plant communities, which emphasizes the need to tailor management actions to variable landscapes that may occur within a single state or region. Additionally, our results suggest that the twig age method is the most efficient and effective index to monitor browse intensity in agriculturally dominated landscapes, such as those of the Central Hardwood Forest Region.

TI  - Evaluation of Male Breast Cancer and the Application of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy: A Multicenter Retrospective Study
T2  - ONCOLOGIST
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is currently used as a routine treatment for patients with breast cancer. However, it may not be applicable for patients with male breast cancer (MBC), because they have notably different clinicopathological features from those occurring in females. There is a lack of evidence of SLNB application and safe exemption from axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with MBC. This study aimed to evaluate the application of SLNB to provide information for the standardized treatment of patients with MBC. The MBC patient records from 4 institutions ranging from January 2001 to November 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. There were 220 patients with MBC with a median age of 60 (range 24-88) years and an average tumor size of 2.3 cm (range 0.5 cm-6.5 cm). Sixty-six percent of patients underwent SLNB, and 39% of them showed positive results. A total of 157 patients underwent ALND, while only half of them had positive nodes, causing unnecessary complications. For patients in the clinical early stage, we found that the SLNB showed a noninferiority to the ALND treatment in DFS (P = .18) and OS (P = .055). In conclusion, there are certain obstacles to the broad application of SLNB due to the lower proportion of patients with clinically negative lymph nodes. However, it is undeniable that SLNB can safely and effectively exempt patients with MBC at early stage with clinically negative nodes from ALND to reduce subsequent complications. It is still an ideal criterion for the axillary staging of patients with MBC.Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is used as a routine treatment for patients with breast cancer; however, it may not be useful for male patients because of the differences in clinicopathological features of male versus female patients. This study evaluated the application of SLNB to provide information for the standardized treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer.

TI  - Observing relationships between sediment-laden meltwater plumes, glacial runoff and a retreating terminus at Blomstrandbreen, Svalbard
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment-laden meltwater plumes are a common occurrence at the margins of marine-terminating glaciers in Svalbard and are useful proxies for inferring the glacial hydrological system and meltwater runoff. Plumes can influence calving rates, marine biogeochemistry and fjord circulation. However, little is known about how their dynamics will evolve in a warmer, wetter Arctic with increasing melt rates and retreating glacier margins. To determine the temporal magnitude and frequency evolution of sediment-laden meltwater plumes, we manually delineated plume outlines in every available Sentinel-2 image at Blomstrandbreen, Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, between 2016 and 2021. While the frequency of plumes upwelling on the fjord surface remained stable in each melt season, their surface area increased significantly by almost an order of magnitude between the beginning and end of the study period, owing primarily to glacial runoff. This significant change was a result of several large plumes (>2 km(2)) mapped in 2020 and 2021. The rate of glacier terminus change throughout the study period has little-to-no influence on plume surface area. However, a notable event concerning the terminus retreating into an overdeepening between 2017 and 2018 may have impacted plume magnitude, allowing for larger plume migration across the calving front after 2018. Seasonal supraglacial lakes on Blomstrandbreen are found to be small in both area and volume which have limited influence on plumes surfacing between 2016-2021. Our findings suggest with increased runoff, plumes upwelling at the glacier terminus may increase in size, transporting greater volumes of sediment into the surrounding local marine environment. These changes could be exacerbated by projected increases in glacier mass loss and retreat expected to occur across Svalbard throughout this century and beyond, making the study of plumes and their impacts key to constraining the transport of water and sediment from a terrestrial to a marine environment as demonstrated at Blomstrandbreen.

M3  - Article
AB  - The background of this paper starts with the history and significance of the author's relationship to the Campaign, U=U; Undetectable equals Untransmissable as an Indigenous woman and well-known advocate living with HIV. The methods used in this paper explored an adaptation of a thriving indigenous Health Framework implemented in New Zealand for over 40 years. We anticipate the methods used in this paper along with the U=U Campaign will make the U=U relevant to other Indigenous Peoples. The common threads of the cultures are our creation stories and our rendition of the Health Circle or the Four Pillars. We interviewed and surveyed key community members, family, people living with HIV, and social workers that work in those communities over a period of 6 months; 36 people participated. We shared personal stories anecdotally of her experiences. The results were a health model comparison of U=U from a Maori worldview. Each aspect of the Four Pillars or cornerstones of the model is explained from a personal experience perspective, which is inclusive and reflects a process familiar to Indigenous Peoples and worldviews. We are using stories to relay that information from that particular worldview. In conclusion, after much deliberation, discussions with key people, and personal experiences, we can tie the concept of U=U to an intrinsic framework that other Indigenous Peoples and communities can easily interpret.

TI  - Mapping 30m China annual impervious surface from 1992 to 2021 via a multi-level classification approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mapping impervious surface has great significance and application for urbanization monitoring, urban sustainable planning, ecosystem protection, etc. In this study, an automatic and high-performance multi-level classification approach based on time-series similarity, spectral feature, and logical reasoning was proposed to accurately map China's annual impervious surface dataset (CAID) from 1992 to 2021 using Landsat time-series images. Firstly, the synthesized image of 30-year night-time light maximum value was used to mask the areas where humans are inactive, which will preliminarily screen out the impervious surface and mitigate the computational volume. Then, similarity measurement based on dynamic time warping was performed, respectively, for periodic index series, which were weighted by an amplitude scale factor. Furthermore, similarity measurement, spectral features, and logical reasoning of long-time-series land cover type were combined to construct a multi-level approach to mapping impervious surface. Finally, for the computational efficiency of pixel-level time-series classification, we built a distributed parallel high-performance computing framework to fully utilize local computing resources for efficiently developing CAID. Using 58,839 validation samples based on stratified random sampling, the overall accuracy and F1-score of CAID were 90.05% and 88.49%. A comparison with five existing 30 m impervious surface products further indicated that our CAID achieved better impervious surface extraction accuracy and was capable of finely delineating impervious surface landscapes. Therefore, it was concluded that our CAID is an accurate and credible product that can provide an important data base for urbanization and urban-related research in China.

TI  - Supporting tamariki takiwatanga Maori (autistic Maori children): Exploring the experience of early childhood educators
T2  - AUTISM
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The experience of the many autistic children who attend inclusive early childhood education settings is largely shaped by the knowledge and attitudes of the educators who support them. Autistic children from under-represented ethnic groups, such as autistic Maori, are likely to face additional challenges and educators need to consider strategies to support their cultural development. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 12 educators with recent experience supporting tamariki takiwatanga Maori (autistic Maori children) in inclusive early childhood settings. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis resulting in three themes and seven subthemes. Overall, participants' understandings of autism aligned with the neurodiversity perspective, and there were similarities between neurodiversity and Maori perspectives. Participants wanted more training and resources drawn from a Maori worldview and available in te reo Maori (the Maori language). These findings have important implications for practice and future research. Lay Abstract The knowledge and attitudes of educators can have a strong influence on the experiences of autistic children who attend inclusive early childhood settings. Autistic children from under-represented ethnic groups, for example, tamariki takiwatanga Maori (autistic Maori children), are likely to face extra challenges and educators need to consider ways to support their cultural development. For this study, we interviewed 12 educators with recent experience supporting tamariki takiwatanga Maori in inclusive early childhood settings. We constructed three themes and seven subthemes from the interview data. We found that educators' understandings of autism were mostly in line with the neurodiversity perspective, which views autism as a difference, not a disorder. We also found similarities between the neurodiversity perspective and Maori perspectives of autism and a need for more training and resources based upon a Maori world view and available in te reo Maori (the Maori language).

TI  - U-shaped pyramid dense residual network for pansharpening
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the widespread use of remote sensing images, pansharpening techniques have received increasing attention. Many pansharpening experiments have demonstrated that multiscale fusion effectively alleviates the problem of image detail loss, and the pyramidal structure is one of the manifestations of the multiscale spatial theory. This paper proposes a U-shaped network architecture based on the pyramid structure for pansharpening. We resample multispectral images and panchromatic images to generate two pyramid image sequences. The image pairs in the same sequence layer are double-merged in pixels and channels before extracting features. The pyramidal feature sequences undergo a U-shaped top-down downsampling fusion and bottom-up upsampling reconstruction to generate high-resolution multispectral images. In addition, this process also utilizes the dense network module to extract deep features and a lateral connection to shallow multiplex features. We conducted experimental tests on full-resolution and reduced-resolution datasets from WorldView-2, IKONOS, and GeoEye-1. The results confirm that the method in this paper can better trade off spectral and spatial features. The technique has better generalization in fusion results and advantages in objective and subjective aspects.

TI  - Co-inversion of island leaf area index combination morphological and spectral parameters based on UAV multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The precise and rapid estimation of leaf area index (LAI) is crucial for quantitative ecological monitoring and assessment, as it serves as an important ecological indicator of plant growth state and canopy structure. The acquisition, integration, and application of multiple remote sensing data from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms in quantitative ecological research is a current research hotspot. This study aims to explore the potential of combining morphological and spectral parameters using the symbolic regression (SR) algorithm with allometric models to improve the estimation of Leaf Area Index (LAI) at a regional scale of island ecosystem using UAV multi-source remote sensing data. The Canopy Height Model (CHM), Vegetation Density (VD), and Vegetation Indices (VIs), derived from UAV multi-platforms, were used as independent variables in the development of the retrieval models. Subsequently, regression equations were used to construct the Singlet, Duplet, and Triplet models. The precise assessments indicated that the triplet model demonstrates the highest accuracy, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.48% and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.2345. This improvement was observed compared to the singlet model (MAE = 19.55%, RMSE = 0.4091) and duplet model (MAE = 15.88%, RMSE = 0.3450), which can be attributed to incorporating morphological parameters to reduce the impact of tree height and leaf density. The analysis also showed that the estimated LAI accuracy is generally higher for shrubs and herbs compared to trees, and that lower plants with high vegetation coverage are better retrieved. The methodology advaneced in this study demonstrates significant potential and implications for ecological monitoring and assessment of island ecosystems, thereby expanding the research scope in the field of island ecology. Furthermore, it provides scientific evidence and technical support for decision-makers and scholars to propose and implement various measures for the conservation and restoration of island ecosystems.

TI  - Sentinel supervised lung-on-a-chip: A new environmental toxicology platform for nanoplastic-induced lung injury
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanoplastics are prevalent in the air and can be easily inhaled, posing a threat to respiratory health. However, there have been few studies investigating the impact of nanoplastics on lung injury, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, cell and animal models cannot deeply understand the pollutant-induced COPD. Existing lung-on-a-chip models also lack interactions among immune cells, which are crucial in monitoring complex responses. In the study, we built the lung-on-a-chip to accurately recapitulate the structural features and key functions of the alveolar-blood barrier while integrating multiple immune cells. The stability and reliability of the lung-on-a-chip model were demonstrated by toxicological application of various environmental pollutants. We Further focused on exploring the association between COPD and polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs). As a result, the cell viability significantly decreased as the concentration of PS-NPs increased, while TEER levels decreased and permeability increased. Additionally, PS-NPs could induce oxidative stress and inflammatory responses at the organ level, and crossed the alveolar-blood barrier to enter the bloodstream. The expression of & alpha;1-antitrypsin (AAT) was significantly reduced, which could be served as early COPD checkpoint on the lung-chips. Overall, the lung-on-a-chip provides a new platform for investigating the pulmonary toxicity of nanoplastics, demonstrating that PS-NPs can harm the alveolar-blood barrier, cause oxidative damage and inflammation, and increase the risk of COPD.

TI  - Ecosystem health assessment and comparison of natural and constructed wetlands in the arid zone of northwest China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands in the arid zone of northwest China have ecological values such as climate regulation, water conservation, and biodiversity maintenance. However, in the context of global warming and economic development, the degree of natural and human interference in the wetlands has been increasing, and wetland health problems are becoming increasingly severe. The current comparative research on the ecosystem health evaluation of natural and constructed wetlands and their sustainable development in the arid zone of northwest China is not perfect, so we selected the natural (Dunhuang Xihu Wetland) and constructed wetlands (Suzhou District Wetland) as research objects. The ecosystem health evaluation system has been developed from 5 levels of the drive, pressure, state, impact, and response (DPSIR). The ecological health status and impact factors were evaluated for the two wetlands using socioeconomic data combined with remote sensing technology from 2000 to 2019. The results showed that 1) the ecological health of natural and constructed wetlands was in a medium healthy state, and the ecological health values of the wetlands showed a trend of decreasing and then increasing from 2000 to 2019, with 2005 as the turning point. The ecological health status of natural wetlands (0.46) was better than that of constructed wetlands (0.42). 2) The main reasons for the degradation of constructed wetlands (-3.20%) were the urban population expansion and blind agricultural reclamation of wetlands, while the degradation of natural wetlands (-6.45%) was dominated by extreme climatic conditions and overuse of water resources. These results provide case support and a theoretical basis for the conservation management and sustainable development of wetland ecosystems in the arid zone.

TI  - Risk Factors Associated With Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Clinically Node-Negative Breast Cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BREAST HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard of care for axillary staging in clinically node negative breast cancer. If predictive factors for sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis could be identified, it would allow selection of candidates for SLNB and omit axillary surgery in those with the lowest risk of axillary lymph node involvement. The aim of this study was to determine risk factors associated with SLN metastasis in breast cancer patients in Bahrain.Materials and Methods: Patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer who underwent SLNB at a single institution between 2016 and 2022 were identified from the pathology database. Patients who had failure of localization of SLN, those with bilateral cancers and those treated for a local recurrence were excluded.Results: A total of 160 breast cancer patients were retrospectively analyzed. Of these, 64.4% had a negative SLNB and 21.9% of all cases underwent axillary dissection. The following parameters emerged as predictors of SLN metastasis in univariate analysis: age; tumour grade; ER status; presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and tumor size. On multivariate analysis, age was not independently associated with the incidence of SLN metastasis.Conclusion: This study showed that high tumour grades, presence of LVI and large tumour size were all risk factors related to axillary metastasis after SLNB in breast cancer. In the elderly, the incidence of SLN metastasis appeared to be relatively low, providing an opportunity to de-escalate axillary surgery in these patients. These findings may allow for the development of a nomogram to estimate the risk of SLN metastasis.

TI  - Changes in Relative Humidity Profiles over Earth's Oceans in a Warming Climate: A Satellite-Data-Based Inference
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, we presented a classification of "primitive" relative humidity (RH) profiles into eight distinct clusters over Earth's oceans, based on about 18 years (2003-20) of observations from the AIRS on NASA's Aqua satellite. Here we investigate the seasonal variability and decadal trends, both in the vertical structure of these RH profiles, and in their associated area of occurrence. Since vertical structures (except in the marine boundary layer) of each RH class are generally robust across all seasons and change only weakly in a warming climate, seasonal or decadal changes to their occurrence areas shift patterns of global moisture distribution. Globally, the marine boundary layer exhibits nonlinear moistening effects after about 2010, the end of the warming hiatus. Annual time series of ocean areas dominated by RH classes have linear trends, which are positive only for the most moist and driest RH classes (in terms of the free tropo-sphere) associated with deep convection and large-scale subsidence favoring conditions for low-level stratocumulus clouds, respectively. Based on estimated linear trends of RH-class occurrences and sea surface temperatures, we infer projected linear responses of RH in a warming climate. Ocean areas dominated by most moist and driest RH classes (in terms of the free atmosphere) are estimated to increase by about 1% and 2%, respectively (corresponding to about 2.5% K21 and 4.5% K21, respectively). The averaged global and tropical RH structure remain almost constant in a warming climate. While this is consis-tent with other studies, our results show how increases in most moist and dry areas compensate each other, indicating possible increases in the frequency or persistence of future extreme events.

TI  - Evaluation of Toxicological Effects of ZnO and CuO Nanoparticles with <i>Taraxacum officinale</i> as Bioindicator
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanoparticles are rising worries because of recent reports about potential toxicity amid the incorporation of these emerging materials into consumer products, and industrial and scientific applications. New developments in the automotive industry are incorporating novel materials, which have increased the emission of nanoparticles into the atmosphere. To overcome the difficulty of detecting and characterizing atmospheric nanoparticles, alternative methods have been proposed, just as the indirect detection and characterization with bioindicators. We report the use of Taraxacum officinale as a sentinel organism to describe the effects of atmospheric nanostructured pollutants. ZnO and CuO nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs, CuO-NPs) were selected for this study, as they are two of the most present nanomaterials in the emerging automotive industry. The physiological effect on Taraxacum officinale exposure to ZnO-NPs and CuO-NPs was evaluated through growth rate, and total chlorophyll content; and comet assay was performed to evaluate the DNA damage. The exposure of plants was made by nebulizing dispersions of the nanoparticles. The exposure to ZnO-NPs presented the maximum DNA damage at a concentration of 100 mg/L. The DNA damage by both studied nanoparticles showed a significant difference against its bulk counterparts. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs showed an accumulation of nanoparticles near the stomata. The study demonstrated the feasibility of T. officinale as a bioindicator of air-related nanoparticles toxicity, and the high sensitivity of the comet assay for this approach.

TI  - Measurement of Total Dissolved Solids and Total Suspended Solids in Water Systems: A Review of the Issues, Conventional, and Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - This study provides a comprehensive review of the efforts utilized in the measurement of water quality parameters (WQPs) with a focus on total dissolved solids (TDS) and total suspended solids (TSS). The current method used in the measurement of TDS and TSS includes conventional field and gravimetric approaches. These methods are limited due to the associated cost and labor, and limited spatial coverages. Remote Sensing (RS) applications have, however, been used over the past few decades as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Although they also present underlying atmospheric interferences in images, radiometric and spectral resolution issues. Studies of these WQPs with RS, therefore, require the knowledge and utilization of the best mechanisms. The use of RS for retrieval of TDS, TSS, and their forms has been explored in many studies using images from airborne sensors onboard unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite sensors such as those onboard the Landsat, Sentinel-2, Aqua, and Terra platforms. The images and their spectral properties serve as inputs for deep learning analysis and statistical, and machine learning models. Methods used to retrieve these WQP measurements are dependent on the optical properties of the inland water bodies. While TSS is an optically active parameter, TDS is optically inactive with a low signal-noise ratio. The detection of TDS in the visible, near-infrared, and infrared bands is due to some process that (usually) co-occurs with changes in the TDS that is affecting a WQP that is optically active. This study revealed significant improvements in incorporating RS and conventional approaches in estimating WQPs. The findings reveal that improved spatiotemporal resolution has the potential to effectively detect changes in the WQPs. For effective monitoring of TDS and TSS using RS, we recommend employing atmospheric correction mechanisms to reduce image atmospheric interference, exploration of the fusion of optical and microwave bands, high-resolution hyperspectral images, utilization of ML and deep learning models, calibration and validation using observed data measured from conventional methods. Further studies could focus on the development of new technology and sensors using UAVs and satellite images to produce real-time in situ monitoring of TDS and TSS. The findings presented in this review aid in consolidating understanding and advancement of TDS and TSS measurements in a single repository thereby offering stakeholders, researchers, decision-makers, and regulatory bodies a go-to information resource to enhance their monitoring efforts and mitigation of water quality impairments.

TI  - Biophysical Variable Retrieval of Silage Maize with Gaussian Process Regression and Hyperparameter Optimization Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification of vegetation biophysical variables such as leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (fCover), and biomass are among the key factors across hydrological, agricultural, and irrigation management studies. The present study proposes a kernel-based machine learning algorithm capable of performing adaptive and nonlinear data fitting so as to generate a suitable, accurate, and robust algorithm for spatio-temporal estimation of the three mentioned variables using Sentinel-2 images. To this aim, Gaussian process regression (GPR)-particle swarm optimization (PSO), GPR-genetic algorithm (GA), GPR-tabu search (TS), and GPR-simulated annealing (SA) hyperparameter-optimized algorithms were developed and compared against kernel-based machine learning regression algorithms and artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) algorithms. The accuracy of the proposed algorithms was assessed using digital hemispherical photography (DHP) data and destructive measurements performed during the growing season of silage maize in agricultural fields of Ghale-Nou, southern Tehran, Iran, in the summer of 2019. The results on biophysical variables against validation data showed that the developed GPR-PSO algorithm outperformed other algorithms under study in terms of robustness and accuracy (0.917, 0.931, 0.882 using R-2 and 0.627, 0.078, and 1.99 using RMSE in LAI, fCover, and biomass of Sentinel-2 20 m, respectively). GPR-PSO also possesses the unique ability to generate pixel-based uncertainty maps (confidence level) for prediction purposes (i.e., estimated uncertainty level <0.7 in LAI, fCover, and biomass, for 96%, 98%, and 71% of the total study area, respectively). Altogether, GPR-PSO appears to be the most suitable option for mapping biophysical variables at the local scale using Sentinel-2 images.

TI  - Omitting Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy after Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy for Clinically Node Negative HER2 Positive and Triple Negative Breast Cancer: A Pooled Analysis
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Following neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST), patients who were clinically node-negative at diagnosis still routinely undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) to detect nodal disease. Surgical staging of the axilla is currently the standard of care, including for those who achieve complete imaging response in the breast and/or axilla. It has been well established that certain breast cancer subtypes respond better to NAST and are more likely to achieve pathological node-negative status (ypN0). These complete responses are underpinned by advances in systemic therapy and subtype-specific targeted treatment. Our pooled analysis shows that patients with no clinical evidence of axillary node involvement at diagnosis, who respond well to upfront systemic therapy, have around 2% chance of disease in sentinel lymph nodes. This suggests that where the risk of nodal disease is sufficiently low, there is a possibility of safely omitting axillary surgery in selected patients. Recent advances in systemic treatment for breast cancer have been underpinned by recognising and exploiting subtype-specific vulnerabilities to achieve higher rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) after neo-adjuvant systemic therapy (NAST). This down-staging of disease has permitted safe surgical de-escalation in patients who respond well. Triple-negative (TNBC) or HER2-positive breast cancer is most likely to achieve complete radiological response (rCR) and pCR after NAST. Hence, for selected patients, particularly those who are clinically node-negative (cN0) at diagnosis, the probability of disease in the sentinel node after NAST could be low enough to justify omitting axillary surgery. The aim of this pooled analysis was to determine the rate of sentinel node positivity (ypN+) in patients with TNBC or HER2-positive breast cancer who were initially cN0, achieving rCR and/or pCR in the breast after NAST. MedLine was searched using appropriate search terms. Five studies (N = 3834) were included in the pooled analysis, yielding a pooled ypN+ rate of 2.16% (95% CI: 1.70-2.63). This is significantly lower than the acceptable false negative rate of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and supports consideration of omission of SLNB in this subset of patients.

TI  - High-Resolution Estimation of Methane Emissions from Boreal and Pan-Arctic Wetlands Using Advanced Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the use of soil moisture data from satellites and a hydrological model as inputs to a simplified CH4 emission model (MeSMOD) for estimating CH4 emissions from boreal and pan-Arctic regions between 2015 and 2021. MeSMOD is calibrated using FLUXNET-CH4 sites and the predictive performance is evaluated using several metrics, including the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). Using satellite soil moisture with 100 m resolution, MeSMOD has the highest performance (NSE = 0.63) compared with using satellite soil moisture of 10 km and hydrological model soil moisture of 10 km and 50 km (NSE = 0.59, 0.56, and 0.53, respectively) against site-level CH4 flux. This study has upscaled the estimates to the pan-Arctic region using MeSMOD, resulting in comparable mean annual estimates of CH4 emissions using satellite soil moisture of 10 km (33 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) and hydrological model soil moisture of 10 km (39 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) compared with previous studies using random forest technique for upscaling (29.5 Tg CH4 yr(-1)), LPJ-wsl process model (30 Tg CH4 yr(-1)), and CH4 CAMS inversion (34 Tg CH4 yr(-1)). MeSMOD has also accurately captured the high methane emissions observed by LPJ-wsl and CAMS in 2016 and 2020 and effectively caught the interannual variability of CH4 emissions from 2015 to 2021. The study emphasizes the importance of using high-resolution satellite soil moisture data for accurate estimation of CH4 emissions from wetlands, as these data directly reflect soil moisture conditions and lead to more reliable estimates. The approach adopted in this study helps to reduce errors and improve our understanding of wetlands' role in CH4 emissions, ultimately reducing uncertainties in global CH4 budgets.

TI  - Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative ultrasound for axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundBreast cancer is the most prevalent cancer and the second leading cause of death among women is breast cancer. The likelihood of survival rises with early breast cancer diagnosis, which lowers death rates. For the treatment of breast cancer, axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) must be correctly staged and managed. The main goals of ALNs staging are to gather prognostic data and information that might influence management decisions.ObjectiveTo evaluate the accuracy of the preoperative ultrasound in detection of malignant ALNs in breast cancer patients.MethodsThe records of breast cancer patients at the breast surgery unit of Kasr Alainy Hospital, between 2017 and 2020, were reviewed. Patients with an axillary ultrasound report who underwent a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) were enrolled in the present study. Demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics including age, family history, body mass index (BMI), primary tumor size, histological and biological grade, Lymphovascular invasion (LVI), extracapsular invasion (ECE), were evaluated.ResultsOut of the 348 Breast Cancer patients who were managed in our department, the age range was 28-89 years (median age 52 years). The histopathology results of the tumor were 96% with invasive duct carcinoma (IDC) 2.3% invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and 1.7% were mixed ductal/lobular. Cortical thickness greater than 3 mm had a significant difference for positive nodal status, effacement of hilum had a sensitivity 56.2% in detecting positive lymph nodes (LNs), round LNs shape had a sensitivity of 82.3% in detecting true positive LNs. Pathological LNs by ultrasound had a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 77% in detecting true positive LNS, BMI was not significant in ultrasound detection of pathological LNs.ConclusionThe data shows that axillary ultrasound by its assessment has revealed to be useful in detection of malignant LNs with a sensitivity of 93.1% and specificity 77% in detecting true malignant LNs.

TI  - Ecological quality, rarity and risk assessment of the wildlife habitats at the Meighan watershed in central Iran
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Meighan watershed habitats, located in central Iran (Markazi Province), have undergone considerable changes in recent years. Landsat satellite images of the year 2020 were used to produce digital land use maps for the present study. Ecological quality, rarity and risk assessment analyses were performed using the Sub-Watershed-scale Ecosystem Service Modeler according to the InVEST (SWESMI) toolkit, HQR and HRA models. The images were classified into three classes including Agriculture, Rangeland, and Human-made (industrial-residential regions) impacts. The results indicated that there are three important habitats in the Meighan watershed: mountains, plains, and wetlands. Human-made changes, agriculture, and road developments were among the biggest threats and most devastating stressors in the Meighan watershed. There was an increased cumulative risk in the plain habitat of the Kharahrod (31.44%), Amanabad (27.75%) and Sarogh (26.87%) sub-watersheds. A decreased cumulative risk was identified in the mountain habitat of the Kheirabad (7.62%) sub-watershed in the Haftad-Gholleh National Park, and wetland habitat of the Meighan (4.30%) sub-watersheds. The plain habitat (with high cumulative consequence) and the wetland habitat (with high accumulative exposure) are at the highest risk from Human-made activities. Stressors related to roads and agriculture-livestock were the main stressors in the mountain habitat and wetland habitat, respectively, whereas both stressors were considerably high in the plain habitat. Due to being located in a protected area, the Kheirabad sub-watershed was found to have suitable quality and rarity compared to other sub-watersheds in central Iran. The results highlight the significance of land conservation and protected areas in maintaining the habitat quality and reducing the risks associated with habitat degradation and biodiversity.

TI  - Analyzing Independent LFMC Empirical Models in the Mid-Mediterranean Region of Spain Attending to Vegetation Types and Bioclimatic Zones
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents empirical models developed through stepwise multiple linear regression to estimate the live fuel moisture content (LFMC) in a Mediterranean area. The models are based on LFMC data measured in 50 field plots, considering four groups with similar bioclimatic characteristics and vegetation types (trees and shrubs). We also applied a species-specific LFMC model for Rosmarinus officinalis in plots with this dominant species. Spectral indices extracted from Sentinel-2 images and their averages over the study time period in each plot with a spatial resolution of 10 m were used as predictors, together with interpolated meteorological, topographic, and seasonal variables. The models achieved adjusted R-2 values ranging between 52.1% and 74.4%. Spatial and temporal variations of LFMC in shrub areas were represented on a map. The results highlight the feasibility of developing satellite-derived LFMC operational empirical models in areas with various vegetation types and taking into account bioclimatic zones. The adjustment of data through GAM (generalized additive models) is also addressed in this study. The different error metrics obtained reflect that these models provided a better fit (most adjusted R-2 values ranged between 65% and 74.1%) than the linear models, due to GAMs being more versatile and suitable for addressing complex problems such as LFMC behavior.

TI  - The 2022 Assisi Think Tank Meeting: White paper on optimising radiation therapy for breast cancer
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ONCOLOGY HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The present white paper, referring to the 4th Assisi Think Tank Meeting on breast cancer, reviews state-of-the-art data, on-going studies and research proposals. <70% agreement in an online questionnaire identified the following clinical challenges: 1: Nodal RT in patients who have a) 1-2 positive sentinel nodes without ALND (axillary lymph node dissection); b) cN1 disease transformed into ypN0 by primary systemic therapy and c) 1-3 positive nodes after mastectomy and ALND. 2. The optimal combination of RT and immunotherapy (IT), patient selection, IT-RT timing, and RT optimal dose, fractionation and target volume. Most experts agreed that RT-IT combination does not enhance toxicity. 3: Re-irradiation for local relapse converged on the use of partial breast irradiation after second breast conserving surgery. Hyperthermia aroused support but is not widely available. Further studies are required to finetune best practice, especially given the increasing use of re-irradiation.

TI  - Disproportionate exposure to surface-urban heat islands across vulnerable populations in Lima city, Peru
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change constitutes an unprecedented challenge for public health and one of its main direct effects are extreme temperatures. It varies between intra-urban areas and this difference is called surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect. We aimed to assess SUHI distribution among socioeconomic levels in Lima, Peru by conducting a cross-sectional study at the block-level. The mean land surface temperature (LST) from 2017 to 2021 were estimated using the TIRS sensor (Landsat-8 satellite [0.5 km scale]) and extracted to block level. SUHI was calculated based on the difference on mean LST values (2017-2021) per block and the lowest LST registered in a block. Socioeconomic data were obtained from the 2017 Peruvian census. A principal component analysis was performed to construct a socioeconomic index and a mixture analysis based on quantile g-computation was conducted to estimate the joint and specific effects of socioeconomic variables on SUHI. A total of 69 618 blocks were included in the analysis. In the Metropolitan Lima area, the mean SUHI estimation per block was 6.44 (SD = 1.44) Celsius degrees. We found that blocks with high socioeconomic status (SES) showed a decreased exposure to SUHI, compared to those blocks where the low SES were predominant (p-value < 0.001) and that there is a significant SUHI exposure variation (p-value < 0.001) between predominant ethnicities per block (Non-White, Afro-American, and White ethnicities). The mixture analysis showed that the overall mixture effect estimates on SUHI was -1.01 (effect on SUHI of increasing simultaneously every socioeconomic variable by one quantile). Our study highlighted that populations with low SES are more likely to be exposed to higher levels of SUHI compared to those who have a higher SES and illustrates the importance to consider SES inequalities when designing urban adaptation strategies aiming at reducing exposure to SUHI.

TI  - Efficacy of household Aedes larval control practices in a peri-urban township, Yangon, Myanmar: Implication for entomological surveillance
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Dengue is a major public health concern in Myanmar. We carried out a cross-sectional study to investigate the efficacy of larval control practices in household water containers, such as the use of the larvicide, temephos, covering the containers with lids and weekly cleaning. We surveyed 300 households in Kaw Hmu Township, a peri-urban community in the Yangon region. We inspected 1,892 water storage containers and 342 non-water storage/household waste containers during the rainy season and 1,866 water storage containers and 287 non-water storage/household waste containers during the dry season. The presence of Aedes larvae and larval control measures were recorded for each container. Results revealed that larval indices were higher than World Health Organization standard indices, and infestations in water storage containers were more common in the rainy season (6.6%) than in the dry season (5.7%). Infestations were also more likely in containers of non-potable water (9.1%-9.9%) than in containers of potable water (0.1%- 0.7%). Two thirds of water storage containers were treated with temephos. Containers most likely to contain Aedes larvae were cement basins and barrels. Temephos was effective in controlling infestations in cement basins, while weekly cleaning was effective in controlling infestations in barrels. Combinations of control methods were more effective at larval control than the use of a single method. Larval infestations were high (18.4% in the rainy season) in unused containers and in containers which were household waste. Overall, we found a complex interaction between household water use, container characteristics, and larval control practices. Larval control strategies in Myanmar will require ongoing entomological surveillance and the identification of key breeding sources and optimal control methods.

TI  - A Generalized Variable Projection Algorithm for Least Squares Problems in Atmospheric Remote Sensing
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a solution for efficiently and accurately solving separable least squares problems with multiple datasets. These problems involve determining linear parameters that are specific to each dataset while ensuring that the nonlinear parameters remain consistent across all datasets. A well-established approach for solving such problems is the variable projection algorithm introduced by Golub and LeVeque, which effectively reduces a separable problem to its nonlinear component. However, this algorithm assumes that the datasets have equal sizes and identical auxiliary model parameters. This article is motivated by a real-world remote sensing application where these assumptions do not apply. Consequently, we propose a generalized algorithm that extends the original theory to overcome these limitations. The new algorithm has been implemented and tested using both synthetic and real satellite data for atmospheric carbon dioxide retrievals. It has also been compared to conventional state-of-the-art solvers, and its advantages are thoroughly discussed. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms all other methods in terms of computation time, while maintaining comparable accuracy and stability. Hence, this novel method can have a positive impact on future applications in remote sensing and could be valuable for other scientific fitting problems with similar properties.

TI  - Wildfire Susceptibility Mapping Using Deep Learning Algorithms in Two Satellite Imagery Dataset
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recurring wildfires pose a critical global issue as they undermine social and economic stability and jeopardize human lives. To effectively manage disasters and bolster community resilience, the development of wildfire susceptibility maps (WFSMs) has emerged as a crucial undertaking in recent years. In this research endeavor, two deep learning algorithms were leveraged to generate WFSMs using two distinct remote sensing datasets. Specifically, the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat-8 images were utilized to monitor wildfires that transpired during the year 2021. To develop an effective WFSM, two datasets were created by incorporating 599 wildfire locations with Landsat-8 images and 232 sites with MODIS images, as well as twelve factors influencing wildfires. Deep learning algorithms, namely the long short-term memory (LSTM) and recurrent neural network (RNN), were utilized to model wildfire susceptibility using the two datasets. Subsequently, four WFSMs were generated using the LSTM (MODIS), LSTM (Landsat-8), RNN (MODIS), and RNN (Landsat-8) algorithms. The evaluation of the WFSMs was performed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) index. The results revealed that the RNN (MODIS) (AUC = 0.971), RNN (Landsat-8) (AUC = 0.966), LSTM (MODIS) (AUC = 0.964), and LSTM (Landsat-8) (AUC = 0.941) algorithms demonstrated the highest modeling accuracy, respectively. Moreover, the Gini index was employed to assess the impact of the twelve factors on wildfires in the study area. The results of the random forest (RF) algorithm indicated that temperature, wind speed, slope, and topographic wetness index (TWI) parameters had a significant effect on wildfires in the study region. These findings are instrumental in facilitating efficient wildfire management and enhancing community resilience against the detrimental effects of wildfires.

TI  - Lithological discrimination and mineralogical mapping using Landsat-8 OLI and ASTER remote sensing data: Igoudrane region, jbel saghro, Anti Atlas, Morocco
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to delineate the lithological formations, in addition to a mineralogical mapping comparing between the ASTER and Landsat-8 OLI sensors in the Igoudrane region. The research was accomplished using BR along with spectral profiles of minerals, PCA, MNF, ICA, XRD, and reflectance spectrometry. The BR measured with ASTER revealed the presence of amphibole, illite, smectite, muscovite, phengite, basic degree index SiO2, calcite, chlorite, epidote, dolomite, hydroxides, and ferrous silicates. Furthermore, Landsat-8 OLI BR highlighted areas with oxides, hydroxides, and laterite. The spectral profiles of minerals showed their absorption in the VNIR and SWIR regions. The muscovite and illite (phyllic alteration) are distinguished by Al-OH absorption at 2.20 & mu;m. The argillitic alteration is additionally defined by muscovite, illite, and Kaolinite, where Kaolinite has a high absorption at 0.9 & mu;m. Chlorite and carbonates characterized the propylitic alteration zone, with an absorption ranging between 2.3 & mu;m and 2.35 & mu;m due to CO3 and Mg-OH compositions. The oxidation (hematite and jarosite) was distinguished by absorption near 0.95 & mu;m and 2.3 & mu;m, respectively, whereas the goethite spectral profile exhibits absorption near 1.4 & mu;m and 2.2 & mu;m. The absorption of smectite is 1.4 & mu;m, near 2.2 & mu;m. The amphibole had absorption near 1.4 & mu;m and 2.3 & mu;m, whereas the pyroxene had absorption near 1.4 & mu;m and 2.3 & mu;m. The first three components of PCA, MNF, and ICA showed the highest eigenvalues and gave an appreciable discrimination of the lithologies, especially with ASTER. Moreover, the XRD quantified the mineralogy of the rocks, which were compared to the BR of ASTER. The reflectance spectrometry also provided alteration minerals, such as muscovite, phengite, illite, Fe-Mg chlorite, Fe-chlorite, iron oxides, hydroxides, hornblende, and calcite. Overall, the methodology adopted has shown great performance and strong potential for mapping alteration areas and lithological discrimination in similar arid regions.

AB  - Freshwater mussels are threatened with extirpation in North America. They are a sentinel species for ecosystem function and contribute towards many ecosystem services. As mussels require clean water to survive, and since conserving ecosystem services is implicit in the federal Clean Water Act, incorporating mussel conservation into state water policies could serve multiple conservation goals. In this paper we conduct a comprehensive critical review of three topics related to freshwater mussels: their contribution to ecosystem services, their links with water quality, and threats to their survival from water pollutants and extent of protection available from regulation. In so doing, we identify gaps between the water quality requirements of mussels and the protection provided by current water regulation to help inform clean water and conservation goals in Minnesota. We find freshwater mussels to be generally sensitive to a wide variety of pollutants, and particularly to nutrients such as total nitrogen and total phosphorus and to major ions such as chloride. In addition, we find that current state water quality standards may not be sufficiently protective of mussels. We formulate a framework for determining an effective conservation strategy for mussels in Minnesota based on ecological and economic criteria to ensure adequate conservation at a reasonable cost.

TI  - Utility of Cerebral Embolic Protection Devices in Transcatheter Procedures: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN CARDIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - With the emergence of the largest randomized control trial to date-the Stroke Protection With Sentinel During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (PROTECTED TAVR) study-we sought to con-duct an updated meta-analyses to evaluate the utility of CEP devices on both clinical outcomes and neuroimaging parameters. Electronic databases were queried through November 2022 for clinical trials comparing the utility of Cerebral Embolic Protection (CEP) devi-ces in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) with non-CEP TAVR procedures. Meta -analyses were performed using the generic inverse variance technique, and a random-effects model, and results are presented as weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous outcomes, and hazard ratios (HR) for dichotomous outcomes. Outcomes of interest included stroke, disabling stroke, nondisabling stroke, bleeding, mortality, vascular complications, new ischemic lesions, acute kidney injury (AKI), and total lesion volume. Thirteen studies (8 RCTs, 5 observational studies) consisting of 128,471 patients were included in the analysis. Results from our meta-analyses showed a significant reduction in stroke (OR: 0.84 [0.74-0.95]; P < 0.01; I-2 = 0%), disabling stroke (OR: 0.37 [0.21-0.67]; P < 0.01; I-2 = 0%) and bleeding events (OR: 0.91 [0.83-0.99]; P = 0.04; I-2 = 0%) through CEP device use in TAVR. The use of CEP devices had no significant impact on nondisabling stroke (OR: 0.94 [0.65-1.37]; P < 0.01; I-2 = 0%), mortality (OR: 0.78 [0.53-1.14]; P < 0.01; I-2 = 17%), vascular complica-tions (OR: 0.99 [0.63-1.57]; P < 0.01; I-2 = 28%), AKI (OR: 0.78 [0.46-1.32]; P < 0.01; I-2 = 0%), new ischemic lesions (MD: -1.72 [-4.01, 0.57]; P < 0.001; I-2 = 95%) and total lesion volume (MD: -46.11 [-97.38, 5.16]; P < 0.001; I-2 = 81%). The results suggest that CEP device use was associated with a lower risk of disabling stroke and bleeding events in patients undergoing TAVR. (Curr Probl Cardiol 2023;48:101675.)

TI  - Reef-Insight: A Framework for Reef Habitat Mapping with Clustering Methods Using Remote Sensing
T2  - INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental damage has been of much concern, particularly in coastal areas and the oceans, given climate change and the drastic effects of pollution and extreme climate events. Our present-day analytical capabilities, along with advancements in information acquisition techniques such as remote sensing, can be utilised for the management and study of coral reef ecosystems. In this paper, we present Reef-Insight, an unsupervised machine learning framework that features advanced clustering methods and remote sensing for reef habitat mapping. Our framework compares different clustering methods for reef habitat mapping using remote sensing data. We evaluate four major clustering approaches based on qualitative and visual assessments which include k-means, hierarchical clustering, Gaussian mixture model, and density-based clustering. We utilise remote sensing data featuring the One Tree Island reef in Australia's Southern Great Barrier Reef. Our results indicate that clustering methods using remote sensing data can well identify benthic and geomorphic clusters in reefs when compared with other studies. Our results indicate that Reef-Insight can generate detailed reef habitat maps outlining distinct reef habitats and has the potential to enable further insights for reef restoration projects.

TI  - Geospatial Analysis for Relative Seismic Activity Assessment: A Case Study of Fatima Suture Zone in Western Saudi Arabia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we state the usefulness of geomorphic analysis, typically applied to highly deformed landforms, to investigate the tectonic geomorphology of an intercontinental structure: the Fatima suture zone. The Fatima suture zone (FSZ) landscape is a tectonically distinct deformation zone along the eastern coast of the Red Sea in western Saudi Arabia providing a complex zone in terms of geology, tectonics, and geomorphology. This zone presents many deformations and fault reactivations that were produced from the effect of horizontal, vertical, and thrust motions as well as deposition and erosion processes. Through several morphometric analyses, remotely sensed data, and geospatial techniques, we recognized the detailed geomorphic surface features of the Fatima suture zone region. Morphometric indices applied in this paper include the stream length gradient index (SL), basin asymmetry factor index (Af), hypsometric integral index (Hi), valley floor width to valley floor height ratio index (Vf), basin shape index (Bs), and mountain front sinuosity index (Smf). Every single morphometric index provides three different relative tectonic classes based on the assigned value ranges. The overall results obtained from the analysis were averaged and presented as an indicator index namely the relative seismic activity (RSA) index, which was classified into four distinct classes from relatively very high to low seismic activity: class 1 is very high seismic activity (CA & LE; 1.5); class 2 is high seismic activity (1.5 < CA & LE; 2); class 3 is moderate seismic activity (2 < CA & LE; 2.5); and class 4 is low seismic activity (CA > 2.5). Additionally, a combination of the two indices (Smf and Vf) was presented as a quantitative model of the relative seismic activity of the examined mountain fronts. The results of the RSA index provided signatures of all four classes of the study region. Two-thirds of the total area of the study region were recorded as high to very high classes in terms of seismic activity. The paper finally concludes that this integration method allows assessment and evaluation of the highly deformed landscapes related to active tectonism. Despite the impact of the Fatima suture zone providing low to medium activities in some parts, it has a signature control on the recent landscape evolution.

A1  - Child Hlth Mortality Prevention
TI  - Causes of Death Among Infants and Children in the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) Network
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE The number of deaths of children younger than 5 years has been steadily decreasing worldwide, from more than 17 million annual deaths in the 1970s to an estimated 5.3 million in 2019 (with 2.8 million deaths occurring in those aged 1-59 months [53% of all deaths in children aged <5 years]). More detailed characterization of childhood deaths could inform interventions to improve child survival.OBJECTIVE To describe causes of postneonatal child deaths across 7 mortality surveillance sentinel sites in Africa and Asia.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) Network conducts childhood mortality surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia using innovative postmortem minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS). In this cross-sectional study, MITS was conducted in deceased children aged 1 to 59 months at 7 sites in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia from December 3, 2016, to December 3, 2020. Data analysis was conducted between October and November 2021.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The expert panel attributed underlying, intermediate, and immediate conditions in the chain of events leading to death, based on histopathologic analysis, microbiological diagnostics, clinical data, and verbal autopsies.RESULTS In this study, MITS was performed in 632 deceased children (mean [SD] age at death, 1.3 [0.3] years; 342 [54.1%] male). The 6 most common underlying causes of death were malnutrition (104 [16.5%]), HIV (75 [11.9%]), malaria (71 [11.2%]), congenital birth defects (64 [10.1%]), lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs; 53 [8.4%]), and diarrheal diseases (46 [7.2%]). When considering immediate causes only, sepsis (191 [36.7%]) and LRTI (129 [24.8%]) were the 2 dominant causes. An infection was present in the causal chain in 549 of 632 deaths (86.9%); pathogens most frequently contributing to infectious deaths included Klebsiella pneumoniae (155 of 549 infectious deaths [28.2%]; 127 [81.9%] considered nosocomial), Plasmodium falciparum (122 of 549 [22.2%]), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (109 of 549 [19.9%]). Other organisms, such as cytomegalovirus (57 [10.4%]) and Acinetobacter baumannii (39 [7.1%]; 35 of 39 [89.7%] considered nosocomial), also played important roles. For the top underlying causes of death, the median number of conditions in the chain of events leading to death was 3 for malnutrition, 3 for HIV, 1 for malaria, 3 for congenital birth defects, and 1 for LRTI. Expert panels considered 494 of 632 deaths (78.2%) preventable and 26 of 632 deaths (4.1%) preventable under certain conditions.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional study investigating causes of child mortality in the CHAMPS Network, results indicate that, in these high-mortality settings, infectious diseases continue to cause most deaths in infants and children, often in conjunction with malnutrition. These results also highlight opportunities for action to prevent deaths and reveal common interaction of various causes in the path toward death.

TI  - Weaving the rururban: an approach to rururbanization processes in the intermediate city of Tunja, Colombia
T2  - PERSPECTIVA GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, the rururban dynamic constitutes profound changes in its forms, expressions and morphologies. It is a new state of the urban in the rural where times, spaces and geographies of diverse nature converge, but where the rural prevails. But how are these processes rewritten? What are these ways of analysis? This document analyses the rururban space of Tunja-Combita-Oicata, an area witness of changes and new configurations exposed in spatial patterns of rurbanization increasingly present in its interstitial areas. for this, a multitemporal analysis of Lansadt 4 (1980), Spot (2000), Landsat 7 (2009) and Google Maps, TIFF format (2019) images were carried out through geographic information system (GIS) tools. As main results, urban occupation processes are identified, in the case of Tunja, higher than 90%, and for the other municipalities of 70 and 40% respectively. This expansion, mostly generated by the city, affects the appearance of a new discontinuous, dispersed, multipolar and diversely located urban fabric and breaks into the local dynamics of these territories and their geographies, challenging their traditional, peasant and agrarian characteristics and installing others.

TI  - Ductal Carcinoma<i> In</i><i> Situ</i> Arising in Sentinel Axillary Lymph Nodes Excised From Patients With Breast Carcinoma- A Potential Diagnostic Pitfall. Report of Two Cases
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BREAST HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We present two cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) that arose in axillary lymph nodes excised as the sentinel lymph node from two patients with breast carcinoma. The patient ages were 72 and 36 years and both patients underwent mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. In addition to DCIS in the sentinel lymph node, the first patient had a wide DCIS and microinvasion in the ipsilateral breast and a micrometastasis in another sentinel lymph node. The second patient was operated on after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had DCIS and a small focus of invasion, in addition to invasive and in situ ductal carcinoma in the lymph node having signs of chemotherapy-induced regression. The presence of DCIS was confirmed by use of the immunohistochemical method with antibodies against myoepithelial cells. As a potential source of cellular origin, DCIS was accompanied by benign epithelial cell clusters in the lymph node in both cases. Morphologic and immunohistochemical features were similar in breast and lymph node neoplasms. We conclude that DCIS may rarely develop from benign epithelial inclusions in the axillary lymph node and is a potential diagnostic pitfall in cases having ipsilateral breast carcinoma.

TI  - Ground displacement assessment on Pico Volcano, Azores, by multitemporal InSAR data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interpreting the signal deriving from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analyses in volcanic islands, characterized by strong regional deformations and recurrent seismicity, is a complex and challenging issue. In these zones, the secondary effects connected to the SAR acquisition system cannot be neglected, and it is important to consider that delay phenomena of the electromagnetic waves, due to the propagation in the tropospheric layer and loss of SAR coherence because of dense vegetation, could affect the interferometric phase. This work focuses on Pico, the second largest and the youngest island of the Azores Archipelago (North Atlantic Ocean). This island consists of a central volcano and a fissure zone. These systems are inactive but recurrent microseismicity occurs in a rock volume hosting a partially crystallized magma storage system, which fed the recent activity of the central volcano. In the same area affected by microseismicity, the main volcanic edifice shows flank instability. All these elements support the hypothesis of possible reactivation of the shallow magmatic system. Aiming to check potential active ground displacements and to define their source, we collected two datasets of C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data, both in descending and ascending acquisition geometry, from January, 2017, to December, 2020. The application of the small baseline subset method of differential InSAR allowed drawing the mean ground velocity maps over the island and the displacement time series, useful to understand the deformation evolution. InSAR data only evidence areas affected by small-scale subsidence at the cinder cones of the fissure zone and along the southeastern slope of Pico volcano, where local debris flows activate during rainy periods.

TI  - Spatial analysis of leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis seroprevalence in the canine population in an area of socioeconomic and environmental vulnerability
T2  - ARQUIVO BRASILEIRO DE MEDICINA VETERINARIA E ZOOTECNIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis are zoonoses of occupational character that are spread worldwide, mainly in tropical and socioeconomically vulnerable areas. Both diseases have vertebrate hosts, which spread the infectious agent to the environment and are potentially infectious to humans and can progress to fatal cases. The present study reinforces the importance of One Health for the control and prophylaxis of leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis using sentinel animals in areas of socioeconomic vulnerability based on a serological study. A total of 336 blood samples were obtained from the canine population of the urban district, which has high rates of poverty and sanitation. The results were analyzed based on seroreactivity animals and georeferencing by kernel spatial mapping. A total of 43.3% (52/120) of the animals were seroreagents for anti-Leptospira spp., with a predominance of Canicola (35/52 = 67.3%) and Pyrogenes (5/52 = 9.6%), while 52.97% (178/336) of the dogs were seroreactive for anti-Toxoplasma gondii. The presence of seroreagent dogs for both zoonosis alert to the inadequate hygienic-sanitary conditions of the studied region, and highlight the importance of a survey of the social, economic and environmental structure to identify factors related to the links in the epidemiological chain of pathogen transmission and necessary corrective actions.

TI  - Assimilation of Sentinel-2 Biophysical Variables into a Digital Twin for the Automated Irrigation Scheduling of a Vineyard
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Decision support systems (DSS) are needed to carry out precision irrigation. Key issues in this regard include how to deal with spatial variability and the adoption of deficit irrigation strategies at the field scale. A software application originally designed for water balance-based automated irrigation scheduling locally fine-tuned through the use of sensors has been further developed with the emerging paradigm of both digital twins and the Internet of Things (IoT). The aim of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of automatically scheduling the irrigation of a commercial vineyard when adopting regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies and assimilating in near real time the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) obtained from Sentinel-2 imagery. In addition, simulations of crop evapotranspiration obtained by the digital twin were compared with remote sensing estimates using surface energy balance models and Copernicus-based inputs. Results showed that regression between instantaneous fAPAR and in situ measurements of the fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (fIPAR) had a coefficient of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.61 to 0.91, and a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.10. The conversion of fAPAR to a daily time step was dependent on row orientation. A site-specific automated irrigation scheduling was successfully adopted and an adaptive response allowed spontaneous adjustments in order to stress vines to a certain level at specific growing stages. Simulations of the soil water balance components performed well. The regression between digital twin simulations and remote sensing-estimated actual (two-source energy balance Priestley-Taylor modeling approach, TSEB-PTS2+S3) and potential (Penman-Monteith approach) evapotranspiration showed RMSD values of 0.98 mm/day and 1.14 mm/day, respectively.

TI  - Chinese sociotechnical imaginaries of Earth observation: From sight to foresight
T2  - BIG DATA & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although Earth observation (EO) is considered a universal scientific technique with a hegemonic gaze, national sociotechnical imaginaries shape its practice. Historically established and organized by national governments, EO, which is commonly pursued via satellite remote sensing, depends on domestic perceptions of the technique's scope and applications. EO is also a political technology with the capacity to mediate and potentially regulate life on Earth at a range of scales. In China, the state and scientists endeavor to transform EO into a data-driven, inductive, and predictive method with a focus on social coordination, especially in cities-a key scale for scientific study and the organization and reproduction of state power. Contributing to China's reimagining of EO as a governance and governmentality tool are advances in social sensing, which leverages big data continuously generated by individuals' devices. By analyzing big EO and social data, rather than only observe past and present changes to the Earth's surface, the Chinese state and scientists seek to predict future social events. While these changes are narrated as a popularization of remote sensing enabling more responsive, human-centric governance, they may augur the rise of antipolitical technologies that attempt to prevent dissent by determining and even guiding future behavior. As China, a satellite power, aims to export its services for observing and predicting Earth and upscale them through global governance, critique of their associated sociotechnical imaginaries is crucial. Such research reveals the heterogeneity of the satellite gaze and may identify where and how people hold power within EO systems.

TI  - Probabilistic Prediction of Satellite-Derived Water Quality for a Drinking Water Reservoir
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A Bayesian network-based modelling framework was proposed to predict the probability of exceeding critical thresholds for chlorophyll-a and turbidity in an Australian subtropical drinking water reservoir, based on Sentinel-2 data and prior knowledge. The model was trained with quasi-synchronous historical in situ and satellite data for 2018-2023 and achieved satisfactory accuracy (Brier score < 0.27 for all models) despite limited poor water quality events in the final dataset. The graphical output of the model (posterior probability maps of high turbidity or chlorophyll-a) provides an effective means for the user to evaluate both the prediction, and the uncertainty behind the predictions in a single map. This avoids loss of trust in the model and can trigger spatially targeted data collection in order to reduce uncertainty. Future work will focus on refining the modelling methodology and its automation, as well as including other data such as in situ high-frequency sensors.

TI  - Marine Environmental Impact on CFAR Ship Detection as Measured by Wave Age in SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are recognized as one of the most efficient tools for day/night, all weather and large area monitoring of ships at sea. However, false alarms discrimination is still one key problem on SAR ship detection. While many discrimination techniques have been proposed for the treatment of false alarms, not enough emphasis has been targeted to explore how obtained false alarms are related to the changing ocean environmental conditions. To this end, we combined a large set of Sentinel-1 SAR images with ocean surface wind and wave data into one dataset. SAR images were separated into three distinct groups according to wave age (WA) conditions present during image acquisition: young wind sea, old wind sea, and swell. A constant false alarm rate (CFAR) ship detection algorithm was implemented based on the generalized gamma distribution (G & UGamma;D). Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance was used to analyze the distribution goodness-of-fit among distinct ocean environments. A backscattering analysis of different sizes of ship targets and sea clutter was further performed using the OpenSARShip and automatic identification system (AIS) datasets to assess its separability. We derived a discrimination threshold adjustment based on WA conditions and showed its efficacy to drastically reduce false alarms. To our present knowledge, the use of WA as part of the CFAR and for the adjustment of the threshold of detection is a novelty which could be tested and evaluated for different SAR sensors.

TI  - Multidiscursivity of Cyberbullying as the Epiphenomenon of Social Media Communication in a Screen Society
T2  - ASR CHIANG MAI UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Communication modes have significantly changed in recent years. Digitalisation and cybernation of social, scientific and cultural life have caused the emergence of new forms and means of communication. That induces shaping some specific behavioural profiles and manifesting negative traits on the web that sociocultural shifts drive. Cyberbullying has become a highly unwelcome epiphenomenon in social media communication. The inevitable transformation of rapidly changing worldview paradigms, cultural sets and stereotypes actualise the processes determining it. Language reflects those processes and objectifies the modes of communication in cyberspace. They require new research strategies within an interdisciplinary approach. Nonverbal forms of cyberbullying are also fairly common; they combine with language structures to form syncretic patterns. The article discusses the theoretical bases of circulation of those patterns in the multimodal aspect as that approach moves beyond merely language analysis and reveals the polymorphism and multidiscursivity of online communication. Depending on the type of cyberbullying, using various verbal and nonverbal techniques may be of interest in controlling a cyberbully. Clarifying the strategies for representing cyberbullying contributes to a greater understanding of one of the most crucial aspects of social media communication.

TI  - Detailed urban roughness parametrization for anthropogenic heat flux estimation using earth observation data
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic Heat (AH) emissions modify the energy balance in urban areas and is crucial for urban microclimate modelling and improved weather forecast modelling. Therefore, the present study conducted on Delhi and its surroundings firstly aims to estimate AH using Earth Observation (EO) data of Landsat 8 then, evaluate the impact of detailed urban roughness parameterization on the estimation of AH and further validate the obtained flux values with ground based observations of Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS) setup. The study has been conducted over three time periods for October 2017, March 2018 and June 2018 by processing six Landsat tiles. Three methods have been employed on EO data for AH computation i.e. single urban roughness value for entire study area (Method 1), LULC based roughness values adopted from the literature (Method 2) and lastly, detailed pixel-by-pixel varying roughness values calculated from fine scale urban parameterization (Method 3) for each time period, The average AH values are higher for the month of June 2018: 359.91, 368.57 and 359.16 W/m2 as compared to month of March 2018 (322.44, 330.84 and 298.35 W/m2) and October 2017 (318.00, 331.04 and 306.71 W/m2) for method 1, method 2 and method 3 respectively. Net radiation and Sensible Heat Flux shows a good correspondence with in-situ measurements for most of the tiles and method 3 shows better spatial distribution of fluxes as compared to other two methods. However, due to difference in approach for estimation of fluxes (LAS setup computes latent heat flux as residual while EO based approach computes AH as residual), conclusive results could not be drawn with respect to aptness of a single method. Accurate estimation of AH in urban areas can assist further in formulating policies, regulations and action plans related to mitigation and control of heat stress, climate change and improved weather forecasting.

TI  - Availability, outage, and capacity of spatially correlated, Australasian free-space optical networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
M3  - Article
AB  - Network capacity and reliability for free space optical communication (FSOC) is strongly driven by ground station availability, which is dominated by local cloud cover causing an outage. Here, we combine remote sensing data and novel methods to provide a generalized framework for assessing and optimizing optical ground station networks. This work is guided by an example network of eight Australian and New Zealand optical communication ground stations that span approximately 60 degrees in longitude and 20 degrees in latitude. Utilizing time-dependent cloud cover data from five satellites, we present a detailed analysis that determines the network availability and diversity, which showed that the Australasian region is well-suited for an optical network with a 69% average site availability and low spatial cloud cover correlations. Employing methods from computational neuroscience, we provide a Monte Carlo method for sampling the joint probability distribution of site availabilities for an arbitrarily sized and point-wise correlated network of ground stations. Furthermore, we develop a general heuristic for site selection under availability and correlation optimizations and combine it with orbital propagation simulations to compare the data capacity between optimized networks and the example network. We show that the example network may be capable of providing tens of terabits per day to a low Earth orbit satellite and up to 99.97% reliability to geostationary satellites. We therefore used the Australasian region to demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, novel, generalized tools for assessing and optimizing FSOC ground station networks, as well as the suitability of the region for hosting such a network.

TI  - Post-launch evaluation and improvements of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-20 Visible-Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensor data record geolocation accuracy
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-20 (formerly Joint Polar Satellite System-1) is a polar-orbiting weather satellite launched on November 18, 2017. Visible-Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is one of five instruments onboard NOAA-20 (N20), and it jointed on orbit the previous VIIRS instrument operating on the Suomi NPP (SNPP) spacecraft since November 2011. During post-launch testing, the accuracy of VIIRS sensor data record (SDR) geolocation products was evaluated using a system called ground control point matching. The control points are based on 30-m Landsat images as "ground truth," and the matchups employ their cross-correlation with the 375-m VIIRS images in band I1. Initial N20 VIIRS geolocation errors shortly after launch exceeded 2 km and were somewhat larger than those previously observed for SNPP VIIRS. The optimization of processing parameters successfully reduced the geolocation uncertainty to less than 400 m (at nadir, 3-sigma), which is comparable to the current performance for the SNPP VIIRS SDR products, with the majority of the geolocation errors within 200 m. The improvement was achieved by adjusting only the instrument-to-spacecraft rotation angles (the "mounting matrix"). Although the uncertainty evaluation was based on global matchups collected over 12-month periods, the parameter optimization was based on a reduction of the geolocation angular errors by reprocessing VIIRS SDR and re-analyzing the global matchups from 16-day orbit repeat periods. Geolocation of the 750-m day/night band (DNB), which is not co-registered with the 375-m I-bands and the 750-m M-bands, was evaluated and optimized separately, using the correlation between DNB and the I1 band re-projected images. Initial N20 VIIRS DNB geolocation errors were even larger than those observed for the other bands, but they were also successfully reduced by adjusting DNB-specific processing parameters. The initial improvements in the N20 VIIRS geolocation accuracy were achieved in 2018, and the processing parameters were further refined after an optical model correction in 2021.

TI  - Towards nowcasting in Europe in 2030
T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - The increasing impact of severe weather over Europe on lives and weather-sensitive economies can be mitigated by accurate 0-6 h forecasts (nowcasts), supporting a vital 'last line of defence' for civil protection and many other applications. Recognizing lack of skill in some complex situations, often at convective and local sub-kilometre scales and associated with rare events, we identify seven recommendations with the aim to improve nowcasting in Europe by the national meteorological and hydrological services (NMHSs) by 2030. These recommendations are based on a review of user needs, the state of the observing system, techniques based on observations and high-resolution numerical weather models, as well as tools, data and infrastructure supporting the nowcasting community in Europe. Denser and more accurate observations are necessary particularly in the boundary layer to better characterize the ingredients of severe storms. A key driver for improvement is next-generation European satellite data becoming available as of 2023. Seamless ensemble prediction methods to produce enhanced weather forecasts with 0-24 h lead times and probabilistic products require further development. Such products need to be understood and interpreted by skilled forecasters operating in an evolving forecasting context. We argue that stronger co-development and collaboration between providers and users of nowcasting-relevant data and information are key ingredients for progress. We recommend establishing pan-European nowcasting consortia, better exchange of data, common development platforms and common verification approaches as key elements for progressing nowcasting in Europe in this decade.

TI  - Mapping Agricultural Intensification in the Brazilian Savanna: A Machine Learning Approach Using Harmonized Data from Landsat Sentinel-2
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural intensification practices have been adopted in the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado), mainly in the transition between Cerrado and the Amazon Forest, to increase productivity while reducing pressure for new land clearing. Due to the growing demand for more sustainable practices, more accurate information on geospatial monitoring is required. Remote sensing products and artificial intelligence models for pixel-by-pixel classification have great potential. Therefore, we developed a methodological framework with spectral indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI)) derived from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) and machine learning algorithms (Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) to map agricultural intensification considering three hierarchical levels, i.e., temporary crops (level 1), the number of crop cycles (level 2), and the crop types from the second season in double-crop systems (level 3) in the 2021-2022 crop growing season in the municipality of Sorriso, Mato Grosso State, Brazil. All models were statistically similar, with an overall accuracy between 85 and 99%. The NDVI was the most suitable index for discriminating cultures at all hierarchical levels. The RF-NDVI combination mapped best at level 1, while at levels 2 and 3, the best model was XGBoost-NDVI. Our results indicate the great potential of combining HLS data and machine learning to provide accurate geospatial information for decision-makers in monitoring agricultural intensification, with an aim toward the sustainable development of agriculture.

TI  - Bare Land Referenced Algorithm from Hyper-Temporal Data (BRAH) for Land Use and Land Cover Age Estimation
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the age of land use and land cover (LULC) using satellite imagery has long been one of the challenging tasks in remote sensing research. Accurately determining age, especially crop age, is essential for plot management, biomass calculations, and carbon sequestration. This research proposes a method for determining the age of LULC using hyper-temporal satellite data. The method is based on the assumption that "the starting point for the age count is when the latest bare land status disappears at any location". To create a geospatial layer (referred to as the BR layer) that can be used to determine the age of any land cover at a specific location, we conditionally stacked such statuses obtained from the analysis of numerous satellite imagery data. The algorithm was tested at two study sites in Thailand, where rubber plantations dominated land use. The study revealed that all the rubber ages determined using BRAH fell accurately within the range of the local government survey data. The manuscript provides a straightforward explanation of the algorithm, including the pseudocode, accuracy assessment, implementations, robustness, and limitations.

TI  - MISPEL: A Multi-Crop Spectral Library for Statistical Crop Trait Retrieval and Agricultural Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporally accurate estimates of crop traits are essential for both scientific modeling and practical decision making in sustainable agricultural management. Besides efficient and concise methods to derive these traits, site- and crop-specific reference data are needed to develop and validate retrieval methods. To address this shortcoming, this study first includes the establishment of 'MISPEL', a comprehensive spectral library (SpecLib) containing hyperspectral measurements and reference data for six key traits of ten widely grown crops. Secondly, crop-specific statistical leaf area index (LAI) models for winter wheat are developed based on a hyperspectral (MISPELFR) and a simulated Sentinel-2 (MISPELS2) SpecLib applying four nonparametric methods. Finally, an independent Sentinel-2 model evaluation at the DEMMIN test site in Germany is conducted, including a comparison with the commonly used SNAP-LAI product. To date, MISPEL comprises a set of 1411 spectra of ten crops and more than 6800 associated reference measurements. Cross-validations of winter wheat LAI models revealed that Elastic-net generalized linear model (GLMNET) and Gaussian process (GP) regressions outperformed partial least squares (PLS) and random forest (RF) regressions, showing RSQ values up to 0.86 and a minimal NRMSE of 0.21 using MISPELFR. GLMNET and GP models based on MISPELS2 further outperformed SNAP-based LAI estimates derived for the external validation site. Thus, it is concluded that the presented SpecLib 'MISPEL' and applied methodology have a very high potential for deriving diverse crop traits of multiple crops in view of most recent and future multi-, super-, and hyperspectral satellite missions.

TI  - Integration of High-Accuracy Geospatial Data and Machine Learning Approaches for Soil Erosion Susceptibility Mapping in the Mediterranean Region: A Case Study of the Macta Basin, Algeria
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Erosion can have a negative impact on the agricultural sustainability and grazing lands in the Mediterranean area, especially in northern Algeria. It is useful to map the spatial occurrence of erosion and identify susceptible erodible areas on large scale. The main objective of this research was to compare the performance of four machine learning techniques: Categorical boosting, Adaptive boosting, Convolutional Neural Network, and stacking ensemble models to predict the occurrence of erosion in the Macta basin, northwestern Algeria. Several climatologic, morphologic, hydrological, and geological factors based on multi-sources data were elaborated in GIS environment to determine the erosion factors in the studied area. The conditioning factors encompassing rainfall erosivity, slope, aspect, elevation, LULC, topographic wetness index, distance from river, distance from roads, clay mineral ratio, lithology, and geology were derived via the integration of topographic attributes and remote sensing data including Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 within a GIS framework. The inventory map of soil erosion was created by integrating data from the global positioning system to locate erosion sites, conducting extensive field surveys, and analyzing satellite images obtained from Google Earth through visual interpretation. The dataset was divided randomly into two sets with 60% for training and calibrating and 40% for testing the models. Statistical metrics including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were used to assess the validity of the proposed models. The results revealed that machine learning and deep learning, as well stacking ensemble techniques, showed outstanding performance with accuracy over 98% with sensitivity 0.98 and specificity 0.98. Policy makers and local authorities can utilize the predicted erosion susceptibility maps to promote sustainable use of water and soil conservation and safeguard agricultural activities against potential damage.

TI  - Conservative treatment of endometrial cancer in women of reproductive age (Review)
T2  - MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Endometrial cancer is the fifth most common female cancer worldwide and the third leading female cancer in the Western world. The marked surge in endometrial cancer incidence is alarming. The aim of the present review is to focus on endometrial cancer affecting young women of reproductive age. Surgery, namely abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomy, with or without salpingo-oophorectomy, and sentinel lymph node detection has become the standard surgical strategy for early stage endometrioid endometrial cancer. However, premenopausal women might want to preserve their fertility, especially if they are nulliparous or have not reached their desired number of children at the time of diagnosis. Conservative, uterus-sparing treatment, based on progestin products, may be an advantageous option for patients meeting the necessary criteria. Potential candidates have to be committed to following a rigorous protocol of treatment, investigations and follow-up. The evidence in favor of this approach, although limited, is encouraging and patients who have achieved a histologically documented disease complete remission could attempt to conceive spontaneously or with the immediate use of assisted reproductive technology techniques. The risk of partial or negative response to progestin treatment or cancer recurrence is well documented, thus patients have to be aware of the possible need for interruption of conservative treatment and hysterectomy.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing based assessments of tree cover and extent provide insight into global and local land use planning. However, there remains considerable uncertainty about the distribution of tree cover in drylands and in areas with non-forest land use. Here, we present a 10-m map of tree extent for 4.35 billion hectares in the tropics (-23.44 degrees to 23.44 degrees latitude) based on multitemporal composites of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 analyzed with convolutional neural networks, from which we derive spatially aggregated tree cover data at a 70-m (0.49 ha) resolution. We identify 2719 million hectares of tropical land with & GE;10% tree cover, including 680 million hectares in tropical drylands. We find that 52% of tropical cropland and 46% of tropical urban areas had & GE;10% tree cover in 2020. Compared to previous datasets, we demonstrate improved ability to map tree extent in areas with high canopy cover heterogeneity and with open canopy cover, especially in drylands, urban areas, and on cropland. As such, this data is expected to enable improved monitoring of tree cover distributions at local scales.

TI  - Accounting for Changes in Radiation Improves the Ability of SIF to Track Water Stress-Induced Losses in Summer GPP in a Temperate Deciduous Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Global observations of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) are available from multiple satellite platforms, and SIF is increasingly used as a proxy for photosynthetic activity and ecosystem productivity. Because the relationship between SIF and gross primary productivity (GPP) depends on a variety of factors including ecosystem type and environmental conditions, it is necessary to study SIF observations across various spatiotemporal scales and ecosystems. To explore how SIF signals relate to productivity over a temperate deciduous forest, we deployed a PhotoSpec spectrometer system at the University of Michigan Biological Station AmeriFlux site (US-UMB) in the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. We found that SIF correlated with GPP across diurnal and seasonal cycles (R-2 = 0.61 and 0.64 for 90-min- and daily-averaged data), but that SIF signals were more strongly related to downwelling radiation than GPP (R-2 = 0.91 for daily-averaged data). The dependence of SIF on radiation obscured the impact of intraseasonal drought in the SIF timeseries, but drought stress was apparent as a decrease in relative SIF, which exhibited a stronger correlation with GPP (R-2 = 0.56) than other remotely sensed data over the drought period. These results highlight the potential of SIF for detecting stress-induced losses in forest productivity. Additionally, we found that the red:far-red SIF ratio did not exhibit a response to water stress-induced losses in productivity, but was largely driven by seasonal and interannual changes in canopy structure, as well as by synoptic changes in downwelling radiation.

TI  - An Estimation of Daily PM2.5 Concentration in Thailand Using Satellite Data at 1-Kilometer Resolution
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study addresses the limited coverage of regulatory monitoring for particulate matter 2.5 microns or less in diameter (PM2.5) in Thailand due to the lack of ground station data by developing a model to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations in small regions of Thailand using satellite data at a 1-km resolution. The study employs multiple linear regression and three machine learning models and finds that the random forest model performs the best for PM2.5 estimation over the period of 2011-2020. The model incorporates several factors such as Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Elevation (EV), Week of the year (WOY), and year and applies them to the entire region of Thailand without relying on monitoring station data. Model performance is evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE), and the results indicate high accuracy for training (R-2: 0.95, RMSE: 5.58 & mu;g/m(3)), validation (R-2: 0.78, RMSE: 11.18 & mu;g/m(3)), and testing (R-2: 0.71, RMSE: 8.79 & mu;g/m(3)) data. These PM2.5 data can be used to analyze the short- and long-term effects of PM2.5 on population health and inform government policy decisions and effective mitigation strategies.

TI  - Understanding Spatial-Temporal Interactions of Ecosystem Services and Their Drivers in a Multi-Scale Perspective of Miluo Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the face of rapid urbanization and global climate change, understanding the trade-offs and synergies of wetland city ecosystem services is vital for mitigating regional ecological and environmental risks, and enhancing human well-being. The Dongting Lake Basin is an ecologically fragile area of global significance. Uncontrolled resource utilization and intensive human activities have severely damaged the ecological environment, including in Miluo. Thus, it is of paramount research importance to uncover the trade-offs and synergies of ecosystem services and their driving mechanisms in Miluo. To achieve this, we classified Miluo's land use data over the past two decades using a random forest model and Landsat imagery. We quantified the major ecosystem services in Miluo by employing ecological process models such as InVEST, RUSLE, and CASA. Additionally, we examined the trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services at different scales and identified the driving mechanisms using multi-source remote sensing data. The results revealed that forests exhibited the highest level of ecosystem services, while urban ecosystem services experienced a significant decline. Over the past two decades, Miluo displayed notable trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services, with synergies prevailing as the dominant pattern, particularly at the county scale. Furthermore, human activities emerged as the primary driver of changes in Miluo's ecosystem services during the 20-year period. Therefore, it is imperative for scientists, policymakers, and civil society to develop effective and scientifically sound strategies to mitigate the ecological risks resulting from rapid urbanization and climate change in the future.

TI  - The INOVMineral Project's Contribution to Mineral Exploration-A WebGIS Integration and Visualization of Spectral and Geophysical Properties of the Aldeia LCT Pegmatite Spodumene Deposit
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the current energetic transition, new geological exploration technologies are needed to discover mineral deposits containing critical materials such as lithium (Li). The vast majority of European Li deposits are related to Li-Cs-Ta (LCT) pegmatites. A review of the literature indicates that conventional exploration campaigns are dominated by geochemical surveys and related exploration tools. However, other exploration techniques must be evaluated, namely, remote sensing (RS) and geophysics. This work presents the results of the INOVMINERAL4.0 project obtained through alternative approaches to traditional geochemistry that were gathered and integrated into a webGIS application. The specific objectives were to: (i) assess the potential of high-resolution elevation data; (ii) evaluate geophysical methods, particularly radiometry; (iii) establish a methodology for spectral data acquisition and build a spectral library; (iv) compare obtained spectra with Landsat 9 data for pegmatite identification; and (v) implement a user-friendly webGIS platform for data integration and visualization. Radiometric data acquisition using geophysical techniques effectively discriminated pegmatites from host rocks. The developed spectral library provides valuable insights for space-based exploration. Landsat 9 data accurately identified known LCT pegmatite targets compared with Landsat 8. The user-friendly webGIS platform facilitates data integration, visualization, and sharing, supporting potential users in similar exploration approaches.

TI  - Insuring Alpine Grasslands against Drought-Related Yield Losses Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work estimates yield losses due to drought events in the mountain grasslands in north-eastern Italy, laying the groundwork for index-based insurance. Given the high correlation between the leaf area index (LAI) and grassland yield, we exploit the LAI as a proxy for yield. We estimate the LAI by using the Sentinel-2 biophysical processor and compare different gap-filling methods, including time series interpolation and fusion with Sentinel-1 SAR data. We derive the grassland production index (GPI) as the growing season cumulate of the daily product between the LAI and a meteorological water stress coefficient. Finally, we calculate the drought index as an anomaly of the GPI. The validation of the Sentinel-2 LAI with ground measurements showed an RMSE of 0.92 [m(2) m(-2)] and an R-2 of 0.81 over all the measurement sites. A comparison between the GPI and yield showed, on average, an R-2 of 0.56 at the pixel scale and an R-2 of 0.74 at the parcel scale. The developed prototype GPI index was used at the end of the growing season of the year 2022 to calculate the payments of an experimental insurance scheme which was proposed to a group of farmers in Trentino-South Tyrol.

T2  - INVESTIGACIONES GEOGRAFICAS-SPAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is one of the most frequent destructive events across the world and the main cause of alterations in the functioning of ecosystems, shifting the patterns of matter and energy exchange with the atmosphere. The objectives of this paper are: 1) to identify the area affected by fires in the province of Cordoba, Argentina, between August and September 2020, 2) to analyze the impacts through four ecosystem variables: the aerial net primary productivity (ANPP), evapotranspiration (ET), albedo, and land surface temperature (LST), and 3) to identify priority areas for restoration through multicriteria analysis. We have used Sentinel-2 images and MODIS products through the Google Earth Engine platform. Fires affected 109,307 hectares, of which 40% exhibited a moderate to high severity. ET was the most affected variable, decreasing by up to 24.8% compared to the pre-fire average situation. The impact on LST and PPNA was found to be moderate, with extreme changes of 10.2% and 10.6%, respectively. We have identified four priority areas for restoration. The low priority areas represent 50% of the total burned area, while high priority areas represent just 7%. This paper provides highly useful information for implementing public policies aimed at guaranteeing the sustainability of these ecosystems.

TI  - Microplastics, Additives, and Plasticizers in Freshwater Bivalves: Preliminary Research of Biomonitoring
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Microplastics are widespread in freshwater environments and could impact these ecosystems. Bivalves are freshwater organisms that are particularly exposed to microplastic contamination. Therefore, in this preliminary study, the accumulation of microplastics, plasticizers, and additives in the freshwater bivalves Anodonta cygnea was investigated through active biomonitoring. Specimens bought commercially were exposed in three rivers in Central Italy for different exposure times: short (1 month) and long (3 months). The gills and the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) were analyzed separately to evaluate the possible uptake and ingestion of particles via Micro-FTIR. For the first time, small microplastics (SMPs, 5-100 & mu;m), plasticizers, additives, and other micro-litter components, e.g., natural and non-plastic synthetic fibers (APFs), were identified in the bivalve A. cygnea. The most abundant polymer in the gills (94.4%) and in the GITs (66.1%) was polyamide, which had the highest concentration in each river. A decrease in SMPs' abundance was observed over time in the gills in each river, while the abundance in the GIT increased. Compared to polymers, a greater variety of APFs was observed in rivers. The APFs changed during the time of exposure and between different rivers more evidently than polymers, allowing for a clearer identification of the possible sources. These results highlighted the plastic pollution caused by SMPs using freshwater bivalves as sentinel organisms and the need to further investigate the additives that can be proxies of the presence of microplastics in the environment and biota.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Riverbank Migration Using Particle Image Velocimetry
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mobile river channels endanger human life and property and over centuries shape ecosystems, landscapes, and stratigraphy. Quantifying channel movements from remote sensing is difficult, in part due to the diversity of river mobility processes (e.g., channel migration, cutoffs, avulsion) and planform morphologies (e.g., meandering, braided). Here, we present a framework for quantifying riverbank migration from remote sensing that upscales recent methodological advances from laboratory flume studies utilizing particle image velocimetry (PIV). We apply PIV to image time series of 21 rivers worldwide, showing PIV ignores cutoff and avulsion processes by design and is well suited for tracking riverbank migration regardless of planform morphology. We show that PIV-derived results for riverbank migration are consistent with published results from centerline- and bank-based Lagrangian methods. Unlike existing methods, PIV offers a grid-based Eulerian framework where defining channel centerlines is unnecessary and quantified uncertainty in riverbank positions is propagated into uncertainty in migration rates. PIV offers means to efficiently extract global patterns in riverbank migration from decades of satellite data, as well as investigate river response to climate change and human activities in our rapidly changing world.

TI  - Thermal pattern at kueishantao (KST) volcano of Taiwan from satellite-observed temperatures and its implication
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Kueishantao (KST) is an active volcanic island off the northeastern coast of Taiwan. Tectonically, it lies in the south of the Okinawa Trough and opposite to the Ilan plain, in which is the southwestern end of the trough. KST provides a convenient observation site for the subsurface geological and geothermal activity and mechanism at its proximity. Land surface temperature (LST) of volcanoes detected from satellite sensors reflects the thermal status of heat sources in the subsurface. LST thus is a key parameter to the understanding of the volcanic process and geothermal resources. This research utilizes the satellite-observed multi-temporal land surface temperature imagery in 1999-2022 on the Kueishantao volcano of Taiwan to explore its geothermal state. The U.S. NASA Earth-observing satellites onboard three thermal sensors (i.e., Landsat ETM+, Terra ASTER, and Aqua/Terra MODIS) derived time series of land surface temperature from 1999 are employed to define the past and current pattern of geothermal activity plus the future trend of the KST. The spatiotemporal LST distribution of KST volcano is explored and analyzed. The spatial LST distribution of the KST volcano indicates that LST anomaly areas are mainly located on the southeast island, which is well correlated with the possible magma reservoir location from previous geophysical and geological surveys. An increasing trend of two-decade LST time series is revealed from all three thermal sensors. The retrieved surface thermal pattern shows non-linear temperature variations that imply the non-steady-state nature of the subsurface thermal sources at this volcano. In summary, satellite LST observations facilitate the understanding on the subsurface magmatic processes of active volcanoes for further management of geothermal resources.

TI  - A Spatial and Temporal Evolution Analysis of Desert Land Changes in Inner Mongolia by Combining a Structural Equation Model and Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the wide application of remote sensing technology, target detection based on deep learning has become a research hotspot in the field of remote sensing. In this paper, aimed at the problems of the existing deep-learning-based desert land intelligent extraction methods, such as the spectral similarity of features and unclear texture features, we propose a multispectral remote sensing image desert land intelligent extraction method that takes into account band information. Firstly, we built a desert land intelligent interpretation dataset based on band weighting to enhance the desert land foreground features of the images. On this basis, we introduced the deformable convolution adaptive feature extraction capability to U-Net and developed the Y-Net model to extract desert land from Landsat remote sensing images covering the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Finally, in order to analyze the spatial and temporal trends of the desert land in the study area, we used a structural equation model (SEM) to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of natural conditions and human activities, i.e., population density (PD), livestock volume (LS), evaporation (Evp), temperature (T), days of sandy wind conditions (LD), humidity (RH), precipitation (P), anthropogenic disturbance index (Adi), and cultivated land (CL). The results show that the F1-score of the Y-Net model proposed in this paper is 95.6%, which is 11.5% more than that of U-Net. Based on the Landsat satellite images, the area of desert land in the study area for six periods from 1990 to 2020 was extracted. The results show that the area of desert land in the study area first increased and then decreased. The main influencing factors have been precipitation, humidity, and anthropogenic disturbance, for which the path coefficients are 0.646, 0.615, and 0.367, respectively. This study will be of great significance in obtaining large-scale and long-term time series of desert land cover and revealing the inner mechanism of desert land area change.

TI  - Evaluation of SMAP-Enhanced Products Using Upscaled Soil Moisture Data Based on Random Forest Regression: A Case Study of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The evaluation of satellite soil moisture is a big challenge owing to the large spatial mismatch between pixel-based satellite soil moisture products and point-based in situ measurements. Upscaling in situ measurements to obtain the "true value" of soil moisture content at the satellite grid/footprint scale can make up for the scale difference and improve the validation. Many existing upscaling methods have strict requirements regarding the spatial distribution and quantity of soil moisture sensors. However, in reality, soil-moisture-monitoring networks are commonly sparse with low sensor density, which increases the difficulty of obtaining accurate upscaled soil moisture data and limits the validation of satellite products. For this reason, this paper proposes a scheme to upscale in situ measurements using five machine learning methods along with Landsat 8 datasets and DEM data to validate the accuracy of a SMAP-enhanced passive soil moisture product for a sparse network on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The proposed scheme realizes the upscaling of in situ soil moisture data to the pixel scale (30 m x 30 m) and then to the coarse grid scale (9 km x 9 km) by using multi-source remote sensing data as the bridge of scale conversion. The long-time SMAP SM products since April 2015 on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were validated based on upscaled soil moisture data. The results show that (1) random forest regression performs the best, and the upscaled soil moisture data reflect the region-average soil moisture conditions that can be used for evaluating SMAP data; (2) the SMAP product meets its scientific measurement requirements; and (3) the SMAP product generally underestimates the soil moisture in the study area.

TI  - Mapping Alteration Minerals Using ZY-1 02D Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data in Coalbed Methane Enrichment Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a clean energy resource, coalbed methane (CBM) is an important industry in China's dual-carbon strategic planning. Despite the immense potential of CBM resources in China, the current exploration level remains low due to outdated survey technology, impeding large-scale exploration and development. This study investigates the application of hyperspectral data in CBM enrichment areas, specifically focusing on the extraction of alteration minerals in the Hudi coal mine area of the Qinshui Basin using ZY-1 02D and Hyperion hyperspectral data. The hyperspectral alteration mineral identification methods are summarized and analyzed. A method that combines spectral feature matching and diagnostic characteristic parameters is proposed for mineral extraction based on the spectral characteristics of different minerals. The extraction results are verified through field samples using X-ray diffraction analysis. Results show that (1) both ZY-1 02D and Hyperion hyperspectral data yield favorable extraction results for clay and carbonate minerals; (2) the overall accuracy of clay and carbonate minerals extraction is higher using ZY-1 02D data compared with Hyperion data, with accuracies of 81.67% and 79.03%, respectively; (3) the proposed method effectively extracts alteration minerals in CBM enrichment areas using hyperspectral data, thereby providing valuable technical support for the application of hyperspectral data.

TI  - The Aerosol Optical Characteristics in Different Dust Events Based on a 532 nm and 355 nm Polarization Lidar in Beijing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme weather events are happening more frequently as a result of global climate change. Dust storms broke out in the spring of 2017 in China and drastically impacted the local air quality. In this study, a variety of data, including aerosol vertical profiles, surface particle concentration, meteorological parameters, and MODIS-derived aerosol optical depth, as well as backward trajectory analysis, were employed to analyze two dust events from April to May in Beijing. The dust plumes were mainly concentrated below 0.8 km, with peak PM10 values of 1000 mu g center dot m(-3) and 300 mu g center dot m(-3) in the two cases. The aerosols showed different vertical distribution characteristics. The pure dust in case 1 from 4 to 5 May 2017 had a longer duration (2 days) and presented a larger aerosol extinction coefficient (2.27 km(-1) at 355 nm and 1.25 km(-1) at 532 nm) than that of the mixed dust in case 2 on 17 April 2017 (2.01 km(-1) at 355 nm and 1.33 km(-1) at 532 nm). The particle depolarization ratio (PDR) remained constant (0.24 +/- 0.03 in case 1) from the surface to 0.8 km in height. In contrast, the PDR profile in the mixed dust (case 2) layer was split into two regions-large values exceeding 0.15 above 0.6 km and small values of 0.11 +/- 0.03 below 0.6 km. The influence of meteorological information on aerosol distribution was also investigated, and wind was predominant through the observing period. The pure dust in case 1 was mainly from Mongolia, with strong northwest winds, while the near-surface mixed pollution was caused by the combination of long-transported sand and local emission. Furthermore, lidar-derived profiles of dust mass concentrations in the two cases were presented. This study reveals the vertical characteristics of dust aerosols in the production and dissipation of localized dust events and confirms the efficacy of thorough observations with multiple approaches from the ground to space to monitor dust events in real time.

TI  - Automatic registration method for medium-resolution remote sensing images of coral reefs with morphological information pairing and constrained iterative fining
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic registration of medium-resolution remote sensing images of coral reefs, particularly those without artificial facilities, faces two challenges: difficulty in identifying the same coral reefs in different images and instability of the fine-tuning process. To overcome these challenges, we propose an automatic registration method that combines morphological information pairing with constrained iterative fining. This method comprises three steps. First, the contours of the coral reefs were extracted using level set method. Subsequently, the same coral reefs in the two images were identified and paired based on morphological similarities and relative locations. Finally, iterative fine registration with a constrained strategy was performed by controlling abnormal changes in the geometric center to further improve the registration accuracy for every pair of coral reefs. The proposed automatic registration method was validated using a Landsat5 image acquired on April 15, 2005 and a HJ-1B image acquired on May 4, 2010. Compared with the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) method and the SIFT with Random Sample Consensus method, the proposed method showed good performance in the automatic registration of coral reef images.

AB  - & BULL; Context.-Distinction between Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and pulmonary small cell carcinoma (PSmCC) can be challenging, even with the aid of immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of CK20 and TTF1, as these tumors occasionally lack classic immunophenotypes (CK20+/ TTF1- in MCC and CK20-/TTF1 & PLUSMN; in PSmCC). Objective.-To evaluate the diagnostic utility of SOX11 and PAX5 IHC for distinguishing MCCs from PSmCCs and compare it with that of CK20 and TTF1 IHC. Design.-SOX11, PAX5, CK20, and TTF1 expression (pattern, intensity, and proportion of tumor cells express-ing protein) was assessed in 31 primary and 16 metastatic MCCs and 20 primary and 9 metastatic PSmCCs. Results.-SOX11 expression was present in all MCCs and was predominantly strong and diffuse. Only 19% of primary and 38% of metastatic MCCs exhibited diffuse PAX5 expression; none exhibited strong immunoreactivity. Strong and diffuse SOX11 expression was seen in less than 25% of primary and metastatic PSmCCs. PAX5 expression was rare in PSmCCs and was mostly weak and focal/ patchy. SOX11 expression in at least 26% of tumor cells, with at least moderate intensity, favored the diagnosis of MCC over PSmCC (P , .001). Furthermore, SOX11 expression was more likely than CK20 expression to be strong or diffuse in sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases of MCC, indicating that SOX11 is superior to CK20 for detecting tumor deposits in SLNs in MCC. Conclusions.-Our findings indicate that SOX11 not only is a powerful marker for distinguishing MCCs from PSmCCs, especially when used in conjunction with CK20 and TTF1, but also has utility for screening SLNs in MCC.

TI  - Landsat 9 Geometric Commissioning Calibration Updates and System Performance Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Starting with launch of Landsat 7 (L7) on 15 April 1999, the USGS Landsat Image Assessment System (IAS) has been performing calibration and characterization operations for over 20 years on the Landsat spacecrafts and their associated payloads. With the launch of Landsat 9 (L9) on 27 September 2021, that spacecraft and its payloads, the Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI-2) and Thermal Infrared Sensor-2 (TIRS-2), were added to the existing suite of missions supported by the IAS. This paper discusses the geometric characterizations, calibrations, and performance analyses conducted during the commissioning period of the L9 spacecraft and its instruments. During this time frame the following calibration refinements were performed; (1) alignment between the OLI-2 and TIRS-2 instruments and the spacecraft attitude control system, (2) within-instrument band alignment, (3) instrument-to-instrument alignment. These refinements, carried out during commissioning and discussed in this paper, were performed to provide an on-orbit update to the pre-launch calibration parameters that were determined through Ground System Element (GSE) testing and Thermal Vacuum Testing (TVAC) for the two instruments and the L9 spacecraft. The commissioning period calibration update captures the effects of launch shift and zero-G release, and typically represents the largest changes that are made to the on-orbit geometric calibration parameters during the mission. The geometric calibration parameter updates performed during commissioning were done prior to releasing any L9 products to the user community. This commissioning period also represents the time frame during which focus is more strictly placed on the spacecraft and instrument performance, ensuring that system and instrument requirements are met, as contrasted with the post commissioning time frame when a greater focus is placed on the products generated, their behavior and their impact on the user community. Along with the calibration updates discussed in this paper key geometric performance requirements with respect to geodetic accuracy, geometric accuracy, and swath width are presented, demonstrating that the geometric performance of the L9 spacecraft and its' instruments with respect to these key performance requirements are being met. Within the paper it will be shown that the absolute geodetic accuracy is met for OLI-2 and TIRS-2 with a margin of approximately 79% and 65% respectively while the geometric accuracy is met for OLI-2 and TIRS-2 with a margin of approximately 68% and 43% respectively.

TI  - Semiautomatic detection of burnt areas in Chimborazo-Ecuador using dNBR mean composites with adjusted thresholds
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - A semi-automatic methodology was implemented for the delimitation of burning areas in the province of Chimborazo in Ecuador, during the period 2018-2021, by using the database of forest fires provided by the "Amazonia sin fuego" program of the "Ministerio de Ambiente Agua y Transicion Ecologica" (MAATE). The collections of atmospherically corrected Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 images available on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform were used. To delimit the burning areas, mean composite images of normalized burning indices (NBR) were calculated in GEE and the most appropriate thresholds of the difference of normalized burning indices (dNBR) were evaluated above which the burning for paramo ecosystem is delimited. The results shows: (a) the dNBR threshold value, based on Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 composite mean images, that best fits to identify burning areas in the study area is 0.15; (b) nine events with areas equal to or greater than 100 ha were found, but only seven could be located; (c) most of the burned areas recorded in the MAATE database were overestimated from 45.0% to 91.5% compared to the burn areas digitized on satellite images. These findings provide information that contributes to the strengthening of national fire statistics, useful for the construction of public policies for monitoring and managing forest fires in Ecuador.

TI  - Do beaver ponds increase methane emissions along Arctic tundra streams?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Beaver engineering in the Arctic tundra induces hydrologic and geomorphic changes that are favorable to methane (CH4) production. Beaver-mediated methane emissions are driven by inundation of existing vegetation, conversion from lotic to lentic systems, accumulation of organic rich sediments, elevated water tables, anaerobic conditions, and thawing permafrost. Ground-based measurements of CH4 emissions from beaver ponds in permafrost landscapes are scarce, but hyperspectral remote sensing data (AVIRIS-NG) permit mapping of 'hotspots' thought to represent locations of high CH4 emission. We surveyed a 429.5 km(2) area in Northwestern Alaska using hyperspectral airborne imaging spectroscopy at & SIM;5 m pixel resolution (14.7 million observations) to examine spatial relationships between CH4 hotspots and 118 beaver ponds. AVIRIS-NG CH4 hotspots covered 0.539% (2.3 km(2)) of the study area, and were concentrated within 30 m of waterbodies. Comparing beaver ponds to all non-beaver waterbodies (including waterbodies >450 m from beaver-affected water), we found significantly greater CH4 hotspot occurrences around beaver ponds, extending to a distance of 60 m. We found a 51% greater CH4 hotspot occurrence ratio around beaver ponds relative to nearby non-beaver waterbodies. Dammed lake outlets showed no significant differences in CH4 hotspot ratios compared to non-beaver lakes, likely due to little change in inundation extent. The enhancement in AVIRIS-NG CH4 hotspots adjacent to beaver ponds is an example of a new disturbance regime, wrought by an ecosystem engineer, accelerating the effects of climate change in the Arctic. As beavers continue to expand into the Arctic and reshape lowland ecosystems, we expect continued wetland creation, permafrost thaw and alteration of the Arctic carbon cycle, as well as myriad physical and biological changes.

TI  - AGDATABOX-RS computational application: Remote sensing data management
T2  - SOFTWAREX
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing can help evolution of agricultural practices by providing periodic information about the status of a given crop over the harvest season, at different scales, and for different segments. Applications in precision agriculture use remote sensing practices based on multispectral images to measure plants' parameters throughout their development cycle. The aim of the current research is to develop a computational module capable of integrating and providing remote sensing data for the AgDataBox precision agriculture platform. The herein developed application enabled the persistence of a new field, the search for raster images generated by orbital satellites, the selection of vegetation indices, as well as the vectorization and insertion of images of interest in the AgDataBox platform. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Adaptation of a Neuro-Variational Algorithm from SeaWiFS to MODIS-Aqua Sensor for the Determination of Atmospheric and Oceanic Variables
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sahara desert is a major global source of dust that is mostly transported southwest over the ocean off West Africa. The presence of this dust impacts the remote sensing of ocean surface properties. These aerosols have absorbing properties that are poorly accounted for in the standard ocean color data processing algorithm. This can result in an overestimation of the atmospheric contribution to the ocean color signal and consequently an underestimation of the oceanic contribution. A two-step algorithm initially applied to the Sea-viewing Wide field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data was adapted to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-Aqua) sensor in the Northwest African region. The Northwest African region is a very productive region, where pelagic resources are an important socio-economic sector. Improving atmospheric correction of ocean color products is, thus, of particular interest for this oceanic region. The two-step approach of classifying the top-of-atmosphere radiance spectra for a better estimate of aerosol type on the one hand, and using an optimization method to fit the parameters of these aerosols and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) on the other hand, allows for a better representation of the optical thickness, a correction of the marine reflectance spectrum, and an increase in the spatio-temporal coverage of the area. To the extent that the properties of the water color signal are improved by this data processing, the Chla estimates should also be improved by this approach. However, it is difficult to conclude on this point from the available in situ observations.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of algal blooms in a tropical crater-lake from MODIS data (2003-2020)
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - The crater lake of Santa Maria del Oro in Nayarit State presents Algal Blooms (AB) in a cyclical annual manner. The blooming and subsequent decline of these populations creates color changes in the water, generally in the first half of the year. This work evaluated supervised classification algorithms that allow these changes to be identified using data from the MOD09GQ and MYD09GQ products of MODIS sensor in the period from January 2003 to December 2020. Based on a review of AB recorded in the literature and statistical analysis of dispersion graphs, a database of spectral information and lake color state labels was created to evaluate the different classification algorithms. The best classifier was Random Forest with an accuracy of 83.3%. The temporal analysis and spatial evaluation of the blooms incidence showed that May, April and March are the months with the greatest presence of color changes related to AB in the lake. The spatial analysis found that the highest incidence of blooms occurs in the southeast region of the lake and the the greatest number of events occurred in the years 2011, 2008 and 2012, respectively. The influence of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon on the incidence of algal blooms in the crater lake is determined by the temporal pattern between the anomalies in the AB and the Multivariate ENSO Index, where the greater number of AB events occurred in the cold phases of the ENSO.

TI  - Vegetation Representation Influences Projected Streamflow Changes in the Colorado River Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation parameters for the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model were recently up-dated using observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Previous work showed that these MODIS-based parameters improved VIC evapotranspiration simulations when compared to eddy covari-ance observations. Due to the importance of evapotranspiration within the Colorado River basin, this study provided a basin-by-basin calibration of VIC soil parameters with updated MODIS-based vegetation parameters to improve streamflow simulations. Interestingly, while both configurations had similar historic streamflow performance, end-of-century hydrologic projections, driven by 29 downscaled global climate models under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario, differed between the two configurations. The calibrated MODIS-based configuration had an ensemble mean that sim-ulated little change in end-of-century annual streamflow volume (10.4%) at Lees Ferry, Arizona, relative to the his-torical period (1960-2005). In contrast, the previous VIC configuration, which is used to inform decisions about future water resources in the Colorado River basin, projected an 11.7% decrease in annual streamflow. Both VIC configura-tions simulated similar amounts of evapotranspiration in the historical period. However, the MODIS-based VIC con -figuration did not show as much of an increase in evapotranspiration by the end of the century, primarily within the upper basin's forested areas. Differences in evapotranspiration projections were the result of the MODIS-based vege-tation parameters having lower leaf area index values and less forested area compared to previous vegetation esti-mates used in recent Colorado River basin hydrologic projections. These results highlight the need to accurately characterize vegetation and better constrain climate sensitivities in hydrologic models.

TI  - Small Field Plots Can Cause Substantial Uncertainty in Gridded Aboveground Biomass Products from Airborne Lidar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerging satellite radar and lidar platforms are being developed to produce gridded aboveground biomass (AGB) predictions that are poised to expand our understanding of global carbon stocks and changes. However, the spatial resolution of AGB map products from these platforms is often larger than the available field plot data underpinning model calibration and validation efforts. Intermediate-resolution/extent remotely sensed data, like airborne lidar, can serve as a bridge between small plots and map resolution, but methods are needed to estimate and propagate uncertainties with multiple layers of data. Here, we introduce a workflow to estimate the pixel-level mean and variance in AGB maps by propagating uncertainty from a lidar-based model using small plots, taking into account prediction uncertainty, residual uncertainty, and residual spatial autocorrelation. We apply this workflow to estimate AGB uncertainty at a 100 m map resolution (1 ha pixels) using 0.04 ha field plots from 11 sites across four ecoregions. We compare uncertainty estimates using site-specific models, ecoregion-specific models, and a general model using all sites. The estimated AGB uncertainty for 1 ha pixels increased with mean AGB, reaching 7.8-33.3 Mg ha(-1) for site-specific models (one standard deviation), 11.1-28.2 Mg ha(-1) for ecoregion-specific models, and 21.1-22.1 Mg ha(-1) for the general model for pixels in the AGB range of 80-100 Mg ha(-1). Only 3 of 11 site-specific models had a total uncertainty of <15 Mg ha(-1) in this biomass range, suitable for the calibration or validation of AGB map products. Using two additional sites with larger field plots, we show that lidar-based models calibrated with larger field plots can substantially reduce 1 ha pixel AGB uncertainty for the same range from 18.2 Mg ha(-1) using 0.04 ha plots to 10.9 Mg ha(-1) using 0.25 ha plots and 10.1 Mg ha(-1) using 1 ha plots. We conclude that the estimated AGB uncertainty from models estimated from small field plots may be unacceptably large, and we recommend coordinated efforts to measure larger field plots as reference data for the calibration or validation of satellite-based map products at landscape scales (& GE;0.25 ha).

TI  - Soil moisture, stressed vegetation and the spatial structure of soil erosion in a high latitude rangeland
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion has been a persistent problem in high-latitude regions and may worsen as climate change unfolds and encourages increased anthropogenic exploitation. We propose that soil moisture is likely to shape future erosion trends, as moisture stress reduces the capacity of vegetation cover to retard erosive processes. However, the spatial variability of soil moisture in high-latitude soils-and the ways in which this variability drives the spatial distribution of erosion features-is poorly understood. We addressed this knowledge gap with a study of andosol erosion in southern Iceland. Our study used a combination of high-resolution (<3 cm) remote sensing data (using normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalised difference red edge as metrics of plant vitality) and long-term, in situ measurements of soil moisture to unpick the relationship between moisture stress, vegetation vitality and patchy soil erosion. Mean NDVI increased with distance from eroded areas, varying from similar to 0.6 in vegetated areas on the margins of erosion patches to similar to 0.8 in areas >10 m from eroded terrain. We found lower moisture availability close to existing erosion features: mean volumetric soil moisture content varied from 17% (proximal to erosion patch) to 36% (distal to erosion patch). We also found that variability in soil moisture decreased with distance from eroded areas: the coefficient of variation (CV) in soil moisture varied from 0.33 (proximal to erosion patch) to 0.13 (distal to erosion). Our findings indicate that the margins of erosion patches have a stressful soil environment due to exposure to the atmosphere. The vegetation in these locations grows less vigorously, and the exposed soil becomes more vulnerable to erosion, leading to erosion patch expansion and coalescence. If these conditions hold more generally, they may represent a feedback mechanism that facilitates the lateral propagation of soil erosion in high-latitude regions.

TI  - Therapeutic Approaches to Vulvar Cancer: A Review of Literature
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: Vulvar cancer is a rare gynecological cancer that mainly affects postmenopausal women. The aim of this review is to analyze the most recent data available in the literature on the clinical and therapeutic approach to vulvar carcinoma. Mechanism: Studies available in the literature on the therapeutic management of patients with vulvar carcinoma until November 2022 have been screened. A comprehensive search was performed in the PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases. Findings in Brief: The approach to vulvar carcinoma has deeply evolved over the years. The management of early-stage vulvar carcinomas is well established and widely shared, while that of advanced and recurrent cancers is a subject of debate. The assessment of the nodal status has changed from the past with the passage from inguinal lymphadenectomy to the removal of only the sentinel node. Conclusions: The gold standard for the management of vulvar cancer is surgery, applicable in the first instance in early-stage tumors and after neoadjuvant therapy for larger tumors. Assessment of the nodal state is crucial and the method to be used depends on the degree of suspicious of positive lymph nodes. The prognosis is good if the treatment is applicable as soon as possible.

TI  - A Web GIS Platform to Modeling, Simulate and Analyze Flood Events: The RiverCure Portal
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood events are becoming more severe, causing significant problems to human communities, including physical, psychological, and material damage. For both flood forecasting in emergency response situations and flood mapping, georeferencing and data curation are paramount in the context of prevention or preparedness. Hence, data display, data management, and articulation with numerical simulation results must occur on GIS platforms. Our research is motivated by recent advances in Web and GIS technologies, social sensing and high-performance computing, and an envisaged wider availability of remote sensing data. This paper presents and discusses an innovative Web GIS platform named "RiverCure Portal" or "RCP" for short. This platform combines observations and hydrodynamic modelling tools to support various stages of the flood risk management cycle, including operational response, emergency preparedness, and risk assessment. RCP is a multi-organization, multi-context digital platform with flexible configuration features to define and support multiple sensor types and modelling options, satisfying the various needs of different organizations and stakeholders. In addition, this paper discusses the RiverCure Approach, which encompasses the following tasks directly supported by the RCP platform: defining the context and involved geometries, associating sensors to the context, pre-processing and generating the context mesh, defining the simulation event, running the simulation event, and analyzing the results from the simulation event. Thus, the RCP streamlines and simplifies data analysis and simulation procedures to meet decision-makers' needs. The novelties discussed in this paper include the design and discussion of a Web GIS platform that allows (i) to manage flood data and results of simulations at several contextual levels by different stakeholders such as domain experts, decision-makers, researchers, or students; (ii) to process and curate sensed data obtained from physical and social sensors; and (iii) update the state and values of the parameters of simulation tools through continuous data assimilation techniques for forecasting purposes. Finally, this paper supports the explanation and discussion with a running example, "agueda 2016 flood" event, which dataset is publicly available for further study and experimentation.

TI  - Qualitative and quantitative analysis of artificial neural network-based post-classification comparison to detect the earth surface variations using hyperspectral and multispectral datasets
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an effective way to analyze land surface changes on regular basis globally. In the previous literature, numerous change detection models were developed to detect the multitemporal or seasonal variations using different optical datasets, such as multispectral and hyperspectral. But there are many challenges involved in the processing of numerous bands, especially in the case of hyperspectral datasets, such as computational constraints and radiometric/atmospheric distortion. A simple framework-based artificial neural network (ANN) and post-classification comparison (PCC), named ANN-based PCC (ANPC), has been proposed to detect the multitemporal changes over agricultural land using hyperspectral, i.e., Earth Observation (EO-1) Hyperion and multispectral, i.e., Landsat-8. For cross-referencing, a comparative analysis is performed with respect to well-known PCC-based change detection methods, i.e., random forest-based post-comparison (RFPC) and support vector machine-based post-comparison (SVMPC). Experimental outcomes confirmed the effectiveness of ANPC (with an accuracy of more than 90%) in the extraction of multitemporal changes as compared to RFPC and SVMPC (with an accuracy of <90 % ). Our study enhances the utilization of the hyperspectral dataset (due to narrow spectral bands) in the extraction of critical information about the earth's surface parameters.

TI  - Effects of Temporal and Spatial Changes in Wetlands on Regional Carbon Storage in the Naoli River Basin, Sanjiang Plain, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Naoli River (NLR) Basin is a crucial distribution area for wetlands in China. Investigating the link between land use changes and carbon storage in this basin is of significant importance for protecting regional ecosystems and promoting the sustainable development of the social economy. This paper uses long-term Landsat satellite images provided on the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform and the random forest classification algorithm to create spatial distribution maps of land use in the NLR Basin from 1993 to 2022. The study analyzes the dynamic changes in wetlands in the basin over the past 30 years and employs the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) model to explore the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of carbon storage. The results reveal that the wetland area of the NLR Basin showed a downward trend from 1993 to 2022, with a total decrease of 1507.18 hm(2) over 30 years. During this period, the carbon storage in the NLR Basin decreased, with a cumulative loss of 1.98 x 10(7) t, mainly due to the continuous reductions in wetland and forest land. Additionally, the change in carbon storage in the basin has a strong spatial and temporal relationship with the changes in land use/cover area. The total carbon storage is positively associated with the areas of wetland, forest land, and water bodies. The conversion of wetlands into any other land type results in the reduction in carbon storage. These findings can improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of wetlands in the NLR Basin over the past 30 years and enable us to analyze the relationship between land use changes and regional carbon storage. The results of this study have great significance for protecting the wetland ecology and regional carbon balance in the NLR Basin.

TI  - Evaluating the Necessity for Routine Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Postmenopausal Patients Being Treated for Clinically Node Negative Breast Cancer the Era of RxPONDER
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study illustrates that omitting SLNB may be safe in postmenopausal patients with ER + /HER2 - breast cancer with clinically negative axillae. Following RxPONDER, RS is currently the most important parameter used to guide of chemotherapy prescription, with SLNB being considerably less important than in previous decades.Introduction: Traditionally, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed to inform adjuvant chemotherapy prescription and prognosis in breast cancer. Following RxPONDER, the OncotypeDX Recurrence Score (RS) guides adjuvant chemotherapy prescription for all postmenopausal patients with estrogen receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (ER + /HER2 -) breast cancer with 0 to 3 positive lymph nodes (0-3 + LN). Aims: To establish the oncological safety of omitting SLNB in postmenopausal patients with ER + /HER2 - breast cancer indicated to undergo SLNB and to evaluate the primary determinants of chemotherapy prescription for these patients.Patients and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was undertaken. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed. Data analytics was performed using SPSS v26.0.Results: Five hundred and seventy five consecutive patients were included (mean age: 66.5 years, range: 45-96). The median follow-up was 97.2 months (range: 3.0-181.6). Of the 575 patients, just 12 patients had positive SLNB (SLNB + ) (2.1%). Using Kaplan-Meier analyses, SLNB + failed to impact recurrence ( P = .766) or mortality ( P = .310). However, using Cox regression analyses, SLNB + independently predicted poorer disease-free survival (hazard ratio: 1.001, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.000-1.001, P = .029). Logistic regression analysis identified RS as the sole predictor of chemotherapy prescription (odds ratio: 1.171, 95% CI: 1.097-1.250, P < .001).Conclusion: Omitting SLNB may be safe and justifiable in postmenopausal patients with ER + /HER2 - breast cancer with clinically negative axillae. Following RxPONDER, RS is the most important guide of chemotherapy use in these patients and SLNB may be less important than previously perceived. Prospective, randomized clinical trials are required to fully establish the oncological safety of omitting SLNB in this setting.

TI  - Assessing the impacts of current and future changes of the planforms of river Brahmaputra on its land use-land cover
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - River bankline migration is a frequent phenomenon in the river of the floodplain region. Nowadays, channel dynamics-related changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are becoming a risk to the life and property of people living in the vicinity of rivers. A comprehensive evaluation of the causes and consequences of such changes is essential for better policy and decision-making for disaster risk reduction and management. The present study assesses the changes in the Brahmaputra River planform using the GIS-based Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) and relates it with the changing LULC of the floodplain evaluated using the CA-Markov model. In this study, the future channel of the Brahmaputra River and its flood plain's future LULC were forecasted to pinpoint the erosion-vulnerable zone. Fortyeight years (1973-2021) of remotely sensed data were applied to estimate the rate of bankline migration. It was observed that the river's erosion-accretion rate was higher in early times than in more recent ones. The left and right banks' average shifting rates between 1973 and 1988 were -55.44 m/y and -56.79 m/ y, respectively, while they were -17.25 m/y and -48.49 m/y from 2011 to 2021. The left bank of the river Brahmaputra had more erosion than the right, which indicates that the river is shifting in the leftward direction (Southward). In this river course, zone A (Lower course) and zone B (Middle course) were more adversely affected than zone C (Upper course). According to the predicted result, the left bank is more susceptible to bank erosion than the right bank (where the average rate of erosion and deposition was -72.23 m/y and 79.50 m/y, respectively). The left bank's average rate of erosion was -111.22 m/y. The research assesses the LULC study in conjunction with river channel dynamics in vulnerable areas where nearby infrastructure and settlements were at risk due to channel migration. The degree of accuracy was verified using the actual bankline and predicted bankline, as well as the actual LULC map and anticipated LULC map. In more than 90% of cases, the bankline's position and shape generally remain the same as the actual bankline. The overall, and kappa accuracy of all the LULC maps was more than 85%, which was suitable for the forecast. Moreover, chi-square (x2) result values for classified classes denoted the accuracy and acceptability of the CA-Markov model for predicting the LULC map. The results of this work aim to understand better the efficient hazard management strategy for the Brahmaputra River for hazard managers of the region using an automated prediction approach.(c) 2023 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

TI  - Hyperspectral Point Cloud Projection for the Semantic Segmentation of Multimodal Hyperspectral and Lidar Data with Point Convolution-Based Deep Fusion Neural Networks
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The fusion of dissimilar data modalities in neural networks presents a significant challenge, particularly in the case of multimodal hyperspectral and lidar data. Hyperspectral data, typically represented as images with potentially hundreds of bands, provide a wealth of spectral information, while lidar data, commonly represented as point clouds with millions of unordered points in 3D space, offer structural information. The complementary nature of these data types presents a unique challenge due to their fundamentally different representations requiring distinct processing methods. In this work, we introduce an alternative hyperspectral data representation in the form of a hyperspectral point cloud (HSPC), which enables ingestion and exploitation with point cloud processing neural network methods. Additionally, we present a composite fusion-style, point convolution-based neural network architecture for the semantic segmentation of HSPC and lidar point cloud data. We investigate the effects of the proposed HSPC representation for both unimodal and multimodal networks ingesting a variety of hyperspectral and lidar data representations. Finally, we compare the performance of these networks against each other and previous approaches. This study paves the way for innovative approaches to multimodal remote sensing data fusion, unlocking new possibilities for enhanced data analysis and interpretation.

TI  - Estimation of Species-Scale Canopy Chlorophyll Content in Mangroves from UAV and GF-6 Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The growth of mangroves is inhibited due to environmental degradation, and changes in the growing health of mangrove forests cause changes in internal physicochemical parameters. The canopy chlorophyll content is an important indicator to monitor the health status of mangroves. We study the effective inversion data sources and methods of mangrove health indicator parameters to monitor the health of mangrove ecosystems in typical areas of Beibu Gulf, Guangxi. In this study, we evaluated the capability of UAV, GF-6 data, and machine learning regression algorithms in estimating mangrove species-scale canopy chlorophyll content (CCC). Effective measures for mangrove pest and disease pressure, Sporobolus alterniflorus invasion, and anthropogenic risk are also explored, which are important for mangrove conservation and restoration. (1) We obtained several feature variables by constructing a combined vegetation index, and the most sensitive band of mangrove CCC was selected by the characteristic variable evaluation, and the CCC model at the mangrove species-scale was evaluated and validated. Through variable preferences, the feature variables with the highest contribution of Avicennia marina, Aegiceras corniculatum, Kandelia candel, and a collection of three categories of species in the UAV data were indices of RI35, MDATT413, RI35, and NDI35. (2) Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Regression Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting were evaluated using the root-mean-square error and coefficient of determination accuracy metrics. Extreme Gradient Boosting regression algorithms were evaluated for accuracy. In both UAV data and GF-6, RF achieved optimal results in inverse mangrove Aegiceras corniculatum species CCC, with higher stability and robustness in machine learning regressors. (3) Due to the sparse distribution of Kandelia candel in the study area and the low spatial resolution of the images, there is an increased possibility that individual image elements contain environmental noise, such as soil. Therefore, the level of CCC can effectively reflect the health status of mangroves and further reflect the increased possibility of the study area being exposed to risks, such as degradation. The establishment of the current protected areas and restoration of degraded ecosystems are effective measures to cope with the risks of mangrove pest and disease stress, invasion of Sporobolus alterniflorus, and anthropogenic activities, which are important for the protection and restoration of mangroves. This study provides an important data reference and risk warning for mangrove restoration and conservation.

TI  - Soil quality assessment for desertification based on multi-indicators with the best-worst method in a semi-arid ecosystem
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Since there are some signs of land degradation and desertification showing how soil sustainability is threatened, it is crucial to create a soil quality index (SQI) model in the semi-arid corum Basin, situated between the Black Sea and Anatolia Region, Central Turkey. The primary aims of the study are: (1) to determine SQI values of the micro-basin in terms of land degradation and desertification. Moreover, the best-worst method (BWM) was used to determine the weighting score for each parameter; (2) to produce the soils' spatial distribution by utilizing different geostatistical models and GIS (geographic information system) techniques; and (3) to validate the obtained SQI values with biomass reflectance values. Therefore, the relationship of RE-OSAVI (red-edge optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index) and NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) generated from Sentinel-2A satellite images at different time series with soil quality was examined. Results showed that SQI values were high in the areas that had almost a flat and slight slope. Moreover, the areas with high clay content and thick soil depth did not have salinity problems, and were generally distributed in the middle parts of the basin. However, the areas with a high slope, poor vegetation, high sand content, and low water holding capacity had low SQI values. Furthermore, a statistically high positive correlation of RE-OSAVI and NDVI indices with soil quality was found, and NDVI had the highest correlative value for June (R-2=0.802) compared with RE-OSAVI.

TI  - Effect of Cryo-Treated Cutting Tool End Milling on Custom 450 Stainless Steel
T2  - MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Custom 450 stainless steel is the most desirable material across industries due to its widespread application in the aerospace, defense and marine industries. Stainless-steel materials are challenging to deal with and fall into the list of hard-to-process materials due to their low heat conduction coefficient and high mechanical properties. In this research work, end milling was carried out on Custom 450 stainless steel machined using TiAlN coated with tungsten carbide inserts that have been cryo-treated (CT) for 24 h (24 h) and 36 h (36 h), as well as untreated (UT) inserts. The inserts were evaluated in terms of feed force, feed rate and consistent depth of cut (ap) at various spindle speeds (S). Also examined were the tool morphology, chip anatomy and surface morphology of cryo-treated material compared to untreated inserts at various responses to cutting force (Fx, Fy, Fz), cutting temperature (Tc), vibration and surface abrasion. For inserts that have been cryo-treated for 36 h, the feed force (Fx) value was 44% and 5% less compared to inserts treated for 24 h and in UT inserts, respectively. Furthermore, for 24-h and 36-h CT inserts, feed force (Fx) was 12% and 20% less compared to a UT insert. Using 24-h cryo-treated inserts as opposed to UT inserts significantly reduced the surface roughness by 20%. Cutting inserts that have undergone cryogenic treatment have been observed to exhibit longer cutting tool life due to less wear and friction on the cutting edges.

TI  - Modeling medium resolution evapotranspiration using downscaling techniques in north-western part of India
T2  - MAUSAM
M3  - Article
AB  - The present investigation provides a modeling solution to downscale MODIS-based evapotranspiration (ET) at a 30 m spatial resolution from its original 500 m spatial resolution using meteorological and Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager, OLI) data by employing downscaling models. The nine indices namely Surface Albedo, Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and Normalized Difference Infrared Index for Band 7 (NDIIB7) were calculated from Lansat 8 data at 30 m spatial resolution. The multiple linear regression (MLR) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) models were developed to generate the relationship between MODIS 500 m ET and Landsat indices at 500 m scale. Further, these develop models were used to estimate 30 m ET based on 30 m Landsat 8 indices. The performance of developed models (MLR and LS-SVM) was carried out using correlation coefficient (CC), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NASH) efficiency, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Normalised Mean Square Error (NMSE). Penman-Monteith (PM) method was used to estimate the ET using observed station data. The results show that lowest ETO was observed in the month of December while it was maximum in the month of May. Using the performances indices, it was found that LS-SVM model slightly out performed than MLR model. However, the downscaled model overestimates ET in comparison to the Penman-Monteith method. Further, the significant correlation was found between MODIS ET and LS-SVM ET at all the stations.

M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy on targeted axillary dissection (TAD) in node-positive breast cancer (BC) patients who had undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).MethodsSixty-two female BC patients with biopsy-confirmed axillary nodal metastases underwent NAC, followed by breast surgery with TAD. A metallic clip was placed in the sampled LN before NAC. On the day of surgery, a periareolar intradermal Tc-99m-nanocolloid injection was administered, followed by SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy. The clipped nodes were localized on CT images, assessed for Tc-99m uptake before surgery, and confirmed during the procedure.ResultsT1-4, N1-2 patients were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. The clipped node was the SLN in 54 (88.5%) patients. In 3 patients (4.9%), a clip was found in a nonsentinel lymph node. In 4 patients, the clips were not visible on SPECT/CT images, and lymph nodes were not found during the procedure. SPECT/CT correctly localized the clipped lymph node in all patients. The overall false-negative rate for TAD was 3.33%. The mean follow-up duration was 29 months, and there were no axillary recurrences.ConclusionsSPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy can accurately localize clipped nodes and SLNs after NAC in patients with node-positive BC.

TI  - Review of Jeremy David Engels's <i>The Ethics of Oneness: Emerson, Whitman, and the Bhagavad Gita</i> *
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION
M3  - Review
AB  - Jeremy David Engels's scholarly and ambitiously interpretive work accesses the relation of worldviews of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman by drawing on contrasting internal textual resources of the ancient Hindu classic, the Bhagavad Gita. He consistently plays out a polemical interpretation that prioritizes Whitman's supposed this-worldly Vedanta strain of the Gita in contrast to Emerson's promotion of an otherworldly Advaita strain of the same Hindu classic. Whitman's worldview is interpreted in terms of a democratic ethics of oneness that is viable for our times. Arguably, however, Emerson's doctrine of Over-Soul is grounded in mainstream concepts of Western Neoplatonism and post-Kantian strains of objective idealism, not in the Gita. Engels's project increasingly aligns with the rhetoric of postmodernism and global ethics that is common coin in today's academy. It plays out as a kind of monocultural ethics of equality in disagreement with the ethics of democracy based on the twin principles of liberty and equality in the open marketplace of performance, as represented by William James and the other classical Pragmatists.

TI  - Extended Sentinel Monitoring of <i>Helicoverpa zea</i> Resistance to Cry and Vip3Aa Toxins in Bt Sweet Corn: Assessing Changes in Phenotypic and Allele Frequencies of Resistance
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Corn and cotton that produce insecticidal toxins derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are widely adopted in the United States to control corn earworm/cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), which has resulted in major benefits to growers and the general public. However, resistance evolution in H. zea populations has become a major threat to the sustainability of these crops. Bt sweet corn producing the same toxins as Bt field corn is more attractive to H. zea than field corn and, thus, can function as a sentinel plant to detect early stages of resistance. As part of an existing sentinel monitoring network, this study evaluated changes in H. zea resistance during 2020-2022 by estimating the phenotypic and resistance allele frequencies for toxins in sentinel Bt corn. Transgenic corn and cotton that produce Cry and Vip3Aa toxins derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are widely planted in the United States to control lepidopteran pests. The sustainability of these Bt crops is threatened because the corn earworm/bollworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), is evolving a resistance to these toxins. Using Bt sweet corn as a sentinel plant to monitor the evolution of resistance, collaborators established 146 trials in twenty-five states and five Canadian provinces during 2020-2022. The study evaluated overall changes in the phenotypic frequency of resistance (the ratio of larval densities in Bt ears relative to densities in non-Bt ears) in H. zea populations and the range of resistance allele frequencies for Cry1Ab and Vip3Aa. The results revealed a widespread resistance to Cry1Ab, Cry2Ab2, and Cry1A.105 Cry toxins, with higher numbers of larvae surviving in Bt ears than in non-Bt ears at many trial locations. Depending on assumptions about the inheritance of resistance, allele frequencies for Cry1Ab ranged from 0.465 (dominant resistance) to 0.995 (recessive resistance). Although Vip3Aa provided high control efficacy against H. zea, the results show a notable increase in ear damage and a number of surviving older larvae, particularly at southern locations. Assuming recessive resistance, the estimated resistance allele frequencies for Vip3Aa ranged from 0.115 in the Gulf states to 0.032 at more northern locations. These findings indicate that better resistance management practices are urgently needed to sustain efficacy the of corn and cotton that produce Vip3Aa.

TI  - Comparative assessment of the accuracies of daytime land surface temperature retrieval methods using Landsat 8 and MODIS imageries in Benin, West Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important climate variable used to assess the effects of climate change. This research project aims to compare the results of mono-window (MW) and split-window (SW) algorithms against the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level-2 surface temperature (L8-C2L2) products and identify the most suitable techniques. In-situ measurements of the earth's surface temperature and relative humidity have been recorded in 2020. LSTs have been validated using root mean square error (RMSE) based on the in-situ meteorological data. Validation analysis has indicated that the SW algorithm combined with in-situ micro-scale atmospheric water vapor content values was more accurate for LST. In the overall study area, the RMSE values of 1.09 degrees C, 3.97 degrees C, 4.36 degrees C, and 6.80 degrees C have been calculated for SW, MODIS, L8-C2L2, and MW LSTs, respectively. These results have demonstrated that the SW algorithm outperformed the other LST products. The maximum difference between the in-situ earth surface temperature and the SW algorithm was 0.79 degrees C. These findings are essential for comparing different data-driven approaches and identifying the most efficient techniques. The study's significance lies in identifying the most appropriate method for LST retrieval, which can aid in climate change studies and inform decision-making processes.(c) 2023 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Assessment of Spatiotemporal Patterns and the Effect of the Relationship between Meteorological Drought and Vegetation Dynamics in the Yangtze River Basin Based on Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change and human activities have increased the frequency and severity of droughts. This has become a critical factor affecting vegetation growth and diversity, resulting in detrimental effects on agricultural production, ecosystem stability, and socioeconomic development. Therefore, assessing the response of vegetation dynamics to drought can offer valuable insights into the physiological mechanisms of terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we applied long-term datasets (2001-2020) of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to unveil vegetation dynamics and their relationship to meteorological drought (SPEI) across different vegetation types in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). Linear correlation analysis was conducted to determine the maximum association of SPEI with SIF and NDVI; we then compared their responses to meteorological drought. The improved partial wavelet coherence (PWC) method was utilized to quantitatively assess the influences of large-scale climate patterns and solar activity on the relationship between vegetation and meteorological drought. The results show that: (1) Droughts were frequent in the YRB from 2001 to 2020, and the summer's dry and wet conditions exerted a notable influence on the annual climate. (2) SPEI exhibits a more significant correlation with SIF than with NDVI. (3) NDVI has a longer response time (3-6 months) to meteorological drought than SIF (1-4 months). Both SIF and NDVI respond faster in cropland and grassland but slower in evergreen broadleaf and mixed forests. (4) There exists a significant positive correlation between vegetation and meteorological drought during the 4-16 months period. The teleconnection factors of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and sunspots are crucial drivers that affect the interaction between meteorological drought and vegetation, with sunspots having the most significant impact. Generally, our study indicates that drought is an essential environmental stressor that disrupts vegetation growth over the YRB. Additionally, SIF demonstrates great potential in monitoring vegetation response to drought. These findings will be meaningful for drought prevention and ecosystem conservation planning in the YRB.

TI  - Cross-Shelf Exchanges Between the East Greenland Shelf and Interior Seas
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing freshwater fluxes from the Greenland ice sheet and the Arctic to the Subpolar North Atlantic could cause a freshening of deep convection regions and affect the overturning circulation. However, freshwater pathways from the Greenland shelf to interior seas and deep convection regions are not fully understood. We investigate exchanges of liquid freshwater between the east Greenland shelf and neighboring seas using drifter data from five deployments carried out at different latitudes along the east Greenland shelf in 2019, 2020, and 2021, as well as satellite data and an atmospheric reanalysis. We compute Ekman transport from winds and geostrophic velocity from satellite altimetry at the shelfbreak and identify the Blosseville Basin and Cape Farewell as areas favorable to cross-shelf exchanges. We further investigate exchange processes in these regions using drifter data. In the Blosseville Basin, drifters are brought off-shelf toward the Iceland Sea and into the interior of the Basin. As they are advected downstream, they re-enter the shelf and are driven toward the coast. At Cape Farewell, the wind appears to be the main driver, although on one occasion we found evidence of an eddy turning drifters away from the shelf. The drifters brought off-shelf at Cape Farewell mostly continue around Eirik Ridge, where they re-enter the West Greenland Current. Overall, the identified export over the east Greenland shelf is limited, small scale, and intermittent, thus unlikely to flux large amount of liquid freshwater into the interior, though exchange processes could enhance mixing in the near-shelf region.

TI  - Detecting and Removing Clouds Affected Regions from Satellite Images Using Deep Learning
T2  - IPSI BGD TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep Learning is becoming a very popular tool for generating and reconstructing images. Research has shown that deep learning algorithms can perform cutting-edge restoration tasks for various types of images. The performance of these algorithms can be achieved by training Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) with data from a large sample size. The processing of high-resolution satellite imagery becomes difficult when there are only a few images in a dataset. An approach based on the intrinsic properties of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) is presented in this paper for the detection and removal of clouds from remote sensing images without any prior training. Our results demonstrated that the algorithm we used performed well when compared to trained algorithms.

TI  - Seasonal Vegetation Trends for Europe over 30 Years from a Novel Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Time-Series-The TIMELINE NDVI Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing multi-decadal time-series provide important information for analysing long-term environmental change. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) has been providing data since the early 1980s. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series derived thereof can be used for monitoring vegetation conditions. This study presents the novel TIMELINE NDVI product, which provides a consistent set of daily, 10-day, and monthly NDVI composites at a 1 km spatial resolution based on AVHRR data for Europe and North Africa, currently spanning the period from 1981 to 2018. After investigating temporal and spatial data availability within the TIMELINE monthly NDVI composite product, seasonal NDVI trends have been derived thereof for the period 1989-2018 to assess long-term vegetation change in Europe and northern Africa. The trend analysis reveals distinct patterns with varying NDVI trends for spring, summer and autumn for different regions in Europe. Integrating the entire growing season, the result shows positive NDVI trends for large areas within Europe that confirm and reinforce previous research. The analyses show that the TIMELINE NDVI product allows long-term vegetation dynamics to be monitored at 1 km resolution on a pan-European scale and the detection of specific regional and seasonal patterns.

TI  - Pulmonary Vein Myocardial Sleeve Length and its Association With Sex and 4q25/PITX2 Genotype
T2  - JACC-CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Experimental evidence suggests genetic variation in 4q25/PITX2 modulates pulmonary vein (PV) myocardial sleeve length. Although PV sleeves are the main target of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation, little is known about the association between different PV sleeve characteristics with ablation outcomes. OBJECTIVES This study sought to evaluate the association between clinical and genetic (4q25) risk factors with PV sleeve length in humans, and to evaluate the association between PV sleeve length and recurrence after AF ablation.METHODS In a prospective, observational study of patients undergoing de novo AF ablation, PV sleeve length was measured using electroanatomic voltage mapping before ablation. The sentinel 4q25 AF susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2200733, was genotyped. The primary analysis tested the association between clinical and genetic (4q25) risk factors with PV sleeve length using a multivariable linear regression model. Covariates included age, sex, body mass index, height, and persistent AF. The association between PV sleeve length and atrial arrhythmia recurrence (>30 seconds) was tested using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model.RESULTS Between 2014 and 2019,197 participants were enrolled (median age 63 years [IQR: 55 to 70 years], 133 male [67.5%]). In multivariable modeling, men were found to have PV sleeves 2.94 mm longer than women (95% CI: 0.99-4.90 mm; P < 0.001). Sixty participants (30.5%) had one 4q25 risk allele and 6 (3.1%) had 2 alleles. There was no association between 4q25 genotype and PV sleeve length. Forty-six participants (23.4%) experienced arrhythmia recurrence within 3 to 12 months, but there was no association between recurrence and PV sleeve length.CONCLUSIONS Common genetic variation at 4q25 was not associated with PV sleeve length and PV sleeve length was not associated with ablation outcomes. Men did have longer PV sleeves than women, but more research is needed to define the potential clinical significance of this observation.

TI  - Validation of Landsat-9 and Landsat-8 Surface Temperature and Reflectance during the Underfly Event
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the launch of Landsat-9 on 27 September 2021, Landsat continues its fifty-year continuity mission of providing users with calibrated Earth observations. It has become a requirement that an underflight experiment be performed during commissioning to support sensor cross-calibration. In this most recent experiment, Landsat-9 flew under Landsat-8 for nearly three days with over 50% ground overlap, from 13 to 15 November 2021. To address the scarcity of reference data that are available to support calibration and validation early-on in the mission, a ground campaign was planned and executed by the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) on 14 November 2021 to provide full spectrum measurements for early mission comparisons. The primary experiment was conducted in the Outer Banks, North Carolina at Jockey's Ridge Sand Dunes. Full-spectrum ground-based measurements were acquired with calibrated reference equipment, while a novel Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)-based platforms acquired hyperspectral visible and near-infrared (VNIR)/Short-wave infrared (SWIR) imagery data and coincident broadband cooled thermal infrared (TIR) imagery. Results of satellite/UAS/ground comparisons were an indicator, during the commissioning phase, that Landsat-9 is behaving consistently with Landsat-8, ground reference, and UAS measurements. In the thermal infrared, all measurements agree to be within 1 K over water and to within 2 K over sand, which represents the most challenging material for estimating surface temperature. For the surface reflectance product(s), Landsat-8 and -9 are in good agreement and only deviate slightly from ground reference in the SWIR bands; a deviation of 2% in the VNIR and 5-8% in the SWIR regime. Subsequent longer-term studies indicate that Landsat 9 continues to perform as expected. The behavior of Thermal Infrared Sensor-2 (TIRS-2) against reference is also shown for the first year of the mission to illustrate its consistent performance.

TI  - Mixed marriage: Definition and consequences, from spirituality towards the conjugal dyad
T2  - APUNTES UNIVERSITARIOS
M3  - Article
AB  - This bibliographic review article proposed a definition of mixed marriage from the perspective of various authors up to the biblical view. The studies indicated that the more communion topics are established in a dyadic coupling, the better functioning the conjugal dyad will present. The mixed marriage, or unequally yoked, has an essential disagreement in the spiritual aspect of the couple. It is important to understand and define what marriage was in the beginning, according to the biblical design, to understand, by contrast, what a mixed or unequally yoked marriage is, and to be able to predict what consequences it brings to the functioning of the couple from spirituality to the conjugal dyad. Differences were found regarding the sexual aspect since the different worldview allows practices that the spouse does not; in the aspect of money, being the religious part censured by the non-religious part by allocating resources to their practice of faith; In addition, it was found that the participants experienced a feeling of loneliness when they felt unaccompanied in their practices and worldviews.

TI  - MODIS Time Series Reveal New Maximum Records of Defoliated Area by <i>Ormiscodes amphimone</i> in Deciduous <i>Nothofagus</i> Forests, Southern Chile
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Outbreaks of the Ormiscodes amphimone moth are among the largest biotic disturbances in South America, defoliating vast areas of native Nothofagus pumilio forests in the Chilean and Argentinian Patagonia in the last decade. Using MODIS 16-day composites of the enhanced vegetation index and the new functions of the latest release of the "npphen" R-package, we identified new maximum records of continuously defoliated area in the Aysen region (Chilean Patagonia). This approach allowed us to detect 55,193 ha and 62,344 ha of extremely defoliated N. pumilio forest in 2019 and 2022, respectively, in an area locally known as "Mallin Grande". Extreme defoliation was accounted for by means of negative EVI anomalies with values falling among 5% of the lowest EVI records of the reference period (2000-2010). These new 2019 and 2022 outbreaks in Mallin Grande were the largest reported insect outbreaks in South American Patagonia in this century.

M3  - Article
AB  - The potato is a food that allows us to understand the settlement process and the development of complex societies in America. The archaeological, ethnohistorical, and ethnobotanical evidence compiled for this article shows the presence and manipulation of solanum sp. over 13,000 years ago. This includes archaeological findings related to potatoes from micro- and macro-remains, as well as representations that are part of museum collections. We illustrate the description, production, and uses of potatoes in two production centres in South America during the colonial era: the Cundiboyacense highlands in the northern Andes and Huarochiri in the central Andes. Finally, we explore the uses, meanings, and forms of production of native potatoes from the Andean worldview. As a result, we find a great diversity of potatoes that give an account of cultural changes in the uses, conceptions, practices, and management since pre-Hispanic times, leading to worldwide potato consumption and production.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval in Bare Agricultural Areas Using Sentinel-1 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture maps are essential for hydrological, agricultural and risk assessment applications. To best meet these requirements, it is essential to develop soil moisture products at high spatial resolution, which is now made possible using the free Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data. Some soil moisture retrieval techniques using S1 data relied on the use of a priori weather information in order to increase the precision of soil moisture estimates, which required access to a weather-forecasting framework. This paper presents an improved and fully autonomous solution for high-resolution soil moisture mapping in bare agricultural areas. The proposed solution derives a priori weather information directly from the original Sentinel images, thus bypassing the need for a weather forecasting framework. For soil moisture estimation, the neural network technique was implemented to ensure the optimum integration of radar information. The neural networks were trained using synthetic data generated by the modified Integral Equation Model (IEM) model and validated on real data from two study sites in France and Tunisia. The main findings showed that the use of a radar signal averaged over grids of a few km(2) in addition to radar signal at plot scale instead of a priori weather information provides good soil moisture estimations. The accuracy is even slightly better compared to the accuracy obtained using a priori weather information.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Patterns of Shallow Groundwater Levels in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of the various hydrologic features responsible for the spatial and temporal variability in large scale subsurface systems is a critical component of water resources engineering and management. Traditionally, modeling large-scale groundwater flow patterns includes simulations with underlying parameter estimations and associated overarching assumptions. More recently, subsurface hydrologists are using empirical orthogonal function analysis to separate and quantify the primary hydrologic components contributing to observed regional and local-scale groundwater hydrodynamics. In this case study, modern spatiotemporal geostatistics plus primary hydrologic component analysis were conducted on spatially and temporally distributed groundwater levels measured in the Yellow River Delta. The results demonstrate the significant interplay between surface water hydrodynamics, overall groundwater quality, and groundwater utilization at the local scale, plus the significant impact of regional-scale aquifer recharge on groundwater level seasonal variation, largely driven by precipitation events. With increased accessibility to remote sensing data, additional research using these or similar statistical approaches to interpolate, compress, and decompose those features driving subsurface fluid-flow variability will prove to be highly beneficial to water resource engineers and managers.

TI  - Summer sea ice drift tracking and variation analysis in Fram Strait from 2011 to 2020
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate sea ice drift information in Fram Strait plays important roles in quantifying the sea ice export through Fram Strait and reducing the uncertainty of the Arctic sea ice loss estimation. Due to the limitations of data sources and algorithms, the existing methods show poor performance in summer sea ice drift retrieval. In this study, a summer daily sea ice drift monitoring method based on time series MODIS data and A-KAZE algorithm was proposed. Furthermore, daily sea ice motions in Fram Strait for 2011-2020 summers (April to September) were retrieved based on the proposed method and the characteristics of sea ice motion in Fram Strait for these ten years were analyzed based on the tracking results. The proposed method was evaluated over a portion of Fram Strait from April 29 to May 5, 2020. The results showed that the proposed method outperformed the classic MCC algorithm in sea ice drift retrieval, with velocity and direction RMSE decreases of 2.13 km center dot d(-1) (73%) and 10 degrees (38%), respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method retrieved more sea ice drift vectors with larger spatial coverage compared with the displacements SIFT and SURF algorithms retrieved. Meanwhile, compared with the daily sea ice motion vectors generated with daily synthetic data, the motion vectors obtained by the proposed method using time series MODIS images covered more areas, with an average increase of 862.62 km(2) (nearly 16 times), which demonstrated that the proposed method greatly reduced the cloud effect on optical data. Furthermore, it was found that the spatial distribution of sea ice velocity in Fram Strait for the last ten years is relatively consistent, showing that the ice velocity in the south of the Strait is higher than that in the north, and the velocity away from the coast is higher than that in the near shore. The annual average summer sea ice velocity in Fram Strait does not show a significant increase or decrease trend, but it shows a downward trend from April to July and an upward trend from August to September. The proposed method provides new idea for daily sea ice drift monitoring in summer and the analysis on summer sea ice velocity in Fram Strait for the last ten years is applicable to the researches such as rapid change of Arctic sea ice.

TI  - Insights for Sea Outfall Turbid Plume Monitoring with High-Spatial-Resolution Satellite Imagery Application in Portugal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal municipalities and industries often discharge poorly treated wastewater into proximate marine and estuarine environments. The urban and/or effluent input can lead to eutrophication and lower water quality, as it holds high concentrations of nutrients and pollutants. One widely applied tool to increase effluent dispersion and direct it away from coastal areas, thus causing fewer impacts on human activities, is sea outfall. In Aveiro, Portugal, the Sao Jacinto sea outfall construction was completed in 1998; however, limited literature regarding the sea outfall's monitoring using satellite data is available. The methodology in this study involved collecting four years' worth (2016-2019) of satellite data to investigate visible traces of the interaction between the S. Jacinto sewage water mass and the Ria de Aveiro lagoon ecosystem using ocean color and spectral analysis, and producing new qualitative data regarding sea outfall plume dispersion monitoring through high-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. The results showed a clear spectral signature of the sewage water mass, and a seasonal pattern was observed in which the plume was more evident in winter and autumn. Additionally, the coastal longshore current and the Aveiro lagoon's runoff were able to restrict the marine outfall's dispersion superficially. Ocean color data were revealed to be a factual and cost-effective tool to monitor the plume water. Finally, an exchange between the marine outfall water mass and Ria de Aveiro lagoon could happen in high tide under northern wind conditions. Therefore, it is important to monitor the water quality to ensure the coastal ecosystem's good environmental state.

TI  - Estimate of carbon stock in the soil via diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (vis/nir) air and orbital remote sensing
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
M3  - Article
AB  - Current procedures for determining soil organic carbon (SOC) content are costly, time-consuming, and generate polluting chemical waste. Therefore, developing new protocols using aerial and orbital remote sensing and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) for digitally mapping the stock of soil organic carbon (CS) is essential for promoting actions of research and monitoring SOC in Brazilian soils. Given this, three areas of commercial plots in the region of the Middle North of Mato Grosso were studied, where sampling was carried out for the determination of SOC in the layer from 0 to 30 cm, evaluated by the dry combustion method and estimated through DRS in the visible to near-infrared region -Vis-NIR-SWIR/350-2500 nm). To obtain the images by aerial remote sensing, the Carcara II & REG; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle was used, with a MicaSense & REG; multispectral camera (RGB + NIR + RedEdge) attached. The orbital sensors used were the Sentinel 2 & REG; and Planet & REG; satellites. This study showed that soil carbon stock values could be predicted using different modeling approaches based on field and laboratory spectral measurements. Predictive models to estimate SOC can be established using remote and near sensing, thus allowing a better understanding of spatial patterns of SOC in crop fields.

TI  - Comparison of <i>Ratioing</i> and <i>RCNA</i> Methods in the Detection of Flooded Areas Using Sentinel 2 Imagery (Case Study: Tulun, Russia)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and natural disasters caused by hydrological, meteorological, and climatic phenomena have a significant impact on cities. Russia, a continental country with a vast territory of complex geographic-ecological environments and highly variable climatic conditions, is subject to substantial and frequent natural disasters. On 29 June 2019, an extreme precipitation event occurred in the city of Tulun in the Irkutsk oblast, Russian Federation, which caused flooding due to the increase in the water level of the Iya River that passes through the city, leaving many infrastructures destroyed and thousands of people affected. This study aims to determine the flooded areas in the city of Tulun based on two change detection methods: Radiometric Rotation Controlled by No-change Axis (RCNA) and Ratioing, using Sentinel 2 images obtained before the event (19 June 2019) and during the flood peak (29 June 2019). The results obtained by the two methodologies were compared through cross-classification, and a 98% similarity was found in the classification of the areas. The study was validated based on photointerpretation of Google Earth images. The methodology presented proved to be useful for the automatic precession of flooded areas in a straightforward, but rigorous, manner. This allows stakeholders to efficiently manage areas that are buffeted by flooding episodes.

TI  - Seasonal drivers of mixed-species flocks from tropical savannas: insights from the Pantanal wetland
T2  - JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Birds participate in different types of multi-species groups (e.g., mixed-species flocks) occurring from temperate to tropical forest and also savannas. However, the effects of seasonal variation in flocking dynamics and formation in tropical savannas, especially in seasonally flooded wetlands, have received comparatively less attention than tropical forests and temperate ecosystems. Because multi-species groups can reflect specific aspects of the bird community (e.g., temporal dynamics), the present study aims to describe the structure, organization, and seasonal variation of mixed-species flocks in the Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland. During the dry, flood, and rainy seasons of 2019 and the flood season of 2020, we observed flocks within the natural mosaic of grassy-shrubby vegetation and patchy forest, and recorded the number of species, individuals (per species), and diversity. Seasonality had a strong influence on flocking structure and organization. During the rainy season, flocks had significantly fewer species, individuals, and diversity, whereas during the dry and flood seasons, flocks had more species, individuals, and diversity. Moreover, we suggest Polioptila dumicola and Casiornis rufus to act, respectively, as the nuclear and the sentinel species of flocks. These species were present in flocks during the year, but they were less frequent during the rainy season. The breeding period during the rainy season may negatively influence the formation of mixed-species flocks, whereas the access to food resources and predator protection may instead facilitate their formation in the dry and flood seasons, respectively. Our results help fill a knowledge gap on how mutualistic interactions among bird species are organized and vary in seasonal and heterogeneous environments, and also provide a starting point to subsequently understand the species role and the effects of human-induced environmental changes on mixed-species bird flock dynamics in the Pantanal and other world's savannas and wetlands facing rapid landscape conversion.

TI  - Flowering Coriander (<i>Coriandrum sativum</i>) Strips Do Not Enhance Ecosystem Services in Azorean Orchards
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Ecosystem services (ESs) and disservices (EDs) are routinely estimated from changes in service provider densities without measuring their actual levels. By using the sentinel approach (i.e., exposing a plant, seeds, and prey models in a standardized way), we tested how coriander (Coriandrum sativum) strips planted in mixed orchards on Terceira Island (Azores, Portugal) affected ESs/EDs via herbivory on lettuce plants, seed predation on wheat and weed seeds, and predation on artificial caterpillars. Vertebrates had more influence than invertebrates on ESs and EDs. Herbivory (ED) after 2 weeks was similar in the coriander and the control plots, while seed predation was higher in the control than in the coriander plots on both wheat grain (an ED: 30.8% vs. 15.3%) and weed seeds (an ES: 2.5% vs. 0.4%). Vertebrate predation (ES) rates after 48 h were significantly higher in the control (9%) than in the coriander plots (3%), while no difference was observed for invertebrate predation. Coriander strips did not support increased ES/reduced ED levels in this habitat. The sentinel approach is effective to quantitatively compare multiple ESs/EDs under different farming management strategies. The effect of flower strips on ecosystem services (ESs) and disservices (EDs) is routinely assessed following changes in service provider densities without measuring the associated levels of ES/EDs. By using the sentinel approach (i.e., exposing a plant, seeds, and prey models in a standardized way), we tested how coriander (Coriandrum sativum) strips planted in mixed orchards on Terceira Island (Azores, Portugal) affected herbivory on lettuce plants, seed predation on wheat and weed seeds, and predation on artificial caterpillars. Vertebrates had more influence than invertebrates on ESs/EDs. Herbivory (ED) after 2 weeks was similar in the coriander and the control plots (mean & PLUSMN; SD; 2.3% & PLUSMN; 3.3% vs. 2.2% & PLUSMN; 2.9%, n = 32 for both). Seed predation was higher in the control than in the coriander plots for both grain (ED; 30.8% & PLUSMN; 38.9% vs. 15.3% & PLUSMN; 10.8%, n = 18 for both) and weed seeds (ES; 2.5% & PLUSMN; 4.1% vs. 0.4% & PLUSMN; 0.5%, n = 18 for both). Vertebrate predation (ES) rates after 48 h were significantly higher in the control (estimate 9%, 95% CI: 4-20%) than in the coriander plots (3%, 1-8%), while no difference was observed for invertebrate predation. Coriander strips did not support increased ES/reduced ED levels in this setting. The tools used can be effective to quantitatively compare multiple ESs/EDs under different farming management strategies.

TI  - Use of satellite application facility on land surface analysis products to improve an operational method for monitoring forest evapotranspiration
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a modification of a water balance method (NDVI-Cws) aimed at improving the estimation of actual evapotranspiration in forest areas. The improvement concerns the calibration of the Cws meteorological factor, which regulates the sensitivity of forest ecosystems to short-term water stress. Such calibration is based on Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis evapotranspiration products, which are informative on the actual impact of water stress on plant evapotranspiration. The original and calibrated versions of NDVI-Cws are applied in two environmentally diversified forest areas in Central Italy, where water fluxes were measured by the eddy covariance technique. The first site corresponds to a Mediterranean coastal pine forest (San Rossore) and the second to a mountain beech forest (Collelongo), where water fluxes were measured for the years 2001 to 2005 and 2000 to 2009, respectively. The calibration performed leaves unchanged the model setting for San Rossore while it induces a reduction of the model sensitivity to water stress for Collelongo. The calibrated NDVI-Cws version yields optimal evapotranspiration estimation accuracies for both study sites; the determination coefficient is around 0.90, the root mean square error is lower than 0.30 mm day(-1) and the mean bias error is around +/- 0.01 mm day(-1). These findings indicate that the modified water stress factor is a realistic descriptor of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere response of forest ecosystems to water shortage.(c) 2023 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

TI  - Pre-Treatment HIV Drug Resistance and Genetic Diversity in Cameroon: Implications for First-Line Regimens
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The efficacy of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be hampered by the presence of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR). We described HIV-1 pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) patterns, effect of viral clades on PDR, and programmatic implications on first-line regimens in Cameroon. A sentinel surveillance of PDR was conducted from 2014 to 2019. Sequencing of HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase was performed, and HIVDR was interpreted using Stanford HIVdb.v.9.4. In total, 379 sequences were obtained from participants (62% female, mean age 36 +/- 10 years). The overall PDR rate was 15.0% [95% CI: 11.8-19.0] nationwide, with significant disparity between regions (p = 0.03). NNRTI PDR was highest (12.4%), of which 7.9% had DRMs to EFV/NVP. Two regions had EFV/NVP PDR above the 10% critical threshold, namely the Far North (15%) and East (10.9%). Eighteen viral strains were identified, predominated by CRF02_AG (65.4%), with no influence of genetic diversity PDR occurrence. TDF-3TC-DTG predictive efficacy was superior (98.4%) to TDF-3TC-EFV (92%), p < 0.0001. The overall high rate of PDR in Cameroon, not substantially affected by the wide HIV-1 genetic diversity, underscores the poor efficacy of EFV/NVP-based first-line ART nationwide, with major implications in two regions of the country. This supports the need for a rapid transition to NNRTI-sparing regimens, with TDF-3TC-DTG having optimal efficacy at the programmatic level.

M3  - Article
AB  - Cetaceans have shown a potential to be used as sentinel species for tracking environmental change in marine ecosystems, yet our assessment of change is typically limited to recent decades and lacks ecological baselines. Using historical museum specimens, we compared community niche metrics and degree of individual dietary specialization in groups of Pacific Arctic beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) from the 1800s (n = 5) to 1900s (n = 10) using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes drilled from teeth. Beluga occupied a broader trophic niche and demonstrated a higher degree of individual specialization in the 1800s than in the 1900s. The cause of this shift is difficult to confirm given long timescales and constraints of specimen-based research but could indicate changes in the prey base or competition. The scale and nature of this detected shift provide perspective for continued research on these climate-vulnerable species.

TI  - Land use function change and its driving force of the "production-living-ecological" space in Fenhe River Basin from 1980 to 2020.
T2  - Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - It is of importance to analyze land use function change and driving factors of the production-living-ecological space of national territory to realize the coordinated development. Based on land use remote sensing data in 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, we used the methods of land use dynamics, transfer matrix, center of gravity shift and geographic detector to analyze the pattern of production-living-ecological space in Fenhe River Basin and explore the influencing factors. The results showed that the area proportion of production-living-ecological space in the basin was ecological space > production space > living space from 1980 to 2020. The ecological space and agricultural production land showed a decreasing trend, with a decrease of 72441.19 and 105882.96 hm2, respectively. The living space and industrial production land showed an upward trend, with an increase of 119503.02 and 58821.13 hm2, respectively. There was significant difference in the land use function change of production-living-ecological space. Agricultural production land had the largest transferred area, accounting for 47.9% of the total. The largest transfer area of industrial land was agricultural land, which accounted for 61.3% of the total from 2000 to 2010. The occupation of agricultural land by urban living land was mainly distributed in the marginal area of various urban areas of Taiyuan Basin. Among them, the increasing area of urban living land in Taiyuan City showed a trend of gradual southward expansion. The center of gravity migration of urban land for living and industrial production land was the most obvious, and that for living showed the trend of first moving south and then moving north, while industrial production land moved northward significantly. The influence of social-economic factors on the land use change was obviously stronger than that of natural factors, while the interaction between social-economic factors had a stronger explanatory power. The results would provide reference for clarifying the relationship between land function transformation and optimizing land use function of production-living-ecological space.
AB  - 分析国土三生空间土地利用功能变化及其驱动因素,对实现三生空间协调发展具有重要作用。本研究基于1980、1990、2000、2010和2020年土地利用遥感影像数据,利用土地利用动态度、转移矩阵、重心转移和地理探测器等方法,分析汾河流域三生空间变化规律,并探索其影响因素。结果表明: 19802020年,流域内三生空间面积占比分别为生态空间＞生产空间＞生活空间,其中,生态空间和农业生产用地呈下降态势,分别减少72441.19、105882.96 hm2,而生活空间和工业生产用地表现为上升趋势,分别增加119503.02、58821.13 hm2。三生空间土地利用变化差异明显,转出面积最大的地类是农业生产用地,占转出总面积的47.9%,20002010年工业生产用地最大转入面积是农业生产用地,占工业生产用地转入总面积的61.3%。城镇生活用地占农业生产用地现象主要分布在太原盆地各城区的边缘区,其中,太原市区的城镇生活用地增加表现为逐渐向南扩展态势。城镇生活用地和工业生产用地的重心迁移最明显,其中,城镇生活用地重心迁移表现出先向南再向北迁移的趋势,工业生产用地重心向北迁移显著。社会经济因子对流域三生空间土地利用变化影响程度明显强于自然因子,社会经济因子之间的交互作用对三生空间土地利用变化的解释力更强。研究结果将为理清三生空间土地利用变化关系和优化用地功能提供参考。.

TI  - A machine learning approach for mapping surface urban heat island using environmental and socioeconomic variables: a case study in a medium-sized Brazilian city
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Smart cities must deal with climate change and find solutions to mitigate phenomena such as urban heat islands (UHI). The land surface temperature (LST) extracted from thermal images is a primary source of information to study UHI, characterizing the surface urban heat islands (SUHI). In addition to LST, environmental and socioeconomic variables have been adopted to explain the SUHI phenomenon. Although machine learning algorithms have potential in several areas, their application in the study of the contribution of these variables in the prediction of LST to characterize SUHI is still unknown. Therefore, the work proposes a machine learning approach to fill this gap. The LST was extracted from 15 Landsat 8 images from 2019 to 2021. Data on socioeconomic variables were obtained from the official demographic census, and environmental variables were extracted from Sentinel-2 and Planet images. Six algorithms were tested to assess the ability to estimate the LST based on the above-mentioned variables. The results showed that the Decision Tree algorithm had the best performance (r = 0.96, MAE = 1.49 degrees C and RMSE = 1.88 degrees C), followed by Random Forest. In addition, the inclusion of all seasons of the year and socioeconomic variables was shown to be relevant to the results. The main contribution of this work is to verify if the algorithms can optimize the SUHI characterization process, analyzing the influence exerted by the studied variables. In the social sphere, the information produced can help urban planning in the construction of smart cities.

TI  - Uncertainty in land use obscures global soil organic carbon stock estimates
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of land use and land cover change (LULCC) on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock is one of the most uncertain items in estimating the global C budget. Despite the improvements in satellite monitoring techniques and inventory data in recent decades, the uncertainty in modeled LULCC-induced SOC changes stemming from the choice of land use datasets remains largely unknown. Using a process-based model, the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM), we investigated global SOC changes during 1900-2018 driven by six LULCC datasets (i.e., LUH2-GCB2019, ESA CCI-LC, MODIS, GLASS-GLC, HH, and RF), which were generated by varied data sources and methodologies. The simulated global SOC stock was negatively affected by land conversions in all the LULCC datasets; however, the corresponding SOC loss was highly different ranging from 33.11 Pg C to 106.20 Pg C. Such significant differences in the global SOC stock estimates due to LULCC uncertainty were mainly located in boreal and temperate forests of the northern high latitudes and were most likely attributed to the LULCC-induced changes in vegetation net primary production. Meanwhile, regions exhibiting large divergence in relative changes of LULCC-induced SOC loss were mainly located in the low latitudes. When considering the interactive effects of LULCC with other environmental factors, the simulated SOC showed divergent trends, increasing in MODIS-, ESA CCI-LC-, and GLASS-GLC-based estimations, but decreasing in LUH2-GCB2019-, HH-, and RF-based estimations. These results highlight the importance of the accuracy of LULCC data in determining the global carbon budget. Future efforts are required for harmonizing satellite observations and inventory data both spatially and temporally to better represent the land conversion processes in terrestrial ecosystem modeling.

TI  - Surface Subsidence of Nanchang, China 2015-2021 Retrieved via Multi-Temporal InSAR Based on Long- and Short-Time Baseline Net
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land subsidence threatens the safety of urban buildings and people's lives. The time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology can provide us with large-area, high-resolution, and high-precision ground deformation monitoring. In this study, the time series InSAR technology and the strategy with long- and short-time baseline networking are used to obtain the surface deformation along the line of sight of Nanchang City based on the six-year (from December 2015 to December 2021) Sentinel-1 data. Longer datasets and better baseline strategies allow us to obtain more stable deformation results of Nanchang City than other researchers. The results of surface deformation show that the overall surface of Nanchang City is stable, but there are several obvious subsidence funnels. We carried out a field survey on four areas with significant surface subsidence. We considered that these subsidence areas may be related to soil compaction, building construction, and groundwater extraction. Based on the surface deformation results around the subway line, we analyzed the impact of subway construction on the surface along the line and identified the sections that need to be focused on by the managers to prevent the deformation area from affecting the surrounding buildings and subway line operation safety.

TI  - Evaluation and Analysis of the Effectiveness of the Main Mitigation Measures against Surface Urban Heat Islands in Different Local Climate Zones through Remote Sensing
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The significant transformation of land use as a consequence of current population growth, together with global warming (atmospheric emissions and extreme weather events), is generating increases in ambient temperatures. This circumstance is affecting people's quality of life, especially those considered more vulnerable or with fewer economic resources. Currently, 30% of the world's population suffers climatic conditions of extreme heat, and forecasts indicate that in the next 20 years, this number will reach 74%. The present study analyzes the effectiveness of the main mitigation strategies for the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect between the years 2002 and 2022 in the different local climate zones of the city of Granada (Spain). Using Landsat 5 and 8 images, the evolution experienced by the land surface temperature and the surface urban heat island was determined and connected to the following variables: normalized difference vegetation index, vegetal proportion, normalized difference building index, and albedo. Our results indicate that compact and industrial areas have higher temperatures and lower vegetation and albedo in contrast to open areas, which have lower temperatures and higher vegetation and albedo. The mitigation measures analyzed presented similar efficiencies, but a greater minimization of the SUHI was reported when vegetation was increased in open areas as opposed to in closed areas, where the increase in albedo was more effective. Our study will allow the implementation of more efficient measures based on the types of LCZs in cities.

TI  - Modeling Phenology Combining Data Assimilation Techniques and Bioclimatic Indices in a Cabernet Sauvignon Vineyard (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.) in Central Chile
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology is a science that is fundamental to crop productivity and is especially sensitive to environmental changes. In Mediterranean and semi-arid climates, vineyard phenology is directly affected by changes in temperature and rainfall distribution, being highly vulnerable to climate change. Due to the significant heterogeneity in soil, climate, and crop variables, we need fast and reliable ways to assess vineyard phenology in large areas. This research aims to evaluate the performance of the phenological data assimilation model (DA-PhenM) and compare it with phenological models based on meteorological data (W-PhenM) and models based on Sentinel-2 NDVI (RS-PhenM). Two W-PhenM approaches were evaluated, one assessing eco- and endo-dormancy, as proposed by Caffarra and Eccel (CaEc) and the widely used BRIN model, and another approach based on the accumulation of heat units proposed by Parker called the Grapevine Flowering Veraison model (GFV). The DA-PhenM evaluated corresponds to the integration between RS-PhenM and CaEc (EKF-CaEC) and between RS-PhenM and GFV (EKF-GFV). Results show that EKF-CaEc and EKF-GFV have lower root mean square error (RMSE) values than CaEc and GFV models. However, based on the number of parameters that models require, EKF-GFV performs better than EKF-CaEc because the latter has a higher Bayesian Index Criterion (BIC) than EKF-GFV. Thus, DA-PhenM improves the performance of both W-PhenM and RS-PhenM, which provides a novel contribution to the phenological modeling of Vitis vinifera L. cv Cabernet Sauvignon.

TI  - Quantifying the influence of design and location on the cool island effect of the urban parks of Barcelona
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research is to analyze the influence of park design and location on their cooling effect during summer daytime in Barcelona. Spatial analytical methods, utilizing the land surface temperature data from the Landsat 8 satellite, were employed to assess the intensity and spatial extent of the Park Cool Island (PCI) in 86 parks over four consecutive years. The study investigated the influence of factors such as the proportion of green land cover, park shape, and surrounding characteristics on these PCI indicators using bivariate correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. Results revealed that 84 parks exhibited a positive cooling effect on their urban surroundings during the studied years, whereas the remaining parks showed no PCI. The statistical analysis indicated that these results are associated with the microclimatic uncertainty caused by the diverse relationships between the proportion of natural vegetated or pervious surfaces and the built spaces within the parks, proposed by the administration aiming to accommodate civic, cultural, and recreational usage. In conclusion, we discuss the parameters for modeling the interaction between park design and their urban surroundings in the context of climatic considerations. This information is crucial for leveraging urban parks as spaces that can mitigate the urban heat island effect while preserving their social value as community public spaces.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Optimized SAR Coherence Analysis for Rapid Coastal Disaster Monitoring: The Impact of the Emma Storm in Southern Spain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The high exposure of coastal areas worldwide to natural and anthropogenic disasters emphasizes the relevance of disaster management processes that ensure a prompt damage detection and identification of affected areas. This paper aimed to develop a novel approach for disaster monitoring in coastal areas using SAR data. The method was based on an interferometric coherence difference analysis of Sentinel 1 data. To calibrate and validate the method, the Emma Storm, a severe coastal storm that affected the southwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula in 2018, was chosen as a case study. A coastal land use/land cover method optimization by optical and UAV field data resulted in an overall improvement of about 20% in the identification of disaster-affected areas by reducing false alarms by up to 33%. Finally, the method achieved hit and false alarm rates of about 80% and 20%, respectively, leading to the identification of approximately 30% (7000 ha) of the study area as being affected by the storm. Marshes and vegetated dunes were the most significantly impacted covers. In addition, SAR data enabled the impact assessment with a time lag of 2 days, contrasting the 25-day delay of optical data. The proposed method stands out as a valuable tool for regional-scale coastal disaster monitoring. In addition, it can be automated and operated at a low cost, making it a valuable tool for decision-making support.

TI  - Patterns and Drivers of Change in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index in Nunavik (Quebec, Canada) over the Period 1984-2020
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Altered temperature and precipitation regimes associated with climate change generally result in improved conditions for plant growth. For Arctic and sub-Arctic ecosystems, this new climatic context promotes an increase in primary productivity, a phenomenon often referred to as "greening". Although this phenomenon has been widely documented at the circumpolar scale, little information is available at the scale of plant communities, the basic unit of the Arctic and sub-Arctic landscape mosaic. The objectives of this study were (1) to quantify the variation of NDVI within the different plant communities of Nunavik (Quebec, QC, Canada) in order to identify which ones contributed the most to the greening and (2) to identify the climatic and biophysical drivers of the greening. To do so, we used Landsat imagery to produce a time series of summer NDVI for the period 1984 to 2020. A fine-resolution map of Northern Quebec vegetation was then overlaid on the time series of NDVI imagery and on maps of surficial deposits, topography, and gridded climate data to obtain information at the plant community level. We found that greening was more important in shrub-dominated communities, particularly near the tree line. Summer temperature, fall and winter precipitation, and surficial deposits were identified as drivers of greening. Through utilizing detailed vegetation maps to accurately quantify changes in Nunavik's plant communities, this study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the region's ecosystem under rapid climate change.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Time Series for Predicting Growing Stock Volume of Boreal Forest: Multitemporal Analysis and Feature Selection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Copernicus Sentinel-1 images are widely used for forest mapping and predicting forest growing stock volume (GSV) due to their accessibility. However, certain important aspects related to the use of Sentinel-1 time series have not been thoroughly explored in the literature. These include the impact of image time series length on prediction accuracy, the optimal feature selection approaches, and the best prediction methods. In this study, we conduct an in-depth exploration of the potential of long time series of Sentinel-1 SAR data to predict forest GSV and evaluate the temporal dynamics of the predictions using extensive reference data. Our boreal coniferous forests study site is located near the Hyytiala forest station in central Finland and covers an area of 2500 km2 with nearly 17,000 stands. We considered several prediction approaches and fine-tuned them to predict GSV in various evaluation scenarios. Our analyses used 96 Sentinel-1 images acquired over three years. Different approaches for aggregating SAR images and choosing feature (predictor) variables were evaluated. Our results demonstrate a considerable decrease in the root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of GSV predictions as the number of images increases. While prediction accuracy using individual Sentinel-1 images varied from 85 to 91 m3/ha RMSE, prediction accuracy with combined images decreased to 75.6 m3/ha. Feature extraction and dimension reduction techniques facilitated the achievement of near-optimal prediction accuracy using only 8-10 images. Examined methods included radiometric contrast, mutual information, improved k-Nearest Neighbors, random forests selection, Lasso, and Wrapper approaches. Lasso was the most optimal, with RMSE reaching 77.1 m3/ha. Finally, we found that using assemblages of eight consecutive images resulted in the greatest accuracy in predicting GSV when initial acquisitions started between September and January.

TI  - Image Texture Analysis Enhances Classification of Fire Extent and Severity Using Sentinel 1 and 2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and reliable mapping of fire extent and severity is critical for assessing the impact of fire on vegetation and informing post-fire recovery trajectories. Classification approaches that combine pixel-wise and neighbourhood statistics including image texture derived from high-resolution satellite data may improve on current methods of fire severity mapping. Texture is an innate property of all land cover surfaces that is known to vary between fire severity classes, becoming increasingly more homogenous as fire severity increases. In this study, we compared candidate backscatter and reflectance indices derived from Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2, respectively, together with grey-level-co-occurrence-matrix (GLCM)-derived texture indices using a random forest supervised classification framework. Cross-validation (for which the target fire was excluded in training) and target-trained (for which the target fire was included in training) models were compared to evaluate performance between the models with and without texture indices. The results indicated that the addition of texture indices increased the classification accuracies of severity for both sensor types, with the greatest improvements in the high severity class (23.3%) for the Sentinel 1 and the moderate severity class (17.4%) for the Sentinel 2 target-trained models. The target-trained models consistently outperformed the cross-validation models, especially with regard to Sentinel 1, emphasising the importance of local training data in capturing post-fire variation in different forest types and severity classes. The Sentinel 2 models more accurately estimated fire extent and were improved with the addition of texture indices (3.2%). Optical sensor data yielded better results than C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with respect to distinguishing fire severity and extent. Successful detection using C-band data was linked to significant structural change in the canopy (i.e., partial-complete canopy consumption) and is more successful over sparse, low-biomass forest. Future research will investigate the sensitivity of longer-wavelength (L-band) SAR regarding fire severity estimation and the potential for an integrated fire-mapping system that incorporates both active and passive remote sensing to detect and monitor changes in vegetation cover and structure.

TI  - Coexistence of a Marginal Mountain Community with Large-Scale and Low Kinematic Landslide: The Intensive Monitoring Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain territories affected by natural hazards are vulnerable areas for settlements and inhabitants. Additionally, those areas are characterized by socio-economic marginality, further favoring their abandonment. The study area is located in Liguria (Italy), and a large, slow-moving phenomenon endangers the settlements in the region. Monitoring such phenomena requires the use of instruments capable of detecting yearly, millimetric displacements and, due to their size, the use of remote techniques which can provide deformation measurement of the entire extent of the phenomenon. The methodology proposed here couples long-term interferometric remote sensing data analysis with intensive in situ monitoring (inclinometer, piezometers and global navigation satellite systems). Furthermore, the inclinometric measurements were carried out with an experimental, robotized inclinometer. The aim is to frame the overall context of ground deformation, assure information for inhabitants, stakeholders and land-planners, and secure coexistence with the phenomenon. Remote sensing provided a time series of 28 years of deformation measurements while in situ instrumentations allowed, in the last years, a better understanding of the surficial and deep behavior of the phenomenon, confirming the satellite data. Additionally, the high-frequency monitoring allowed us to record acceleration after precipitation peaks. The proposed approach, including the experimental instruments, proved its viability and can be replicated in similar mountain contexts.

M3  - Article
AB  - Post-hurricane damage assessments are often costly and time-consuming. Remotely sensed data provides a complementary method of data collection that can be completed comparatively quickly and at relatively low cost. This study focuses on 15 Florida counties impacted by Hurricane Michael (2018), which had category 5 strength winds at landfall. The present study evaluates the ability of aerial imagery collected to cost-effectively measure blue tarps on buildings for disaster impact and recovery. A support vector machine model classified blue tarp, and parcels received a damage indicator based on the model's prediction. The model had an overall accuracy of 85.3% with a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 96.7%. The model results indicated approximately 7% of all parcels (27 926 residential and 4431 commercial parcels) in the study area as having blue tarp present. The study results may benefit jurisdictions that lacked financial resources to conduct on-the-ground damage assessments.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Revegetation Assessment at Post-Closure Mine Sites in Canada
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The environmental legacy of post-closure mine sites poses a significant risk to the sustainability of mining operations and natural resource development. This study aims to advance the understanding of sustainable mine site reclamation behavior in Canada by using multi-temporal Landsat satellite images to examine the long-term land cover changes at post-closure mine sites. Six representative post-closure mine sites were selected for the evaluation and comparison. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis, Landsat image classification, post-classification change detection, and Regrowth Index (RI) analysis were conducted to assess the speed and extent of landscape and vegetation recovery at the target mine sites. A significant vegetation recovery was quantified for the mine sites that have experienced active reclamation activities. In contrast, the post-closure mine area undergoing only passive revegetation typically demonstrated a slow and minor increase in vegetation over time. The actively revegetated mine sites can typically be restored to a vegetation cover level that equals or is better than the pre-mining situation. This work confirms that active reclamation and revegetation at post-closure mine sites is critically important in sustainable mining. The quantified mine site reclamation behavior and the relevant sustainable practices would be useful for evidence-based sustainable resource management in Canada.

TI  - The Uncertainty of SNO Cross-Calibration for Satellite Infrared Channels
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The on-orbit radiometric calibration is a fundamental task in quantitative remote sensing applications. A widely used calibration method is the cross-calibration based on Simultaneous Nadir Observation (SNO), which involves using high-precision reference instruments to calibrate lower-precision onboard instruments. However, despite efforts to match the observation time, spatial location, field geometry, and instrument spectra, errors can still be introduced during the matching processes and linear regression analysis. This paper focuses on the error generated by sample matching and the error fitting method generated by the sample fitting method. An error propagation analysis is performed to develop a generic model for assessing the uncertainty of the SNO cross-calibration method itself in meteorological satellite infrared channels. The model is validated using the payload parameters of the Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS) and the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) instruments aboard the FengYun-3D (FY-3D). Simulation experiments are performed considering typical bright temperatures, different background fields, and varying matching threshold conditions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in capturing the error propagation chain in the SNO cross-calibration process. The model provides valuable insight into error analysis in the SNO cross-calibration method and can assist in determining the optimal sample matching threshold for achieving radiometric calibration accuracy.

AB  - Monitoring variations in the extent of wet snow over space and time is essential for many applications, such as hydrology, mountain ecosystems, meteorology and avalanche forecasting. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements from the Sentinel-1 satellite help detect wet snow in almost all weather conditions. Most detection methods use a fixed threshold to a winter image ratio with one or two reference images (with no snow or dry snow). This study aimed to explore the potential of image segmentation methods from different families applied to Sentinel-1 SAR images to improve the detection of wet snow over the French Alps. Several segmentation methods were selected and tested on a large alpine area of 100 x 100 km(2). The segmentation methods were evaluated over one season using total snow masks from Sentinel-2 optical measurements and outputs from forecasters' bulletins combining model and in-situ observations. Different metrics were used (such as snow probability, correlations, Hamming distance, and structure similarity scores). The standard scores illustrated that filtering globally improved the segmentation results. Using a probabilistic score as a function of altitude highlights the interest in some segmentation methods, and we show that these scores could be relevant to calibrate the parameters of these methods better.

TI  - Scavenger receptor a is a major homeostatic regulator that restrains drug-induced liver injury
T2  - HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aim: Drug-induced liver injury occurs frequently and can be life threatening. Although drug-induced liver injury is mainly caused by the direct drug cytotoxicity, increasing evidence suggests that the interplay between hepatocytes and immune cells can define this pathogenic process. Here, we interrogate the role of the pattern recognition scavenger receptor A (SRA) for regulating hepatic inflammation and drug-induced liver injury.Approach and Results: Using acetaminophen (APAP) or halothane-induced liver injury models, we showed that SRA loss renders mice highly susceptible to drug hepatotoxicity, indicated by the increased mortality and liver pathology. Mechanistic studies revealed that APAP-induced liver injury exaggerated in the absence of SRA was associated with the decreased anti-inflammatory and prosurvival cytokine IL-10 concomitant with excessive hepatic inflammation. The similar correlation between SRA and IL-10 expression was also seen in human following APAP uptake. Bone marrow reconstitution and liposomal clodronate depletion studies established that the hepatoprotective activity of SRA mostly resized in the immune sentinel KCs. Furthermore, SRA-facilitated IL-10 production by KCs in response to injured hepatocytes mitigated activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase-mediated signaling pathway in hepatocytes. In addition, supplemental use of IL-10 with N-acetylcysteine, only approved treatment of APAP overdose, conferred mice improved protection from APAP-induced liver injury.Conclusion:We identify a novel hepatocyte-extrinsic pathway governed by the immune receptor SRA that maintains liver homeostasis upon drug insult. Giving that drug (ie, APAP) overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure, targeting this hepatoprotective SRA-IL-10 axis may provide new opportunities to optimize the current management of drug-induced liver injury.

TI  - Evaluating the Hydrological Components Contributions to Terrestrial Water Storage Changes in Inner Mongolia with Multiple Datasets
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, multiple remote sensing data were used to quantitatively evaluate the contributions of surface water, soil moisture and groundwater to terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes in five groundwater resources zones of Inner Mongolia (GW_I, GW_II, GW_III, GW_IV and GW_V), China. The results showed that TWS increased at the rate of 2.14 mm/a for GW_I, while it decreased at the rate of 4.62 mm/a, 5.89 mm/a, 2.79 mm/a and 2.62 mm/a for GW_II, GW_III, GW_IV and GW_V during 2003-2021. Inner Mongolia experienced a widespread soil moisture increase with the rate of 4.17 mm/a, 2.13 mm/a, 1.20 mm/a, 0.25 mm/a and 1.36 mm/a for the five regions, respectively. Significant decreases were detected for regional groundwater storage (GWS) with the rate of 2.21 mm/a, 6.76 mm/a, 6.87 mm/a, 3.01 mm/a, and 4.14 mm/a, respectively. Soil moisture was the major contributor to TWS changes in GW_I, which accounted 58% of the total TWS changes. Groundwater was the greatest contributor to TWS changes in other four regions, especially GWS changes, which accounted for 76% TWS changes in GW_IV. In addition, this study found that the role of surface water was notable for calculating regional GWS changes.

TI  - The Factors Affecting the Quality of the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) and the Spatial-Temporal Variations in Drought from 2011 to 2020 in Regions Affected by Climate Change
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) is widely used for the monitoring of global or regional drought because of its strong drought-monitoring capabilities and ease of implementation. However, the temporal errors in the land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can affect warm and cold edges, thus determining the quality of the TVDI, especially in regions affected by climate change, such as Shandong Province. This paper explores this issue in the region in 2011, using daily MODIS MOD09GA and MOD11A1 data products. For each image acquisition time, the warm and cold edges of the NDVI-LST were extracted based on the NDVI, derived from red and near-infrared reflectance data, and the LST, derived from the MOD11A1 dataset. Then, the variations in the warm and cold edges with the LST and NDVI were analyzed. Subsequently, the influence of warm and cold edges, based on the daily values of the temperature, NDVI and precipitation during the observed period, was assessed using a linear regression. The soil moisture (SM) data obtained from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) datasets and the crop water stress index (CWSI) obtained from the MOD16A2 products were used for the assessment. The spatial and temporal variations in drought in Shandong Province from 2011 to 2020 were measured based on Theil-Sen median trend analysis and the Mann-Kendall test. The results show that apparently random variations were evident in the temporal evolution of the slope of the warm edge, indicating that daily data were appropriate to determine the boundary of the warm edge. Daily data were also appropriate to determine the boundary of the cold edge in a similar way. Additionally, the temperature, NDVI and precipitation in this region affected by climate change had a negative correlation with the slope and a positive correlation with the intercept. The validation results show that there was a significant negative correlation between the observed TVDI and GLDAS soil moisture values (R-2 > 0.62) in 12 scatter plots. Therefore, we deduced that the monthly or yearly TVDI product produced by the daily MODIS data has a higher precision than that produced by 8-day or monthly data in regions affected by climate change. The spatial and temporal variations show that the trend of slight and moderate droughts first increased and then decreased, and, in particular, some areas presented severe drought from 2011 to 2015. The results obtained in this study are important for the scheduling of irrigation and drought warnings.

TI  - Agricultural drought conditions over mainland Southeast Asia: Spatiotemporal characteristics revealed from MODIS-based vegetation time-series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a reoccurring slow-onset hazard event and has a tremendous impact on agricultural production and ecosystem health. Mainland Southeast Asia is a major rainfed crop-producing area of the world, and this region is increasingly vulnerable to drought hazards. However, the monitoring and characterization of agricultural and vegetative droughts in this region remains understudied. This paper presented the first comprehensive analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics and trends of agricultural and vegetative droughts across the region using the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) based on the reconstructed MODIS-based vegetation time-series data between 2000 and 2021. This study also developed an approach for identifying severe drought years using annual extreme pixels. Results showed that vegetation-based drought characteristics and trends varied in space and time across the region. Central Myanmar suffered from the most frequent droughts (nearly 60%), but prolonged events were less common. By contrast, the Lower Mekong area suffered from frequent and prolonged drought conditions. Most of the recent severe droughts were observed in Cambodia, and this area is characterized by a drying trend. Regionally, the severe drought years were detected in 2000, 2004, 2005, 2010, 2016, 2019, and 2020, and they were commonly found in Central Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia. The analysis of drought years indicated that the temporal change pattern of drought has shifted from the northern regions (e.g., Central Myanmar) in 2010 to the Lower Mekong region in recent years. The findings of this study provide valuable information for drought early warning management and agricultural planning across mainland Southeast Asia.

TI  - Aortoesophageal fistula complicated by mycotic aneurysm secondary to endoscopic procedures: A case report
T2  - CLINICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Key Clinical MessageAortoesophageal fistula (AEF) is a rare cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding that often receives little attention in the emergency department. The classic presentation includes the Chiari triad of central chest pain, sentinel arterial bleeding, and subsequent evacuation after an asymptomatic period. For patients suspected of having AEF, a CT scan with IV contrast is the preferred diagnostic modality. In our patient, the presence of an aortic wall outpouching, ectopic gas, periaortic fat stranding, and leukocytosis, even in the absence of fever and positive blood culture, suggested mycotic aneurysm with AEF. The unique aspect of this case report is the occurrence of AEF as a rare complication of endoscopic procedures, which should be considered. Treatment options for AEF include surgery and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). TEVAR is a good option for stabilizing the patient's condition and reducing mortality in the short term. Once the patient's condition is suitable for AEF repair surgery, surgical intervention can be performed.

TI  - Large-Scale Flood Hazard Monitoring and Impact Assessment on Landscape: Representative Case Study in India
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, natural hazards are a significant concern as they contribute to increased vulnerability, environmental degradation, and loss of life, among other consequences. Climate change and human activities are key factors that contribute to various natural hazards such as floods, landslides, droughts, and deforestation. Assam state in India experiences annual floods that significantly impact the local environment. In 2022, the flooding affected approximately 1.9 million people and 2930 villages, resulting in the loss of 54 lives. This study utilized the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-computing platform to investigate the extent of flood inundation and deforestation, analyzing pre-flood and post-flood C band Sentinel-1 GRD datasets. Identifying pre- and post-flood areas was conducted using Landsat 8-9 OLI/TIRS datasets and the modified and normalized difference water index (MNDWI). The districts of Cachar, Kokrajhar, Jorhat, Kamrup, and Dhubri were the most affected by floods and deforestation. The 2022 Assam flood encompassed approximately 24,507.27 km(2) of vegetation loss and 33,902.49 km(2) of flood inundation out of a total area of 78,438 km(2). The most affected areas were the riverine regions, the capital city Dispur, Guwahati, southern parts of Assam, and certain eastern regions. Flood hazards exacerbate environmental degradation and deforestation, making satellite-based information crucial for hazard and disaster management solutions. The findings of this research can contribute to raising awareness, planning, and implementing future disaster management strategies to protect both the environment and human life.

TI  - Improved Method for Estimating Construction Year of Road Bridges by Analyzing Landsat Normalized Difference Water Index 2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction year of road bridges plays an important role in bridge management systems. Based on the age of road bridges and other factors, deterministic and probabilistic deterioration models can be used to calculate deterioration rates and predict the future physical condition of road bridges. Two new techniques are proposed in this manuscript for estimating the construction year of road bridges by analyzing the normalized difference water index 2 (NDWI_2). Technique 1 uses both the target bridge point (TBP) and a selected optimal reference control point, while Technique 2 uses only the TBP. Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper NDWI_2 data were analyzed at all 44 road bridges in Nago City, Japan of the bridges' overall length = 100 m and construction year between 1990 and 2006. The sequential t-test analysis of the regime shift method, at a significance level a = 0.05 and cutoff length l = 2 to l = 27, was used to interpret the estimated construction year from the NDWI_2 for both techniques. Both techniques successfully determined the estimated construction year, which was statistically significant with p-values < 0.05, except for seven road bridges in Technique 1 and one road bridge in Technique 2. The correlation and comparative analysis of the actual and estimated construction years yielded R-2 = 0.24 and R-2 = 0.33, as well as an average deviation of S = 5.81 years and S = 4.08 years for Technique 1 and Technique 2, respectively. The findings suggest that Technique 2 is more accurate and provides a better estimate than Technique 1. It was observed that, as the cutoff length l increased, the absolute error between the actual and estimated construction year increased. Therefore, as a measure of accuracy, the upper limit of cutoff length l was set to l = 12. It was also observed that the increase in the bridge's overall length and forested area contributed to the accuracy of the results. By using the construction year as one of the inputs into bridge management systems, bridge managers can make more informed decisions about how best to maintain and improve road bridges to ensure user safety and road bridge preservation for the future.

TI  - Coseismic Surface Horizontal Deformation of the 2022 Mw 6.6 Menyuan, Qinghai, China, Earthquake from Optical Pixel Correlation of GF-7 Stereo Satellite Images
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying surface deformation due to earthquake-related surface rupturing is a criti-cal research focus. Localized offsets on the primary fault can be obtained via field mea-surements of dislocated landforms. However, effectively quantifying distributed deformation, which can extend for tens to hundreds of meters around the fault zone, has only become possible with the development of remote sensing technology and optical pixel correlation techniques. In this study, we correlated pre-and post -earth-quake GaoFen (GF)-2 and-7 images that were ortho-rectified by a digital elevation model generated from GF-7 stereo images to obtain surface horizontal deformation of the 2022 Mw 6.6 Menyuan earthquake. The surface rupture had a total length of 28 km along two segments separated by a stepover; in this study, we focused on the northern segment (23.5 km), which was distributed along the Lenglongling fault (LLLF). The total surface offset measured by our study had the maximum value of 4.0 m and a mean value of 1.9 m. The mean offset measured by field observations cap-tured just 50% of the mean offset from optical pixel correlation. Overall, 57% of off -fault deformation (OFD) occurred on the LLLF, which is a mature fault, owing to soft near-surface materials. Comparison of the surface offset measured by pixel correlation data in our study and near ground slip from joint inversion of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar and pixel correlation data suggests that OFD played a significant role in accommodating the shallow slip. The results of this study offer new insight into the characteristics of surface deformation.

TI  - Revealing the Land Subsidence Deceleration in Beijing (China) by Gaofen-3 Time Series Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Revealing the land subsidence in Beijing, China, induced by the massive groundwater extraction in the past three decades, is important to mitigate the hazards and protect the residences and infrastructure. Many SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) datasets have been successfully applied to reveal the land subsidence over Beijing in previous research, while few works were achieved on land subsidence revealed by time-series InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) with Gaofen-3 SAR images. In this study, we successfully perform the time-series InSAR analysis with Gaofen-3 SAR images to extract the land subsidence in Beijing from 2020 to 2021. The Sentinel-1 SAR images were used to assess the accuracy of Gaofen-3 images. The subsidence scale and extent are consistent in detected major subsidence bowls between the two datasets. The spatial-temporal evolution and the deceleration of Beijing land subsidence were revealed by comparing with the Sentinel-1 results from 2017 to 2020. Moreover, we evaluated the interferometric performance of Gaofen-3 satellite SAR imagery and analyzed the main factors that mostly influence the coherence and quality of interferograms. Our results proved that the long perpendicular baselines decrease the coherence seriously over the study area, and the artifacts induced by inaccurate orbit information reduce the quality of the Gaofen-3 interferograms. Refining and removing the two main artifacts could improve the quality of interferograms formed by Gaofen-3 SAR images.

TI  - Satellite data reveal how Sudd wetland dynamics are linked with globally-significant methane emissions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent work has highlighted the large role of methane emissions from the Sudd wetland and surrounding ecosystems on the global atmospheric growth rate of methane since 2010. These emissions are driven by high rainfall over basin catchments linked with the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole. We reconstruct flood inundation for the Sudd wetland over a 38-year period at a spatial resolution of 30 m using a new satellite Earth Observation (EO) wetland mapping tool. We reveal considerable changes in the wet season extent of the wetland, including an increase >300% since 2019 compared to the median 1984-2022 extent. We report major increases in flood extent within grassland-dominated floodplains outside of the area currently defined Sudd wetland region. These year-to-year changes in wetland extent are corroborated with total water storage anomalies inferred from satellite data (Pearson correlation R = 0.92), Lake Victoria levels (R = 0.73), and anomalies in reported annual mean global methane growth rates since 2009 (R = 0.88). Our analysis shows that flood water inundation is dominated by inundated vegetation and aquatic vegetation, accounting for an average of 40% and 50% of total extent, respectively, compared to open water that accounted for just 9% of inundation in a typical year. This is consistent with recent studies that report wetland methane emissions are focused on areas with inundated vegetation. Our findings also support recent studies that highlight the significant role of the Sudd wetland in driving anomalously large global atmospheric annual growth rates, 2020-2022. By capturing high resolution information on inundated vegetation, our EO wetland mapping tool has significant potential for improved wetland emission estimates of methane. Vascular plants common in the Sudd wetland, e.g. macrophytes including Phragmites Australis and Cyperus Papyrus, seem to play a key role in methane emissions and we recommend they should be the focus of future research.

TI  - Allocation of federal funding to address the opioid overdose crisis in the criminal legal system
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE USE & ADDICTION TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The opioid overdose crisis remains a chief public health concern in the United States, and people involved in the criminal legal system are among the most vulnerable to opioid related harms. This study aimed to identify all discretionary federal funding allocated to states, cities, and counties targeting the overdose crisis for criminal legal system-involved populations in fiscal year (FY) 2019. We then aimed to assess the extent to which federal funding was allocated to states with the highest need.Methods: We collected data from publicly available government databases (N = 22) to identify federal funding targeting opioid use disorder in criminal legal system-involved populations. Descriptive analyses examined the extent to which funding allocated per person in the criminal legal system-involved population was associated with funding need, proxied by a composite measure of opioid mortality and drug-related arrests. We created a generosity measure and dissimilarity index to assess the degree to which funding matched need across states.Results: More than 590 million dollars were allocated across 517 grants by 10 federal agencies in FY 2019. About half of states received less than $100.00 dollars per capita in the state criminal legal system-involved population. Funding generosity ranged from 0 % to 504.2 %, with more than half of states (52.9 %, n = 27) receiving fewer dollars per opioid problem than the US average. Further, a dissimilarity index indicated that about 34.2 % of funding (similar to$202.3 million) would have to be reallocated to distribute funding more evenly across states.Conclusions: Results suggest that additional efforts are needed to more equitably distribute funds to meet the needs of states with more severe opioid problems.

TI  - Multimodal SuperCon: classifier for drivers of deforestation in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change can have a serious impact on human life and occurs due to the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. Deforestation is one contributing factor to climate change. It is important to understand the drivers of deforestation for mitigation efforts, but there is a lack of data-driven studies that can predict these drivers. In this work, we propose a contrastive learning architecture, called Multimodal SuperCon, to classify the drivers of deforestation in Indonesia using composite images obtained from Landsat 8. Multimodal SuperCon is an architecture that combines contrastive learning and multimodal fusion to handle the available Indonesian deforestation dataset. As a means to yield better performance, Multimodal SuperCon upgrades ordinary SuperCon so that it is able to handle auxiliary spatial variables as additional inputs. Our proposed model outperforms previous work on driver classification, giving an 8% improvement in accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art rotation equivariant model for the same task.

TI  - Analysis of Water Yield Changes in the Johor River Basin, Peninsular Malaysia Using Remote Sensing Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land-use-land-cover (LULC) affect the water balance of a region by influencing the water yield (WY) along with variations in rainfall and evapotranspiration (ET). Remote sensing satellite imagery offers a comprehensive spatiotemporal distribution of LULC to analyse changes in WY over a large area. Hence, this study mapped and analyse successive changes in LULC and WY between 2000 and 2015 in the Johor River Basin (JRB) by specifically comparing satellite-based and in-situ-derived WY and characterising changes in WY in relation to LULC change magnitudes within watersheds. The WY was calculated using the water balance equation, which determines the WY from the equilibrium of precipitation minus ET. The precipitation and ET information were derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data, respectively. The LULC maps were extracted from Landsat-Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI). The results demonstrate a good agreement between satellite-based derived quantities and in situ measurements, with an average bias of & PLUSMN;20.04 mm and & PLUSMN;43 mm for precipitation and ET, respectively. LULC changes between 2000 and 2015 indicated an increase in agriculture land other than oil palm to 11.07%, reduction in forest to 32.15%, increase in oil palm to 11.88%, and increase in urban land to 9.82%, resulting in an increase of 15.76% WY. The finding can serve as a critical initiative for satellite-based WY and LULC changes to achieve targets 6.1 and 6.2 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (UNSDG) 6.

TI  - Creating a Safety Assurance Case for a Machine Learned Satellite-Based Wildfire Detection and Alert System
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are a common problem in many areas of the world with often catastrophic consequences. A number of systems have been created to provide early warnings of wildfires, including those that use satellite data to detect fires. The increased availability of small satellites, such as CubeSats, allows the wildfire detection response time to be reduced by deploying constellations of multiple satellites over regions of interest. By using machine learned components on-board the satellites, constraints which limit the amount of data that can be processed and sent back to ground stations can be overcome. There are hazards associated with wildfire alert systems, such as failing to detect the presence of a wildfire, or detecting a wildfire in the incorrect location. It is therefore necessary to be able to create a safety assurance case for the wildfire alert ML component that demonstrates it is sufficiently safe for use. This paper describes in detail how a safety assurance case for an ML wildfire alert system is created. This represents the first fully developed safety case for an ML component containing explicit argument and evidence as to the safety of the machine learning.

TI  - Discovering Optimal Triplets for Assessing the Uncertainties of Satellite-Derived Evapotranspiration Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information relating to errors in evapotranspiration (ET) products, including satellite-derived ET products, is critical to their application but often challenging to obtain, with a limited number of flux towers available for the sufficient validation of measurements. Triple collocation (TC) methods can assess the inherent uncertainties of the above ET products using just three independent variables as a triplet input. However, both the severity with which the variables in the triplet violate the assumptions of zero error correlations and the corresponding impact on the error estimation are unknown. This study proposed a cross-correlation analysis approach to discover the optimal triplet of satellite-derived ET products with regard to providing the most reliable error estimation. All possible triple collocation solutions for the same product were first evaluated by the extended triple collocation (ETC), among which the optimum was selected based on the correlation between ETC-based and in-situ-based error metrics, and correspondingly, a statistic experiment based on ranked triplets demonstrated how the optimal triplet was valid for all pixels of the product. Six popular products (MOD16, PML_V2, GLASS, SSEBop, ERA5, and GLEAM) that were produced between 2003 to 2018 and which cover China's mainland were chosen for the experiment, in which the error estimates were compared with measurements from 23 in-situ flux towers. The findings suggest that (1) there exists an optimal triplet in which a product as an input of TC with other collocating inputs together violate TC assumptions the least; (2) the error characteristics of the six ET products varied significantly across China, with GLASS performing the best (median error: 0.1 mm/day), followed by GLEAM, ERA5, and MOD16 (median errors below 0.2 mm/day), while PML_V2 and SSEBop had slightly higher median errors (0.24 mm/day and 0.27 mm/day, respectively); and (3) removing seasonal variations in ET signals has a substantial impact on enhancing the accuracy of error estimations.

TI  - Understanding the Spatiotemporal Characteristics of Land Subsidence and Rebound in the Lianjiang Plain Using Time-Series InSAR with Dual-Track Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lianjiang Plain, renowned for its position as 'China's textile hub' and characterized by its high population density, has experienced considerable subsidence due to excessive groundwater extraction in recent years. Although some studies have investigated short-term subsidence in this plain, research on long-term subsidence and rebound remain understudied. In this paper, the characteristics of surface deformation in the Lijiang Plain during two periods (2015-2017 and 2018-2021) have been investigated using the time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR) technique, and the correlation with the changes in groundwater level, geological factors, and urban construction are discussed. The InSAR-derived results are cross-validated with the adjacent orbit datasets. Large-scale and uneven subsidence ranging from -124 mm/year to +40 mm/year is observed from 2015 to 2017. However, a significant decrease in the subsidence rate during 2018-2021, with local rebound deformation up to +48 mm/year in three regions, is also observed. Groundwater level changes are found to be the major cause of the ground deformation, and the intercomparison between groundwater level and ground displacement time series from TS-InSAR measurements also indicates a clear relationship between them during 2018-2021. Geological factors control the range of deformation area over the study period. The impact of urban construction on surface subsidence is evident, contributing to high deformation. Our findings could improve the understanding of how deformation is affected by groundwater rebound and offer valuable insights into groundwater management, urban planning, and land subsidence mitigation.

TI  - A Probabilistic Approach to Mapping the Contribution of Individual Riverine Discharges into Liverpool Bay Using Distance Accumulation Cost Methods on Satellite Derived Ocean-Colour Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessments of the water quality in coastal zones often rely on indirect indicators from contributing river inputs and the neighbouring ocean. Using a novel combination of distance accumulation cost methods and an ocean-colour product derived from SENTINEL-3 data, we developed a probabilistic method for the assessment of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in Liverpool Bay (UK) for the period from 2017 to 2020. Using our approach, we showed the annual and monthly likelihood of DIN exposure from its 12 major contributory rivers. Furthermore, we generated monthly risk maps showing the probability of DIN exposure from all rivers, which revealed a seasonal variation of extent and location around the bay. The highest likelihood of high DIN exposure throughout the year was in the estuarine regions of the Dee, Mersey, and Ribble, along with near-shore areas along the north Wales coast and around the mouth of the rivers Mersey and Ribble. There were seasonal changes in the risk of DIN exposure, and this risk remained high all year for the Mersey and Dee estuary regions. In contrast, for the mouth and near the coastal areas of the Ribble, the DIN exposure decreased in spring, remained low during the summer and early autumn, before displaying an increase during winter. Our approach offers the ability to assess the water quality within coastal zones without the need of complex hydrodynamic models, whilst still having the potential to apportion nutrient exposure to specific riverine inputs. This information can help to prioritise how direct mitigation strategies can be applied to specific river catchments, focusing the limited resources for coastal zone and river basin management.

TI  - Impact of Design Factors for ESA CCI Satellite Soil Moisture Data Assimilation over Europe
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, soil moisture retrievals of the combined active-passive ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) soil moisture product are assimilated into the Noah-MP land surface model over Europe using a one-dimensional ensemble Kalman filter and an 18-yr study period. The performance of the data assimilation (DA) system is evaluated by comparing it with a model-only experiment (at in situ sites) and by assessing statistics of innovations and increments as DA diagnostics (over the entire domain). For both assessments, we explore the impact of three design choices, resulting in the following in-sights. 1) The magnitude of the assumed observation errors strongly affects the skill improvements evaluated against in situ stations and internal diagnostics. 2) Choosing between climatological or monthly cumulative distribution function matching as the observation bias correction method only has a marginal effect on the in situ skill of the DA system. However, the in-ternal diagnostics suggest a more robust system parameterization if the observations are rescaled monthly. 3) The choice of atmospheric reanalysis dataset to force the land surface model affects the model-only skill and the DA skill improvements. The model-only skill is higher with input from the MERRA-2 than with input from the ERA5 reanalysis, resulting in larger DA skill improvements for the latter. Additionally, we show that the added value of the DA strongly depends on the qual-ity of the satellite retrievals and land cover, with the most substantial soil moisture skill improvements occurring over crop-lands and skill degradation occurring over densely forested areas.

TI  - Monitoring of Land Cover and Vegetation Changes in Juhugeng Coal Mining Area Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal is the most prevalent energy source in China and plays an important role in ensuring energy security. The continuous monitoring of coal mining activities is helpful to clarify the incremental space of coal production and establish a rational framework for future coal production capacity. In this study, a multi-source remote sensing approach utilizing SPOT 4, GF, and Landsat data is employed to monitor land cover and vegetation changes in the Juhugeng mining area of the Muli coalfield over a span of nearly 20 years. The analysis incorporates an object-oriented classification method and a vegetation parameter to derive insights. The findings reveal that the mining operations can be divided into two periods, since their initiation in 2003 until their cessation in 2021, with a dividing point around 2013/2014. The initial phase witnessed rapid and even accelerated expansion of the mine, while the subsequent phase was characterized by more stable development and the implementation of some restorative measures for the mine environment. Although the vegetation parameter, Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC), indicates some reclamation efforts within the mining area, the extent of the reclaimed land remains limited. This study demonstrates the effective application of object-oriented classification in conjunction with the vegetation parameter FVC for monitoring coal mining areas.

TI  - Assessing Models of Sea Level Rise and Mean Sea Surface with Sentinel-3B and Jason-3 Altimeter Data near Taiwan: Impacts of Data Quality and Length
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the local sea level rise (SLR) is vital for coastal sustainability and resilience amid climate change. Using the latest altimeter data from the Sentinel-3B (S3B) and Jason-3 (J3) missions, we investigated the regional variability and accuracy of SLR rates around Taiwan and evaluated the accuracies of three mean sea surface (MSS) models: NCTUMSS, CLS15, and DTU18. NCTUMSS is a regional model for defining the new depth datum of Taiwan. The least-squares method with outlier removal was used to compute the along-track SLRs and MSS heights from S3B and J3. Our results show that the SLR rates around Taiwan in the recent 3-6 years from S3B and J3 were 2.0-3.0 mm/year higher than the global rate of 3.3 mm/year. Positive SLR rates were observed in most waters around Taiwan, but negative rates occurred in some parts of the Taiwan Strait. Short-term SLR rates from S3B and J3 were significantly different from the long-term rates determined using altimeter data from the TOPEX/POSEIDON (TP), Jason-1, Jason-2, and J3 missions from 1992.96 to 2021.92. The comparison between the along-track MSS heights from S3B and J3 and the modeled MSS heights showed that CLS15 had the highest accuracy. The DTU18 model exhibited lower sea surface heights near Penghu in the Taiwan Strait compared with CLS15 and NCTUMSS. The NCTUMSS model incorporates tide gauge measurements and Taiwan's hybrid geoid for a smooth transition from ocean to land. It was concluded that the SLR rates around Taiwan were not uniform, and the rates provided by the three global models, as well as the along-track S3B and J3 altimeter data, suffered from problems like limited spatial resolutions and accuracies, which originated from limited altimeter data qualities and record lengths. One must be cautious about the accuracy of an MSS model for constructing a depth datum and the accuracy of an SLR model for mitigating SLR-induced hazards. We recommend updating the MSS model around Taiwan every 7 years to ensure a 2 cm accuracy requirement, considering the average SLR rate of 3.3 mm/year around Taiwan. Short-term data reflects recent sea level rise but lacks accuracy, while the long-term sea level record may be more precise but may not capture recent rates, necessitating a comprehensive approach that considers both factors for producing accurate assessments and the planning of sea level rise impacts.

TI  - An Extended Investigation of Unexpected <i>Helicoverpa zea</i> (Boddie) Survival and Ear Injury on a Transgenic Maize Hybrid Expressing Cry1A/Cry2A/Vip3A Toxins
T2  - TOXINS
M3  - Article
AB  - The wide occurrence of resistance to Cry1A and Cry2A insecticidal toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) in the corn earworm/bollworm Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) leaves the Vip3A toxin produced during the vegetative stage of Bt as the only fully active toxin expressed in transgenic crops to control H. zea in the U.S.A. During 2021, the first unexpected survival of H. zea and injury (UXI) on a maize hybrid expressing Cry1A.105, Cry2Ab2, and Vip3Aa in Louisiana, U.S.A. were observed in two sentinel plots used for resistance monitoring. A follow-up intensive investigation was conducted with two H. zea populations established from larvae collected from the two UXI plots. The main goal of this study was to reveal if the unexpected damage was due to resistance development in the insect to the Bt toxins expressed in the maize hybrid. Diet-overlay bioassays showed that the two populations were highly resistant to Cry1A.105, moderately resistant to Cry2Ab2, but still highly susceptible to Vip3Aa when compared to a reference susceptible strain. In 10 d assays with detached ears, the larvae of the two UXI populations exhibited survival on ears expressing only Cry toxins but presented near 100% mortality on maize hybrids containing both cry and vip3A transgenes. Multiple field trials over three years demonstrated that natural H. zea populations in Louisiana were highly resistant to maize expressing only Cry toxins but remained susceptible to all tested hybrids containing cry and vip3A genes. Altogether, the results of this study suggest that the observed UXIs in Louisiana were associated with a resistance to Cry toxins but were not due to a resistance to Vip3A. The possible causes of the UXIs are discussed. The results generated and procedures adopted in this study help in determining thresholds for defining UXIs, assessing resistance risks, and documenting field resistance.

TI  - An Improved Satellite-Based Evapotranspiration Procedure for China
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical process that regulates the transfer of heat and water between land and the atmosphere. While satellite-based ET algorithms can provide area-wide daily ET estimates, few are independent of local meteorological measurements. The Variant of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Standard Evapotranspiration Algorithm (VISEA) can potentially run without ground-based observations. However, the surface energy budgets used in VISEA generally overpredict daily net radiation and related ET. To improve the accuracy of net radiation and ET, we incorporated Brutsaert's atmosphere emissivity model and corrected the routine to calculate the downward long-wave radiation on cloudy days (which we called VISEA(2023) model). The VISEA(2023) model predicted net radiation and ET that agreed well with measurements at seven ChinaFlux sites, with an R-2 of 0.8 and an Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 30 W m(-2) for net radiation, and an R-2 of 0.6 and an RMSE of 1 mm day(-1) for ET, respectively. Additionally, the VISEA(2023) model is more robust in comparison to the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrologic model output in 10 major river basins and 80 sub-river basins, with an R-2 of 0.91 (0.78) and an RMSE of 85 (127.4) mm year(-1), than MOD16, which has an R-2 of 0.81 (0.82) and an RMSE of 134.8 (157.7) mm year(-1), and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer ET, which has an R-2 of 0.92 (0.62) and an RMSE of 90.1 (136.1) mm year(-1). The improved VISEA(2023) model can offer near-real-time ET on a larger scale, improving our understanding of water cycles and their relation to climate change.

TI  - Assimilating FY-3D MWHS2 Radiance Data to Predict Typhoon Muifa Based on Different Initial Background Conditions and Fast Radiative Transfer Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the impact of assimilating MWHS2 radiance data under different background conditions on the analyses and deterministic prediction of the Super Typhoon Muifa case, which hit China in 2022, was explored. The fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data and the Global Forecast System (GFS) analysis data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) were used as the background fields. To assimilate the Microwave Humidity Sounder II (MWHS2) radiance data into the numerical simulation experiments, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and its three-dimensional variational data assimilation system were employed. The results show that after the data assimilation, the standard deviation and root-mean-square error of the analysis significantly decrease relative to the observation, indicating the effectiveness of the assimilation process with both background fields. In the MWHS_GFS experiment, a subtropical high-pressure deviation to the east is observed around the typhoon, resulting in its northeast movement. In the differential field of the MWHS_ERA experiment, negative sea-level pressure differences around the typhoon are observed, which increases its intensity. In the deterministic predictions, assimilating the FY3D MWHS2 radiance data reduces the typhoon track error in the MWHS_GFS experiment and the typhoon intensity error in the MWHS_ERA experiment. In addition, it is found that the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) and the Radiative Transfer for Tovs (RTTOV) model show similar performance in assimilating MWHS2 radiance data for this typhoon case. It seems that the data assimilation experiment with the CRTM significantly reduces the typhoon track error than the experiment with the RTTOV model does, while the intensity error of both experiments is rather comparable.

TI  - Landslide Recognition from Multi-Feature Remote Sensing Data Based on Improved Transformers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient and accurate landslide recognition is crucial for disaster prevention and post-disaster rescue efforts. However, compared to machine learning, deep learning approaches currently face challenges such as long model runtimes and inefficiency. To tackle these challenges, we proposed a novel knowledge distillation network based on Swin-Transformer (Distilled Swin-Transformer, DST) for landslide recognition. We created a new landslide sample database and combined nine landslide influencing factors (LIFs) with remote sensing images (RSIs) to evaluate the performance of DST. Our approach was tested in Zigui County, Hubei Province, China, and our quantitative evaluation showed that the combined RSIs with LIFs improved the performance of the landslide recognition model. Specifically, our model achieved an Overall Accuracy (OA), Precision, Recall, F1-Score (F1), and Kappa that were 0.8381%, 0.6988%, 0.9334%, 0.8301%, and 0.0125 higher, respectively, than when using only RSIs. Compared with the results of other neural networks, namely ResNet50, Swin-Transformer, and DeiT, our proposed deep learning model achieves the best OA (98.1717%), Precision (98.1672%), Recall (98.1667%), F1 (98.1615%), and Kappa (0.9766). DST has the lowest number of FLOPs, which is crucial for improving computational efficiency, especially in landslide recognition applications after geological disasters. Our model requires only 2.83 GFLOPs, which is the lowest among the four models and is 1.8242 GFLOPs, 1.741 GFLOPs, and 2.0284 GFLOPs less than ResNet, Swin, and DeiT, respectively. The proposed method has good applicability in rapid recognition scenarios after geological disasters.

In this study, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), gradient boosting machine (GBM), random forest (RF), quantile random forest (QRF), regularized random forest (RRF), and Bayesian regularization neural network (BRNN) machine learning algorithms were constructed to estimate the AGB of four forest types based on environmental factors and the variables selected by the Boruta algorithm in Yunnan Province and using integrated Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2A images. The results showed that (1) DEM was the most important variable for estimating the AGB of coniferous forests, evergreen broadleaved forests, deciduous broadleaved forests, and mixed forests; while the vegetation index was the most important variable for estimating deciduous broadleaved forests, the climatic factors had a higher variable importance for estimating coniferous and mixed forests, and texture features and vegetation index had a higher variable importance for estimating evergreen broadleaved forests. (2) In terms of specific model performance for the four forest types, RRF was the best model both in estimating the AGB of coniferous forests and mixed forests; the R-2 and RMSE for coniferous forests were 0.63 and 43.23 Mg ha(-1), respectively, and the R-2 and RMSE for mixed forests were 0.56 and 47.79 Mg ha(-1), respectively. BRNN performed the best in estimating the AGB of evergreen broadleaved forests; the R-2 was 0.53 and the RMSE was 68.16 Mg ha(-1). QRF was the best in estimating the AGB of deciduous broadleaved forests, with R-2 of 0.43 and RMSE of 45.09 Mg ha(-1). (3) RRF was the best model for the four forest types according to the mean values, with R-2 and RMSE of 0.503 and 52.335 Mg ha(-1), respectively. In conclusion, different variables and suitable models should be considered when estimating the AGB of different forest types. This study could provide a reference for the estimation of forest AGB based on remote sensing in complex terrain areas with a high degree of forest heterogeneity.

T2  - Academic radiology
M3  - Multicenter Study
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a simplified scoring system by integrating MRI and clinicopathologic features for preoperative prediction of axillary pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in clinically node-positive breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 389 patients from three hospitals were retrospectively analyzed. To identify independent predictors for axillary pCR, univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed on pre- and post-NAC MRI and clinicopathologic features. Then, a simplified scoring system was constructed based on regression coefficients of predictors in the multivariable model, and its predictive performance was assessed with the receiver operating characteristic curve and calibration curve. The added value of the scoring system for reducing false-negative rate (FNR) of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was also evaluated.RESULTS: The simplified scoring system including seven predictors: progesterone receptor-negative (Three points), HER2-positive (Two points), post-NAC clinical T0-1 stage (Two points), pre-NAC higher ADC value of breast tumor (One point), absence of perinodal infiltration at pre-NAC (One point) and post-NAC MRI (Two points), and absence of enhancement in the tumor bed at post-NAC MRI (Two points), showed good calibration and discrimination, with AUCs of 0.835, 0.828 and 0.798 in the training, internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. The axillary pCR rates were increased with the total points of the scoring system, and patients with a score of ≥11 points had a pCR rate of 86%-100%. In test cohorts for simulating clinical application, the diagnostic accuracy for axillary pCR was 80%-90% among four different radiologists. Compared to standalone SLNB, combining the scoring system with SLNB reduced the FNR from 14.5% to 4.8%.CONCLUSION: The clinicopathologic-image scoring system with good predictive performance for axillary pCR in clinically node-positive breast cancer, may guide axillary management after NAC and improve patient selection for de-escalating axillary surgery to reduce morbidity.

TI  - Land Cover Classification of SAR Based on 1DCNN-MRF Model Using Improved Dual-Polarization Radar Vegetation Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate land cover classification (LCC) is essential for studying global change. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been used for LCC due to its advantage of weather independence. In particular, the dual-polarization (dual-pol) SAR data have a wider coverage and are easier to obtain, which provides an unprecedented opportunity for LCC. However, the dual-pol SAR data have a weak discrimination ability due to limited polarization information. Moreover, the complex imaging mechanism leads to the speckle noise of SAR images, which also decreases the accuracy of SAR LCC. To address the above issues, an improved dual-pol radar vegetation index based on multiple components (DpRVI(m)) and a new LCC method are proposed for dual-pol SAR data. Firstly, in the DpRVI(m), the scattering information of polarization and terrain factors were considered to improve the separability of ground objects for dual-pol data. Then, the Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distance and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) algorithm were used to analyze the effect of difference dual-pol radar vegetation indexes on LCC. Finally, in order to reduce the influence of the speckle noise, a two-stage LCC method, the 1DCNN-MRF, based on the 1DCNN and Markov random field (MRF) was designed considering the spatial information of ground objects. In this study, the HH-HV model data of the Gaofen-3 satellite in the Dongting Lake area were used, and the results showed that: (1) Through the combination of the backscatter coefficient and dual-pol radar vegetation indexes based on the polarization decomposition technique, the accuracy of LCC can be improved compared with the single backscatter coefficient. (2) The DpRVI(m) was more conducive to improving the accuracy of LCC than the classic dual-pol radar vegetation index (DpRVI) and radar vegetation index (RVI), especially for farmland and forest. (3) Compared with the classic machine learning methods K-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), and the 1DCNN, the designed 1DCNN-MRF achieved the highest accuracy, with an overall accuracy (OA) score of 81.76% and a Kappa coefficient (Kappa) score of 0.74. This study indicated the application potential of the polarization decomposition technique and DEM in enhancing the separability of different land cover types in SAR LCC. Furthermore, it demonstrated that the combination of deep learning networks and MRF is suitable to suppress the influence of speckle noise.

TI  - Mapping Abandoned Uranium Mine Features Using Worldview-3 Imagery in Portions of Karnes, Atascosa and Live Oak Counties, Texas
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldview-3 (WV3) 16-band multispectral data were used to map exposed bedrock and mine waste piles associated with legacy open-pit mining of sandstone-hosted roll-front uranium deposits along the South Texas Coastal Plain. We used the "spectral hourglass" approach to extract spectral endmembers representative of these features from the image. This approach first requires calibrating the imagery to reflectance, then masking for vegetation, followed by spatial and spectral data reduction using a principal component analysis-based procedure that reduces noise and identifies homogeneous targets which are "pure" enough to be considered spectral endmembers. In this case, we used a single WV3 image which covered an similar to 11.5 km by similar to 19.5 km area of Karnes, Atascosa and Live Oak Counties, underlain by mined rocks from the Jackson Group and Catahoula Formation. Up to 58 spectral endmembers were identified using a further multi-dimensional class segregation method and were used as inputs for spectral angle mapper (SAM) classification. SAM classification resulted in the identification of at least 117 mine- and mine waste-related features, most of which were previously unknown. Class similarity was further evaluated, and the dominant minerals in each class were identified by comparison to spectral libraries and measured samples of actual Jackson Group uranium host rocks. Redundant classes were eliminated, and SAM was run a second time using a reduced set of 23 endmembers, which were found to map these same features as effectively as using the full 58 set of endmembers, but with significantly reduced noise and spectral outliers. Our classification results were validated by evaluating detailed scale mapping of three known mine sites (Esse-Spoonamore, Wright-McCrady and Garbysch-Thane) with published ground truth information about the vegetation cover, extent of erosion and exposure of waste pile materials and/or geologic information about host lithology and mineralization. Despite successful demonstration of the utility of WV3 data for inventorying mine features, additional landscape features such as bare agricultural fields and oil and gas drill pads were also identified. The elimination of such features will require combining the spectral classification maps presented in this study with high-quality topographic data. Also, the spectral endmembers identified during the course of this study could be useful for larger-scale mapping efforts using additional well-calibrated WV3 images beyond the coverage of our initial study area.

TI  - Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Land Use/Cover Change and Its Effect on Land Surface Temperature in Lahaul and Spiti, India
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) changes have a significant impact on Land Surface Temperature (LST). The LST is an important parameter in various environmental and climatological studies, as it plays a crucial role in understanding the Earth's surface-atmosphere interactions. The LULC changes can modify the surface energy balance and alter the radiation budget, leading to changes in LST. Urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural land use changes are some of the primary drivers of LULC change that have a significant impact on LST. Deforestation and agricultural land use changes result in a reduction in evapotranspiration, leading to an increase in LST. The main objective of the study is to analyze the spatio-temporal change in Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) and its effect on Land Surface Temperature (LST), as well as to establish a correlation of LST with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalize Difference Snow Index (NDSI). Understanding the impact of LULC on LST is essential for developing effective land use policies that can mitigate the adverse effects of LULC change on the environment and human health.

TI  - Role of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Skin Cancer Based on Clinical Studies
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Sentinel lymph nodes are the first regional lymph nodes to receive lymph fluid from the primary cancer, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can detect occult nodal metastasis. In addition, it may also have a therapeutic effect via regional disease control. SLNB was first introduced in melanoma among skin cancers and is currently used in many types of skin cancers. Previous randomized clinical trials suggested a prognostic benefit from SLNB in melanoma patients. However, whether SLNB affects the prognosis of patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer remains largely unknown, although SLNB may provide important information about nodal status. Since SLNB may be associated with adverse events including infection, lymphedema, and nerve injury, routine application of SLNB for all patients with skin cancer is not recommended. In this review, we summarize the evidence available in the literature regarding the role of SLNB in skin cancer. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node from the primary tumor. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a surgical procedure that can detect occult nodal metastasis with relatively low morbidity. It may also have a therapeutic effect via regional disease control. The Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy-I (MSLT-I) trial revealed a prognostic benefit from SLNB in melanoma patients. However, it remains unclear whether there is a prognostic benefit from SLNB in patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer owing to a lack of randomized prospective studies. Nevertheless, SLNB provides important information about nodal status, which is one of the strongest factors to predict prognosis and may guide additional nodal treatment. Currently, SLNB is widely used in the management of not only patients with melanoma but also those with nonmelanoma skin cancer. However, the utilization and outcomes of SLNB differ among skin cancers. In addition, SLNB is not recommended for routine use in all patients with skin cancer. In this review, we provide a summary of the role of SLNB and of the indications for SLNB in each skin cancer based on previously published articles.

TI  - EnMAP-Box: Imaging spectroscopy in QGIS
T2  - SOFTWAREX
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite missions like EnMAP and PRISMA generate raster images that describe the Earth's environment with hyperspectral resolution. Such imaging spectroscopy data is of high value for applications in, e.g., geological, vegetation, or hydrological research. Due to its high dimensionality, analyzing imaging spectroscopy data is still challenging and often requires the use of proprietary software. The motivation for the EnMAP-Box is to close this gap and to foster the use of imaging spectroscopy data with state-of-the art remote sensing methods. Developed as Python plugin for the QGIS geoinformation system, the EnMAP-Box integrates into a well-established, platform-independent, and free-and-open-source software ecosystem to analyze geospatial data. The EnMAP-Box offers advanced functionalities to visualize and process hyper- and multispectral, and multi-temporal remote sensing data, it implements novel spectral libraries concept, and provides easy access to published algorithms from different fields of environmental research. Already been widely used in the past, the EnMAP-Box can now unfold its full potential as first operational EnMAP data became available in 2022. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Precipitation in different phases has varying effects on runoff. However, monitoring surface snowfall poses a significant challenge, highlighting the importance of developing a snowfall detection algorithm. The objective of this study is develop a snowfall detection algorithm for the Microwave Temperature Sounder-2 (MWTS-II) and the Microwave Humidity Sounder-2 (MWHS-II) onboard the FY-3D satellite while considering the differentiated atmosphere temperature conditions. The results show that: (1) The brightness temperature (TB) of MWTS Channel 3 is well-suited for pre-classifying atmospheric temperatures, and significant differences in TB distribution exist between the two pre-classification subsets. (2) Among six machine classifiers examined, the random forest classifier exhibits favorable classification performance on both the validation set (accuracy: 0.76, recall: 0.76, F1 score: 0.75) and test set (accuracy: 0.80, recall: 0.44, F1 score: 0.44). (3) The application of the snowfall detection algorithm showcases a reasonable spatial distribution and outperforms the IMERG and ERA5 snowfall data.

TI  - Forest Phenology under Differing Topographic Conditions: A Case Study of Changbai Mountain in Northeast China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest phenology is sensitive to climate change, and its responses affect many land surface processes, resulting in a feedback effect on climate change. Human activities have been the main driver of climate change's long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns. Forest phenology, understood as the timing of the annual cycles of plants, is extremely sensitive to changes in climate. Quantifying the responses of temperate forest phenology under an elevational range of topographic conditions that mimic climate change is essential for making effective adaptive forest ecosystem management decisions. Our study utilized the Google Earth Engine (GEE), gap filling, and the Savitzky-Golay (GF-SG) algorithm to develop a long-time series spatio-temporal remote sensing data fusion. The forest phenology characteristics on the north slope of Changbai Mountain were extracted and analyzed annually from 2013 to 2022. Our study found that the average start of the growing season (SOS) on the north slope of Changbai Mountain occurred between the 120th-150th day during the study period. The end of the growing season (EOS) occurred between the 270th-300th day, and the length of the growing season (LOS) ranged from the 110th-190th day. A transect from the northeast to southwest of the study area for a 10-year study period found that SOS was delayed by 39 d, the EOS advanced by 32 d, and the LOS was gradually shortened by 63 d. The forest phenology on the north slope of Changbai Mountain showed significant topographic differentiations. With an increase of 100 m in altitude, the mean SOS was delayed by 1.71 d (R-2 = 0.93, p < 0.01). There were no obvious trends in EOS variation within the study area altitude gradient. LOS decreased by 1.23 d for each 100 m increase in elevation (R-2 = 0.90, p < 0.01). Forests on steep slopes had an earlier SOS, a later EOS, and a longer LOS than forests on gentle slopes. For each degree increase in slope, SOS advanced by 0.12 d (R-2 = 0.53, p = 0.04), EOS was delayed by 0.18 d (R-2 = 0.82, p = 0.002), and the LOS increased by 0.28 d (R-2 = 0.78, p = 0.004). The slope aspect had effects on the EOS and the LOS but had no effect on the SOS. The forest EOS of the south aspect was 3.15 d later than that of the north aspect, and the LOS was 6.47 d longer. Over the 10-year study period, the phenology differences between the north and south aspects showed that the LOS difference decreased by 0.85 d, the SOS difference decreased by 0.34 d, and the EOS difference decreased by 0.53 d per year. Our study illustrates the significance of the coupling mechanism between mountain topography and forest phenology, which will assist our future understanding of the response of mountain forest phenology to climate change, and provide a scientific basis for further research on temperate forest phenology.

TI  - Near real-time altimetry for river monitoring-a global assessment of Sentinel-3
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - For applications such as weather, flood, and drought forecasting that need water level estimates as soon as possible, near real-time (NRT) products are most appropriate. Unlike in-situ sensors for water level measurements, which typically deliver NRT data, satellite altimeters deliver physically meaningful observations with substantial delays after acquisition. The new radar altimetry mission, Sentinel-3, is capable of delivering NRT water levels within a few hours of observation. Currently, it remains unexplored how accurate the NRT product is in the context of river monitoring. This study assesses Sentinel-3A/B NRT products in mapping river water level variations globally. Based on a three-year comparison, we find that the water level derived from NRT is almost as good as that from the delayed products (median root-mean-square error (RMSE): 21.5 cm and 23.5 for S3A and S3B), and both products achieve very similar RMSE values (median: 52.5 cm and 59.0 cm for NRT and non-time critical) against in-situ data at 25 locations. This study highlights the usefulness of Sentinel-3 NRT product for river monitoring and forecasting. And we recommend the NRT product if latency is a primary concern.

TI  - Eutrophication and salinization elevate the dissolved organic matter content in arid lakes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an essential role in the global lake carbon cycle. Understanding DOM composition and monitoring its spatiotemporal dynamics are of great significance for understanding the lake carbon cycle, controlling water pollution, and protecting water resources. However, previous studies have focused mainly on eutrophic freshwater lakes, with limited attention given to saline lakes. Based on in situ data collected in ten lakes in northwestern China, this study reported the changes in DOM components in different lake types. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was used to analyze the three-dimensional excitation emission matrix (EEMs) to obtain the DOM fluorescence components. The contributions of different environmental factors to the changes in DOM components were quantified by the generalized linear model (GLM). The results showed that the eutrophication index was significantly positively related to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (R2 = 0.95, p < 0.01) and colored DOM (CDOM) (R2 = 0.96, p < 0.01) concentrations. Terrestrial humic-like and tryptophanlike components, which are highly correlated with human activities, explained 62% and 64% of the variations in DOC and CDOM, respectively. In sum, the contributions of human activities to the DOC and CDOM variations were 61% and 57%, respectively. Salinity also showed significant positive correlations with both DOC (R2 = 0.88, p < 0.01) and CDOM (R2 = 0.87, p < 0.01). Lake salinization led to increases in DOM concentration, and salinity contributed 20% and 16% to the DOC and CDOM variations, respectively. Therefore, human activities and salinity codetermined the DOM concentration and its composition in the western arid lakes. Based on these findings, this study proposed a feasible flowchart for remotely estimating DOM in saline lakes using satellite data. This study is significant for the long-term monitoring of the carbon cycle and the effective protection of lake water resources in saline lakes.

TI  - Toward a High-Resolution Wave Forecasting System for the Changjiang River Estuary
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on a high-resolution unstructured SWAN model and GFS forecast wind, an operational wave forecasting system is conducted for the Changjiang River Estuary (CRE). The performance of the wave forecasting system is evaluated by comparing it with the altimeter observations and in situ wave buoys. The present operational system shows good accuracy in reproducing the seasonal and the synoptic-scale wave characteristics over the CRE. The forecasting capability in three different horizons, including 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h forecasts, is evaluated. Waves over the CRE exhibit distinct seasonal variability. Larger waves occur in both the summer and winter when typhoons and cold weather events affect the CRE. In contrast, waves with longer wave periods take place mainly in the wind transition seasons, i.e., the spring and fall, and the wave directions are more dispersed in these seasons. A seasonal varied forecasting capability is also revealed: better in the winter and spring than in the summer and fall and better during cold weather events than during typhoons. A cross comparison with the model analysis suggests that there is a systematic difference between wave measurements by Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A/3B. The significant wave height from Jason-3 compares best with the model analysis and forecasts and is systematically lower than Sentinel-3A/3B in lower wave conditions (<4 m) in the East China Sea. Substantial discrepancies exist among the three altimeters when the significant wave height exceeds 4 m, and further efforts are needed to discern their merits.

TI  - Automatic Extraction of Saltpans on an Amendatory Saltpan Index and Local Spatial Parallel Similarity in Landsat-8 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Saltpans extraction is vital for coastal resource utilization and production management. However, it is challenging to extract saltpans, even by visual inspection, because of their spatial and spectral similarities with aquaculture ponds. Saltpans are composed of crystallization and evaporation ponds. From the whole images, existing saltpans extraction algorithms could only extract part of the saltpans, i.e., crystallization ponds. Meanwhile, evaporation ponds could not be efficiently extracted by only spectral analysis, causing the degeneration of saltpans extraction. In addition, manual intervention was required. Thus, it is essential to study the automatic saltpans extraction algorithm of the whole image. As to the abovementioned problems, this paper proposed a novel method with an amendatory saltpan index (ASI) and local spatial parallel similarity (ASI-LSPS) for extracting coastal saltpans. To highlight saltpans and aquaculture ponds in coastal water, the Hessian matrix has been exploited. Then, a new amendatory saltpans index (ASI) is proposed to extract crystallization ponds to reduce the negative influence of turbid water and dams. Finally, a new local parallel similarity criterion is proposed to extract evaporation ponds. The Landsat-8 OLI images of Tianjin and Dongying, China, have been used in experiments. Experiments have shown that ASI can reach at least 70% in intersection over union (IOU) and 78% in Kappa for extraction of crystallization in saltpans. Moreover, experiments also demonstrate that ASI-LSPS can reach at least 82% in IOU and 89% in Kappa on saltpans extraction, at least 13% and 17% better than comparing algorithms in IOU and Kappa, respectively. Furthermore, the ASI-LSPS algorithm has the advantage of automaticity in the whole imagery. Thus, this study can provide help in coastal saltpans management and scientific utilization of coastal resources.

TI  - Daily to Centennial Behavior of Aseismic Slip Along the Central Section of the North Anatolian Fault
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Slow, aseismic slip plays a crucial role in the initiation, propagation, and arrest of large earthquakes along active faults. In addition, aseismic slip controls the budget of elastic strain in the crust, hence the amount of energy available for upcoming earthquakes. The conditions for slow slip include specific material properties of the fault zone, pore fluid pressure, and geometrical complexities of the fault plane. Fine scale descriptions of aseismic slip at the surface and at depth are key to determine the factors controlling the occurrence of slow, aseismic versus rapid, seismic fault slip. We focus on the spatial and temporal distribution of aseismic slip along the North Anatolian Fault, the plate boundary accommodating the 2 cm/yr of relative motion between Anatolia and Eurasia. Along the eastern termination of the rupture trace of the 1944 M7.3 Bolu-Gerede earthquake lies a segment that slips aseismically since at least the 1950s. We use Sentinel 1 time series of displacement and GNSS data to provide a spatio-temporal description of the kinematics of fault slip. We show that aseismic slip observed at the surface is coincident with a shallow locking depth and that slow slip events with a return period of 2.5 years are restricted to a specific section of the fault. In the light of historical measurements, we discuss potential rheological implications of our results and propose a simple alternative model to explain the local occurrence of shallow aseismic slip at this location.

TI  - Analysis of Four Decades of Land Use and Land Cover Change in Semiarid Tunisia Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semiarid Tunisia is characterized by agricultural production that is delimited by water availability and degraded soil. This situation is exacerbated by human pressure and the negative effects of climate change. To improve the knowledge of long-term (1980 to 2020) drivers for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes, we investigated the semiarid Rihana region in central Tunisia. A new approach involving Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used to map LULC using Landsat imagery and vegetative indices (NDVI, MSAVI, and EVI) by applying a Random Forest (RF) classifier. A Rapid Participatory Systemic Diagnosis (RPSD) was used to consider the relation between LULC changes and their key drivers. The methodology relied on interviews with the local population and experts. Focus groups were conducted with practicians of the Regueb Agricultural Extension Services, followed by semi-structured interviews with 52 households. Results showed the following: (1) the RF classifier in Google Earth Engine had strong performance across diverse Landsat image types resulting in overall classification accuracy of & GE;0.96 and a kappa coefficient & GE;0.93; (2) rainfed olive land increased four times during the study period while irrigated agriculture increased substantially during the last decade; rangeland and rainfed annual crops decreased by 58 and 88%, respectively, between 1980 and 2021; (3) drivers of LULC changes are predominately local in nature, including topography, local climate, hydrology, strategies of household, effects of the 2010 revolution, associated increasing demand for natural resources, agricultural policy, population growth, high cost of agricultural input, and economic opportunities. To summarize, changes in LULC in Rihana are an adaptive response to these various factors. The findings are important to better understand ways towards sustainable management of natural resources in arid and semiarid regions as well as efficient methods to study these processes.

AB  - The essay brings elements for the analysis of the problem of impotence (Ohnmacht) of the spirit and its aporias, present in the last phase of Max Scheler's thought. A proper interpretation of the critical framework requires attention to the work The Human Place in the Cosmos and the essays contained in the Philosophical Worldview. We will address points related to the duality of Scheler's anthropological thought, as well as the concept of functionalization of the spirit. The opinions of philosophers such as Cassirer and Buber on the subject are also under consideration.

TI  - The Lucerne Toolbox 2 to optimise axillary management for early breast cancer: a multidisciplinary expert consensus
T2  - ECLINICALMEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Clinical axillary lymph node management in early breast cancer has evolved from being merely an aspect of surgical management and now includes the entire multidisciplinary team. The second edition of the "Lucerne Toolbox", a multidisciplinary consortium of European cancer societies and patient representatives, addresses the challenges of clinical axillary lymph node management, from diagnosis to local therapy of the axilla. Five working packages were developed, following the patients' journey and addressing specific clinical scenarios. Panellists voted on 72 state-ments, reaching consensus (agreement of 75% or more) in 52.8%, majority (51%-74% agreement) in 43.1%, and no decision in 4.2%. Based on the votes, targeted imaging and standardized pathology of lymph nodes should be a prerequisite to planning local and systemic therapy, axillary lymph node dissection can be replaced by sentinel lymph node biopsy ( & PLUSMN; targeted approaches) in a majority of scenarios; and positive patient outcomes should be driven by both low recurrence risks and low rates of lymphoedema.

TI  - The effects of flash drought on the terrestrial ecosystem in Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Typified by rapid intensification in a short time, flash droughts (FDs) have attracted increasing attention because of their effects on water resources and ecosystems. Water use efficiency (WUE) is a key indicator for understanding the interaction between the carbon dynamic and water cycle. However, the effects of FDs on terrestrial ecosystems in Korea remain mostly unknown. Therefore, we identified FD events in Korea using the soil moisture (SM)-based rate of intensification (RI) and the evapotranspiration (ET)-based Standardized Evaporative Stress Ratio (SESR) with flux tower data. Continuous satellite data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to examine spatiotemporal patterns and trends in FD-related factors, Potential ET (PET), Actual ET (AET), Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), Evaporative Stress Ratio (ESR), and WUE from 2001 to 2020. The frequency, duration, and intensity of FDs in Korea were investigated and responses in WUE to FDs in different landcover types were examined. The SESR and RI had a similar performance in capturing FD events in flux tower site data. At the regional scale, a lower ESR was mainly observed in the western and southern parts of the study area, indicating progressively drier climate conditions. The mean frequency percentage and number of Korean FD events in the past 20 years were 61.3% and 16, respectively. In addition, more FD events occurred in the northern and eastern regions of the study area, where the main landcover type is forest, and northeastern Korea suffered from long FD events (over 30 days). FDs caused a positive response of WUE in most of the study area. However, the change in WUE after FD events varied by FD severity and landcover type. The changes in WUE after moderate FD events were largely driven by the change in GPP, and the highest sensitivity of WUE to FD intensity was found in croplands. These findings highlight the characteristics and effects of FDs on WUE across landcover types, which will be helpful in managing potential environmental risks in Korea.

TI  - A Novel Bio-Inspired Optimization Algorithm Design for Wind Power Engineering Applications Time-Series Forecasting
T2  - BIOMIMETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind patterns can change due to climate change, causing more storms, hurricanes, and quiet spells. These changes can dramatically affect wind power system performance and predictability. Researchers and practitioners are creating more advanced wind power forecasting algorithms that combine more parameters and data sources. Advanced numerical weather prediction models, machine learning techniques, and real-time meteorological sensor and satellite data are used. This paper proposes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) forecasting model incorporating a Dynamic Fitness Al-Biruni Earth Radius (DFBER) algorithm to predict wind power data patterns. The performance of this model is compared with several other popular models, including BER, Jaya Algorithm (JAYA), Fire Hawk Optimizer (FHO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based models. The evaluation is done using various metrics such as relative root mean squared error (RRMSE), Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (MBE), Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), coefficient of determination (R2), and determination agreement (WI). According to the evaluation metrics and analysis presented in the study, the proposed RNN-DFBER-based model outperforms the other models considered. This suggests that the RNN model, combined with the DFBER algorithm, predicts wind power data patterns more effectively than the alternative models. To support the findings, visualizations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the RNN-DFBER model. Additionally, statistical analyses, such as the ANOVA test and the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, are conducted to assess the significance and reliability of the results.

TI  - A Systematic Review of the Latest Research Trends on the Use of Satellite Imagery in Solid Waste Disposal Applications from 2012 to 2021
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Review
AB  - There is currently no review article on the role of remote sensing (RS) tools on waste disposal site (WDS) applications. Permanent waste disposal is the world's most commonly used solid waste management method, and a specific review is warranted. To investigate research trends and to identify knowledge gaps on the use of satellite-based RS in WDS applications, 170 studies published over the last decade, from 2012 to 2021, were examined and classified using a bibliometric approach. Results are discussed with respect to relevancy, satellite types, study origins, RS analytical methods, and applications. Out of 72 short-listed studies, 44.4% were carried out in Asia, followed by Europe with 18.0%. Asia is also a leading region in the use of multiple satellite products. Only two satellite products were utilized in African studies. The absence of local satellites could potentially be the reason behind the sole use of global satellite imagery. Globally, Landsat contributed 70.8% of the total studies. Sentinel products represented only 8.3%. About 44% of the studies used various RS indices when addressing WDS-related issues. The majority of studies (56%) applied image classification methods to study changes in land use and land cover. The temporal trend reveals a general increase in the total number of studies, particularly for suitable site detection and disposal-site-induced anomaly detection. This review directly addresses the knowledge management aspect of data-driven solid waste management.

TI  - A novel framework to predict chlorophyll-a concentrations in water bodies through multi-source big data and machine learning algorithms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication happens when water bodies are enriched by minerals and nutrients. Dense blooms of noxious are the most obvious effect of eutrophication that harms water quality, and by increasing toxic substances damage the water ecosystem. Therefore, it is critical to monitor and investigate the development process of eutrophication. The concentration of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) in water bodies is an essential indicator of eutrophication in them. Previous studies in predicting chlorophyll-a concentrations suffered from low spatial resolution and discrepancies between predicted and observed values. In this paper, we used various remote sensing and ground observation data and proposed a novel machine learning-based framework, a random forest inversion model, to provide the spatial distribution of chl-a in 2 m spatial resolution. The results showed our model outperformed other base models, and the goodness of fit improved by over 36.6% while MSE and MAE decreased by over 15.17% and over 21.26% respectively. Moreover, we compared the feasibility of GF-1 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing data in chl-a concentration prediction. We found that better prediction results can be obtained by using GF-1 data, with the goodness of fit reaching 93.1% and MSE only 3.589. The proposed method and findings of this study can be used in future water management studies and as an aid for decision-makers in this field.

TI  - Structure of the High-Latitude Noon Ionosphere of the Southern Hemisphere
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The structure of the winter noon ionosphere of the southern hemisphere was studied. This structure includes the dayside cusp, associated high-latitude ionospheric trough (HLT), main ionospheric trough (MIT), electron density (Ne) peak at latitudes about 70 & DEG;, mid-latitude ring ionospheric trough (RIT), and low-latitude quasi-trough. Data from the CHAMP satellite in the southern hemisphere for quiet geomagnetic conditions under high solar activity were selected for analysis. The DMSP satellite data and a model of auroral diffuse precipitation were also used. This model represents two zones of auroral diffuse precipitation on the equatorward and poleward edges of the auroral oval. It is shown that the situation in the winter noon ionosphere of the southern hemisphere depends cardinally on longitude. At sunlit longitudes, only the HLT is observed, and MIT is formed in the shadow region. At intermediate longitudes, both troughs can be observed and, therefore, there is a problem of their separation. The positions of all structures of the ionosphere depend on the longitude; in particular, the positions of the daytime MIT are changed by 6 & DEG;-7 & DEG;. At latitudes of the dayside cusp, both the peak and the minimum of Ne can be observed. A high and narrow peak of Ne is regularly recorded in the CHAMP data at latitudes of the equatorward zone of diffuse precipitation (68 & DEG;-72 & DEG;). In the shadow region, this peak forms the MIT poleward wall, and at sunlit longitudes a quasi-trough equatorward of this peak is sometimes observed. The RIT is rarely formed during the day, only at the American and Atlantic longitudes.

M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThis study aimed to measure the efficacy of using carbon nanoparticles in the preoperative localization of early breast cancer (BC) cases as well as in the detection of sentinel lymph nodes in Egypt. In addition, the purpose of the study was to determine whether the efficacy of carbon nanoparticles outweighs their high price and additional shipping fees.Material and methodsThe current pilot study enrolled 16 early BC patients, particularly those eligible for breast-conserving surgery. All patients underwent standardized injection techniques. The operating surgeons provided comprehensive intraoperative findings and postoperative histopathological reports of the excised tissues.ResultsAfter neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), downstaging of the study subjects was achieved until reaching the TNM stage of T1N1M0 and T1N0M0 in 2 cases (12.5%) and 14 cases (87.5%), respectively. Ultrasound-guided injection of carbon nanoparticles was done, followed by surgical excision on the same day or the day after injection. Eleven patients had positive mass lesions preoperatively, with a mean tumoral size of less than 1 cm in maximum dimension. Moreover, 6 out of the 11 patients showed positive black staining intraoperatively with an accuracy of 68.75%. Postoperative histopathological examination (the gold standard) of axillary specimens revealed that 3 out of 16 of the study population have positive tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes. However, only 2 of these cases demonstrated intra-operative black staining, with the black dye's positive and negative predictive values of staining being 100% and 92.2%, respectively.ConclusionsPreoperative carbon nanoparticle suspension injection is a safe and effective method for adequate tumoral localization in BC patients. Nevertheless, this pilot study did not provide strong evidence for the adequacy of sentinel lymph node detection due to the small sample size, high cost, and extra shipping fees of the carbon nanoparticles.

TI  - Graph Neural Network-Based Method of Spatiotemporal Land Cover Mapping Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral satellite imagery offers a new perspective for spatial modelling, change detection and land cover classification. The increased demand for accurate classification of geographically diverse regions led to advances in object-based methods. A novel spatiotemporal method is presented for object-based land cover classification of satellite imagery using a Graph Neural Network. This paper introduces innovative representation of sequential satellite images as a directed graph by connecting segmented land region through time. The method's novel modular node classification pipeline utilises the Convolutional Neural Network as a multispectral image feature extraction network, and the Graph Neural Network as a node classification model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we utilised EfficientNetV2-S for feature extraction and the GraphSAGE algorithm with Long Short-Term Memory aggregation for node classification. This innovative application on Sentinel-2 L2A imagery produced complete 4-year intermonthly land cover classification maps for two regions: Graz in Austria, and the region of Portoroz, Izola and Koper in Slovenia. The regions were classified with Corine Land Cover classes. In the level 2 classification of the Graz region, the method outperformed the state-of-the-art UNet model, achieving an average F1-score of 0.841 and an accuracy of 0.831, as opposed to UNet's 0.824 and 0.818, respectively. Similarly, the method demonstrated superior performance over UNet in both regions under the level 1 classification, which contains fewer classes. Individual classes have been classified with accuracies up to 99.17%.

TI  - Morphometric Determination and Digital Geological Mapping by RS and GIS Techniques in Aseer-Jazan Contact, Southwest Saudi Arabia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrological characteristics of the watershed in the southern Aseer and northern Jazan regions of Saudi Arabia (SA) were identified by integrated remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Landsat data. For this purpose, the Wadi Ishran, Wadi Baysh, Wadi Itwad, Wadi Tabab, and Wadi Bayd drainage basins were extracted. Wadi Ishran is the largest, and Wadi Tabab is the smallest. Stream order and bifurcation ratio show that the Itwad and Bayd basins are permeable and of high aquifer potentiality. The multisupervised classification found seven rock units that were spread out in different ways across the basins. The areas with the highest vegetation were in the southeast, the centre, and the northwest. The bands' ratios show more iron-rich sediments in the northeast and southwest. This paper's outcomes serve as the basis for planning and managing groundwater resources. It finds potential groundwater zones, determines the risk of flooding, and chooses places where harvesting can be undertaken.

TI  - An Updated Meta-Analysis on Cerebral Embolic Protection in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Intervention Stratified by Baseline Surgical Risk and Device Type
T2  - STRUCTURAL HEART-THE JOURNAL OF THE HEART TEAM
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve intervention (TAVI) can lead to the embolization of debris. Capturing the debris by cerebral embolic protection (CEP) devices may reduce the risk of stroke. New evidence has allowed us to examine the effects of CEP in patients undergoing TAVI. We aimed to assess the effects of CEP overall and stratified by the device used (SENTINEL or TriGuard) and the surgical risk of the patients.Methods: We selected randomized controlled trials using electronic databases through September 17, 2022. We estimated random-effects risk ratios (RR) with (95% confidence interval) and calculated absolute risk differences at 30 days across baseline surgical risks derived from the TAVI trials for any stroke (disabling and nondisabling) and all-cause mortality. Results: Among 6 trials (n 1/4 3921), CEP vs. control did not reduce any stroke [RR: 0.95 (0.50-1.81)], disabling [RR: 0.75 (0.18-3.16)] or nondisabling [RR: 0.99 (0.65-1.49)] strokes, or all-cause mortality [RR: 1.23 (0.552.77)]. However, when analyzed by device, SENTINEL reduced disabling stroke [RR: 0.46 (0.22-0.95)], translating into 6 fewer per 1000 in high-risk, 3 fewer per 1000 in intermediate-risk, and 1 fewer per 1000 in low surgical-risk patients. CEP vs. control did not reduce the risk of any bleeding [RR: 1.03 (0.44-2.40)], major vascular complications [RR: 1.41 (0.57-3.48)], or acute kidney injury [RR: 1.36 (0.57-3.28)].Conclusions: This updated meta-analysis showed that SENTINEL CEP might reduce disabling stroke in patients undergoing TAVI. Patients with high and intermediate surgical risks were most likely to derive benefits.AS, aortic stenosis; AKI, acute kidney injury; CEP, cerebral embolic protection; CI, confidence interval; STS/TVT, Society of Thoracic Surgeon-Transcatheter Valve Therapy; STS-PROM, Society of Thoracic Surgery-predicted risk of mortality; TAVI, transcatheter aortic valve intervention.

TI  - Multi-Branch Deep Learning Framework for Land Scene Classification in Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land scene classification in satellite imagery has a wide range of applications in remote surveillance, environment monitoring, remote scene analysis, Earth observations and urban planning. Due to immense advantages of the land scene classification task, several methods have been proposed during recent years to automatically classify land scenes in remote sensing images. Most of the work focuses on designing and developing deep networks to identify land scenes from high-resolution satellite images. However, these methods face challenges in identifying different land scenes. Complex texture, cluttered background, extremely small size of objects and large variations in object scale are the common challenges that restrict the models to achieve high performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multi-branch deep learning framework that efficiently combines global contextual features with multi-scale features to identify complex land scenes. Generally, the framework consists of two branches. The first branch extracts global contextual information from different regions of the input image, and the second branch exploits a fully convolutional network (FCN) to extract multi-scale local features. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on three benchmark datasets, UC-Merced, SIRI-WHU, and EuroSAT. From the experiments, we demonstrate that the framework achieves superior performance compared to other similar models.

TI  - A Systematic Approach to Identify Shipping Emissions Using Spatio-Temporally Resolved TROPOMI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stringent global regulations aim to reduce nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions from maritime shipping. However, the lack of a global monitoring system makes compliance verification challenging. To address this issue, we propose a systematic approach to monitor shipping emissions using unsupervised clustering techniques on spatio-temporal georeferenced data, specifically NO2 measurements obtained from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. Our method involves partitioning spatio-temporally resolved measurements based on the similarity of NO2 column levels. We demonstrate the reproducibility of our approach through rigorous testing and validation using data collected from multiple regions and time periods. Our approach improves the spatial correlation coefficients between NO2 column clusters and shipping traffic frequency. Additionally, we identify a temporal correlation between NO2 column levels along shipping routes and the global container throughput index. We expect that our approach may serve as a prototype for a tool to identify anthropogenic maritime emissions, distinguishing them from background sources.

TI  - Spectral and Spatial Dependencies in the Validation of Satellite-Based Aerosol Optical Depth from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager Using the Aerosol Robotic Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The regional and global scale of aerosols in the atmosphere can be quantified using the aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved from satellite observations. To obtain reliable satellite AODs, conducting consistent validations and refining retrieval algorithms are crucial. AODs and & ANGS;ngstrom exponents (AEs) measured with the aerosol robotic network (AERONET) are considered as the ground truth for satellite validations. AERONET AEs are used to collocate the wavelength of the AERONET AODs to those of the satellite AODs when there is a discordancy in their wavelengths. However, numerous validation studies have proposed different strategies by applying the AERONET AODs and AEs, and spatiotemporal collocation criteria. This study examined the impact of the wavelength and spatial collocation radius variations by comparing AODs at 550 nm derived from the geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) with those obtained from the AERONET for the year 2016. The estimated AERONET AODs at 550 nm varied from 5.18% to 11.73% depending on the selection of AOD and AE, and the spatial collocation radii from 0 to 40 km, respectively. The longer the collocation radius and the higher the AODs, the greater the variability observed in the validation results. Overall, the selection of the spatial collocation radius had a stronger impact on the variability in the validation results obtained compared to the selection of the wavelength. The variability was also found in seasonal analysis. Therefore, it is recommended to carefully select the data wavelength and spatial collocation radius, consider seasonal effects, and provide this information when validating satellite AODs using AERONET.

TI  - Trends of axillary surgery in breast cancer patients with axillary lymph node metastasis: a comprehensive single-center retrospective study.
T2  - Annals of surgical treatment and research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Purpose: Based on the results of previous trials, de-escalation of axillary surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has increased in patients with axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis at presentation. This study aimed to review the trends of axillary surgery by time period and molecular subtype in patients with ALN metastasis.Methods: We analyzed the rates of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and ALN dissection (ALND) based on time period and subtype. The time period was divided into 3 subperiods to determine the rate of axillary surgery type over time (period 1, from 2009 to 2012; period 2, from 2013 to 2016; and period 3, from 2017 to July 2019).Results: From 2009 to July 2019, 2,525 breast cancer patients underwent surgery. Based on subtype, the ALND rate of hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) disease decreased by 13.0% from period 1 to period 3 (period 1, 99.4%; period 2, 97.5%; and period 3, 86.4%; P < 0.001). Conversely, the ALND rate in HR+/HER2+, HR-/HER2+, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) significantly decreased by 43.7%, 48.8%, and 35.2% in period 1, period 2, and period 3, respectively (P < 0.001). In the patient group receiving NAC, HR+/HER2- had a significantly higher ALND rate (84.1%) than HR+/HER2+, HR-/HER2+, and TNBC (60.8%, 62.3%, and 70.7%, respectively; P < 0.001).Conclusion: The SLNB rate in patients with ALN metastasis has increased over time. However, the ALND rate in HR+/HER2- was significantly higher than in other subtypes.

TI  - Monitoring Mining-Induced Geo-Hazards in a Contaminated Mountainous Region of Indonesia Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining-induced or enhanced geo-hazards (MGHs) pose significant risks in rural mountainous regions with underground mining operations by harming groundwater layers, water circulation systems, and mountain stability. MGHs occurring in naturally contaminated environments can severely amplify socio-environmental risks. A high correlation was found among undermining development, precipitation, and hazards; however, details of MGHs have yet to be adequately characterized. This study investigated multiple mining-induced/enhanced geo-hazards in a naturally contaminated mountain region in Bone Bolango Regency, Gorontalo Province, Indonesia, in 2020, where a rapidly developing coexisting mining sector was present. We utilized PlanetScope's CubeSat constellations and Sentinel-1 dataset to assess the volume, distribution, pace, and pattern of MGHs. The findings reveal that severe landslides and floods accelerated the mobilization of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) via the river water system, thus considerably exacerbating socio-environmental risks. These results indicate potential dangers of enhanced PTE contamination for marine ecosystems and humans at a regional level. The study design and data used facilitated a comprehensive assessment of the MGHs and associated risks, providing important information for decision-makers and stakeholders. However, limitations in the methodology should be considered when interpreting the findings. The societal benefits of this study include informing policies and practices that aim to mitigate the negative impacts of mining activities on the environment and society at the local and regional levels.

TI  - Land-Water Transition Zone Monitoring in Support of Drinking Water Production
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Water utilities often use extended open surface water reservoirs to produce drinking water. Biotic and abiotic factors influence the water level, leading to alterations in the concentration of the dissolved substances (in cases of flood or drought), entry of new pollutants (in case of flooding) or reduction in the availability and inflow speed of water to the treatment plant (in case of drought). Spaceborne image analysis is considered a significant surrogate for establishing a dense network of sensors to monitor changes. In this study, renowned inundation mapping techniques are examined for their adaptability to the inland water reservoirs' conditions. The results, from the Polyphytos open surface water reservoir in northern Greece, showcase the transferability of the workflows with overall accuracies exceeding-in cases-98%. Hydroperiod maps generated for the area of interest, along with variations in the water surface extent over a four-year period, provide valuable insights into the reservoir's hydrological patterns. Comparison among different inundation mapping techniques for the surface water extent and water level reveal challenges and limitations, which are related to the spatial resolution, the data take frequency and the influence of the landscape synthesis beyond the water reservoir boundaries.

TI  - Monitoring Individual Tree Phenology in a Multi-Species Forest Using High Resolution UAV Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring tree phenology is important for understanding ecosystem functioning and for assessing ecosystem responses to climate change. Satellite imagery offers open-access global coverage but is restricted to forest-level analyses, due to its coarse spatial resolution. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery can monitor phenology at the individual tree level by utilizing a centimeter-scale resolution. Two research objectives were identified for this study: (1) to derive phenological metrics at the individual tree level, using various vegetation indices (VIs); and (2) to assess the accuracy of automatic crown delineation in a diverse ecosystem. To achieve this, fourteen multi-spectral UAV flights were performed, and the ability of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), and chlorophyll index red-edge (CIre) to model seasonal phenology was assessed. A double logistic model was fitted on the VI observations for each individual tree, to derive the start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS). Individual tree crowns were delineated automatically using marker-controlled watershed segmentation (MCWS), and the treetops were identified using a local maximum filter (LMF). Overall, the automatic segmentation performed well (F-score: 0.79, IoU: 0.58), with higher accuracies in single-species areas, while it underperformed in complex mixed forest structures. All VIs captured a strong seasonal signal for the deciduous trees and derived SOS and EOS estimates consistent with literature and ground observations. General phenological patterns included an early silver birch SOS, a quick beech budburst, and large within-species phenology variations for oak trees. Seasonal VI variation for coniferous evergreen trees was limited, and the resulting phenology estimates proved unreliable. In conclusion, these findings emphasize the capabilities of UAV imagery for individual tree crown phenology monitoring. However, they also show the difficulty of monitoring evergreen phenology with the commonly-used VIs and stress the need for further investigations.

TI  - Cloud-Free Global Maps of Essential Vegetation Traits Processed from the TOA Sentinel-3 Catalogue in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global mapping of essential vegetation traits (EVTs) through data acquired by Earth-observing satellites provides a spatially explicit way to analyze the current vegetation states and dynamics of our planet. Although significant efforts have been made, there is still a lack of global and consistently derived multi-temporal trait maps that are cloud-free. Here we present the processing chain for the spatiotemporally continuous production of four EVTs at a global scale: (1) fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), (2) leaf area index (LAI), (3) fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and (4) leaf chlorophyll content (LCC). The proposed workflow presents a scalable processing approach to the global cloud-free mapping of the EVTs. Hybrid retrieval models, named S3-TOA-GPR-1.0-WS, were implemented into Google Earth Engine (GEE) using Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) Level-1B for the mapping of the four EVTs along with associated uncertainty estimates. We used the Whittaker smoother (WS) for the temporal reconstruction of the four EVTs, which led to continuous data streams, here applied to the year 2019. Cloud-free maps were produced at 5 km spatial resolution at 10-day time intervals. The consistency and plausibility of the EVT estimates for the resulting annual profiles were evaluated by per-pixel intra-annually correlating against corresponding vegetation products of both MODIS and Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS). The most consistent results were obtained for LAI, which showed intra-annual correlations with an average Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.57 against the CGLS LAI product. Globally, the EVT products showed consistent results, specifically obtaining higher correlation than R > 0.5 with reference products between 30 and 60 degrees latitude in the Northern Hemisphere. Additionally, intra-annual goodness-of-fit statistics were also calculated locally against reference products over four distinct vegetated land covers. As a general trend, vegetated land covers with pronounced phenological dynamics led to high correlations between the different products. However, sparsely vegetated fields as well as areas near the equator linked to smaller seasonality led to lower correlations. We conclude that the global gap-free mapping of the four EVTs was overall consistent. Thanks to GEE, the entire OLCI L1B catalogue can be processed efficiently into the EVT products on a global scale and made cloud-free with the WS temporal reconstruction method. Additionally, GEE facilitates the workflow to be operationally applicable and easily accessible to the broader community.

AB  - Four main models of the appearance of boundaries (in a particular case, integrity), arising from the theory of nonlinear dynamic systems, are considered briefly. On the basis of Kotelnikov's fundamental sampling theorem and, accordingly, general information theory, the character of a distinguished boundary as a function of the sampling frequency in a spatial series with a regular step is investigated and the measurement unit "berg" (one full oscillation per one kilometer) is introduced, which is essentially identical to the unit "hertz" for a time series. The main provisions are illustrated using the analysis of the properties of real biogeocenoses and multispectral measurements of solar radiation reflection by the SPOT 6 satellite.

TI  - Towards the Accurate Automatic Detection of Mesoscale Convective Systems in Remote Sensing Data: From Data Mining to Deep Learning Models and Their Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and associated hazardous meteorological phenomena cause considerable economic damage and even loss of lives in the mid-latitudes. The mechanisms behind the formation and intensification of MCSs are still not well understood due to limited observational data and inaccurate climate models. Improving the prediction and understanding of MCSs is a high-priority area in hydrometeorology. One may study MCSs either employing high-resolution atmospheric modeling or through the analysis of remote sensing images which are known to reflect some of the characteristics of MCSs, including high temperature gradients of cloud-top, specific spatial shapes of temperature patterns, etc. However, research on MCSs using remote sensing data is limited by inadequate (in size) databases of satellite-identified MCSs and poorly equipped automated tools for MCS identification and tracking. In this study, we present (a) the GeoAnnotateAssisted tool for fast and convenient visual identification of MCSs in satellite imagery, which is capable of providing AI-generated suggestions of MCS labels; (b) the Dataset of Mesoscale Convective Systems over the European Territory of Russia (DaMesCoS-ETR), which we created using this tool, and (c) the Deep Convolutional Neural Network for the Identification of Mesoscale Convective Systems (MesCoSNet), constructed following the RetinaNet architecture, which is capable of identifying MCSs in Meteosat MSG/SEVIRI data. We demonstrate that our neural network, optimized in terms of its hyperparameters, provides high MCS identification quality (mAP=0.75, true positive rate TPR=0.61) and a well-specified detection uncertainty (false alarm ratio FAR=0.36). Additionally, we demonstrate potential applications of the GeoAnnotateAssisted labelling tool, the DaMesCoS-ETR dataset, and the MesCoSNet neural network in addressing MCS research challenges. Specifically, we present the climatology of axisymmetric MCSs over the European territory of Russia from 2014 to 2020 during summer seasons (May to September), obtained using MesCoSNet with Meteosat MSG/SEVIRI data. The automated identification of MCSs by the MesCoSNet artificial neural network opens up new avenues for previously unattainable MCS research topics.

TI  - Land use change pattern of the greater one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) in Chitwan national park of Nepal.
T2  - Asian Journal of Conservation Biology
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change pattern shrinking habitats of greater one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) in lowland of Nepal. It has been attributed to many factors including habitat conversion, fragmentation, infestation of weeds and climate change. We examined the land use change and habitats utiliation by R.unicornis overtime in the Chitwan National Park and surrounding area of Central Nepal through field observations combined with geographical information system (GIS) data and satellite images. We used landsat Imageries of 1993, 2000, 2010, and 2014 to examine land use change in the Chitwan Valley. These findings were verified through field observation. Sighting locations of R. unicornis in different land were carried in field observation and from literature review. We found that land use has significantly (x2=271.87, a=0.05) changed over time and influenced habitat utilization of R. unicornis in the Chitwan Valley. We also analyzed effect of land use change on habitat of rhinoceros and shifting of rhinoceros from the east area to west area with changing preferred habitat as grassland and riverbeds over time. Interestingly, we found that preferred habitat of R.unicornis significantly (x2=410.2, a=0.05) different in the Chitwan Valley and, preferably habitat is sparse forest/grasslands and riverbeds. Infestation of Mikania micrantha decouple with climate change are also responsible factors for changing land use pattern of the eastern and central lowland of Nepal. Our findings provide information useful for implementing effective strategies for long-term conservation of wildlife in the Nepal and beyond.

TI  - Assessment of Land Cover Changes and Climate Variability Effects on Catchment Hydrology Using a Physically Distributed Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover, along with climate variability, play vital roles in hydrological functionality of catchments and are leading threats to inter-related hydrological processes. In the current study, a physically distributed Soil and Water Assessment Tool model is used to investigate the impact of historical changes on the hydrologic response of the Damodar catchment (Jharkhand, India) in terms of inflow to the Panchet reservoir. The model was validated for the monthly runoff and inflow at the outlets of four watersheds and three reservoirs in the Damodar catchment before the assessment of changes in inflow at the Panchet reservoir was performed. The analysis of land cover thematic maps prepared using satellite images of Landsat 4, 5 and 7 showed that from 1972 to 2001, the land cover in the Damodar catchment changed considerably. The interpretation of land cover results indicates that significant increases in settlements (140%), waterbodies (98.42%) and agricultural land (26.71%), along with decreases in wasteland (32.63%) and forest (15.28%), occurred due to development. The Mann-Kendall test was used for measuring the rainfall and temperature for the Damodar catchment, which showed that this region became drier during 1970-2005, with decreases in the annual rainfall and increases in the mean temperature. A simulated hydrological impact under land cover dynamics and climate variability in the historical time frame of 1970-2000 using the model revealed a gradual increase of 26.16% in the Panchet reservoir inflow. The study revealed that the increased inflow is relatively greater under the influence of climate variability due to changes in rainfall and temperature, rather than land cover, that were observed over the region.

TI  - Sero-molecular epidemiology of Japanese encephalitis virus in swine population of western Uttar Pradesh, India: Unraveling the geographical expansion of the virus.
T2  - Journal of vector borne diseases
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Swine is a good sentinel for forecast of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) outbreaks in humans. The present study was envisaged with objectives to know the sero-conversion period of JEV and to assess the prevalence of JEV in swine population of western Uttar Pradesh state of India.METHODS: A total of 252 swine serum samples were screened using IgM ELISA over the period of one year to determine the sero-conversion rate and compared seasonally to check the transmission peak of virus. Further, 321 swine blood and serum samples were collected from all seven divisions of western Uttar Pradesh to determine prevalence of JEV using real time RT-PCR and ELISA.RESULTS: Seasonal sero-conversion rate was high during monsoon and post-monsoon (32%) followed by winter (22.91%) and summer (10.71%) seasons. The sero-conversion was observed in all months indicating viral activity throughout the year in the region. The low degree of correlation was found between meteorological variables (day temperature, rainfall) and sero-conversion rate. A total of 52 samples (16.19%) were found positive by real time RT-PCR while sero-positivity of 29.91% was observed using IgG and IgM ELISA(s). The overall prevalence of JEV was 39.25%.INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The presence of JEV was recorded throughout the year with peak occurrence during monsoon and post-monsoon season indicating that virus has spread its realm to western region of the state. The information generated in the present study will aid in initiating timely vector control measures and human vaccination program to mitigate risk of JEV infection in the region.

TI  - Dynamics of land cover changes and condition of soil and surface water quality in a Mining-Altered landscape, Ghana
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the dynamics of mining effects on land use land cover changes and the chemical and physical characteristics of soil and surface water in the Ahafo mining area in Ghana. Landsat imagery was used to analyze land use-land cover changes (LULC) using a supervised classification technique. Soil samples were collected within 600 m from active mining operations and at depths of up to 75 cm, as well as surface water samples from upstream and downstream of the mine. Atomic Absorption Spectrometry was used to determine the concentration of heavy metals in the soil and water samples. The results demonstrated a significant loss of forest and other vegetation covers, which decreased from 44% to 31% to 8% and 20%, respectively, with corresponding increases in the mining site, mine water, settlement/bare surface, cropland and plantation. Organic matter, organic carbon, exchangeable bases, cation exchange capacity, available phosphorus, and pH were all moderate in the soil surrounding the mine. Except for As (4.027 mg/kg) and Hg (1 mg/kg), all heavy metals found in the soil were within FAO/WHO guidelines. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) (416.18 mg/L), Total Suspended Solids (55.08 mg/L), Turbidity (54.49 NTU), Ca (84.49 mg/L), Mg (31.97 mg/L), nitrate (10.23 mg/L), and sulphate (606.83 mg/L) in the downstream water were higher than those in the upstream and USEPA/ WHO limits for drinking water except for TDS. Because of the geology of the area, there were high concentrations of iron, manganese, and aluminum in the surface water. The results show that mining induced severe land cover changes and impaired surface water and soil quality in the mine's vicinity. The findings have implications for stakeholder education, appropriate community water interventions, and company-community-regulator participatory monitoring to avoid health risk exposure and further water and soil quality and vegetation degradation.

TI  - Climate change remarks in a glacial catchment within Southern Rhaetian Alps: the Fumo Valley case study (Adamello Group, Northern Italy)
T2  - RENDICONTI ONLINE DELLA SOCIETA GEOLOGICA ITALIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, glacier retreat from the end of the Little Ice Age to present time and climatic variations on recent time scale were assessed in the Fumo Valley, which is a small glacial catchment located in the Adamello Group (Southern Rhaetian Alps, Italy). The study area has a high scientific and cultural value as part of the UNESCO Adamello-Brenta Geopark and provides several ecosystem and socioeconomic services. Therefore, the assessment of climate change impacts at local scale is essential for a sustainable watershed management, as well as for conservation strategies. A present-state glacier inventory was elaborated by means of remote sensing using Sentinel-2 satellite images. Then, it was compared to previous published glacier inventories in order to assess numerical and geometric surface variations. Also, two temperature data series related to different thirty-year periods (i.e., 1971-2000 and 1991-2020) were analysed to assess air temperature variations. The results highlight a total surface loss of 5.99 km2 (-70.9%) between 1850 and 1958. Between 1958 and 2022 a total area reduction of 0.87 km2 (-35.5%) was observed, which is comparable to other studies carried out at national scale. However, a minor progression phase was observed between 1958 and 1981 (+76.3%), which is partially attributable to the glacial advance episode that occurred between the 1970s and 1980s in the Italian Alps. After, total glacier area declined by 63.4% (1981-2022), with an accelerated regression between 2015 and 2022 (i.e., higher annual rate of variation, formation of ice-contact lakes, tongue separation, and severe glacier fragmentation). The mean annual air temperature rose of 0.6 & DEG;C, with a greater variation in mean annual maximum temperature (+1 & DEG;C) than minimum temperature (+0.1 & DEG;C), and an average temperature increase higher in spring and summer than in autumn and winter. These results can be interpreted as truthful indicators of climate change impacts occurring at local scale, highlighting the vulnerability of the study area with respect to the predicted future climatic scenarios.

TI  - Unlocking the Potential of Remote Sensing in Wind Erosion Studies: A Review and Outlook for Future Directions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) has revolutionized field data collection processes and provided timely and spatially consistent acquisition of data on the terrestrial landscape properties. This research paper investigates the relationship between Wind Erosion (WE) and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques. By examining, analyzing, and reviewing recent studies utilizing RS, we underscore the importance of wind erosion research by exploring indicators that influence the detection, evaluation, and modeling of wind erosion. Furthermore, it identifies research gaps particularly in soil erodibility estimation, soil moisture monitoring, and surface roughness assessment using RS. Overall, this research enhances our understanding of WE and RS and offers insights into future research directions. To conduct this study, we employed a two-fold approach. First, we utilized a non-systematic review approach by accessing the Global Applications of Soil Erosion Modelling Tracker (GASEMT) database. Subsequently, we conducted a systematic review of the relevant literature on wind erosion and remote sensing in the core collection of the Web of Science (WoS) database. Additionally, we employed the VOSviewer bibliometric software to generate a cooperative keyword network analysis, facilitating the advancements and identifying emerging areas of WE and RS research. With a non-systematic review, we focused on examining the current state and potential of remote sensing for mapping and analyzing following indicators of wind erosion modelling: (1) soil erodibility; (2) soil moisture; (3) surface roughness; (4) vegetation cover; (5) wind barriers; and (6) wind erosion mapping. Our study highlights the widespread utilization of freely available RS data, such as MODIS and Landsat, for WE modeling. However, we also acknowledge the limitations of high resolution sensors due to their high costs. RS techniques offer an efficient and cost-effective approach for mapping erosion at various scales and call for a more comprehensive and detailed assessment of soil erosion at regional scales. These findings provide valuable guidance for future research endeavors in this domain.

TI  - A Novel Method Using Fine Needle Aspiration from Tumor-Draining Lymph Nodes Could Enable the Discovery of New Prognostic Markers in Patients with Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Cutaneous squamous cell cancer is a common form of cancer. Caught early, it is usually curable. However, 3-5% develop into a metastatic form with a very poor prognosis. All efforts to find biomarkers, in blood or in the tumor itself, for early identification of this group of patients have so far failed. This study describes a novel method based on fine needle aspiration that enables the identification of lymphocyte markers in tumor-draining lymph nodes. By focusing on lymph nodes as a key organ for a well-functioning immune system, it might be possible to, early on, find biomarkers related to future metastatic development. Cutaneous squamous cell cancer (cSCC) is the second most common form of skin cancer, characterized by abnormal, accelerated growth of squamous cells. When caught early, most cSCCs are curable. About 5 percent of the cSCC cases have advanced to such an extent, generally metastatic, that they are far more dangerous, with very poor prognosis and challenging to treat. All efforts to find biomarkers, in blood or in the tumor itself, for early identification of patients with a risk for metastasis have so far failed. The present study describes a novel method that enables the identification of lymphocyte markers in tumor-draining lymph nodes. Six patients with advanced cSCC were analyzed using a combination of a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) protocol, fine needle aspiration (FNA), and flow cytometry. Immunological results from the sentinel nodes were combined with corresponding data from peripheral blood and unfixed tumor tissues. The result demonstrates a striking difference between the subsets of T-cells from the three compartments. Our interpretation of this first pilot study is that the ability to follow specific immunological markers on lymphocytes in tumor-draining lymph nodes will enable the identification of novel prognostic biomarkers not detectable in material from blood and tumor tissues.

T2  - ENGINEERING STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the flexural behavior of rectangular ultra-high performance concrete-filled high-strength steel tube (CuFTh) members. A total of 11 tests were conducted. The influence of yield stress of steel (Fy), steel fiber volume content of UHPC (& rho;), height (H) of steel tube, and thickness of steel tube wall (t) was investigated. 3D finite-element models were developed and benchmarked to conduct parametric studies. Results from the experimental tests and FEM analyses indicated that: (i) Fy, t, and H have a significant influence on the flexural strength, while the compressive strength of concrete has a negligible impact; and (ii) increasing & rho; slightly improves the flexural strength, but obviously reduces the ductility. Additionally, results from the experimental tests and FEM analyses were compared with the strength estimated using AISC 360-16, GB 50936-2014, Eurocode 4, and AIJ. The comparisons showed that Eurocode 4 and AISC 360-16 can reasonably estimate the flexural strength of rectangular CuFTh members. AIJ is recommended for predicting the service-level flexural stiffness of rectangular CuFTh members.

TI  - Refraction Correction for Spectrally Derived Bathymetry Using UAS Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectrally derived bathymetry (SDB) algorithms are rapidly gaining in acceptance and widespread use for nearshore bathymetric mapping. In the past, refraction correction could generally be ignored in SDB, due to the relatively small fields of view (FOVs) of satellite sensors, and the fact that such corrections were typically small in relation to the uncertainties in the output bathymetry. However, the validity of ignoring refraction correction in SDB is now called into question, due to the ever-improving accuracies of SDB, the desire to use the data in nautical charting workflows, and the application of SDB algorithms to airborne cameras with wide FOVs. This study tests the hypothesis that refraction correction leads to a statistically significant improvement in the accuracy of SDB using uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) imagery. A straightforward procedure for SDB refraction correction, implemented as a modification to the well-known Stumpf algorithm, is presented and applied to imagery collected from a commercially available UAS in two study sites in the Florida Keys, U.S.A. The results show that the refraction correction produces a statistically significant improvement in accuracy, with a reduction in bias of 46-75%, a reduction in RMSE of 3-11 cm, and error distributions closer to Gaussian.

TI  - Modeling Coastal Water Clarity Using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding and attributing changes to water quality is essential to the study and management of coastal ecosystems and the ecological functions they sustain (e.g., primary productivity, predation, and submerged aquatic vegetation growth). However, describing patterns of water clarity-a key aspect of water quality-over meaningful scales in space and time is challenged by high spatial and temporal variability due to natural and anthropogenic processes. Regionally tuned satellite algorithms can provide a more complete understanding of coastal water clarity changes and drivers. In this study, we used open-access satellite data and low-cost in situ methods to improve estimates of water clarity in an optically complex coastal water body. Specifically, we created a remote sensing water clarity product by compiling Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 reflectance data with long-term Secchi depth measurements at 12 sites over 8 years in a shallow turbid coastal lagoon system in Virginia, USA. Our satellite-based model explained similar to 33% of the variation in in situ water clarity. Our approach increases the spatiotemporal coverage of in situ water clarity data and improves estimates from bio-optical algorithms that overpredicted water clarity. This could lead to a better understanding of water clarity changes and drivers to better predict how water quality will change in the future.Plain Language Summary Water quality affects coastal ocean ecosystems and their ecological functions, including primary productivity, predation, and aquatic vegetation growth. An important component of water quality, water clarity, has historically been measured by tools such as Secchi disks. They are black and white painted disks that are lowered into the water column to estimate the depth at which they are no longer visible from the surface. They are a reliable, repeatable, and low-cost tool; thus, they have contributed to extensive long-term records of overall water quality. However, they produce gaps in space and time. Here, we created a remote sensing product to fill these gaps using open-access high resolution satellite data and low-cost in situ methods. Our product allows for the retrieval of water clarity data across an entire water body and at times field measurements are not available. This could lead to a better understanding of water clarity changes and drivers to better predict how water quality will change in the future.

TI  - Convectively Coupled Kelvin Waves and Tropical Cyclogenesis: Connections through Convection and Moisture
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research has demonstrated a relationship between convectively coupled Kelvin waves (CCKWs) and tropical cyclogenesis, likely due to the influence of CCKWs on the large-scale environment. However, it remains un-clear which environmental factors are most important and how they connect to TC genesis processes. Using a 39-yr data-base of African easterly waves (AEWs) to create composites of reanalysis and satellite data, it is shown that genesis may be facilitated by CCKW-driven modifications to convection and moisture. First, stand-alone composites of genesis demon-strate the significant role of environmental preconditioning and convective aggregation. A moist static energy variance budget indicates that convective aggregation during genesis is dominated by feedbacks between convection and longwave radiation. These processes begin over two days prior to genesis, supporting previous observational work. Shifting attention to CCKWs, up to 76% of developing AEWs encounter at least one CCKW in their lifetime. An increase in genesis events following convectively active CCKW phases is found, corroborating earlier studies. A decrease in genesis events fol-lowing convectively suppressed phases is also identified. Using CCKW-centered composites, we show that the convectively active CCKW phases enhance convection and moisture content in the vicinity of AEWs prior to genesis. Furthermore, en-hanced convective activity is the main discriminator between AEW-CCKW interactions that result in genesis versus those that do not. This analysis suggests that CCKWs may influence genesis through environmental preconditioning and radiative-convective feedbacks, among other factors. A secondary finding is that AEW attributes as far east as central Africa may be predictive of downstream genesis.

TI  - A Technique for Generating Preliminary Satellite Data to Evaluate SUHI Using Cloud Computing: A Case Study in Moscow, Russia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of construction zones, transportation, and utilities for industry and high-tech areas due to human activities has caused the deterioration of the natural ecological environment. As cities face problems related to the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect and environmental pollution, there is an urgent need to develop new methods for the ecological-microclimatic assessment and structural-functional planning of urban areas. The main goal of this study was to demonstrate the evolution of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect in Moscow over a long period and to determine the interaction between SUHIs and urban pollution islands (UPIs) using a geospatial analysis platform while optimizing vegetation classification with machine learning. Additionally, we are creating a digital database for modeling the sustainability of cities on the GEE platform using cloud computing. This study used cloud computing and remote sensing image analysis platforms for a 17-year temporal-series ecological-microclimatic assessment, which provided a sequence of values describing the ongoing process of changes in the ecological conditions of Moscow over time. Combining machine learning with the random forest algorithm (RF) improved vegetation classification accuracy while reducing computation time. The study findings demonstrated how the SUHI affected Moscow's territory and showed the urban areas significantly impacted by this phenomenon. The locations of surface urban heat islands in Moscow and areas affected by SUHI and UPI were identified using numerical modeling of the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI). From the findings, we identified the need to develop a new method for obtaining geospatial data for assessing the interaction between UPIs and SUHIs using cloud computing and mathematical data models.

TI  - Using US Twinkling Artifact to Identify Breast Biopsy Markers
T2  - RADIOLOGY-IMAGING CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast biopsy markers play an essential role in the surgical management of patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer. Marking a pathology-proven lymph node ensures accurate imaging assessment of response to neoadjuvant systemic therapy and decreased false-negative rates in sentinel lymph node biopsy. There is a clinically unmet need to make breast biopsy markers, particularly in the axilla, more sonographically visible or identifiable for preoperative localization purposes. Previously described color Doppler US twinkling artifact of some breast biopsy markers in in vitro gel phantoms and in ex vivo cadaveric breasts suggests that twinkling of such markers can be leveraged for improved in vivo detection. In this retrospective case series of eight female patients (mean age, 58.6 years & PLUSMN; 12.3 [SD]), conventional B-mode US imaging failed to identify the biopsy marker associated with a surgical target in the breast or in an axillary lymph node. However, in each patient, the marker was successfully identified with the help of color Doppler US twinkling.

TI  - Risk of Lymphedema and Death after Lymph Node Dissection with Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Treatments in Patients with Breast Cancer: An Eight-Year Nationwide Cohort Study
T2  - HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge on the impact of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments on post-surgery lymphedema (LE) in patients with breast cancer is limited due to methodological limitations and an insufficient sample size. We investigated the risk of LE in patients going through long-term anticancer treatment regimens using a national cohort from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database from 2011-2013. Incidence rate ratio, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional regression analysis were performed. A total of 39,791 patients were included. While minimal lymph node dissection (SLNB) reduced the risk of LE (hazard ratio [HR] 0.51) as expected, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by SLNB did not reduce the risk. Adjusting for adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) as time-varying exposure decreased the risk of LE in the SLNB group (HR 0.51), but not the mortality risk (HR 0.861). A longer duration of NAC, especially taxane-based, combined with SLNB reversed the effect and increased risk of LE. The findings highlight the importance of not only early surveillance before and after surgery, but also long-term surveillance during adjuvant treatment by surgeons and oncologists in order to reduce the risk of LE.

TI  - Greening and Browning Trends on the Pacific Slope of Peru and Northern Chile
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate detection and quantification of regional vegetation trends are essential for understanding the dynamics of landscape ecology and vegetation distribution. We applied a comprehensive trend analysis to satellite data to describe geospatial changes in vegetation along the Pacific slope of Peru and northern Chile, from sea level to the continental divide, a region characterised by biologically unique and highly sensitive arid and semi-arid environments. Our statistical analyses show broad regional patterns of positive trends in EVI, called "greening", alongside patterns of "browning", where trends are negative between 2000 and 2020. The coastal plain and foothills, up 1000 m, contain notable greening of the coastal Lomas and newly irrigated agricultural lands occurring alongside browning trends related to changes in land use practices and urban development. Strikingly, the precordilleras show a distinct 'greening strip', which extends from approximately 6 & DEG;S to 22 & DEG;S, with an altitudinal trend, ascending from the tropical lowlands (170-780 m) in northern Peru to the subtropics (1000-2800 m) in central Peru and temperate zone (2600-4300 m) in southern Peru and northern Chile. We find that the geographical characteristics of the greening strip do not match climate zones previously established by Koppen and Geiger. Greening and browning trends in the coastal deserts and the high Andes lie within well defined climatic and life zones, producing variable but identifiable trends. However, the distinct Pacific slope greening presents an unexpected distribution with respect to the regional Koppen-Geiger climate and life zones. This work provides insights on understanding the effects of climate change on Peru's diverse ecosystems in highly sensitive, biologically unique arid and semi-arid environments on the Pacific slope.

TI  - Choice of Solar Spectral Irradiance Model for Current and Future Remote Sensing Satellite Missions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of surface reflectance estimation for satellite sensors using radiance-based calibrations can depend significantly on the choice of solar spectral irradiance (or solar spectrum) model used for atmospheric correction. Selecting an accurate solar spectrum model is also important for radiance-based sensor calibration and estimation of atmospheric parameters from irradiance observations. Previous research showed that Landsat 8 could be used to evaluate the quality of solar spectrum models. This paper applies the analysis using five previously evaluated and three more recent solar spectrum models using both Landsat 8 (OLI) and Landsat 9 (OLI2). The study was further extended down to 10 nm resolution and a wavelength range from Ultraviolet A (UVA) to shortwave infrared (SWIR) (370-2480 nm) using inversion of field irradiance measurements. The results using OLI and OLI2 as well as the inversion of irradiance measurements were that the more recent Chance and Kurucz (SA2010), Meftah (SOLAR-ISS) and Coddington (TSIS-1) models performed better than all of the previous models. The results were illustrated by simulating dark and bright surface reflectance signatures obtained by atmospheric correction with the different solar spectrum models. The results showed that if the SA2010 model is assumed to be the "true" solar irradiance, using the TSIS-1 or the SOLAR-ISS model will not significantly change the estimated ground reflectance. The other models differ (some to a large extent) in varying wavelength areas.

TI  - Adaptive Speckle Filter for Multi-Temporal PolSAR Image with Multi-Dimensional Information Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) is an important sensor for earth observation. Multi-temporal PolSAR images obtained by successive observations of the region of interest contain rich polarimetric-temporal-spatial information of the land covers, which has wide applications. Speckle filtering becomes a necessary pre-processing for many subsequent applications. Currently, it is common to filter multi-temporal PolSAR data by directly using a speckle filter developed for single SAR or PolSAR data. The cross-correlation between different time series contains rich information in multi-temporal PolSAR images. How to utilize complete polarimetric-temporal-spatial information becomes a large challenge to achieve more satisfied performances of speckle reduction and details preservation simultaneously. This work dedicates to this issue and develops a novel speckle filtering approach for multi-temporal PolSAR data by multi-dimensional information fusion. The core idea is to establish an adaptive and efficient strategy of similar pixel selection based on the similarity test of multi-temporal polarimetric covariance matrices. This similar pixel selection scheme fuses the complete information of multi-temporal PolSAR data. The sensitivity of the proposed scheme is demonstrated with several typical and challenging texture patterns. Then, an adaptive speckle filter is established specifically for multi-temporal PolSAR data. Intensive comparison studies are carried out with airborne UAVSAR datasets and spaceborne ALOS/PALSAR datasets. Quantitative investigations in terms of the equivalent number of looks (ENL) and the figure of merit (FOM) indexes demonstrate and validate the superiority of the proposed method.

TI  - Combining Multi-Source Data and Feature Optimization for Plastic-Covered Greenhouse Extraction and Mapping Using the Google Earth Engine: A Case in Central Yunnan Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapidly increasing numbers of the plastic-covered greenhouse (PCG) worldwide ensure food security but threaten environmental security; thus, accurate monitoring of the spatiotemporal pattern in plastic-covered greenhouses (PCGs) is necessary for modern agricultural management and environmental protection. However, many urgent issues still exist in PCG mapping, such as multi-source data combination, classification accuracy improvement, spatiotemporal scale expansion, and dynamic trend quantification. To address these problems, this study proposed a new framework that progressed layer by layer from multi-feature scenario construction, classifier and feature scenario preliminary screening, feature optimization, and spatiotemporal mapping, to rapidly identify large-scale PCGs by integrating multi-source data using Google Earth Engine (GEE), and the framework was first applied to Central Yunnan Province (CYP), where PCGs are concentrated but no relevant research exists. The results suggested that: (1) combining the random forest (RF) classifier and spectrum (S) + backscatter (B) + index (I) + texture (T) + terrain (Tr) feature scenario produced the highest F-score (95.60%) and overall accuracy (88.04%). (2) The feature optimization for the S + I + T + B + Tr scenario positively impacted PCG recognition, increasing the average F-score by 1.03% (96.63% vs. 95.60%). (3) The 6-year average F-score of the PCGs extracted by the combined RF algorithm and the optimal feature subset exceeded 95.00%, and its spatiotemporal mapping results indicated that PCGs were prominently agglomerated in the central CYP and continuously expanded by an average of 65.45 km(2)/yr from 2016 to 2021. The research reveals that based on the GEE platform, multi-source data can be integrated through a feature optimization algorithm to more efficiently map PCG spatiotemporal information in complex regions.

TI  - Predicting Crop Growth Patterns with Spatial-Temporal Deep Feature Exploration for Early Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The timely and accurate mapping of crops over large areas is essential for alleviating food crises and formulating agricultural policies. However, most existing classical crop mapping methods usually require the whole-year historical time-series data that cannot respond quickly to the current planting information, let alone for future prediction. To address this issue, we propose a novel spatial-temporal feature and deep integration strategy for crop growth pattern prediction and early mapping (STPM). Specifically, the STPM first learns crop spatial-temporal evolving patterns from historical data to generate future remote sensing images based on the current observations. Then, a robust crop type recognition model is applied by combining the current early data with the predicted images for early crop mapping. Compared to existing spatial-temporal prediction models, our proposed model integrates local, global, and temporal multi-modal features comprehensively. Not only does it achieve the capability to predict longer sequence lengths (exceeding 100 days), but it also demonstrates a significant improvement in prediction accuracy for each time step. In addition, this paper analyses the impact of feature dimensionality and initial data length on prediction and early crop mapping accuracy, demonstrating the necessity of multi-modal feature fusion for spatial-temporal prediction of high-resolution remote sensing data and the benefits of longer initial time-series (i.e., longer crop planting time) for crop identification. In general, our method has the potential to carry out early crop mapping on a large scale and provide information to formulate changes in agricultural conditions promptly.

TI  - A Transformer-Based Framework for Parameter Learning of a Land Surface Hydrological Process Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The effective representation of land surface hydrological models strongly relies on spatially varying parameters that require calibration. Well-calibrated physical models can effectively propagate observed information to unobserved variables, but traditional calibration methods often result in nonunique solutions. In this paper, we propose a hydrological parameter calibration training framework consisting of a transformer-based parameter learning model (ParaFormer) and a surrogate model based on LSTM. On the one hand, ParaFormer utilizes self-attention mechanisms to learn a global mapping from observed data to the parameters to be calibrated, which captures spatial correlations. On the other hand, the surrogate model takes the calibrated parameters as inputs and simulates the observable variables, such as soil moisture, overcoming the challenges of directly combining complex hydrological models with a deep learning (DL) platform in a hybrid training scheme. Using the variable infiltration capacity model as the reference, we test the performance of ParaFormer on datasets of different resolutions. The results demonstrate that, in predicting soil moisture and transferring calibrated parameters in the task of evapotranspiration prediction, ParaFormer learns more effective and robust parameter mapping patterns compared to traditional and state-of-the-art DL-based parameter calibration methods.

TI  - Fusion Approaches to Individual Tree Species Classification Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the wide availability of remotely sensed data from various sensors, fusion-based tree species classification approaches have emerged as a prominent and ongoing research topic. However, most recent studies primarily focused on combining multisource data at the feature level, while few systematically examined their positive or negative contributions to tree species classification. This study aimed to investigate fusion approaches at the feature and decision levels deployed with support vector machine and random forest algorithms to classify five dominant tree species: Norway maple, honey locust, Austrian pine, white spruce, and blue spruce in individual crowns. Spectral, textural, and structural features derived from multispectral imagery (MSI), a very high-resolution panchromatic image (PAN), and LiDAR data were systematically exploited to assess their contributions to accurate classifications. Among the various classification schemes that were explored, both feature- and decision-level fusion approaches demonstrated significant improvements in tree species classification compared with the utilization of MSI (0.7), PAN (0.74), or LiDAR (0.8) in isolation. Notably, the decision-level fusion approach achieved the highest overall accuracies (0.86 for SVM and 0.84 for RF) and kappa coefficients (0.82 for SVM and 0.79 for RF). The misclassification analysis of fusion approaches highlighted the potential and flexibility of decision-level fusion in tree species classification.

TI  - Scale Effect of Land Cover Classification from Multi-Resolution Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover data are important basic data for earth system science and other fields. Multi-source remote sensing images have become the main data source for land cover classification. There are still many uncertainties in the scale effect of image spatial resolution on land cover classification. Since it is difficult to obtain multiple spatial resolution remote sensing images of the same area at the same time, the main current method to study the scale effect of land cover classification is to use the same image resampled to different resolutions, however errors in the resampling process lead to uncertainty in the accuracy of land cover classification. To study the land cover classification scale effect of different spatial resolutions of multi-source remote sensing data, we selected 1 m and 4 m of GF-2, 6 m of SPOT-6, 10 m of Sentinel-2, and 30 m of Landsat-8 multi-sensor data, and explored the scale effect of image spatial resolution on land cover classification from two aspects of mixed image element decomposition and spatial heterogeneity. For the study area, we compared the classification obtained from GF-2, SPOT-6, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 images at different spatial resolutions based on GBDT and RF. The results show that (1) GF-2 and SPOT-6 had the best classification results, and the optimal scale based on this classification accuracy was 4-6 m; (2) the optimal scale based on linear decomposition depended on the study area; (3) the optimal scale of land cover was related to spatial heterogeneity, i.e., the more fragmented and complex was the space, the smaller the scale needed; and (4) the resampled images were not sensitive to scale and increased the uncertainty of the classification. These findings have implications for land cover classification and optimal scale selection, scale effects, and landscape ecology uncertainty studies.

TI  - Comparison of Different Important Predictors and Models for Estimating Large-Scale Biomass of Rubber Plantations in Hainan Island, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis Muell.) plantations are among the most critical agricultural ecosystems in tropical regions, playing a vital role in regional carbon balance. Accurate large-scale biomass estimation for these plantations remains a challenging task due to the severe signal saturation problem. Recent advances in remote sensing big data, cloud platforms, and machine learning have facilitated the precise acquisition of key physiological variables, such as stand age (A) and canopy height (H), which are critical parameters for biomass estimation but have been underutilized in prior studies. Using Hainan Island-the second-largest rubber planting base in China-as a case study, we integrated extensive ground surveys, maps of stand age and canopy height, remote sensing indicators (RSIs), and geographical and climate indicators (ECIs) to ascertain the optimal method for estimating rubber plantation biomass. We compared different inputs and estimation approaches (direct and indirect) using the random forest algorithm and analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of rubber plantation biomass on Hainan Island. The results indicated that the traditional model (RSIs + ECIs) had low accuracy and significant estimation bias (R-2 = 0.24, RMSE = 38.36 mg/ha). The addition of either stand age or canopy height considerably enhance model accuracy (R-2 = 0.77, RMSE & AP; 21.12 mg/ha). Moreover, incorporating the DBH obtained through indirect inversion yielded even greater predictive accuracy (R-2 = 0.97, RMSE = 7.73 mg/ha), outperforming estimates derived from an allometric equation model input with the DBH (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 25.43 mg/ha). However, augmenting the model with stand age, canopy height, or their combination based on RSIs, ECIs, and DBH only marginally improved the accuracy. Consequently, it is not recommended in scenarios with limited data and computing resources. Employing the optimal model, we generated biomass maps of rubber plantations on Hainan Island for 2016 and 2020, revealing that the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of the biomass is closely associated with the establishment year of the rubber plantations. While average biomass in a few areas has undergone slight decreases, total biomass has exhibited significant growth, reaching 5.46 x 10(7) mg by the end of 2020, underscoring its considerable value as a carbon sink.

TI  - Large Scale Crop Water Footprint Evaluation Based on Remote Sensing Methods: A Case Study of Maize
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is the world's largest consumer of water resources, and accurate measurement of crop water footprint (CWF) can provide a scientific basis for evaluating the water use characteristics of agricultural production and guiding water management. The measurement of regional CWF requires large amounts of ground data, and remote sensing provides an effective means to scientifically measure the CWF on a large scale. In this study, we developed an effective means to estimate regional maize CWF based on global evapotranspiration (MOD16 and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)-Noah) products in China. And we also calculated the CWF based on the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (FAO-PM) on the site scale in China. We assessed the accuracy of these methods by comparing them against eight eddy-covariance based flux tower measurements. Links and differences behind the results of the three water footprint calculations were analyzed in terms of the basic principles and characteristics of the calculations. The results showed that the CWF had a similar distribution based on the MOD16 and GLDAS-Noah, reflecting the influence of regional soil moisture on the CWF. Computational rationale analysis of the three quantitative methods showed that the ETc-based method from the FAO-PM model was similar to the MOD16- and GLDAS-Noah-based CWF in the wetter areas, two remote sensing-based methods considered the water constraints during soil evaporation and water dissipation during dry and wet canopy conditions, and were closer to reality than the ETc-based methods in measuring the CWF in arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Identifying Potential Landslides in Steep Mountainous Areas Based on Improved Seasonal Interferometry Stacking-InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a major concern in the mountainous regions of southwest China, leading to significant loss of life and property damage. Therefore, it is crucial to identify potential landslides for early warning and mitigation. stacking-InSAR, a technique used for landslide identification in a wide area, has been found to be faster than conventional time-series InSAR. However, the dense vegetation in southwest China mountains has an adverse impact on the coherence of stacking-InSAR, resulting in more noise and inaccuracies in landslide identification. To address this problem, this paper proposes an improved seasonal interferometry stacking-InSAR method. It uses Sentinel-1 satellite data from 2017 to 2022. The study area is the river valley section of the G213 road from Wenchuan County to Mao County. The study reveals the characteristics of seasonal decoherence in the steep mountainous region, and identifies a total of 21 potential landslides using the improved method. Additionally, optical satellite imagery and LiDAR data were used to assist in the identification of potential landslides. The results of the conventional stacking-InSAR method and the improved seasonal interferometry stacking-InSAR method are compared, showing that the latter is more effective in noise suppression caused by low coherence. Their standard deviations were reduced by 46%, 22%, 10%, and 14%, respectively, using the quantitative statistics for the four tested areas. The proposed method provides an efficient and effective approach for detecting potential landslides in the mountainous regions of southwest China. It can serve as a valuable technical reference for future landslide identification studies in this area.

TI  - Local Climate Zone Classification Using Daytime Zhuhai-1 Hyperspectral Imagery and Nighttime Light Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The tremendous advancement of cities has caused changes to the urban subsurface. Urban climate problems have become increasingly prominent, especially with regard to the intensification of the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The local climate zone (LCZ) is a new quantitative method for analyzing urban climate that is based on the kind of urban surface and can effectively deal with the problem of the hazy distinction between urban and rural areas in UHI effect research. LCZs are widely used in regional climate modeling, urban planning, and thermal comfort surveys. Existing large-scale LCZ classification methods usually use visual features of optical images, such as spectral and textural features. There are many problems with hyperspectral LCZ extraction over large areas. LCZ is an integrated concept that includes features of the geography, society, and economy. Consequently, it makes sense to consider the characteristics of human activity and the visual features of the images to interpret them accurately. ALOS_DEM data can depict the city's physical characteristics; however, images of nighttime lights are crucial indicators of human activity. These three datasets can be used in combination to portray the urban environment. Therefore, this study proposes a method for fusing daytime and nighttime data for LCZ mapping, i.e., fusing daytime Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral images and their derived feature indices, ALOS_DEM data, and nighttime light data from Luojia-1. By combining daytime and nighttime information, the proposed approach captures the temporal dynamics of urban areas, providing a more complete representation of their characteristics. The integration of the data allows for a more refined identification and characterization of urban land cover. It comprehensively integrates daytime and nighttime data, exploits synergistic information from multiple sources, and provides higher accuracy and resolution for LCZ mapping. First, we extracted various features, namely spectral, red-edge, and textural features, from the Zhuhai-1 images, ALOS_DEM data, and nighttime light data from Luojia-1. Random forest (RF) and XGBoost classifiers were used, and the average impurity reduction method was employed to assess the significance of the variables. All the input variables were optimized to select the best combination of variables. The results from a study of the 5th ring road area of Beijing, China, revealed that the technique achieved LCZ mapping with good precision, with a total accuracy of 87.34%. In addition, to examine and contrast the effects of various feature indices on the LCZ classification accuracy, feature combination methods were used. The results of the study showed that the accuracies of LCZ classification in terms of spectral and textural were improved by 2.33% and 2.19% using the RF classifier, respectively. The radiation brightness value (RBV) (GI value = 0.0212) attained the classification's highest variable importance value; the DEM also produced a high GI value (0.0159), indicating that night lighting and landform features strongly influence LCZ classification.

TI  - Semi-empirical models for remote estimating colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in a productive tropical estuary
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland waters are important components of the global carbon cycle as they regulate the flow of terrestrial carbon to the oceans. In this context, remote monitoring of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) allows for analyzing the carbon content in aquatic systems. In this study, we develop semi-empirical models for remote estimation of the CDOM absorption coefficient at 400 nm (a(CDOM)) in a tropical estuarine-lagunar productive system using spectral reflectance data. Two-band ratio models usually work well for this task, but studies have added more bands to the models to reduce interfering signals, so in addition to the two-band ratio models, we tested three- and four-band ratios. We used a genetic algorithm (GA) to search for the best combination of bands, and found that adding more bands did not provide performance gains, showing that the proper choice of bands is more important. NIR-Green models outperformed Red-Blue models. A two-band NIR-Green model showed the best results (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 0.22 m(-1), and MAPE = 5.85%) using field hyperspectral data. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential application for Sentinel-2 bands, especially using the B5/B3, Log(B5/B3) and Log(B6/B2) band ratios. However, it is still necessary to further explore the influence of atmospheric correction (AC) to estimate the a(CDOM) using satellite data.

TI  - Predicting Carbonate Chemistry on the Northwest Atlantic Shelf Using Neural Networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Northwest Atlantic Shelf (NAS) region has experienced accelerated warming, heatwaves, and is susceptible to ocean acidification, yet also suffers from a paucity of carbonate chemistry observations, particularly at depth. We address this critical data gap by developing three different neural network models to predict dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) in the NAS region from more readily available hydrographic and satellite data. The models predicted DIC with r (2) between 0.913-0.963 and root mean square errors (RMSE) between 15.4-23.7 (mu mol kg(-1)) and TA with r (2) between 0.986-0.983 and RMSE between 9.0-10.4 (mu mol kg(-1)) on an unseen test data set that was not used in training the models. Cross-validation analysis revealed that all models were insensitive to the choice of training data and had good generalization performance on unseen data. Uncertainty in DIC and TA were low (coefficients of variation 0.1%-1%). Compared with other predictive models of carbonate system variables in this region, a larger and more diverse data set with full seasonal coverage and a more sophisticated model architecture resulted in a robust predictive model with higher accuracy and precision across all seasons. We used one of the models to generate a reconstructed seasonal distribution of carbonate chemistry fields based on DIC and TA predictions that shows a clear seasonal progression and large spatial gradients consistent with observations. The distinct models will allow for a range of applications based on the predictor variables available and will be useful to understand and address ocean sustainability challenges.Plain Language Summary The U.S. northeast coast is particularly susceptible to climate change and ocean acidification. However, the lack of observations on seawater carbonate chemistry makes it difficult to assess the impacts of ocean acidification on the region. We address this information gap by developing three different machine learning models to predict carbonate system parameters from more readily available field and satellite data. The models predicted carbonate system parameters with high accuracy and good precision. Compared with other models of carbonate chemistry variables for this region, a larger data set with full seasonal and vertical coverage of the water column and a more complex model architecture resulted in a robust model with low error and uncertainty across all four seasons as well as in surface and subsurface waters. The reconstructed distributions of carbonate chemistry fields on U.S. northeast coast based on one of the models were consistent with observations. We anticipate that the distinct versions of the model will allow for a wide range of different applications based on the predictor variables that are available.

TI  - MS-AGAN: Road Extraction via Multi-Scale Information Fusion and Asymmetric Generative Adversarial Networks from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images under Complex Backgrounds
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extracting roads from remote sensing images is of significant importance for automatic road network updating, urban planning, and construction. However, various factors in complex scenes (e.g., high vegetation coverage occlusions) may lead to fragmentation in the extracted road networks and also affect the robustness of road extraction methods. This study proposes a multi-scale road extraction method with asymmetric generative adversarial learning (MS-AGAN). First, we design an asymmetric GAN with a multi-scale feature encoder to better utilize the context information in high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs). Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and feature fusion are integrated into the asymmetric encoder-decoder structure to avoid feature redundancy caused by multi-level cascading operations and enhance the generator network's ability to extract fine-grained road information at the pixel level. Second, to maintain road connectivity, topologic features are considered in the pixel segmentation process. A linear structural similarity loss (LSSIM) is introduced into the loss function of MS-AGAN, which guides MS-AGAN to generate more accurate segmentation results. Finally, to fairly evaluate the performance of deep models under complex backgrounds, the Bayesian error rate (BER) is introduced into the field of road extraction for the first time. Experiments are conducted via Gaofen-2 (GF-2) high-resolution remote sensing images with high vegetation coverage in the Daxing District of Beijing, China, and the public DeepGlobe dataset. The performance of MS-AGAN is compared with a list of advanced models, including RCFSNet, CoANet, UNet, DeepLabV3+, and DiResNet. The final results show that (1) with respect to road extraction performance, the Recall, F1, and IoU values of MS-AGAN on the Daxing dataset are 2.17%, 0.04%, and 2.63% higher than the baselines. On DeepGlobe, the Recall, F1, and IoU of MS-AGAN improve by 1.12%, 0.42%, and 0.25%, respectively. (2) On road connectivity, the Conn index of MS-AGAN from the Daxing dataset is 46.39%, with an improvement of 0.62% over the baselines, and the Conn index of MS-AGAN on DeepGlobe is 70.08%, holding an improvement of 1.73% over CoANet. The quantitative and qualitative analyses both demonstrate the superiority of MS-AGAN in preserving road connectivity. (3) In particular, the BER of MS-AGAN is 20.86% over the Daxing dataset with a 0.22% decrease compared to the best baselines and 11.77% on DeepGlobe with a 0.85% decrease compared to the best baselines. The proposed MS-AGAN provides an efficient, cost-effective, and reliable method for the dynamic updating of road networks via HRSIs.

TI  - Relating weather radar data to migrating waterfowl abundance in the Rainwater Basin of Nebraska.
T2  - Journal of Wildlife Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Waterfowl migrations are large-scale events that involve millions of birds moving over broad geographic extents, which make them difficult to quantify and study. Historically, wildlife managers have relied mostly on field surveys, such as visual counts from the ground or air that sample at small spatial or temporal extents, or both. Combining field surveys with remote sensing data comprehensively collected over large spatial extents at high temporal frequency may improve the study of migrating waterfowl distributions. We tested the strength of the relationship between broad-scale weather surveillance radar data and fine-scale field surveys of waterfowl abundance at wetlands within the Rainwater Basin of Nebraska, USA, from 2017-2019. Radar reflectivity of waterfowl at the peak exodus of evening flights was positively correlated with diurnal waterfowl count data, although there was unexplained variation in the relationship. The association was also very similar across various time scales ranging from daily to monthly averages of waterfowl abundance. We suggest that human-based ground surveys can calibrate and leverage more comprehensive remote sensing data to get a broad understanding of waterfowl distributions during migration. Several confounding factors, such as spatial displacement between radar and survey observation, individual variation in orientation and body size, and identification of avian species sampled by radar, remain on the path to improving radar-based waterfowl estimates.

TI  - Applicability Assessment of Multi-Source DEM-Assisted InSAR Deformation Monitoring Considering Two Topographical Features
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The high-precision digital elevation model (DEM) is of great significance for improving the accuracy of InSAR deformation monitoring. In today's free opening of multi-source DEM, there is no consensus on how to select suitable DEMs to assist InSAR in deformation monitoring for different landforms. This article introduces five types of DEMs: ALOS12.5, SRTM-1, ASTER V3, AW3D30, and Copernicus 30, and uses SBAS-InSAR technology to analyze the applicability of deformation monitoring in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and Central China Plain regions. The coverage, average value, standard deviation, and unwrapping efficiency of the phase unwrapping results, the temporal deformation rate curves of six random deformation points in the key deformation area, as well as the consistency with the second-level data and the comparative analysis of RMSE of all deformation points, show that in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau region, Copernicus 30 is the best, followed by ASTER V3, AW3D30, and SRTM-1 having low accuracy, and ALOS12.5 is the worst. In the Central China Plain region, AW3D30 is the best, followed by Copernicus 30, SRTM-1, and ASTER V3 having low accuracy, and ALOS12.5 is still the worst. Although ALOS12.5 has the highest resolution, it is not recommended for deformation monitoring based on its worst performance in plateau and plain areas. It is recommended to use Copernicus 30 in plateau areas and AW3D30 for deformation monitoring in plain areas.

TI  - Identification of sentinel lymph nodes in esophageal cancer patients using contrast-enhanced EUS with peritumoral injections
T2  - ENDOSCOPIC ULTRASOUND
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesThe objective of this pilot study was to compare the performance of contrast-enhanced EUS (CE-EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with EUS-FNA for lymph node (LN) staging in esophageal cancer.MethodsThirty-seven subjects with esophageal cancer undergoing EUS staging were enrolled, and 30 completed this institutional review board-approved study. A Prosound F75 US system (Hitachi Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) with harmonic contrast imaging software and GF-UCT180 curvilinear endoscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was utilized. All LNs identified by standard EUS were first noted. Sonazoid (dose: 1 mL; GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway) was administered peritumorally, and all enhanced LNs were recorded. Fine-needle aspiration was performed on LNs considered suspicious by EUS alone, as well as LNs enhanced on CE-EUS. Performance of each modality was compared using FNA cytology as reference standard.ResultsA total of 132 LNs were detected with EUS, of which 59 showed enhancement on CE-EUS. Fifty-three LNs underwent FNA, and 22 LNs were determined to be malignant. Among the latter, 10 were considered suspicious by EUS, whereas the other 12 LNs underwent FNA only because of CE-EUS enhancement. Contrast-enhanced EUS showed enhancement in 19 of the 22 malignant LNs. The rate of metastatic node identification from EUS was 45% (10/22), and it was 86% (19/22; P = 0.008) for CE-EUS. Eight subjects (8/30 [27% of study total]) had nodal status upgraded by the addition of CE-EUS, which influenced LN staging and clinical management.ConclusionsFine-needle aspiration of LNs identified by CE-EUS may increase metastasis positive rate by ruling out LNs not associated with the tumor drainage pattern. In addition, CE-EUS seems to identify more metastatic LNs that would not be biopsied under the standard EUS criteria.

TI  - Recent Advances and Challenges in Schumann Resonance Observations and Research
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The theoretical development of Schumann Resonances has spanned more than a century as a form of global natural electromagnetic resonances. In recent years, with the development of electromagnetic detection technology and the improvement in digital processing capabilities, the connection between Schumann Resonances and natural phenomena, such as lightning, earthquakes, and Earth's climate, has been experimentally and theoretically demonstrated. This article is a review of the relevant literature on Schumann Resonance observation experiments, theoretical research over the years, and a prospect based on space-based observations. We start with the theoretical background and the main content on Schumann Resonances. Then, observations and the identification of Schumann Resonance signals based on ground and satellite data are introduced. The research and related applications of Schumann Resonances signals are summarized in terms of lightning, earthquakes, and atmosphere. Finally, the paper presents a brief study of Schumann Resonances based on the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES) and preliminary ideas about how to improve the identification and application of space-based Schumann Resonances signals.

TI  - Forest Canopy Water Content Monitoring Using Radiative Transfer Models and Machine Learning
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are facing various threats, such as drought, in the context of global climate change. Canopy water content (CWC) is a crucial indicator of forest water stress, mortality, and fire monitoring. However, previous studies on CWC have not adequately simulated forests with heterogeneous and discontinuous canopy structures. At the same time, there is a lack of field validation. This study retrieved the forest CWC across the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) with coupled radiative transfer models (RTMs) and the random forest (RF) algorithm. A Gaussian copula and prior knowledge were used for model parameterization. The results indicated that more accurate simulations of leaf trait dependencies and canopy structure characteristics lead to better CWC inversion. In addition, GeoSail, coupled with PROSPECT-5B, showed good performance (R-2 = 0.68, RMSE = 0.15 kg m(-2), MAE = 0.12 kg m(-2), rRMSE = 12.78%, Bias = -0.036 kg m(-2)) for forest CWC retrieval. Large variation existed in forest CWC, spatiotemporally, and evergreen needle forest (ENF) showed strong CWC capacity. This study underscores the suitability of 3D RTMs for inversing the parameters of forest canopies.

TI  - Analysis of signal-to-noise ratio retrieved from multi-GNSS satellite data of land surface reflections
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The reflection of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, known as GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R), has made significant progress in monitoring ocean and land surface geophysical parameters. The main purpose of this investigation is to analyze the impact of antenna gain, land surface properties, and coherent integration time on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of multi-GNSS reflected signals using complex waveform (CW) products generated by the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) constellation recording multi-GNSS raw intermediate frequency (IF) data. For different GNSS constellations, CYGNSS antenna gain of 6-9 dB can achieve an SNR of 0 dB or more over most pan-tropical regions. The normalized SNR (NSNR) calculated by the calibration procedure is used for such analysis. The results show that the coherent reflection caused the largest NSNR by the inland water body, and NSNR from the GPS reflected signal is about 2 dB and 4 dB larger than Galileo and BDS, respectively, whereas the dense vegetation caused a strong attenuation of the reflected signal and resulted in the smallest NSNR. Different GNSS systems have similar sensitivity to roughness coefficient (RC). In contrast, different GNSS constellations exhibit different sensitivities for moderate soil moisture (SM), the NSNR increases for GPS, BDS, and Galileo are estimated by linear fitting to be 4.85 dB, 7.67 dB, and 8.73 dB, respectively. NSNR gradually increases with above-ground biomass (AGB) when AGB is less than 100 Mg/ha, which seems to be the threshold for signals to penetrate the sparse vegetation and sense SM under the vegetation. However, when AGB is greater than 100 Mg/ha, the opposite is true. Furthermore, NSNR can be improved by longer coherent integration time, the average improvement in NSNR is about 1.5 dB with 2 ms coherent integration time and approximately 3 dB with 4 ms coherent integration time.

TI  - HIV-Related Knowledge and Sexual Behaviors among Teenagers: Implications for Public Health Interventions
T2  - CHILDREN-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Teenagers are at a turning point in people's physical and psychological maturity and are also in a critical period in reproductive and sexual health. It is reported that the initial age at first sexual behavior is younger than decades ago, which implies that the risky sexual behavior among teenagers may be on the rise. However, it is unclear about the changes of sexual knowledge and behaviors in recent years. Methods: Based on the national sentinel surveillance survey in 2011-2021 among students in Hangzhou, we selected out teenagers aged 10-19 years as our study sample. Demographic characteristics (gender, age, marital status, etc.), knowledge of HIV and sexual behaviors were collected. The sexual knowledge score and sexual behaviors were analyzed, and their influencing factors were explored. Results: In total, 1355 teenagers were incorporated in this study; the awareness rates of sexual knowledge in 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2021 were 74.9%, 71.8%, 89.3% and 95.8%, respectively, which showed an overall upward trend. The results of binary logistic regression showed that the survey year, whether students had received and participated in HIV-related publicity services and whether they had sexual behaviors, had a significant influence on whether the awareness rate & GE; 75%. The survey year and whether the awareness rate & GE; 75% had a significant influence on whether students had sexual behaviors. Conclusions: Both the average scores and awareness rates of teenagers' sexual knowledge showed an overall upward trend from 2011 to 2021. Teenagers' initial sexual behavior was at a low age, and the proportion of teenagers who had fixed, temporary and commercial heterosexual sex was still relatively high despite no significant increasing. Therefore, we should further strengthen health education on the risks of sexual behaviors from schools, families and health-related institutions to ensure teenagers receive HIV-related publicity services.

M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological models play an important role in water resources management and extreme events forecasting, and they are sensitive to the underlying conditions. This study aims to evaluate the impact of different soil-type maps and land-use maps on hydrological simulations and watershed responses by applying the WRF-Hydro (Weather Research and Forecasting Model Hydrological modeling system) distributed hydrological model to the Xijiang River basin. WRF-Hydro runs for four different scenarios for the period 1992-2013. FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) and GSDE (Global soil-type maps and land-use maps are freely combined to form four scenarios. It is found that soil moisture and surface runoff are sensitive to soil-type maps, and absorbed shortwave radiation is found to be the least sensitive to soil-type maps. Absorbed shortwave radiation and heat flux are sensitive to land-use maps. The model performance of simulating soil moisture has increased when the soil-type map changes from FAO to GSDE and the land-use map changes from MODIS to CNLUCC for most stations. When the soil-type map changes from FAO to GSDE and the land-use map changes from MODIS to CNLUCC, the biases of simulating streamflow decrease. This study shows that the performance of the offline WRF-Hydro is significantly influenced by soil-type and land-use maps, and better simulation results can be obtained with more realistic underlying surface maps.

TI  - Using remote sensing technology to monitor salt lake changes caused by climate change and melting glaciers: insights from Zabuye Salt Lake in Xizang
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Zabuye Salt Lake (ZSL) in Xizang is the only saline lake in the world with natural crystalline lithium carbonate. As it is an important lithium production base in China, any changes of this lake are concerning. Global climate change (CC) has affected the hydrological conditions of glaciers, lakes, and ecosystems in the Tibetan Plateau (TP). With the aim of monitoring dynamic hydrological changes in ZSL and Lunggar Glaciers (LG) to identify factors governing lake changes, and to estimate the potential damage to grasslands and salt pans, Landsat remote sensing (RS) and meteorological data were used to do a series of experiments and analysis. Firstly, according to the spectral characteristics (SC), salt lake, glaciers, grasslands, and salt pans around the salt lake were extracted by band calculation (BC). Secondly, basin and water areas of the expanded lake were estimated using a shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM). Thirdly, comprehensive analyses of lake and glacier area changes, and regional meteorological factors (annual average temperature, annual precipitation, and evaporation) were performed, and the results show that ZSL expanded at a rate of 5.28 km2/a, it is likely to continue expanding. Expansion was closely related to the large-scale melting of a glacier caused by rising temperatures. Continued lake expansion (LE) will exert different effects on surrounding grasslands and salt pans, 7.84 km2 of grassland and 2.7 km2 of salt pan will be submerged with every meter of water increase in the lake. Similar prediction methods was used to monitor other lakes on the TP. Mami Co, Selin Co, and Chaerhan salt lakes all expanded at different rates, and may potentially cause different levels of potential harm to surrounding grasslands and roads. Our study contributes to salt lake research and demonstrates the superiority of RS technology for monitoring saline lakes.

TI  - Variations in Global Soil Moisture During the Past Decades: Climate or Human Causes?
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As a sensitive climate change indicator, global multi-depth soil moisture (SM) has undergone great variation due to warming trends during the past decades. Here, we investigate the evolutionary pattern of SM and then carry out an attribution analysis from climate and human perspectives. The results reveal an unbalanced surface and rootzone variation trend during 1980-2020. The surface soil had approximately equal proportions of drying and wetting. Nonetheless, the percentage of the wetting region is significantly higher than that of the drying region for rootzone soil. The significantly drying region is mainly distributed in habitable areas, while the remarkably wetting region is usually located in the harsh climate and tropical humid zones. According to the attribution analysis using the Feature Importance Index of the Random Forest model, Pearson correlation coefficient, Maximum information coefficient, Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and Granger causality with 99% statistical significance, both climatic and human factors presented significant impacts on SM. Specifically, air temperature and evaporation are thought to be the primary climatic factors affecting the seasonal and long-term variability of SM, respectively. Irrigation water withdrawal is regarded as the dominant driving force of SM variation among six human water withdrawals, and domestic and electricity water withdrawals play indispensable roles in SM fluctuation. Additionally, SM also provides profound feedbacks on climatic factors and human water withdrawals. The global spatial-temporal SM variation along with warming temperatures could seriously risk food security and sustainable development, which needs to be addressed.

TI  - Multi-Source SAR-Based Surface Deformation Monitoring and Groundwater Relationship Analysis in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land motions are significantly widespread in the Yellow River delta (YRD). There is, however, a lack of understanding of the delta-wide comprehensive deformation mode and its dynamic mechanism, especially triggered by groundwater extraction. This paper adopts an integrated analysis of multidisciplinary data of image geodesy, geophysics, geology and hydrogeology to provide insights into Earth surface displacement patterns and dynamics in the YRD. Delta-scale land motions were measured for the first time using L-band ALOS images processed using multi-temporal InSAR, illustrating multiple obvious surface sinking regions and a maximum annual subsidence velocity of up to 130 mm. Then, the InSAR-constrained distributed point source model with optimal kernel parameters, a smoothness factor of 10 and a model grid size of 300 m was established and confirmed to be rational, reliable and accurate for modeling analysis over the YRD. Remarkable horizontal surface displacements, moving towards and converging on a sinking center, were recovered by means of modeling and measured using InSAR, with a maximum rate of up to 60 mm per year, which can trigger significant disasters, such as ground fissures and building damage. In addition, the annual total water storage variation at the delta scale, the most meaningful outcome, can be calculated and reaches a total of approximately 12,010 x 10(3) m(3) in Guangrao city, efficiently filling the gap of GRACE and in situ investigations for delta-wide aquifer monitoring. Finally, a comparative analysis of time series InSAR measurements, modeling outcomes, and fault and groundwater data was conducted, and the strong agreement demonstrates that faults control aquifer distribution and hence the spatial distribution of groundwater-withdrawal-related regional land subsidence. Moreover, the obvious asymmetric displacements, demonstrating a northeasterly displacement trend, further reveal that faults control aquifer distribution and Earth surface deformation. These findings are useful for understanding the land motion patterns and dynamics, helping to sustainably manage groundwater and control disasters in the YRD and elsewhere worldwide.

TI  - Crop Type Mapping Based on Polarization Information of Time Series Sentinel-1 Images Using Patch-Based Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale crop mapping is of fundamental importance to tackle food security problems. SAR remote sensing has lately received great attention for crop type mapping due to its stability in the revisit cycle and is not hindered by cloud cover. However, most SAR image-classification studies focused on the application of backscattering characteristics with machine learning models, while few investigated the potential of the polarization decomposition and deep-learning models. This study investigated whether the radar polarization information mined by polarization decomposition, the patch strategy and the approaches for combining recurrent and convolutional neural networks (Conv2d + LSTM and ConvLSTM2d) could effectively improve the accuracy of crop type mapping. Sentinel-1 SLC and GRD products in 2020 were collected as data sources to extract VH, VV, VH/VV, VV + VH, Entropy, Anisotropy, and Alpha 7-dimensional features for classification. The results showed that the three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (Conv3d) was the best classifier with an accuracy and kappa up to 88.9% and 0.875, respectively, and the ConvLSTM2d and Conv2d + LSTM achieved the second and third position. Compared to backscatter coefficients, the polarization decomposition features could provide additional phase information for classification in the time dimension. The optimal patch size was 17, and the patch-based Conv3d outperformed the pixel-based Conv1d by 11.3% in accuracy and 0.128 in kappa. This study demonstrated the value of applying polarization decomposition features to deep-learning models and provided a strong technical support to efficient large-scale crop mapping.

TI  - Evaluation of Post-Tunneling Aging Buildings Using the InSAR Nonuniform Settlement Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tunneling work, including the construction of municipal tunnels and metro lines, may disturb the structural health of aging buildings in densely built urban areas. Deformation monitoring and risk assessments of aging buildings are crucial to mitigate incidents and prevent losses of people's lives and properties. Time-series InSAR reveals spatio-temporal information about observed targets by extracting persistent scatterers of the structures, which can achieve the wide-range monitoring of buildings and infrastructure. However, solely relying on InSAR-derived general parameters (deformation rates and time series of specific points) cannot objectively assess the safety conditions of buildings. To address this issue, this study proposes an InSAR Nonuniform Settlement Index. First, the point targets of buildings are extracted through time-series InSAR processing. Then, using the points as inputs, the Nonuniform Settlement Index calculates the 3D settlement plane and the inclination angle of the plane corresponding to each building. In this way, the proposed Nonuniform Settlement Index acts as a subsequent analysis method of time-series InSAR to characterize the safety statuses of buildings. In our study, 147 scenes of COSMO-SkyMed images from 2013 to 2022 were used to inverse the nine-year deformation evolution of the tested area. After time-series InSAR processing and index analysis based on the above SAR datasets, cross-validation was implemented with static-level and manual investigation data. The approach was to use one aging, collapsed building affected by tunneling work, as well as the eight adjacent aging buildings. The results showed high consistency with the in situ data, which proves the efficiency of the proposed approach.

TI  - Surface Water Quality Assessment through Remote Sensing Based on the Box-Cox Transformation and Linear Regression
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - A methodology to estimate surface water quality using remote sensing is presented based on Landsat satellite imagery and in situ measurements taken every six months at four separate sampling locations in a tropical reservoir from 2015 to 2019. The remote sensing methodology uses the Box-Cox transformation model to normalize data on three water quality parameters: total organic carbon (TOC), total dissolved solids (TDS), and chlorophyll a (Chl-a). After the Box-Cox transformation, a mathematical model was generated for every parameter using multiple linear regression to correlate normalized data and spectral reflectance from Landsat 8 imagery. Then, significant testing was conducted to discard spectral bands that did not show a statistically significant response (& alpha; = 0.05) from the different water quality models. The r(2) values achieved for TOC, TDS, and Chl-a water quality models after the band discrimination process were found 0.926, 0.875, and 0.810, respectively, achieving a fair fitting to real water quality data measurements. Finally, a comparison between estimated and measured water quality values not previously used for model development was carried out to validate these models. In this validation process, a good fit of 98% and 93% was obtained for TDS and TOC, respectively, whereas an acceptable fit of 81% was obtained for Chl-a. This study proposes an interesting alternative for ordered and standardized steps applied to generate mathematical models for the estimation of TOC, TDS, and Chl-a based on water quality parameters measured in the field and using satellite images.

TI  - Identifying the Driving Forces of Alpine Wetland Dynamic Changes in the Yellow River Source National Park from 2000 to 2020
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow River Source National Park (YRSNP), one of largest alpine wetlands in China which serves as the origin of the Yellow River, is situated in the heart of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The alpine wetland ecosystem, which is its primary ecological system, is crucial for maintaining ecological balance, preserving biodiversity, and facilitating the sustainable development of the Yellow River Basin. In this study, based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform combined with Landsat 5 7 8 remote sensing images, we used a random forest classification model to identify and classify the alpine wetland from 2000 to 2020 and analyze its pattern of dynamic changes. The main driving forces that drive the change of the alpine wetland area in the YRSNP from 2000 to 2020 are identified using a random forest regression analysis in combination with data on precipitation, temperature, potential evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and population density. The results show that: (1) From 2000 to 2020, the average overall accuracy of remote sensing classification and extraction of the YRSNP alpine wetlands is 0.8492 and the Kappa coefficient is 0.8051. (2) From 2000 to 2020, the shrinking trend of the YRSNP alpine wetland area is restrained. However, the lake wetland, marsh wetland, and marsh meadow all increase by 0.58%, 0.06%, and 3.34%, respectively, whereas the river wetland shows a declining trend. (3) The results of the identification of driving forces indicate that soil moisture is the main factor influencing the dynamic changes of the alpine wetland, although the decline in population density has a favorable impact on the alpine wetland. The results can provide scientific basis for maintaining the stability, diversity, and sustainability of the alpine wetland ecosystem in the Yellow River Source National Park.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the Andean world, water is a fundamental and sacred element, which is why there are divinities that promote its existence as Illapa (god of rain). The purpose of this research is to demonstrate how there is a ritual continuity in the representation of the Andean divinities of water in two moments and discourses: first, to analyze their representation in the colonial chronicles of Guaman Poma de Ayala and Inca Garcilaso de la Vega; second, to study contemporary Quechua and Aymara ritual poetry. Between these two horizons, the aim is to highlight continuities. To do this we will use the Andean categories kawsay (everything has life), ayni (we all need everyone to exist) and pachakutiy (overturning the world) in order to approach the spaces of production of texts. This is within the Andean worldview that considers that everything is alive and related (the dead, the stones, the rivers), which places us in an intense animism.

TI  - Tundra Browning in the Indigirka Lowlands (North-Eastern Siberia) Explained by Drought, Floods and Small-Scale Vegetation Shifts
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Contrary to the general "greening of the Arctic", the Siberian Indigirka Lowlands show strong "browning" (a decrease in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or "NDVI") in various recent satellite records. Since greening and browning are generally indicative of increases and losses in photosynthetically active biomass, this browning trend may have implications for the carbon balance and vegetation of this Arctic tundra region. To explore potential mechanisms responsible for this trend break from general Arctic greening, we studied timeseries of Landsat summer maximum NDVI, weather data, and high-resolution maps of vegetation compositional change, topography, geomorphology and hydrology. We find that a significant proportion of browning (lower summer NDVI) is explained by moisture dynamics, with high snow depths and resulting floods as well as summer drought coinciding with low NDVI. Relations between seasonal weather variables and NDVI are spatially heterogeneous, with floodplains, drained thaw lake basins and Yedoma ridges showing different patterns of association with weather variables. Low summer NDVI after high snowfall was particularly evident in floodplains, likely explained by early summer floods. Local small-scale vegetation changes explained only small amounts of variance in browning rates in Landsat NDVI. Local expansion of Sphagnum vegetation in particular may have contributed to recent browning of our study site, but higher resolution NDVI timeseries are necessary to accurately constrain the role of small-scale vegetation shifts. Overall, associations identified in this study suggest that future increases in Arctic precipitation variability and extremes may limit tundra greening, but to different extents even across comparatively small topographical contrasts.

AB  - In the past few years, there have been many research studies conducted in the field of Satellite Image Classification. The purposes of these studies included flood identification, forest fire monitoring, greenery land identification, and land-usage identification. In this field, finding suitable data is often considered problematic, and some research has also been done to identify and extract suitable datasets for classification. Although satellite data can be challenging to deal consist of multiple interconnected neurons, have shown promising results when applied to satellite imagery data. In the present work, first we have manually downloaded satellite images of four different classes in Florida locations using the TerraFly Mapping System, developed and managed by the High Performance Database Research Center a CNN architecture suitable for extracting features and capable of multi-class classification in our dataset. We discuss the shortcomings in the classification due to the limited size of the dataset. To address this issue, we first employ data augmentation and then utilize transfer learning methodology for feature extraction with VGG16 and ResNet50 pretrained models. We use these features to classify satellite imagery of Florida. We analyze the misclassification in our model and, to address this issue, we introduce a location-based CNN model. We convert coordinates to geohash codes, use these codes as an additional feature vector and feed them into the CNN model. We believe that the new CNN model combined with geohash codes as location features provides a better accuracy for our dataset.

TI  - Seasonal Dynamics of Aphid Flights and Cotton Leafroll Dwarf Virus Spread in Alabama
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV) can cause yield loss of cotton in susceptible plants. The only known aphid vector in the U.S. is Aphis gossypii, which regularly infests cotton, but knowledge so far is limited to the cotton growing season. Seven other species are also known to feed on cotton, but little is known about their seasonal dynamics. Two species are known vectors of CLRDV in chickpea in India. Improving our understanding of the viral spread and seasonal dynamics of potential vectors is key to developing management strategies for plant pathogens. In this study, we monitored seasonal population dynamics of these eight species, in three locations and two different habitats in Alabama, with the use of pan traps, year-round, for two consecutive years. To coordinate this with viral presence, CLRDV spread was monitored at the same sites with the use of cotton sentinel plants. Plants (while conditions allowed) and traps were collected and replaced weekly. Our findings provided baseline information on when these eight species are dispersing in the landscape and when CLRDV spread is occurring in cotton. While A. gossypii is likely the primary vector, early season spread of CLRDV suggests additional aphid vectors are possible. Cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV) is an introduced Polerovirus (Family: Solemoviridae) of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., in the U.S. The only vector known to transmit this virus to cotton is the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover; however, there are seven other species of aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) reported to colonize cotton in the southeastern U.S.: Protaphis middletonii (Thomas), Rhopalosiphum rufiabdominale (Sasaki), Aphis craccivora Koch, Macrosiphum euphorbiae Thomas, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), Smythurodes betae Westwood, and Aphis fabae Scopoli. Little to no information is available on annual population dynamics of these species in the southeastern U.S. The timing of CLRDV spread to cotton plantings is also unknown. The objective of this study was to monitor the population dynamics of eight cotton-feeding aphid species concurrent with the spread of CLRDV at three different locations in Alabama. Aphids were monitored weekly for two years with yellow pan traps, and sentinel plants were deployed weekly to monitor CLRDV spread throughout the cotton-growing season. During the two years, most CLRDV spread at all locations occurred when A. gossypii was actively dispersing in the field. Early season spread at sites in south and central Alabama, when A. gossypii was not abundant, suggests additional aphid vectors are possible.

TI  - Evaluation of perennial reference evapotranspiration (ET o ) over a typical dryland using satellite images: A case study from Uzbekistan
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the most significant compartments in the energy and water balance between the atmosphere and the Earth's surface. Global climate change has an impact on the water cycle and can result in an increase in ET from the land surface; nevertheless, an increase in ET can destabilize the macro- and micro-climate at the local and continental levels. In line with this, the purpose of this article is to learn more about the factors that contribute to the high and current reference ET (ET o ) rate of Karakalpakstan (Uzbekistan). MODIS Terra images was used to analyze long-term land cover change. The Google Earth Engine code editor, Erdas Imagine 2020, and ArcMap 10.8 were used to map land cover change and the leaf area index (LAI). Though the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index were used because of their past performance as affirmative measurement techniques for vegetation monitoring. The HargreavesSamani equation was utilized to ET o in this study. Increased crop density in agriculture and the conversion of barren soil to grasslands to rehabilitate the seashore ecosystem of the Aral Sea influenced LAI significantly, according to multifactorial analyses of perennial air temperature, land cover change, solar irradiance, and ET o in a typical dryland of Uzbekistan. However, the extension of LAI in the agricultural area of Karakalpakstan substantially accelerated the ET o rate, which was a key contributor of an increase in crop water demand. We can see that measured solar radiation and ET o were consistent across time by looking at the nearly same quantities for both. As a result, we assume that global climatic changes have no effect in the uncertainty of solar radiation and ET rate.& COPY; 2023 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Towards a Postsecular Shia Rhetoric-the Discursive Strategies of Transnational Online Network of Shia Muslims in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION MEDIA AND DIGITAL CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Much of the scholarly discussions on the nexus between secular worldview and discourse on Islam have depicted a rather homogeneous image of 'postsecular Islam' by overlooking the heterogeneity and changing nature of communications on Islam. In most cases, the postsecular rhetoric of minority sects in Islam, such as Shia Islam, is rarely mentioned. This study aims to offer a more empirical and context-oriented understanding of the emerging postsecular turn in the contemporary narratives of Shia Islam due to its encounter with secular ideologies, digital media, and popular culture. To do so, it examines dominant discursive features of a transnational Shia religious network -'Who is Hussain'. The analysis focuses on exploring new interpretations and representations of Shi'i messages online. Four main types of narrative features were found: a postsecular contextualization of Shi'i religious events, a secular call for action infused with Shi'i moral motivations, promoting postsecular humanitarian responses, and translating Shi'i religiosity into citizenry engagement. The language deployed by the Facebook page of this network to translate religious ideas denotes a high degree of malleability. This open hermeneutic margin, this study finds, allows the knowledge producers to develop a postsecular narrative of Shi'ism that has the potential to travel beyond the confines of religious boundaries by animating new debates internationally.

TI  - User-Relevant Land Cover Products for Informed Decision-Making in the Complex Terrain of the Peruvian Andes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover in mountainous regions is shaped by a complex web of stressors arising from natural and anthropogenic processes. The co-design process implemented with regional stakeholders in this study highlighted persistent data gaps and the need for locally relevant (thematic, spatial, and temporal) data products, which global alternatives still fail to deliver. This study describes the development of a land cover database designed for the Junin National Reserve (JNR) in Peru as a precursor of a broader effort designed to serve Andean wetland ecosystems. The products were created using Random Forest models leveraging Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data and trained using a large database of in situ data enhanced by the use of high-resolution commercial imagery (Planet). The land cover basemap includes eight classes (two of vegetation) with an overall accuracy of 0.9 and Cohen's Kappa of 0.93. A second product further subdivided vegetation into locally meaningful vegetation classes, for a total of four types (overall accuracy of 0.85). Finally, a surface water product (snapshot and frequency) delivered a representation of the highly variable water extent around Lake Junin. It was the result of a model incorporating 150 Sentinel-1 images from 2016 to 2021 (an overall accuracy of 0.91). The products were successfully employed in identifying 133 ecosystem services provided by the different land cover classes existing in the JNR. The study highlights the value of participatory monitoring and open-data sharing for enhanced stewardship of social-ecological systems.

TI  - In-Season Crop Type Detection by Combing Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2 Imagery Based on the CNN Model
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In-season crop-type maps are required for a variety of agricultural monitoring and decision-making applications. The earlier the crop type maps of the current growing season are obtained, the more beneficial it is for agricultural decision-making and management. With the availability of a large amount of high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing data, different data sources are expected to increase the frequency of data acquisition, which can provide more information in the early season. To explore the potential of integrating different data sources, a Dual-1DCNN algorithm was built based on the CNN model in this study. Moreover, an incremental training method was used to attain the network on each data acquisition date and obtain the best detection date for each crop type in the early season. A case study for Hengshui City in China was conducted using time series of Sentinel-1A (S1A) and Sentinel-2 (S2) attained in 2019. To verify this method, the classical methods support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and Mono-1DCNN were implemented. The input for SVM and RF was S1A and S2 data, and the input for Mono-1DCNN was S2 data. The results demonstrated the following: (1) Dual-1DCNN achieved an overall accuracy above 85% at the earliest time.; (2) all four types of models achieved high accuracy (F1s were greater than 90%) on summer maize after sowing one month later; (3) for cotton and common yam rhizomes, Dual-1DCNN performed best, with its F1 reaching 85% within 2 months after cotton sowing, 15 days, 20 days, and 45 days ahead of Mono-1DCNN, SVM, and RF, respectively, and its extraction of the common yam rhizome was achieved 1-2 months earlier than other methods within the acceptable accuracy. These results confirmed that Dual-1DCNN offered significant potential in the in-season detection of crop types.

TI  - Influence of the Indian Summer Monsoon on Inter-Annual Variability of the Tibetan-Plateau NDVI in Its Main Growing Season
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), as a major component of the land-atmosphere interaction, affects the TP thermal conditions. And, as a direct climatic factor of vegetation, precipitation over the TP is significantly regulated by the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). Using remote-sensing-based vegetation images, meteorological observations, and reanalysis datasets, this study deeply explored the influence of the ISM on vegetation on the TP in its main growing season, where the vegetation on the TP is indicated by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The findings reveal that the ISM is a critical external factor impacting the TP vegetation and has a significantly positive correlation with the TP precipitation and NDVI. Corresponding to a strong ISM, the South Asia high moves northwestward toward the TP and Iranian Plateau with an increase in intensity, and the cyclonic circulation develops over the south of the TP in the middle-lower troposphere. This tropospheric circulation structure aids in the transportation of more water vapor to the TP and enhances convection there, which facilitates more precipitation and thus the TP vegetation growth, featuring a uniform NDVI pattern. Since the positive correlation between precipitation over the TP and NDVI is weaker than that between the ISM and NDVI, we suggest that the ISM can influence the TP vegetation growth not only through changing precipitation but also through other local climatic factors. The increased convection and precipitation over the TP induced by the ISM can also affect the surface thermal conditions, featuring an interaction between the TP vegetation and heat sources. The evapotranspiration of vegetation and its coverage affect local latent and sensible heat fluxes, while the TP thermal condition changes affect in return the vegetation growth. In addition, the changes in thermal conditions over the TP caused by the substantial increase in vegetation may have a de-correlation effect on the relationship between the ISM and uniform NDVI pattern after the TP vegetation reaches its maximum coverage.

TI  - GNSS-based precise orbit determination for maneuvering LEO satellites
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Maneuverability is essential for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to fulfill various operational objectives. However, the precise orbit determination (POD) process might deteriorate due to imperfect satellite orbital dynamics modeling. This article develops a generic POD strategy with maneuver handling for LEO satellites equipped with high-performance spaceborne Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers. Given the time span of an executed maneuver, a set of constant thrust accelerations in the satellite body-fixed reference frame is estimated without using a-priori maneuver accelerations. In addition, different numbers of velocity pulses are estimated at predefined epochs determined by the duration of a maneuver. POD experiments are done for the GRACE-FO and Sentinel-3 satellites, for which the orbit maneuvers vary significantly. The orbits are assessed via internal consistency checks and external orbit validations. Internally, in each direction, the agreement between the reduced-dynamic and kinematic orbits reaches a level of 1 cm, which is comparable with the reference day without maneuvers. Externally, comparisons with the official GRACE-FO products and orbits from the Sentinel-3 Copernicus POD Quality Working Group confirm the reliability of the new orbits with maneuver handling. Finally, satellite laser ranging and K-band ranging measurements indicate a 1-cm accuracy of the absolute orbits and a 2-mm accuracy of the GRACE-FO relative orbits. The maneuver handling strategy is tested in the Bernese GNSS Software, consistently developed at the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern.

TI  - Rainfall-Induced Landslide Assessment under Different Precipitation Thresholds Using Remote Sensing Data: A Central Andes Case
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The determination of susceptibility to rainfall-induced landslides is crucial in developing a robust Landslide Early Warning System (LEWS). With the potential uncertainty of susceptibility changes in mountain environments due to different precipitation thresholds related to climate change, it becomes important to evaluate these changes. In this study, we employed a machine learning approach (logistic models) to assess susceptibility changes to landslides in the Central Andes. We integrated geomorphological features such as slope and slope curvature, and precipitation data on different days before the landslide. We then split the data into a calibration and validation database in a 50/50% ratio, respectively. The results showed an area under the curve (AUC) performance of over 0.790, indicating the model's capacity to represent prone-landslide changes based on geomorphological and precipitation antecedents. We further evaluated susceptibility changes using different precipitation scenarios by integrating Intensity/Duration/Frequency (IDF) products based on CHIRPS data. We concluded that this methodology could be implemented as a Rainfall-Induced Landslides Early Warning System (RILEWS) to forecast RIL occurrence zones and constrain precipitation thresholds. Our study estimates that half of the basin area in the study zone showed a 59% landslide probability for a return of two years at four hours. Given the extent and high population in the area, authorities must increase monitoring over unstable slopes or generate landslide early warning at an operational scale to improve risk management. We encourage decision-makers to focus on better understanding and analysing short-duration extreme events, and future urbanization and public infrastructure designs must consider RIL impact.

TI  - Dissemination of Enterococcal Genetic Lineages: A One Health Perspective
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Enterococcus spp. are commensals of the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and animals and colonize a variety of niches such as water, soil, and food. Over the last three decades, enterococci have evolved as opportunistic pathogens, being considered ESKAPE pathogens responsible for hospital-associated infections. Enterococci's ubiquitous nature, excellent adaptative capacity, and ability to acquire virulence and resistance genes make them excellent sentinel proxies for assessing the presence/spread of pathogenic and virulent clones and hazardous determinants across settings of the human-animal-environment triad, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the One Health continuum. This review provides an overview of enterococcal fitness and pathogenic traits; the most common clonal complexes identified in clinical, veterinary, food, and environmental sources; as well as the dissemination of pathogenic genomic traits (virulome, resistome, and mobilome) found in high-risk clones worldwide, across the One Health continuum.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Single Bands, Vegetation Indices, and Their Combination in Predicting Grass Species Nitrogen in a Protected Mountainous Area
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of biodiversity in improving the primary productivity within terrestrial ecosystems is well documented. Each species in an ecosystem has a role to play in the overall productivity of an ecosystem. Grass species nitrogen (N) estimation is essential in rangelands, especially in rugged terrain such as mountainous regions. It is an indicator of forage quality, which has nutritional implications for grazing animals. This research sought to improve and test the predictability of grass N by applying a combination of remotely sensed spectral bands and vegetation indices as input. Recursive feature selection was used to select the optimal spectral bands and vegetation indices for predicting grass N. Subsequently, the selected vegetation indices and bands were used as input into the non-parametric random forest (RF) regression to predict grass N. The prediction of grass N improved slightly in the vegetation indices model (81%) compared to the bands model (80%), and the highest prediction was achieved by combining the two (85%). This research ascertains that including red-edge-based vegetation indices improves the prediction of grass N. S2 MSI remains the ideal remote sensing tool for estimating grass N because of its strategically positioned red-edge bands, which are highly correlated with chlorophyll content in plants.

TI  - Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Status: <i>Wuchereria bancrofti</i> Infections in Human Populations after Five Effective Rounds of Mass Drug Administration in Zambia
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymphatic filariasis (LF), also commonly known as elephantiasis, is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by filarial parasites. The disease is transmitted via a bite from infected mosquitoes. The bites of these infected mosquitoes deposit filarial parasites, Wuchereria or Brugia, whose predilection site is the lymphatic system. The damage to the lymph system causes swelling in the legs, arms, and genitalia. A mapping survey conducted between 2003 and 2011 determined LF as being endemic in Zambia in 96 out of 116 districts. Elimination of LF is known to be possible by stopping the spread of the infection through large-scale preventive chemotherapy. Therefore, mass drug administration (MDA) with diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) (6 mg/kg) and Albendazole (400 mg) for Zambia has been conducted and implemented in all endemic districts with five effective rounds. In order to determine whether LF prevalence has been sufficiently reduced to levels less than 2% antigenemia and less than 1% microfilaremia, a pre-transmission assessment survey (pre-TAS) was conducted. Therefore, post-MDA pre-TAS was conducted between 2021 and 2022 in 80 districts to determine the LF prevalence. We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study involving 600 participants in each evaluation unit (EU) or each district. The study sites (sentinel and spot-check sites) were from districts that were the implementation units (IUs) of the LF MDA. These included 80 districts from the 9 provinces. A total of 47,235 people from sentinel and spot-check locations were tested. Of these, valid tests were 47,052, of which 27,762 (59%) were females and 19,290 (41%) were males. The survey revealed in the 79/80 endemic districts a prevalence of Wb antigens of 0.14% and 0.0% prevalence of microfilariae. All the surveyed districts had an optimum prevalence of less than 2% for antigenaemia, except for Chibombo district. The majority of participants that tested positive for Wuchereria bancrofti (Wb) Antigens (Ag) were those that had 2, 3, and 4 rounds of MDA. Surprisingly, individuals that had 1 round of MDA were not found to have circulating antigens of Wb. The study showed that all the surveyed districts, except for Chibombo, passed pre-TAS. This further implies that there is a need to conduct transmission assessment surveys (TASs) in these districts.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote-sensing-based satellite images have been providing a wealth of information to the scientists for study of environmental changes caused by climate changes or human activities such as destructive cyclones and earthquakes etc. This paper proposes a deep learning-based segmentation model for agriculture images captured from satellites and a novel agriculture-based satellite dataset. The segmentation has been performed on the satellite images into five categories of cultivated land, uncultivated land, residences, water, and forest. The dataset has been created using Sentinel-2 satellite data over the Panipat district in Haryana, India having di-versity in crops and land usage. The dataset consists of 16,720 images and their corresponding masks over the years ranging from 2018 to 2020. The proposed model consists of a six-phase encoder-decoder network with a total of 33 convolution layers. The proposed segmentation model has been evaluated on proposed dataset and obtained an efficient metric of 72% IoU score which is better than state-of-the-art models such as U-Net, Link -Net, FPN and DeeplabV3+ score 51%, 46%, 49%, 67% IoU respectively.

TI  - Assessing Clouds Using Satellite Observations Through Three Generations of Global Atmosphere Models
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds are parameterized in climate models using quantities on the model grid-scale to approximate the cloud cover and impact on radiation. Because of the complexity of processes involved with clouds, these parameterizations are one of the key challenges in climate modeling. Differences in parameterizations of clouds are among the main contributors to the spread in climate sensitivity across models. In this work, the clouds in three generations of an atmosphere model lineage are evaluated against satellite observations. Satellite simulators are used within the model to provide an appropriate comparison with individual satellite products. In some respects, especially the top-of-atmosphere cloud radiative effect, the models show generational improvements. The most recent generation, represented by two distinct branches of development, exhibits some regional regressions in the cloud representation; in particular the southern ocean shows a positive bias in cloud cover. The two branches of model development show how choices during model development, both structural and parametric, lead to different cloud climatologies. Several evaluation strategies are used to quantify the spatial errors in terms of the large-scale circulation and the cloud structure. The Earth mover's distance is proposed as a useful error metric for the passive satellite data products that provide cloud-top pressure-optical depth histograms. The cloud errors identified here may contribute to the high climate sensitivity in the Community Earth System Model, version 2 and in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model, version 1.

TI  - Estimating Drought-Induced Crop Yield Losses at the Cadastral Area Level in the Czech Republic
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Czech Republic, soil moisture content during the growing season has been decreasing over the past six decades, and drought events have become significantly more frequent. In 2003, 2015, 2018 and 2019, drought affected almost the entire country, with droughts in 2000, 2004, 2007, 2012, 2014 and 2017 having smaller extents but still severe intensities in some regions. The current methods of visiting cadastral areas (approximately 13,000) to allocate compensation funds for the crop yield losses caused by drought or aggregating the losses to district areas (approximately 1000 km2) based on proxy data are both inappropriate. The former due to the required time and resources, the later due to low resolution, which leads to many falsely negative and falsely positive results. Therefore, the study presents a new method to combine ground survey, remotely sensed and model data for determining crop yield losses. The study shows that it is possible to estimate them at the cadastral area level in the Czech Republic and attribute those losses to drought. This can be done with remotely sensed vegetation, water stress and soil moisture conditions with modeled soil moisture anomalies coupled with near-real-time feedback from reporters and with crop status surveys. The newly developed approach allowed the achievement of a proportion of falsely positive errors of less than 10% (e.g., oat 2%, 8%; spring barley 4%, 3%; sugar beets 2%, 21%; and winter wheat 2%, 6% in years 2017, resp. 2018) and allowed for cutting the loss assessment time from eight months in 2017 to eight weeks in 2018.

TI  - Biomass and carbon estimation with remote sensing tools in tropical dry forests of Tolima, Colombia
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests store a large amount of carbon in biomass, which constitutes an option for climate change mitigation. This research focused on the estimation of aboveground biomass and carbon using remote sensing and mathematical modeling tools in dry forests of the Centro Universitario Regional del Norte (CURDN) of the University of Tolima: gallery and riparian forest (152.2 ha) and secondary or transitional vegetation (329.1 ha). Fifty-nine temporary sampling plots were established and the aboveground biomass and carbon were estimated by measuring trees and using allometric models and a carbon fraction of 0.47. Four vegetation indexes (NDVI, EVI, SAVI and OSAVI) were calculated from two Sentinel 2A satellite images from rainy and dry season. The NDVI index from the rainy season showed the best R2 (0.87), which allowed the development of a model for aboveground biomass estimation. Biomass and carbon distribution mapping was generated in the study area yielding an average value of 95.1 and 44.1 t/ha of aboveground biomass and carbon, respectively. These results made it possible to spatialize the biomass content and carbon sinks within the CURDN and serve as a first step to manage the territory and establish mechanisms for the preservation of the bs-T in the department of Tolima.

TI  - Atmospheric correction under cloud edge effects for Geostationary Ocean Color Imager through deep learning
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) is widely employed in tracking diurnal dynamics of oceanic conditions. However, the current atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms for GOCI often mask pixels around cloud edges to exclude pixels contaminated by cloud edge effects (CEEs; including stray light, cloud shadows, and cloud adjacent effects (AEs)), which results in massive data loss. In this paper, we propose a novel AC algorithm to correct these CEE-affected pixels based on deep learning (namely, DLACC) to achieve a comparable quality level to those pixels far away from cloud edges. We used the standard near-infrared iterative AC algorithm in SeaDAS (namely, NIR) to obtain Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (Rrc) and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs). Then, high-quality Rrs values were extracted using a quality assurance (QA) algorithm. Next, we obtained 2,821,668 matchups by matching CEE-free noontime Rrs values with CEE-affected Rrc values in a time window of 1 h. These matchups were used to develop DLACC. Validations using in situ data from Aerosol Robotic Network-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) stations showed that more matchups were obtained with the DLACC model than with the NIR algorithm and Korea Ocean Satellite Center standard AC algorithm in GDPS 2.0 (KOSC), and the accuracies were similar. More importantly, the DLACC algorithm is more tolerant of AEs and reduces AEs in a 2-pixel distance from cloud edges by 10% in the blue bands and by 50% in the green band. As a result, more valid observations are obtained with the DLACC algorithm, with the daily percentage of valid observations (DPVOs) increasing by 71% and 62% over those with the NIR algorithm and the KOSC algorithm, respectively. These increases in valid observations could further result in more consistent patterns in terms of space and time. Our DLACC algorithm can not only be used to process GOCI images but also provide an open framework to develop corresponding deeplearning models for other geostationary satellites.

TI  - GRACE Data Quantify Water Storage Changes in the Shiyang River Basin, an Inland River in the Arid Zone
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global changes and human activities have significantly altered water cycle processes and water resource patterns in inland river basins in arid zones. New tools are needed to conduct more comprehensive and scientific assessments of basin water cycle processes and water resource patterns. Based on GRACE satellite and Landsat data, this study investigated terrestrial water storage changes and surface water area in the Shiyang River Drainage Basin from 2002 to 2021. It explored the effects of climate change and water conservancy construction on terrestrial water storage changes in the basin. The results of the study show that, although the surface water quantity in the Shiyang River basin has increased in the past 20 years, the overall decreasing trend of terrestrial water storage in the basin of the Shiyang River has an interannual decreasing rate of 0.01 cm/a. The decreasing trend of water storage in the midstream and downstream areas is more prominent. The change in precipitation controls the change in water storage in the Shiyang River Drainage Basin. Artificial water transfer has changed the spatial distribution of water resources in the basin of the Shiyang River. However, it still has not completely reversed the trend of decreasing water storage in the middle and lower reaches of the Shiyang River.

TI  - Predicting Upgrade of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ to Invasive Breast Cancer at Surgery With Ultrafast Imaging
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND. Biopsy-proven ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions are often upgraded to invasive cancer at surgery. Therefore, accurate prediction of the likelihood of invasion is helpful for surgical planning, including the need for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).OBJECTIVE. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether kinetic features of clinically available ultrafast MRI (UF-MRI) can predict upgrade of biopsy-proven DCIS to invasive cancer at surgical excision.METHODS. Consecutive patients with biopsy-proven pure DCIS lesions who underwent UF-MRI with conventional dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and subsequently underwent surgery between August 2019 and January 2021 were identified. Patient and lesion characteristics, biopsy method and pathology, and lesion features on mammography, ultrasound, DCE-MRI, and UF-MRI were assessed to determine predictors of upgrade to invasive cancer. The Fisher exact test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for association analysis.RESULTS. In 68 patients (median age, 52.0 years; range, 31-79 years) with 68 biopsy-proven pure DCIS lesions, 26 lesions (38%) were upgraded from in situ to invasive cancer. An upgrade of DCIS to invasive cancer was significantly associated with a shorter time to enhancement (TTE) on preoperative UF-MRI (p = .03), with a threshold of 11 seconds providing maximum specificity (50%) and sensitivity (76%) for upgrade. Larger lesion size on DCE-MRI (p = .001) and mammography (p = .04) was also significantly associated with upgrade; an optimal predictive threshold of 4.4 cm on DCE-MRI yielded sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 56%. No other specific variables were significantly associated with upgrade after surgery. Logistic regression of selected features combined with TTE produced a higher AUC (0.85) in predicting upgrade to invasive disease than did each factor alone, but this result was not statistically significant.CONCLUSION. Preoperative UF-MRI TTE and lesion size on DCE-MRI and mammography show potential in predicting upgrade of DCIS to invasive cancer at surgery.CLINICAL IMPACT. UF-MRI provides useful information that can be used in surgical planning, including determination of the need to perform SLNB.

TI  - The February 6, 2023, Earthquakes in Turkey: A Model of the Rupture Surface Based on Satellite Radar Interferometry
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Two strike-slip faults, displacements along which caused the catastrophic earthquakes in Turkey on February 6, 2023, were mapped from satellite radar interferometry data. According to the satellite data, the relative displacements of the sides of the East Anatolian Fault Zone (EAFZ), with which the first event of M-w 7.8 was associated, exceeded 5 m in the central segment. The rupture surface extends from the area of the Doganyol-Sivris earthquake M-w 6.7 of January 24, 2020, in the north to the Mediterranean coast in the south, where the earthquake M-w 6.3 occurred on February 20, 2023. The second event M-w 7.5 is associated with the Surgu-cardak fault; the relative displacements of its sides, according to satellite data, exceeded 7 m. The obtained displacement fields of the Earth's surface were used to construct a model of the seismic rupture. This model was worked out on the basis of the Pollitz, 1996 solution, which defines displacements on the surface of the spherically stratified planet as a result of along dip and strike displacements on a rectangular rupture located inside the sphere. Ignoring the spherical stratification of the planet leads to errors of up to 20%, especially in the presence of a large strike-slip component [5]. Ignoring sphericity also causes an error, when using the solution obtained for an elastic homogeneous half-space, as the US Geological Survey (USGS) has done, in modeling the seismic rupture for earthquakes in Turkey in 2023. Our model differs in the detailed consideration of the fault geometry. For this purpose, the faults were approximated by 19 planes along the strike, divided into two levels along the dip. In our rupture model strike-slip displacements in the central segment of the EAFZ reached 12.7 m. In the southern segment of this rupture, the displacements are much smaller. It should be emphasized that we registered the displacements for the period from January 29, 2023, to February 10, 2023; therefore, together with co-seismic ones, they also include post-seismic displacements for four days after the main seismic events. The displacements on the rupture surface along the Surgu-cardak Fault, where the M-w 7.5 earthquake occurred, were up to 10 m. The results demonstrate, in particular, the efficiency of application of the satellite radar interferometry in the operative study of catastrophic geodynamic phenomena and processes.

TI  - Operational AOD Retrieval at Subkilometer Resolution Using OceanSat-2 OCM Over Land: SAER Algorithm, Uncertainties, Validation & Inter-Sensor Comparison
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ocean color monitor (OCM) sensor onboard OceanSat-2 is providing data in visible and near Infrared (NIR) bands. Due to the limited spectral coverage of OCM, the widely used dark-target and deep-blue aerosol algorithms cannot be adapted. Here, a new aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval algorithm for OCM (or similar sensors) over land, termed Space Applications Center AErosol Retrieval (SAER) is described. It utilizes two blue bands for the AOD inversion and, Red and NIR band to characterize the surface in visible bands without assuming red and NIR bands transparent to aerosols. Unlike the dark-target algorithm, the SAER algorithm can retrieve AOD over bright arid and urban areas too. The uncertainty analysis of SAER suggests a theoretically expected error (EE) envelope of +/-(0.06 + 0.26 x AOD) for typical retrieval conditions. OCM AOD over land is retrieved operationally for the first time over Indian and neighboring countries' landmass at the finest spatial resolution of 0.007 degrees. The SAER algorithm is validated against in-situ AOD measurements during the years 2016-2018 at 21 Aerosol Robotic Network stations located in south-Asia. Overall validation using 1900 match-up points shows correlations exceeding 0.8 with 74% of retrievals within EE. The retrievals over cropland, grassland, and mixed land cover types show high (low) correlation (bias), while over bright urban areas somewhat low (high) correlation (bias) is observed. Excluding monsoon season, OCM AOD retrievals show good performance over the year. The performance of MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer dark-target and OCM AOD, against common in-situ, is close to each other. The study shows that OCM AOD can be used for air quality monitoring/modeling at high spatial resolution.

TI  - Land cover change in marginalised landscapes of South Africa (1984-2014): Insights into the influence of socio-economic and political factors
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural landscapes in South Africa experience high conversion rates due to intense land use; however, the changes are site specific and depend on the socio-economic and political history of the area. Land cover change (LCC) was assessed in response to socio-economic and political factors in uThukela Municipal District, KwaZulu-Natal, using Landsat imagery from 1984 to 2014, while making comparisons to other studies in South Africa. Socio-economic/political data were used to gain insights into the observed LCC patterns. Land cover was classified using a random forest classifier, and accuracies ranging from 87% to 92% were achieved. Systematic and intensity analysis methods were used to describe patterns, rates, and transitions of LCC in Imbabazane (ILM) and Okhahlamba (OLM) local municipalities. The results showed a reduced rate of change intensity from 3.4% to 0.9% in ILM and from 3.1% to 1.1% in OLM between 1984 and 2014. Grassland was persistent, covering over 70% in both local municipalities between 1984 and 2014. Although persistent, grassland experienced respective losses of 3.7% and 14.3% in both observation periods in ILM and of 10.2% and 13.3% in OLM. During the analysis period, settlements and cropland gained actively in both local municipalities. The changes represent a degree of population, local authority, and people's perception as influencers of land use and LCC. It is therefore argued that socio-economic and political changes can potentially influence land use and LCC; however, natural ecosystems can persist under those conditions, and this requires more research efforts.

TI  - The Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Mangrove Forest Cover from 1973 to 2020 in Chwaka Bay and Menai Bay, Zanzibar
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves in Zanzibar have a high value for biodiversity and scenic beauty. However, mangroves are susceptible to anthropogenic and natural environmental disturbances. Although global mangrove monitoring systems exist, it is the practitioners focused on small mangrove areas who are knowledgeable about the area in which they work. This study examined the change in mangrove cover in Chwaka Bay and Menai Bay, between 1973 and 2020, using Landsat satellite data. The transformed divergence (TD) index and Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distance were used to calculate separability of land cover classes before classification. The overall accuracies ranged between 82.5 and 92.7% for Chwaka Bay and 85.5 and 94.5% for Menai Bay. The kappa coefficients (& kappa;) were in the range of 0.72-0.90, while the producer's and user's accuracies were between 72 and 100%. Chwaka Bay's annual decrease in mangrove cover between 1973 and 2020 was 48.5 ha, compared to Menai's 6.8 ha. The loss of mangroves in Zanzibar is linked to illegal timber/pole cutting, firewood collection, charcoal burning, unsustainable aquaculture, and agricultural and urban development. Others are changes in environmental conditions that are suitable for mangroves and climate change. This study is crucial in providing a basis for the ecological restoration and management of Zanzibar's mangrove ecosystem.

TI  - Wetland Mapping in Great Lakes Using Sentinel-1/2 Time-Series Imagery and DEM Data in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Great Lakes (GL) wetlands support a variety of rare and endangered animal and plant species. Thus, wetlands in this region should be mapped and monitored using advanced and reliable techniques. In this study, a wetland map of the GL was produced using Sentinel-1/2 datasets within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. To this end, an object-based supervised machine learning (ML) classification workflow is proposed. The proposed method contains two main classification steps. In the first step, several non-wetland classes (e.g., Barren, Cropland, and Open Water), which are more distinguishable using radar and optical Remote Sensing (RS) observations, were identified and masked using a trained Random Forest (RF) model. In the second step, wetland classes, including Fen, Bog, Swamp, and Marsh, along with two non-wetland classes of Forest and Grassland/Shrubland were identified. Using the proposed method, the GL were classified with an overall accuracy of 93.6% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.90. Additionally, the results showed that the proposed method was able to classify the wetland classes with an overall accuracy of 87% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.91. Non-wetland classes were also identified more accurately than wetlands (overall accuracy = 96.62% and Kappa coefficient = 0.95).

T2  - FORMA Y FUNCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous language literacy has been utilized to elevate prestige, create a lasting record and facilitate language learning, while Spanish has facilitated academic success and access to work. In a globalized and urban world, it provides opportunities for participation, social dialogue and dissent. Therefore, it is essential to develop literacy learning processes that do not undermine indigenous languages or their oral traditions. This study aimed to develop participatory recommendations for teaching literacy in the Wounmeu language ( ISO 639-3 noa) and in Spanish, aligned with the Wounaan worldview, to facilitate decision-making in the development of the Community Education Project and the linguistic planning for literacy education in urban settings. To this end, this paper examines the perspectives on literacy in indigenous communities, presents the project and the linguistic practices of the community, explains the recommendations, evaluates the process and provides concluding remarks.

TI  - Patterns of regional site index across a North American boreal forest gradient
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest structure-the height, cover, vertical complexity, and spatial patterns of trees-is a key indicator of productivity variation across forested extents. During the 2017 and 2019 growing seasons, NASA's Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment collected full-waveform airborne LiDAR using the land, vegetation and imaging sensor, sampling boreal and tundra landscapes across a variety of ecological regions from central Canada westward through Alaska. Here, we compile and archive a geo-referenced gridded suite of these data that include vertical structure estimates and novel horizontal cover estimates of vegetation canopy cover derived from vegetation's vertical LiDAR profile. We validate these gridded estimates with small footprint airborne LiDAR, and link >36 million of them with stand age estimates from a Landsat time-series of tree-canopy cover that we confirm with plot-level disturbance year data. We quantify the regional magnitude and variability in site index, the age-dependent rates of forest growth, across 15 boreal ecoregions in North America. With this open archive suite of forest structure data linked to stand age, we bound current forest productivity estimates across a boreal structure gradient whose response to key bioclimatic drivers may change with stand age. These results, derived from a reduction of a large archive of airborne LiDAR and a Landsat time series, quantify forest productivity bounds for input into forest and ecosystem growth models, to update forecasts of changes in North America's boreal forests by improving the regional parametrization of forest growth rates.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Time Series and Classifier Fusion to Map an Aquatic Invasive Plant Species along a River-The Case of Water-Hyacinth
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater ecosystems host high levels of biodiversity but are also highly vulnerable to biological invasions. Aquatic Invasive Alien Plant Species (aIAPS) can cause detrimental effects on freshwater ecosystems and their services to society, raising challenges to decision-makers regarding their correct management. Spatially and temporally explicit information on the occurrence of aIAPS in dynamic freshwater systems is essential to implement efficient regional and local action plans. The use of unmanned aerial vehicle imagery synchronized with free Sentinel-2 multispectral data allied with classifier fusion techniques may support more efficient monitoring actions for non-stationary aIAPS. Here, we explore the advantages of such a novel approach for mapping the invasive water-hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) in the Cavado River (northern Portugal). Invaded and non-invaded areas were used to explore the evolution of spectral attributes of Eichhornia crassipes through a time series (processed by a super-resolution algorithm) that covers March 2021 to February 2022 and to build an occurrence dataset (presence or absence). Analysis of the spectral behavior throughout the year allowed the detection of spectral regions with greater capacity to distinguish the target plant from the surrounding environment. Classifier fusion techniques were implemented in the biomod2 predictive modelling package and fed with selected spectral regions to firstly extract a spectral signature from the synchronized day and secondly to identify pixels with similar reflectance values over time. Predictions from statistical and machine-learning algorithms were ensembled to map invaded spaces across the whole study area during all seasons with classifications attaining high accuracy values (True Skill Statistic, TSS: 0.932; Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve, ROC: 0.992; Kappa: 0.826). Our results provide evidence of the potential of our approach to mapping plant invaders in dynamic freshwater systems over time, applicable in the assessment of the success of control actions as well as in the implementation of long-term strategic monitoring.

T2  - FILOLOGICHESKIE NAUKI-NAUCHNYE DOKLADY VYSSHEI SHKOLY-PHILOLOGICAL SCIENCES-SCIENTIFIC ESSAYS OF HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the fanfiction novel by E. Yudkowsky "Harry Potter and the methods of rationality" from the point of view of various genre strategies. We analyze Yudkowsky's text as an example of the realization of possibilities of the network space for popularization of transhumanism and principles of rationality by creating a didactic novel based on the J.K. Rowling's literary universe. Also it is a postmodern novel based on the deconstruction of Rowling's "canonical" text and key elements of the fantasy genre. Besides that, this text is a philosophical existentialist novel, which reflects the author's worldview. Yudkowsky's experiment with genres demonstrates the potential of fanfiction texts illustrating R. Barth's concept of reader's active role: the famous story written by J. Rowling gets new meanings in Yudkowsky's interpretation. Deconstructing the logic of fantasy, the author realizes didactic tasks, teaches rationality to his readers and reflects on the ethics of action, making Harry Potter a superhero, whose principles are correlated with the ideas of J.-P. Sartre and F. Nietzsche. Yudkowsky's project, aimed at the rehabilitation of rationality, finally makes a reader doubt it, because the rational mind turns to be capable of destruction.

TI  - Utilising Sentinel-1's Orbital Stability for Efficient Pre-Processing of Radiometric Terrain Corrected Gamma Nought Backscatter
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) gamma nought backscatter, which was introduced around a decade ago, has evolved into the standard for analysis-ready Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. While working with RTC backscatter data is particularly advantageous over undulated terrain, it requires substantial computing resources given that the terrain flattening is more computationally demanding than simple orthorectification. The extra computation may become problematic when working with large SAR datasets such as the one provided by the Sentinel-1 mission. In this study, we examine existing Sentinel-1 RTC pre-processing workflows and assess ways to reduce processing and storage overheads by considering the satellite's high orbital stability. By propagating Sentinel-1's orbital deviations through the complete pre-processing chain, we show that the local contributing area and the shadow mask can be assumed to be static for each relative orbit. Providing them as a combined external static layer to the pre-processing workflow, and streamlining the transformations between ground and orbit geometry, reduces the overall processing times by half. We conducted our experiments with our in-house developed toolbox named wizsard, which allowed us to analyse various aspects of RTC, specifically run time performance, oversampling, and radiometric quality. Compared to the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) this implementation allowed speeding up processing by factors of 10-50. The findings of this study are not just relevant for Sentinel-1 but for all SAR missions with high spatio-temporal coverage and orbital stability.

TI  - Monitoring and assessment of urban green space loss and fragmentation using remote sensing data in the four cities of Malawi from 1986 to 2021
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green spaces enhance cities' natural beauty, boost biodiversity, and promote the health and happiness of city residents, among other benefits. Despite the benefits of ur-ban green spaces, their spatial configuration and composition are impacted by urban ex-pansion. This study aims to investigate the spatial-temporal fragmentation trends of urban green spaces in four cities in Malawi (Blantyre, Zomba, Lilongwe, and Mzuzu). We, there-fore, applied multi-temporal Landsat images to understand trends in urban green spaces from 1986 to 2021. Five landscape metrics, namely: percentage of land area (PLAND), num-ber of patches (NP), patch density, largest patch index (LPI), landscape shape index (LSI), and mean patch size (MPS), were used to quantify the degree of urban green space frag-mentation in Fragstats software. The results showed an increase in the NP, PD, and LSI and a decline in the LPI and MPA in the four cities. This is an indication of fragmentation and a reduction in green space. Rapid urbanisation has resulted in the loss and fragmentation of urban green space areas, which has been attributed to the rapid expansion of built-up ar-eas at the expense of green spaces. The present study is the first to incorporate landscape metrics to understand the spatial heterogeneity of the composition and configuration of green spaces in all the cities of Malawi. The findings of this study contribute to an under -standing of how urban growth impacts fragmentation and the loss of urban green spaces and offer valuable insights for better spatial planning and management of cities. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Remote Sensing Soil Freeze-Thaw Status and North American N<sub>2</sub>O Emissions From a Regional Inversion
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - North American nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions over 2011-2018 are estimated using the CarbonTracker-Lagrange regional inversion framework. Emissions are strongest in the Midwestern corn/soybean belt and display a distinct dual maxima seasonal pattern. The first maximum occurs in late winter/early spring, suggestive of freeze-thaw (FT) effects on denitrification rates and associated N2O emissions. The second maximum occurs in late spring/early summer, consistent with a growing season nitrogen fertilizer-driven source, although fertilizer applied in late fall may contribute to the FT pulse as well. Interannual variability in the first maximum correlates significantly to soil freeze thaw status derived from remote sensing data. A requisite frozen period in the preceding early winter appears necessary to create conditions for the N2O pulse after thawing. The FT pulse is a prominent feature of the annual cycle in Canadian cropland, where it may be of comparable magnitude to growing season emissions. In contrast, the growing season peak in N2O dominates the FT peak in the Midwestern Corn-Soybean region of the United States.

TI  - Vegetation Change and Conservation Evaluation of the Cangshan Erhai National Nature Reserve (Cangshan Mountain Part) in Southwest China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation and its spatiotemporal variations play a crucial role in regional ecological security and sustainable development. Examining vegetation dynamics in natural reserves provides valuable insights for optimizing vegetation patterns and management strategies. This study utilizes Landsat remote sensing imagery to investigate changes in vegetation pattern and coverage in the Cangshan mountain of the Cangshan Erhai National Nature Reserve, as well as assesses the effectiveness of conservation efforts. The results indicate the following: (1) The primary vegetation types in the Cangshan mountain include warm-temperate coniferous forests, deciduous broad-leaved forests, bamboo forests, and alpine meadows, exhibiting distinct vertical zonation patterns. The vegetated area expanded by 1146 hectares during the study period. (2) The average fractional of vegetation coverage (FVC) in the Cangshan mountain demonstrated an upward trend (0.82 in 1987 to 0.93 in 2017), with the proportion of highly FVC areas increasing from 59.67% in 1987 to 97.89% in 2017. (3) The vegetation landscape fragmentation in Cangshan mountain and various functional areas shows an increasing trend, while connectivity decreases, and is accompanied by a more intricate shape of the vegetation landscape. While conservation and management efforts have yielded certain results in safeguarding the vegetation in the Cangshan mountain, the degree of vegetation landscape fragmentation has intensified due to climate change and human activities. Thus, it is imperative for management authorities to promptly adjust protective measures within the Cangshan mountain. This study contributes to our understanding of vegetation changes within the Cangshan mountain and provides essential baseline information for optimizing and enhancing vegetation conservation management strategies within the reserve.

TI  - Analysis of PlanetScope Dove Digital Surface Model Accuracy Using Geometrically Simulated Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many objectives in geoscience and engineering require Earth surface elevations at greater temporospatial resolution and coverage than are currently available. This may be achieved with stereo imagery from large constellations of "small sats", such as PlanetScope Doves. Obtaining Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of sufficient quality from these images is challenging due to their lower resolution and weaker stereo geometry relative to stereo mode satellites such as WorldView. The quality can be improved by utilizing their much larger numbers of repeat images, but this requires effective stereopair selection. To determine the stereo geometries required for obtaining quality DSMs from PlanetScope Dove imagery, we apply a new methodology for generating simulated stereo images of varying geometries using adjusted orientation parameters obtained by a self-calibrating bundle adjustment and validated by comparing the resulting rigorous sensor and rational function models. The accuracies of simulated stereo and multi-pair DSMs are then assessed through comparison to a reference DSM, providing the relationship between specific imaging geometries and DSM quality. Our results provide a basis for automated stereo imagery selection to enable large-scale DSM production from PlanetScope Dove imagery. Our methodology can be applied to other sources of stereo imagery and designing future satellite missions. In the future, we will further develop multi-pair matching algorithms for generating DSMs with Dove Classic images to improve both accuracy and quality that are otherwise limited by the weak stereo geometry of single stereo pairs.

TI  - Dust storm induced severe cooling in the northern Arabian Sea during winter 2022
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale dust storms lifted by strong winds into the atmosphere may adversely affect local weather and climate. One such major dust storm occurred in January 2022 over the northern Arabian Sea significantly decreased the visibility in the region. In our study, we examined the potential consequences and processes of this dust storm event and their impact on sea surface temperature (SST) variability using MODIS, and satellite reanalysis model data. We observed a substantial increase in dust mass concentrations (88%) during the event date when compared to the normal days, followed by an intense cooling (6.7 degrees C) in the region. Furthermore, the results show an increased latent heat flux (LHF) concentrations (476 wm  2) and aerosol optical depth (1.4) over the northern Arabian Sea. Our findings also suggest a significant association between SST and LHF with wind components during the dust storm event. A numerical simulation conducted with the help of WRF-Chem validated the cooling phenomena. Taken together, our results indicate that the dust storms are a significant phenomenon that impacts the regional climate and marine ecosystem.

TI  - Periostin thorn Stromal Cells Guide Lymphovascular Invasion by Cancer Cells
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cancer cell dissemination to sentinel lymph nodes is associated with poor patient outcomes, particularly in breast cancer. The process by which cancer cells egress from the primary tumor upon interfacing with the lymphatic vasculature is complex and driven by dynamic interactions between cancer cells and stromal cells, includ-ing cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF). The matricellular protein periostin can distinguish CAF subtypes in breast cancer and is associated with increased desmoplasia and disease recurrence in patients. However, as periostin is secreted, periostin-expressing CAFs are difficult to characterize in situ, limiting our understanding of their specific contribution to cancer progression. Here, we used in vivo genetic labeling and ablation to lineage trace periostin thorn cells and characterize their functions during tumor growth and metas-tasis. Periostin-expressing CAFs were spatially found at periductal and perivascular margins, were enriched at lymphatic vessel periph-eries, and were differentially activated by highly metastatic cancer cells versus poorly metastatic counterparts. Surprisingly, genetically depleting periostin thorn CAFs slightly accelerated primary tumor growth but impaired intratumoral collagen organization and inhibited lymphatic, but not lung, metastases. Periostin ablation in CAFs impaired their ability to deposit aligned collagen matrices and inhibited cancer cell invasion through collagen and across lymphatic endothelial cell monolayers. Thus, highly metastatic cancer cells mobilize periostin-expressing CAFs in the primary tumor site that promote collagen remodeling and collective cell invasion within lymphatic vessels and ultimately to sentinel lymph nodes.Significance: Highly metastatic breast cancer cells activate a population of periostin-expressing CAFs that remodel the extra -cellular matrix to promote escape of cancer cells into lymphatic vessels and drive colonization of proximal lymph nodes.

TI  - Trade-Offs and Synergies among 17 Ecosystem Services in Africa: A Long-Term Multi-National Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The proper management of multiple ecosystem services (ESs) in a balanced manner is an important and challenging responsibility. However, due to infrastructural constraints, we need to understand more about the spatial interactions among ESs in most African countries. Therefore, we took 48 African countries, 5 African geopolitical regions, and the African continent as case studies to diagnose the spatial trade-offs and synergies among 17 ESs and 8 types of land use and land cover (LULC) in 2000 and 2019. The implications of our findings at the national, regional, continental, and global levels were explored. To achieve this, we mapped the spatial distributions of the 17 ESs at the continental level using classified land cover data from MODIS remotely sensed data, with a spectral band between 0.405 and 14.385 & mu;m and a spatial resolution of 500 m. Then, we used Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to determine the spatial interactions among the 17 ESs. The results show that regulation services showed synergies at the continental level in gas regulation (0.66), climate regulation (0.71), disturbance regulation (0.14), water regulation (0.53), water supply (0.71), and waste treatment (0.06). Moreover, we found moderate levels of interactions among most ESs in the 48 countries, with most regulating services and supporting services exhibiting trade-offs with other categories of ESs, among other findings. The results will inform scientific communities and authorities at all levels on how to deliver human well-being and quality of life, and usher in a sustainable change where we expect better ecosystem management and ecological conservation.

T2  - ENERGY REPORTS

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 4th International Conference on Sustainable Energy and Environmental Development
CL  - Krakow, POLAND
AB  - In this study the impact on air quality and on atmospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) of selected waste fires in Poland in the last few years was assessed using measurement results derived from the public air quality monitoring (AQM) system and satellite observations of the MODIS sensor. Additional meteorological data from nearest ground stations as well as results of HYSPLIT forward and backward modeling and high-resolution satellite imagery were used to initially identify locations potentially exposed to smoke from the fires and hours of exposure. The concentrations of selected air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, NOx, CO, and C6H6) were treated as characteristic substances of waste fires. Depending on the location of a given AQM station in relation to the place of waste fire and the prevailing meteorological conditions, a more or less significant air concentration peaks (lasting at least several hours) of the analyzed substances were observed. The study showed that the fumes from large waste fires spread over a long distance, so that the increase in air pollutant concentrations can be also recorded at AQM stations located further away (approx. 200-300 km) from the fire site. In the layer of the atmosphere where the smoke is transported, its influence on the AOD data from satellite observations was also visible. (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAs part of its mission to improve the quality of care for women with gynecological cancers across Europe, the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO) first published in 2017 evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with vulvar cancer. ObjectiveTo update the ESGO guidelines based on the new evidence addressing the management of vulvar cancer and to cover new topics in order to provide comprehensive guidelines on all relevant issues of diagnosis and treatment of vulvar cancer. MethodsThe ESGO Council nominated an international development group comprised of practicing clinicians who provide care to vulvar cancer patients and have demonstrated leadership through their expertize in clinical care and research, national and international engagement and profile as well as dedication to the topics addressed to serve on the expert panel (18 experts across Europe). To ensure that the statements were evidence-based, new data identified from a systematic search were reviewed and critically appraised. In the absence of any clear scientific evidence, judgment was based on the professional experience and consensus of the international development group. Prior to publication, the guidelines were reviewed by 206 international practitioners in cancer care delivery and patient representatives. ResultsThe updated guidelines cover comprehensively diagnosis and referral, staging, pathology, pre-operative investigations, surgical management (local treatment, groin treatment, sentinel lymph node procedure, reconstructive surgery), (chemo)radiotherapy, systemic treatment, treatment of recurrent disease (vulvar, inguinal, pelvic, and distant recurrences), and follow-up. Management algorithms are also defined.

TI  - A First-Person Account of Developmental Language Disorder
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study is to share the lived experiences of an adult with developmental language disorder (DLD) and relate her experience to the evidence base and issues in clinical practice. Method: We co-wrote a first-person account grounded in the research literature. We organized the account into six main sections: (a) the early signs of DLD; (b) diagnosis; (c) treatment; (d) the impact of DLD on family relationships, social-emotional health, and academic performance; and (e) considerations for practicing speech-language pathologists. We close with (f) the first author's current perspective on life with DLD.Conclusions: The first author was diagnosed with moderate-to-severe DLD in early childhood, and she continues to exhibit subtle and occasional symptoms of DLD as an adult. At specific points in development, her family relationships were disrupted and her social, emotional, and academic functions were disabled, particularly in the school context. Supportive adults, especially her mother and her speech-language pathologist, helped lessen these impacts. DLD and its consequences also positively influenced her worldview and professional choices. The precise nature of her DLD and her experiences around the disorder will not be true of everyone with DLD. Nevertheless, the broad themes that emerge from her narrative are reflected in the evidence base and thus are likely applicable to many individuals with DLD or other neurodevelopmental conditions.

TI  - Influence of the Coriolis Force on Spreading of River Plumes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind is the main external force that governs the spreading of river plumes in the sea. Many previous studies demonstrated that the spreading direction of river plumes (especially small plumes) generally coincides with wind direction. At the same time, the majority of river plumes are strongly affected by the Coriolis force, which is also among the baseline knowledge about the plumes. In this study, we focus on the deflection of plumes from wind direction induced by the Coriolis force, which received little attention before. For this purpose, we analyzed an extensive set of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images of multiple small- and medium-sized river plumes at different parts of the World Ocean and synchronous wind reanalysis data. We demonstrated that the deflection angle is stable for individual river plumes for different wind directions, albeit with certain limitations related to wind speed and coastal morphology. Moreover, the deflection angle is similar for river plumes located at similar latitudes and varies from similar to 0 degrees near the Equator to 15-25 degrees in temperate zones and similar to 30 degrees in polar zones. Finally, we derived a direct relation between latitude and the deflection angle. The obtained results contribute to our understanding of universal features of river plume dynamics, which is important for monitoring and forecasting of delivery and fate of fluvial water and river-borne matter in different coastal regions of the World Ocean.

TI  - Treatment Changes in Breast Cancer Management and De-Escalation of Breast Surgery
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BREAST HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - A better understanding of tumor biology and new drugs have led to significant changes in the management of breast cancer (BC). Radical mastectomy, which had been the treatment for BC for more than a century, was based on the hypothesis that BC is a local-regional disease. In the 1970s, Fisher's studies showed that cancer cells could reach the systemic circulation without passage through the regional lymphatic system. Multidisciplinary treatment of BC, which was now considered a systemic disease, was started and radical mastectomy was replaced by breast-conserving surgery (BCS)+, axillary dissection (AD), systemic chemotherapy, hormonotherapy, and radiotherapy in early-stage BC. Modified radical mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy were applied as a treatment for locally advanced BC. However, later clinical studies demonstrated that the breast can be preserved in those who respond well to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). In the early 1990s, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in early-stage BC (cN0) was performed using blue dye and radioisotope markers. It was shown that AD may be avoided in SLN-negative patients, and SLNB has been a standard intervention in cN0 patients. In this way, the very serious complications of AD, especially lymphedema, were avoided. BC has been shown to be a heterogeneous disease and the tumor may be divided into four different molecular subtypes. Thus, optimal treatment differed from patient to patient (one size fits all was inappropriate), individualized treatments have emerged and over-treatment was avoided. The prolongation of life expectancy and the decrease in recurrence led to an increase in the rate of BCS, an acceptable cosmetic result with oncoplastic surgery, and a better quality of life. The increase in the rate of complete response to NAC with new and targeted agents and especially in human epidermal growth factor receptor-2+ and triple-negative patients with a poor prognosis has led to the use of NAC regardless of cN0. The complete disappearance of the tumor after NAC has been reported by some studies, suggesting that breast surgery may not be needed. However, other studies have shown that vacuum biopsies performed on the tumor bed have a high rate of false negativity. Therefore, it is difficult to suggest that there is no need for lumpectomy, which is cheaper and safer today. The false negativity rate of SLNB is high in patients with cN1 at the time of diagnosis and cN0 after NAC (approximately 13%). In order to reduce this rate to & LE;5%, clinical studies have recommended the use of the dual method, marking the positive lymph node before chemotherapy and removing 3-4 nodules with SLN. In summary, a better understanding of tumor biology and new drugs have changed the management of BC and de-escalate the role of surgical treatment.

TI  - Machine Learning Classifier Evaluation for Different Input Combinations: A Case Study with Landsat 9 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution multispectral remote sensing images offer valuable information about various land features, providing essential details and spatially accurate representations. In the complex urban environment, classification accuracy is not often adequate using the complete original multispectral bands for practical applications. To improve the classification accuracy of multispectral images, band reduction techniques are used, which can be categorized into feature extraction and feature selection techniques. The present study examined the use of multispectral satellite bands, spectral indices (including Normalized Difference Built-up Index, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and Normalized Difference Water Index) for feature extraction, and the principal component analysis technique for feature selection. These methods were analyzed both independently and in combination for the classification of multiple land use and land cover features. The classification was performed for Landsat 9 and Sentinel-2 satellite images in Delhi, India, using six machine learning techniques: Classification and Regression Tree, Minimum Distance, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Tree Boosting, and Support Vector Machine on Google Earth Engine platform. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively to analyze the classification results with whole image (comprehensive feature) and small subset (targeted feature). The RF and GTB classifiers were found to outperform all others in the quantitative analysis of all input combinations for both Landsat 9 and Sentinel-2 datasets. RF achieved a classification total accuracy of 96.19% for Landsat and 96.95% for Sentinel-2, whereas GTB achieved 91.62% for Landsat and 92.89% for Sentinel-2 in all band combinations. Furthermore, the RF classifier achieved the highest F1 score of 0.97 in both the Landsat and Sentinel datasets. The qualitative analysis revealed that the PCA bands were particularly useful to classifiers in distinguishing even the slightest differences among the feature class. The findings contribute to the understanding of feature extraction and selection techniques for land use and land cover classification, offering insights into their effectiveness in different scenarios.

TI  - Natural grasslands across mainland France: A dataset including a 10 m raster and ground reference points
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The data provided here include the first 10 m raster of natural grasslands across mainland France and related ground reference points. The latter consist of 1770 field observations that describe natural and artificial grasslands from respectively a compilation of hundreds of field-based vegetation maps and the European Union Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS). Based on analysis of aerial images, ground reference points were manually extracted from grassland polygons of the field-based vegetation maps and the LPIS within herbaceous areas larger than 30 x 30 m. The raster data of natural grasslands were derived from five annual 10 m land cover maps of France from 2016 -2020. Pixels classified as "grassland" every year from 2016 -2020 were considered natural grasslands, while those classified as "crop" at least once were considered artificial grasslands. Validation using the ground reference points revealed that natural and artificial grasslands were accurately mapped (overall accuracy = 86%). The ground reference points, publicly available in GeoJSON vector format, can be used as training or test samples for spatial modeling. The natural grassland map, publicly available in GeoTIFF raster format, can be used as a predictor variable for spatial modeling or as a base map for landscape ecology analyses.

TI  - Detection of goat herding impact on vegetation cover change using multi-season, multi-herd tracking and satellite imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency and severity of Mediterranean forest fires are expected to worsen as climate change progresses, height-ening the need to evaluate understory fuel management strategies as rigorously as possible. Prescribed small-ruminant foraging is considered a sustainable, cost-effective strategy, but demonstrating a link between animal presence and vegetation change is challenging. This study tested whether the effect of small-ruminant herd presence in Mediterra-nean woodlands can be detected by integrating remote sensing and herd tracking at the landscape scale. The daily for-aging routes of seven shepherded goat herds that exploited a 100-km2 forested area of the Judean Hills, Israel, were tracked over six years using GPS (Global Positioning System) collars. Herd locations were converted to stocking rates, with units of animal-presence-days per unit area per defined time period, and mapped at a spatial resolution of 10 m. We estimated pixel-level vegetation cover change based on a time series of 63 monthly Landsat-8 images expressed as the normalized soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). Spatiotemporal trend analysis assessed the magni-tude and direction of change, and a random forest machine-learning algorithm estimated the relative impact on veg-etation cover change of environmental factors as well as the herd-related factors of stocking rate that accrued over six years and distance to the closest corral. The last two factors were among the most influential factors determining veg-etation cover change in the regional and individual-herd analyses. In some respects, the permanent herds differed in their spatial pattern of stocking rate from the mobile herds that periodically relocated their night corral throughout the year, but stocking rate scaled logarithmically for all herds individually and combined. The combination of multi-season GPS tracking, remote sensing, and machine-learning techniques, applied at a regional scale, detected herd impacts on vegetation cover trends, consistent with livestock foraging being an effective tool for fuel reduction in Mediterranean woodlands.

TI  - The Importance of Including Non-Household Environments in Dengue Vector Control Activities
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Most vector control activities in urban areas are focused on household environments; however, information relating to infection risks in spaces other than households is poor, and the relative risk that these spaces represent has not yet been fully understood. We used data-driven simulations to investigate the importance of household and non-household environments for dengue entomological risk in two Kenyan cities where dengue circulation has been reported. Fieldwork was performed using four strategies that targeted different stages of mosquitoes: ovitraps, larval collections, Prokopack aspiration, and BG-sentinel traps. Data were analyzed separately between household and non-household environments to assess mosquito presence, the number of vectors collected, and the risk factors for vector presence. With these data, we simulated vector and human populations to estimate the parameter m and mosquito-to-human density in both household and non-household environments. Among the analyzed variables, the main difference was found in mosquito abundance, which was consistently higher in non-household environments in Kisumu but was similar in Ukunda. Risk factor analysis suggests that small, clean water-related containers serve as mosquito breeding places in households as opposed to the trash- and rainfall-related containers found in non-household structures. We found that the density of vectors (m) was higher in non-household than household environments in Kisumu and was also similar or slightly lower between both environments in Ukunda. These results suggest that because vectors are abundant, there is a potential risk of transmission in non-household environments; hence, vector control activities should take these spaces into account.

TI  - Superconducting Gravimeters: A Novel Tool for Validating Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration Products
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The practical utility of remote sensing techniques depends on their validation with ground-truth data. Validation requires similar spatial-temporal scales for ground measurements and remote sensing resolution. Evapotranspiration (ET) estimates are commonly compared to weighing lysimeter data, which provide accurate but localized measurements. To address this limitation, we propose the use of superconducting gravimeters (SGs) to obtain ground-truth ET data at larger spatial scales. SGs measure gravity acceleration with high resolution (tenths of nm s(-2)) within a few hundred meters. Similar to lysimeters, gravimeters provide direct estimates of water mass changes to determine ET without disturbing the soil. To demonstrate the practical applicability of SG data, we conducted a case study in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina (Lat: -34.87, Lon: -58.14). We estimated cumulative ET values for 8-day and monthly intervals using gravity and precipitation data from the study site. Comparing these values with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based ET products (MOD16A2), we found a very good agreement at the monthly scale, with an RMSE of 32.6 mm month(-1) (1.1 mm day(-1)). This study represents a step forward in the use of SGs for hydrogeological applications. The future development of lighter and smaller gravimeters is expected to further expand their use.

TI  - Temporal Changes in Mediterranean Pine Forest Biomass Using Synergy Models of ALOS PALSAR-Sentinel 1-Landsat 8 Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, climate change requires the quantification of carbon stored in forest biomass. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data offers a significant advantage over other remote detection measurement methods in providing structural and biomass-related information about ecosystems. This study aimed to develop non-parametric Random Forest regression models to assess the changes in the aboveground forest biomass (AGB), basal area (G), and tree density (N) of Mediterranean pine forests by integrating ALOS-PALSAR, Sentinel 1, and Landsat 8 data. Variables selected from the Random Forest models were related to NDVI and optical textural variables. For 2015, the biomass models with the highest performance integrated ALS-ALOS2-Sentinel 1-Landsat 8 data (R-2 = 0.59) by following the model using ALS data (R-2 = 0.56), and ALOS2-Sentinel 1-Landsat 8 (R-2 = 0.50). The validation set showed that R-2 values vary from 0.55 (ALOS2-Sentinel 1-Landsat 8) to 0.60 (ALS-ALOS2-Sentinel 1-Landsat 8 model) with RMSE below 20 Mg ha(-1). It is noteworthy that the individual Sentinel 1 (R-2 = 0.49). and Landsat 8 (R-2 = 0.47) models yielded equivalent results. For 2020, the AGB model ALOS2-Sentinel 1-Landsat 8 had a performance of R-2 = 0.55 (validation R-2 = 0.70) and a RMSE of 9.93 Mg ha(-1). For the 2015 forest structural variables, Random Forest models, including ALOS PAL-SAR 2-Sentinel 1 Landsat 8 explained between 30% and 55% of the total variance, and for the 2020 models, they explained between 25% and 55%. Maps of the forests' structural variables were generated for 2015 and 2020 to assess the changes during this period using the ALOS PALSAR 2-Sentinel 1-Landsat 8 model. Aboveground biomass (AGB), diameter at breast height (dbh), and dominant height (Ho) maps were consistent throughout the entire study area. However, the Random Forest models underestimated higher biomass levels (>100 Mg ha(-1)) and overestimated moderate biomass levels (30-45 Mg ha(-1)). The AGB change map showed values ranging from gains of 43.3 Mg ha(-1) to losses of -68.8 Mg ha(-1) during the study period. The integration of open-access satellite optical and SAR data can significantly enhance AGB estimates to achieve consistent and long-term monitoring of forest carbon dynamics.

TI  - Retrieval Consistency between LST CCI Satellite Data Products over Europe and Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) data is essential to ensure their high quality for climate applications and research. This study intercompared seven LST products (i.e., ATSR_3, MODISA, MODIST, SLSTRA, SLSTRB, SEVIR2 and SEVIR4) of the European Space Agency's (ESA) LST Climate Change Initiative (LST_cci) project, which are retrieved for polar and geostationary orbit satellites, and three operational LST products: NASA's MODIS MOD11/MYD11 LST and ESA's AATSR LST. All data were re-gridded on to a common spatial grid of 0.05 degrees and matched for concurrent overpasses within 5 min. The matched data were analysed over Europe and Africa for monthly and seasonally aggregated median differences and studied for their dependence on land cover class and satellite viewing geometry. For most of the data sets, the results showed an overall agreement within +/- 2 K for median differences and robust standard deviation (RSD). A seasonal variation of median differences between polar and geostationary orbit sensor data was observed over Europe, which showed higher differences in summer and lower in winter. Over all land cover classes, NASA's operational MODIS LST products were about 2 K colder than the LST_cci data sets. No seasonal differences were observed for the different land covers, but larger median differences between data sets were seen over bare soil land cover classes. Regarding the viewing geometry, an asymmetric increase of differences with respect to nadir view was observed for day-time data, which is mainly caused by shadow effects. For night-time data, these differences were symmetric and considerably smaller. Overall, despite the differences in the LST retrieval algorithms of the intercompared data sets, a good consistency between the LST_cci data sets was determined.

TI  - An IoT System and MODIS Images Enable Smart Environmental Management for Mekong Delta
T2  - FUTURE INTERNET
M3  - Article
AB  - The smart environmental management system proposed in this work offers a new approach to environmental monitoring by utilizing data from IoT stations and MODIS satellite imagery. The system is designed to be deployed in vast regions, such as the Mekong Delta, with low building and operating costs, making it a cost-effective solution for environmental monitoring. The system leverages telemetry data collected by IoT stations in combination with MODIS MOD09GA, MOD11A1, and MCD19A2 daily image products to develop computational models that calculate the values land surface temperature (LST), 2.5 and 10 (mu m) particulate matter mass concentrations (PM2.5 and PM10) in areas without IoT stations. The MOD09GA product provides land surface spectral reflectance from visible to shortwave infrared wavelengths to determine land cover types. The MOD11A1 product provides thermal infrared emission from the land surface to compute LST. The MCD19A2 product provides aerosol optical depth values to detect the presence of atmospheric aerosols, e.g., PM2.5 and PM10. The collected data, including remote sensing images and telemetry sensor data, are preprocessed to eliminate redundancy and stored in cloud storage services for further processing. This allows for automatic retrieval and computation of the data by the smart data processing engine, which is designed to process various data types including images and videos from cameras and drones. The calculated values are then made available through a graphic user interface (GUI) that can be accessed through both desktop and mobile devices. The GUI provides real-time visualization of the monitoring values, as well as alerts to administrators based on predetermined rules and values of the data. This allows administrators to easily monitor the system, configure the system by setting alerting rules or calibrating the ground stations, and take appropriate action in response to alerts. Experimental results from the implementation of the system in Dong Thap Province in the Mekong Delta show that the linear regression models for PM2.5 and PM10 estimations from MCD19A2 AOD values have correlation coefficients of 0.81 and 0.68, and RMSEs of 4.11 and 5.74 mu g/m(3), respectively. Computed LST values from MOD09GA and MOD11A1 reflectance and emission data have a correlation coefficient of 0.82 with ground measurements of air temperature. These errors are comparable to other models reported in similar regions in the literature, demonstrating the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed system.

TI  - Radioisotope-Guided Excision of Mediastinal Lymph Nodes in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma: Feasibility and Clinical Impact
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary We tried to use a small amount of radioactivity, injected around non-small cell lung cancers, to see if this technique can identify the lymph node receiving the flow (and thus potentially the metastases) from the tumour. Our results show that it is possible to do so; this technique could be used to obtain a personalised and potentially safer approach in lung cancer surgery. Background: Intraoperative localisation of nodal disease in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be challenging. Lymph node localisation via radiopharmaceuticals is used in many conditions; we tested the feasibility of this approach in NSCLC. Methods: NSCLC patients were prospectively recruited. Intraoperative peri-tumoral injections of [99mTc]Tc-albumin nanocolloids were performed, followed by removing the tumour and locoregional lymph nodes. These were examined ex vivo with a gamma probe and labelled sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) if they showed any activity or non-sentinel lymph nodes (nSLNs) if they did not. Thereafter, the surgical field was scanned with the probe; any further radioactive lymph node was removed and labelled as "extra" SLNs (eSLNs). All specimens were sent to histology, and metastatic status was recorded. Results: 48 patients were enrolled, and 290 nodal stations were identified: 179 SLNs, 87 nSLNs, and 24 eSLNs. A total of 44 nodal metastases were identified in 22 patients, with 36 of them (82%) located within SLNs. Patients with nSLNs metastases had at least a co-existing positive SLN. No metastases were found in eSLNs. Conclusions: The technique shows high sensitivity for intraoperative nodal metastases identification. This information could allow selective lymphadenectomies in low-risk patients or more aggressive approaches in high-risk patients.

TI  - About the Assessment of Cover Crop Albedo Potential Cooling Effect: Risk of the Darkening Feedback Loop Effects
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Today societies face an unprecedented challenge to limit global warming and restore agricultural soils. Recent studies show that the introduction of cover crops over Europe could result in a cooling impact due to an increase in soil organic carbon stocks, a decrease in the use of fertilizers, and an increase in surface albedo of the croplands. Based on the use of remote sensing data, land cover database, meteorological data, national agricultural statistics, and ground measurements, a generic model was developed to simulate the radiative forcing following the change in surface albedo. This article analyzes the impact of the introduction of cover crops in Europe during the fallow periods. Compared to previous studies, this work discusses: (i) The maximum greening potential in Europe and the associated indirect surface properties changes (ii) for snowfall episodes, and (iii) due to an increase in organic matter. This study shows that the mitigation potential of cover crops through albedo effects could reach 6.74 MtCO(2)-eq.yr(-1) by extending the periods of the introduction of the cover crops to all possible fallow periods. This mitigation could be limited to 5.68 MtCO(2)-eq.yr(-1) if the impact of snowfalls is considered. This would be equivalent to 9.12 gCO(2).m(-2).yr(-1). Finally, this study investigates the feedback loop due to soil darkening with soil organic carbon content increase when cover crops are introduced, considering two scenarios. The first considers the soil organic carbon content increase following repeated incorporation of cover crop biomass into the soil, simulated with the DayCent model. The second, more conceptual and extreme scenario aims at alerting on the possible impact of a combination of carbon farming practices, such as biochar or organic amendments. Our results show that this effect could lead to a loss of 20% of the climate benefit (i.e., 5.39 MtCO(2)-eq.yr(-1)). In conclusion, this study shows that cover crops have a strong potential for climate mitigation through direct albedo effects (soil coverage). However, once introduced, cropland should be permanently covered by vegetation or straws in order to avoid this darkening feedback loop effect.

TI  - Forest Clearing Dynamics and Its Relation to Remotely Sensed Carbon Density and Plant Species Diversity in the Puuc Biocultural State Reserve, Mexico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Puuc Biocultural State Reserve (PBSR) is a unique model for tropical dry forest conservation in Mexico. Preserving forest biodiversity and carbon within the PBSR depends on maintaining low-impact productive activities coordinated by multiple communal and private landowners. In this study, we used state-of-the-art remote sensing data to investigate past spatial patterns in forest clearing dynamics and their relation to forest carbon density and forest plant species richness and diversity in the context of the forest conservation goals of the PBSR. We used a Landsat-based continuous change detection product for the 2000-2021 period and compared it to carbon density and tree species richness models generated from ALOS-2 PALSAR 2 imagery and national scale forest inventory data. The estimated error-adjusted area of detected annual forest clearings from the year 2000 until the year 2021 was 230,511 ha in total (& PLUSMN;19,979 ha). The analysis of annual forest clearing frequency and area suggests that although forest clearing was significantly more intensive outside of the PBSR than within the PBSR during the entire 2000-2021 period, there is no evidence suggesting that the frequency and magnitude of forest clearing changed over the years after the creation of the PBSR in 2011. However, an emergent hotspot analysis shows that high spatiotemporal clustering of forest clearing events (hotspots) during the 2012-2021 period was less common than prior to 2011, and these more recent hotspots have been confined to areas outside the PBSR. After comparing forest clearing events to carbon density and tree species richness models, the results show that landowners outside the PBSR often clear forests with lower carbon density and species diversity than those inside the PBSR. This suggests that, compared to landowners outside the PBSR, landowners within the PBSR might be practicing longer fallow periods allowing forests to attain higher carbon density and tree species richness and hence better soil nutrient recovery after land abandonment. In conclusion, our results show that the PBSR effectively acted as a stabilizing forest management scheme during the 2012-2021 period, minimizing the impact of productive activities by lowering the frequency of forest clearing events and preserving late secondary forests within the PBSR. We recommend continuing efforts to provide alternative optimal field data collection strategies and modeling techniques to spatially predict key tropical forest attributes. Combining these models with continuous change detection datasets will allow for underlying ecological processes to be revealed and the generation of information better adapted to forest governance scales.

AB  - In the present study, the vertical and horizontal growth of Patna Urban Agglomeration was evaluated using the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) technique during 2015-2018. The vertical urban growth assessment of the city landscape was assessed using microwave time series (30 temporal) datasets of Single Look Complex (SLC) Sentinel-1A interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar using SARPROZ software (ver. 2020). This study demonstrated that peripheral city regions experienced higher vertical growth (similar to 4 m year(-1)) compared to the city core regions, owing to higher urban development opportunities leading to significant land use alterations, the development of high-rise buildings, and infrastructural development. While the city core of Patna observed an infill and densification process, as it was already saturated and highly densified. The rapidly urbanizing city in the developing region witnessed a considerable horizontal urban expansion as estimated through the normalized difference index for built-up areas (NDIB) and speckle divergence (SD) using optical Sentinel 2A and microwave Sentinel-1A ground range detected (GRD) satellite data, respectively. The speckle divergence-based method exhibited high urban growth (net growth of 11.28 km(2)) with moderate urban infill during 2015-2018 and reported a higher accuracy as compared to NDIB. This study highlights the application of SAR remote sensing for precise urban area delineation and temporal monitoring of urban growth considering horizontal and vertical expansion through processing a long series of InSAR datasets that provide valuable information for informed decision-making and support the development of sustainable and resilient cities.

TI  - Ship Detection in Low-Quality SAR Images via an Unsupervised Domain Adaption Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection in low-quality Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images poses a persistent challenge. Noise signals in complex environments disrupt imaging conditions, hindering SAR systems from acquiring precise target information, thereby significantly compromising the performance of detectors. Some methods mitigate interference via denoising techniques, while others introduce noise using classical methods to learn target features in the presence of noise. This conundrum is regarded as a cross-domain problem in this paper; a ship detection method in low-quality images is proposed to learn features of targets and shrink serious deterioration of detection performance by utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). First, an image-to-image translation task is implemented using CycleGAN to generate low-quality SAR images with complex interference from the source domain to the target domain. Second, with the annotation inheritance, these generated SAR images participate in a training process to improve the detection accuracy and model robustness. Multiple experiments indicate that the proposed method conspicuously improves the detection performance and efficaciously reduces the missed detection rate in the SAR ship detection task. This cross-domain approach achieved outstanding improvements in the form of 11.0% mAP and 3.22% mAP on the GaoFen-3 ship dataset and SRSSD-V1.0, respectively. In addition, the characteristics and potentials of near-shore and off-shore SAR image reconstruction with style transfer based on Generative Adversarial Networks were explored and analyzed in this work.

TI  - Adolescent male with bilateral succinate dehydrogenase-deficient renal cell carcinoma in a horseshoe kidney managed successfully with staged bilateral robotic-assisted partial nephrectomies: A case report
T2  - UROLOGY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) deficient renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a rare subset of familial RCC with only 59 cases reported. SDH deficiency is associated with hereditary paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma syndrome. Most of the cases are solitary tumors with only two reported cases of bilateral tumor. The identification of SDH deficient RCC is often the sentinel event of patient's syndromic diagnosis. We present a case of an adolescent male with bilateral tumors in a horseshoe kidney who was treated with staged robotic-assisted partial nephrectomies without complication. Both tumors were SDH negative on immunohistochemical staining.

TI  - Improving Railway Alignment Selection in Mountainous Areas with Complex Vegetation: A Multisource Data Landslide Identification Approach for Assisted Decision-Making Research
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to provide important assistance for the scientific and effective route selection of future planned railways in the research area and to quickly and accurately identify the distribution range of landslides, thereby proactively mitigating the impact of geological hazards on railways under earthquake conditions, this study aims to shift the risk threshold for geological hazards and provide a scientific basis for the accurate planning and route selection of railways in mountainous areas. Jiuzhaigou was selected as the research area and postearthquake surface deformation information in the study area was obtained through Sentinel-1 satellite radar data. Based on Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing imagery, the changes in vegetation indices in the study area before and after the earthquake were analyzed in depth. The concept of vegetation index difference was proposed as a characteristic parameter for landslide information interpretation and a method combining surface deformation information was developed for landslide information interpretation. According to this method, the study area experienced a deformation subsidence of up to 14.93 cm under the influence of the earthquake, with some areas experiencing an uplift of approximately 6.0 cm. The vegetation index difference in the research area ranged from -1.83502 to 1.45366. The total number of landslides extracted is 12.034 km(2) and 164 landslide points are marked, with an overall recognition accuracy of 92.6% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.876. The research results provide new research ideas for landslide information interpretation and can be used to assist in the decision-making of mountain railroad alignment options.

TI  - Calibration of volumetric soil moisture using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery by Google Earth Engine
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Water scarcity for agriculture is increasingly evident due to climatic alterations and inadequate management of this resource. Therefore, developing digital models that help improve water resource management to provide solutions to agronomic problems in northern Mexico is necessary. In this context, the objective of the present research is to calibrate the Optical Trapezoidal (OPTRAM) and Thermal-Optical Trapezoidal (TOTRAM) models to estimate the volumetric soil moisture at different depths through vegetation indices derived from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images using Google Earth Engine (GEE). Agricultural areas under gravity irrigation and rainfed runoff in the Comarca Lagunera, the lower part of the Hydrological Region No. 36 of the Nazas and Aguanaval rivers were selected for in-situ measurements. The OPTRAM and TOTRAM normalized moisture content (W) estimates were compared with in-situ volumetric soil moisture (& theta;) data. Results indicate that the predictions of OPTRAM errors using Sentinel-2 images showed RMSE between 0.033 to 0.043 cm3 cm-3 and R2 between 0.66 to 0.75, whereas Landsat-8 errors showed RSME from 0.036 to 0.057 cm3 cm-3 and R2 between 0.70 to 0.81. On the other hand, TOTRAM errors showed RMSE between 0.045 to 0.053 cm3 cm-3 and R2 between 0.62 to 0.85 through calibrations. This study made it possible to evaluate the most accurate combinations of the pixel distributions of each model and vegetation indices for the estimation of volumetric soil moisture within the different phenological stages of the crops.

TI  - Tree canopy density thresholds for improved forests cover estimation in protected areas of madagascar
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rich endemic biodiversity of Madagascar is concentrated in different types of natural forests primarily conserved within the network of protected areas (PAs). Since 1990, remote sensing has been utilized to monitor forest cover. The latest forest cover map generated using these techniques provides accurate estimates of natural forest cover within the PAs network. However, the standardized application of Tree Canopy Density (TCD), as used in global assessments of forest cover, yields erroneous estimates for different forest types in Madagascar because the standard TCD cannot be globally applied to all types of forests. Our study aims to utilize global remote sensing data at the scale of PAs to identify specific TCD thresholds for individual PAs. Starting from the year 2000 data, the application of these thresholds will allow us to estimate deforestation in subsequent years at reduced costs. We used the official PA boundaries, a reliable forest cover map at the national scale, and the TCDs published at a global scale to infer the values of TCD to be applied in each PA. The standard TCD threshold above 30% overestimates humid and dry forests and underestimates dry spiny forests in Madagascar. Our specific TCD thresholds inferred for each PA accurately estimate the forest cover in the vast majority of PAs. Using these specific TCD thresholds will allow for improved monitoring of forest cover within the network of PAs. The methodology detailed here can also be applied in other geographic regions, and future improvements in data on forest cover-both remotely sensed and field-collected-will enhance our ability to estimate forest cover and its changes over time.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) Effect Based on the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) Classification Scheme for Two Japanese Cities, Hiroshima, and Sapporo
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification system is used in this study to analyze the impacts of urban morphology on a surface urban heat island (SUHI). Our study involved a comparative analysis of SUHI effects in two Japanese cities, Sapporo and Hiroshima, between 2000 to 2022. We used geographical-information-system (GIS) mapping techniques to measure temporal LST changes using Landsat 7 and 8 images during the summer's hottest month (August) and classified the study area into LCZ classes using The World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) method with Google Earth Pro. The urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) is used to examine each LCZ's thermal comfort level, and the SUHI heat spots (HS) in each LCZ classes are identified. The research findings indicate that the mean LST in Sapporo only experienced a 0.5 & DEG;C increase over the time, while the mean LST increased by 1.8 & DEG;C in Hiroshima City between 2000 and 2022. In 2000, open low-rise (LCZ 6) areas in Sapporo were the hottest, but by 2022, heavy industry (LCZ 10) became the hottest. In Hiroshima, compact mid-rise (LCZ 2) areas were the hottest in 2000, but by 2022, heavy-industry areas took the lead. The study found that LCZ 10, LCZ 8, LCZ E, and LCZ 3 areas in both Dfa and Cfa climate classifications had unfavorable UTFVI conditions. This was attributed to factors such as a high concentration of heat-absorbing materials, impervious surfaces, and limited green spaces. The majority of the SUHI HS and areas with the highest surface temperatures were situated near industrial zones and large low-rise urban forms in both cities. The study offers valuable insights into the potential long-term effects of various urban forms on the SUHI phenomenon.

TI  - Assessment of water quality parameters in Muthupet estuary using hyperspectral PRISMA satellite and multispectral images
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous availability of spatial and temporal distributed data from satellite sensors provides more accurate and timely information regarding surface water quality parameters. Remote sensing data has the potential to serve as an alternative to traditional on-site measurements, which can be resource-intensive due to the time and labor involved. This present study aims in exploring the possibility and comparison of hyperspectral and multispectral imageries (PRISMA) for accurate prediction of surface water quality parameters. Muthupet estuary, situated on the south side of the Cauvery River delta on the Bay of Bengal, is selected as the study area. The remote sensing data is acquired from the PRISMA hyperspectral satellite and the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) satellite. The in situ sampling from the study area is performed, and the testing procedures are carried out for analyzing different water quality parameters. The correlations between the water sample results and the reflectance values of satellites are analyzed to generate appropriate algorithmic models. The study utilized data from both the PRISMA and Sentinel satellites to develop models for assessing water quality parameters such as total dissolved solids, chlorophyll, pH, and chlorides. The developed models demonstrated strong correlations with R-2 values above 0.80 in the validation phase. PRISMA-based models for pH and chlorophyll displayed higher accuracy levels than Sentinel-based models with R-2 > 0.90.

TI  - Utilization, user characteristics, and adverse outcomes of insulin glargine originators and follow-on drug in patients with diabetes in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE & SPECIALTY PHARMACY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The first follow-on drug (Basaglar) of the originator insulin glargine (Lantus), a long-acting insulin for treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM, T2DM), was approved in 2015 in the United States. Information on the uptake, user characteristics, and outcomes of follow-on insulin remains sparse.OBJECTIVE: To describe the utilization, user characteristics, and health outcomes of the follow-on insulin glargine and insulin glargine originators in a large, distributed network of primarily commercially insured patients in the United States.METHODS: We used health care claims data in the US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel common data model format across 5 research partners in the Biologics & Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium distributed research network. Sentinel analytic tools were used to identify adult users of insulin glargine between January 1, 2011, and February 28, 2021, and describe patient demographics, baseline clinical characteristics, and adverse health events among users of the originators and the follow-on drug, stratified by diabetes type. RESULTS: We identified 508,438 users of originator drugs and 63,199 users of the follow-on drug. The proportions of the follow-on drug users among total insulin glargine users were 9.1% (n = 7,070) for T1DM and 11.4% (n = 56,129) for T2DM. Follow-on use rose from 8.2% in 2017 to 24.8% in 2020, accompanied by a steady decrease in the use of originator drugs. Demographics of the users of the originators and follow-on drug were similar among the T1DM and T2DM groups. Overall, follow-on users had poorer baseline health profile and higher propor-tions of episodes with adverse events in the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of increased uptake of the follow-on drug rela-tive to the originator products in the post-2016 period. The differences in the base-line clinical characteristics between users of the originator products and the follow-on drug and their relationship with health out-comes merit further research.

TI  - Channel Dynamics of a Middle Reach of Rapti River, Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Rapti a foothills-fed river is emerging from the Lesser Himalayan zone of southern Nepal. It has shifted its course at its foothills and middle reaches several times and has been affecting many localities in the last few decades. Keeping this in view a severely affected 94 km. long stretch of Rapti river flowing in the Shravasti district of eastern Uttar Pradesh was selected for the study of channel dynamics. In the present work, the geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques were used to evaluate the river shifting and assessment of related effects on the adjacent landscapes between the years 1980 to 2020. Satellite image of Landsat and Sentinel was also used to determine the spatio-temporal changes occurring in the river channel for the last forty years. The river channels, their centre lines and bars were digitized in a GIS environment and all channels were divided into four reaches, viz. A, B, C and D. Twenty cross-sections perpendicular to the centre line representing the position of the channel in the year 1980 were drawn. The sinuosity index, measurements of the channel migration, channel width and bank line shift of the channel were calculated.The sinuosity indices of the river channels for the years 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 were computed as 1.52, 1.47, 1.47, 1.70 and 1.48, respectively. Temporal changes in sinuosity exhibit the meandering pattern of the river channel. Overlayed active channel centre lines of the years 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 show the migrational trend of the river channel. The maximum migration has occurred along reaches A and D. The extensive migration and sedimentation in the channel also alter the channel width that varies significantly along reaches A and C. Apart from this, the geomorphic features viz. channel migration, bank line erosion, abandoned channels, expansion of meanders, oxbow lake, chute cut off, neck cut off, etc. were identified as indicators of active erosion on the flood plain of the Rapti. It has been observed that river migration and bank line erosion are severely affecting the many rural settlements situated in the active flood plain. This study infers that the Rapti river channel has been migrating frequently for the last forty years and is increasing the vulnerability of flood hazards in its active flood plains.

AB  - The article presents the results of a literature review whose objective was to produce a summary and analysis on diversity in the gerontological field in Latin America and the Caribbean. Studies carried out between 2010 and 2021 on the aging experiences of older people with disabilities, members of the LGBT community, migrants, and Indigenous peoples were reviewed. The literature review was guided by the SALSA (Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis and Analysis) method. The results were analyzed by group, showing central themes for each one: for the disability group, limitations in old age as generators of deterioration and decline, making social participation impossible; for the LGBT group, the weight of social norms that restrict the expression of dissident sexual and gender identities; for the migration group, the intersection with the theme of care and the ambivalences linked to a binational life course; and for the Indigenous group, the tensions between the worldview of First Nations people and the cultural changes impacting their social role. Transversal discursive axes were identified in the corpus, highlighting the unequal and exclusionary old age that many people experience at the same time as the capacity for agency, reinvention, and resistance that these elderly people manifest in their daily practices.

TI  - Warm Rain Analysis from Remote Sensing Data in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona for 2015-2022
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Metropolitan Area of Barcelona is one of the most densely populated European regions. The hydrological conditions are very extreme, as are those of the Mediterranean Basin, with long drought periods. The management of water systems is one of the priorities, implying the understanding of the whole life cycle of water. One of the worst-known steps in this cycle corresponds to the rainfall events occurring between warm and cold periods, with quasi-tropical precipitation but with little or no lightning activity. This manuscript relies on the analysis of this type of precipitation for 2015-2022 for characterization and modelling to provide the signatures that can help diagnose these events in real time. The comparison of cold convective and warm rain events thorough radar, lightning and numerical weather prediction data has allowed us to find the main differences between both types. Warm rain events are predominant in the region, with more than 70% cases exceeding 10 mm of daily precipitation. The maritime influence is crucial in most of the warm rain episodes.

AB  - Wetlands are transition zones between aquatic and terrestrial environments that are home to several animal and plant species, providing several ecosystem services. Murundus fields are typical wetlands of the Brazilian Cerrado, with an important role in local biodiversity and water regime. The present study aimed to detect the murundus fields in the Claro river basin (MG) using Sentinel 2 satellite images. For this, the Google Earth Engine platform was used to implement an algorithm based on machine learning (Random Forests) aiming to map the study area from four distinct combinations of input data. The results indicate that the joint use of all Sentinel-2 bands and the normalized difference water index was the most efficient, presenting 71.95% producer accuracy, 79.42% user accuracy and F-measure of 75.5%. Furthermore, it is observed that the combination of the near-infrared and red-edge bands result in a satisfactory F-measure index (69.39%), indicating that these spectral regions provide important information to detect wetlands. The development of technologies that assist in the detection and monitoring of murundus fields can aid in the preservation of these habitats. Due to its processing in the cloud, GEE has the potential to map wetlands over large areas.

TI  - To Make Known in Order to Recognize: Schools as Vehicles for Constructing Identity for the Maya Peoples
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the Guatemalan population is made up of 53% Indigenous peoples, there is a certain belief according to which Indigenous peoples are still currently associated with underdevelopment, inferiority, submission, and exploitation, causing the belief that, for many, being Mayan is not synonymous with identity, but with poverty, neglect, and inferiority. Through a biographical-naturalist study, we delve into how Guatemalan teachers experienced not only their Mayan being, but also how the construction of their identity was gestated in schools. After carrying out the data analysis process, we underline and describe how the Mayan culture, worldview, and language still constitutes a difficulty and an obstacle to the construction of the personal identity of Indigenous peoples in Guatemala. We describe the experience lived in monolingual and monoethnic schools in which not only is the Mayan culture not recognized, but the use of the language and its expression are prohibited. We review the repercussions that the actions of the political agendas have on the key of recognition, highlighting how, beyond the legislative indications, it is the involvement and personal actions of teachers that is making it possible to make known and recognize the Mayan culture.

TI  - Ancestral Practices for Water and Land Management: Experiences in a Latin American Indigenous Reserve
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification and analysis of mythical images and ancestral practices that make up the ethnos of a community allow us to know its ways of existing in the cosmos. The objective of this paper is to analyze the ancestral experiences associated with the dynamics of socio-environmental management that the Embera Indigenous reserve (Choco, Colombia) carries out for the conservation of water and land. This study is qualitative and ideographic. We also adopted an ethnographic approach to provide a detailed description of water and land management practices, which correspond to their cultural patterns. Using Atlas Ti V.6.0 software, we identify and analyze these cultural patterns. The results show that the ecosystemic relationships offered by the Embera worldview are part of a true connection with their spiritual world, which fosters respect for the natural elements and understanding of universal natural laws. These relationships are manifested through gifts and penance. The Embera beliefs and religion are a possible methodology for the sustainable management of water and land and, consequently, of the basin where they live. The success of their ethnodevelopment depends significantly on the power figures of their culture: the Jaibana (their gods), the elders, and the Embera woman as a cultural agent. The Embera worldview is possibly a valid instrument to enable the sustainable development of modern communities.

TI  - Marine Pollution and Advances in Biomonitoring in Cartagena Bay in the Colombian Caribbean
T2  - TOXICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Coastal zones sustain extensive biodiversity, support key processes for ocean dynamics, and influence the balance of the global environment. They also provide resources and services to communities, determine their culture, and are the basis for their economic growth. Cartagena Bay in the Colombian Caribbean is the place of the establishment of one of the country's main cities, which has a great historical and tourist attraction, and it is also the location of the main commercial port and a great variety of industries. Historically, it has been affected by several environmental impacts and intense pollution. This situation has gained the attention of different researchers, so herein is presented a literature review with a systematic approach using RStudio's bibliometrix on the presence of pollutants and the impact on biodiversity in recent decades, providing a critical analysis of the state of Cartagena Bay and its future needs to ensure its recovery and conservation. In addition, the socioeconomic dynamics related to the environmental state of Cartagena Bay are presented from the framework drivers, pressures, status, impacts, and responses (DPSIR). The update and critical understanding of the sources, fate, and effects of pollution are important not only for the knowledge of the status of this singular ecosystem but also to encourage future research and entrench evidence to support decision makers' actions. This review highlights that several pollutants that have been detected exceeding sediment quality guidelines, like As, Cd, Hg, and PAH, are also reported to bioaccumulate and cause damage throughout the trophic levels of the coastal environment. In addition, the potential use of sentinel species and biomarkers for their monitoring is discussed. Finally, the factors that cause pollution and threaten the state of the bay continue to exert pressure and impact; thus, there is a call for the further monitoring of this ecosystem and the strengthening of policies and regulations.

TI  - Combining Irradiation and Biological Control against Brown Marmorated Stink Bug: Are Sterile Eggs a Suitable Substrate for the Egg Parasitoid <i>Trissolcus japonicus</i>?
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Halyomorpha halys is an alien stink bug species native to south-eastern Asia, and is now widely distributed and very invasive worldwide. Management of this pest by chemical insecticides is not very effective because of the high mobility of the pest species and its innate ability to develop resistance to most of the synthetic insecticides applied. For this reason, classical biological control has been considered, with attention focused on co-evolved egg parasitoids, which oviposit and complete their larval development within a single egg of the host. The detection and collection of the egg parasitoid species is often conducted by exposing newly oviposited egg-masses of the stink bug pest in the field for a few days as sentinels, which can then be parasitized by the egg parasitoids. In newly invaded areas, limiting factors in the use of sentinel eggs include the short amount of time that they are a suitable substrate for the oviposition of the egg parasitoid and the risk of the unintentional release of additional pests from unparasitized eggs. A valid potential alternative is to use sterile sentinel eggs of the pest species. This study focused on the evaluation of the performance of three types of sterile sentinel eggs for the oviposition and the larval development of the egg parasitoid Trissolcus japonicus. The brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys, is a phytophagous invasive pest native to south-eastern Asia, and it is now distributed worldwide. This species is considered to be one of the most damaging insect pests in North America and in Europe. In agriculture, the predominant approach to managing BMSB is based on the use of insecticides, specifically pyrethroids and neonicotinoids. Unfortunately, the biology of the species and its facility to develop mechanisms of resistance to available pesticides has induced farmers and scientists to develop different, least-toxic, and more effective strategies of control. In a territorial area-wide approach, the use of a classical biological control program in combination with other least-toxic strategies has been given prominent consideration. Following exploratory surveys in the native range, attention has focused on Trissolcus japonicus, a small scelionid egg parasitoid wasp that is able to oviposit and complete its larval development in a single egg of H. halys. A common method for detecting egg parasitoids in the native range involves the placement of so-called 'sentinel' egg masses of the pest in the environment for a short period, which are then returned to the laboratory to determine if any of them are parasitized. Outside of the area of origin, the use of fertile sentinel eggs of the alien species may lead to the further release of the pest species; an alternative is to use sterile sentinel eggs to record the presence of new indigenous egg parasitoids or to detect the dispersal of alien species (in this case, T. japonicus) released in a new environment to control the target insect pest species. This study evaluated the performance of three types of sterile sentinel eggs as a suitable substrate for the oviposition and larval development of the egg parasitoid T. japonicus in a context of combining classical biological control with a Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) approach.

TI  - Monitoring Braided River-Bed Dynamics at the Sub-Event Time Scale Using Time Series of Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing plays a central role in the assessment of environmental phenomena and has increasingly become a powerful tool for monitoring shorelines, river morphology, flood-wave delineation and flood assessment. Optical-based monitoring and the characterization of river evolution at long time scales is a key tool in fluvial geomorphology. However, the evolution occurring during extreme events is crucial for the understanding of the river dynamics under severe flow conditions and requires the processing of data from active sensors to overcome cloud obstructions. This work proposes a cloud-based unsupervised algorithm for the intra-event monitoring of river dynamics during extreme flow conditions based on the time series of Sentinel-1 SAR data. The method allows the extraction of multi-temporal series of spatially explicit geometric parameters at high temporal and spatial resolutions, linking them to the hydrometric levels acquired by reference gauge stations. The intra-event reconstruction of inundation dynamics has led to (1) the estimation of the relationship between hydrometric level and wet area extension and (2) the assessment of bank erosion phenomena. In the first case, the behavior exhibits a change when the hydrometric level exceeds 1 m. In the second case, the erosion rate and cumulative lateral erosion were evaluated. The maximum erosion velocity was greater than 1 m/h, while the cumulative lateral erosion reached 130 m. Time series of SAR acquisitions, provided by Sentinel-1 satellites, were analyzed to quantify changes in the wet area of a reach of the Tagliamento river under different flow conditions. The algorithm, developed within the Python-API of GEE, can support many types of analyses of river dynamics, including morphological changes, floods monitoring, and bio-physical habitat dynamics. The results encourage future advancements and applications of the algorithm, specifically exploring SAR data from ICEYE and Capella Space constellations, which offer significantly higher spatial and temporal resolutions compared to Sentinel-1 data.

TI  - Crop Mapping without Labels: Investigating Temporal and Spatial Transferability of Crop Classification Models Using a 5-Year Sentinel-2 Series and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal crop classification approaches have demonstrated high performance within a given season. However, cross-season and cross-region crop classification presents a unique transferability challenge. This study addresses this challenge by adopting a domain generalization approach, e.g., by training models on multiple seasons to improve generalization to new, unseen target years. We utilize a comprehensive five-year Sentinel-2 dataset over different agricultural regions in Slovakia and a diverse crop scheme (eight crop classes). We evaluate the performance of different machine learning classification algorithms, including random forests, support vector machines, quadratic discriminant analysis, and neural networks. Our main findings reveal that the transferability of models across years differs between regions, with the Danubian lowlands demonstrating better performance (overall accuracies ranging from 91.5% in 2022 to 94.3% in 2020) compared to eastern Slovakia (overall accuracies ranging from 85% in 2022 to 91.9% in 2020). Quadratic discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and neural networks consistently demonstrated high performance across diverse transferability scenarios. The random forest algorithm was less reliable in generalizing across different scenarios, particularly when there was a significant deviation in the distribution of unseen domains. This finding underscores the importance of employing a multi-classifier analysis. Rapeseed, grasslands, and sugar beet consistently show stable transferability across seasons. We observe that all periods play a crucial role in the classification process, with July being the most important and August the least important. Acceptable performance can be achieved as early as June, with only slight improvements towards the end of the season. Finally, employing a multi-classifier approach allows for parcel-level confidence determination, enhancing the reliability of crop distribution maps by assuming higher confidence when multiple classifiers yield similar results. To enhance spatiotemporal generalization, our study proposes a two-step approach: (1) determine the optimal spatial domain to accurately represent crop type distribution; and (2) apply interannual training to capture variability across years. This approach helps account for various factors, such as different crop rotation practices, diverse observational quality, and local climate-driven patterns, leading to more accurate and reliable crop classification models for nationwide agricultural monitoring.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Parameters in Boreal Artificial Coniferous Forests Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to evaluate forest quality and carbon stocks and improve our understanding of ecosystems and carbon cycling processes, the accurate measurement of aboveground biomass (AGB) and other forest characteristics is crucial. This paper considers the response differences between the bands obtained from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A sensors, respectively, and combines the exhaustive combination of spectral indices with normalization and ratio techniques to establish suitable weights for the bands in the vegetation index using relative sensitivity and noise equivalent (NE) to improve the saturation effect between the vegetation index and forest parameters (canopy closure (CC), forest stand density (S), basal area (BA), and AGB) and extend the linear relationship between them. This paper also considers the effects of window size, direction, and principal component analysis on texture features, adds weight to textures and combines textures using linear correlation and NE, establishes texture indices to improve the limitations of information contained in individual texture features, analyzes the potential of texture features to evaluate each forest parameter under different conditions, and better captures the variation of forest parameters. In this paper, we only analyze the planted coniferous forest in Saihanba to avoid the differences in electromagnetic wave effects that are difficult to judge and analyze because of the differences in leaf size and leaf orientation between coniferous and broad-leaf forests. In contrast, the vegetation indices and texture indices obtained from Sentinel-2A could better estimate each vegetation parameter, and the linear estimation of each vegetation parameter using the new texture index reached an R-2 above 0.65. The results of this study indicate that Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 are promising remote sensing datasets for estimating vegetation parameters at the regional scale, and Sentinel-2A data can be employed as the primary source of earth observation data for assessing forest resources in the Saihanba area.

T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The prospecting area is located in the eastern part of Iran. Aster and Landsat 8 satellite images were processed with different spectral analyses techniques to detect the clay representing the alteration zones, with emphasis on bentonite occurrences in the study area. Band Feature Fitting (SFF), and Least Square Fit (LS-Fit) techniques were performed to show the promising areas for clay mineral. Band ratios of 6/7, 6/5, and 4/2 from Landsat 8 OLI imagery and 4/6, 5/6, 5/8, from ASTER were used to enhance clay alterations. The results obtained from the supervised classification using the SAM algorithm for minerals from US Geological Survey spectral library (USGS) have been compared with the results of Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) spectral library. The Sequential Maximum Angle Convex Cone (SMACC) algorithm also performed to detect same minerals. Comparing the different analyzing satellite image based on ASTER data indicate all methods generate relatively similar results for clay mineral. Although all methods generate relatively similar results, the SAM method seems to be the best fit with geological evidences to generate reliable promising areas for clay mineral in this area. Based on this study, around 100 km2 of the total studied area was selected as suitable for more exploration and ground survey.

TI  - Hyperspectral Bare Soil Index (HBSI): Mapping Soil Using an Ensemble of Spectral Indices in Machine Learning Environment
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral remote-sensing indices based on visible, NIR, and SWIR wavelengths are useful in predicting spatial patterns of bare soil. However, identifying an effective combination of informative wavelengths or spectral indices for mapping bare soil in a complex urban/agricultural region is still a challenge. In this study, we developed a new bare-soil index, the Hyperspectral Bare Soil Index (HBSI), to improve the accuracy of bare-soil remote-sensing mapping. We tested the HBSI using the high-spectral-resolution AVIRIS-NG and Sentinel-2 multispectral images. We applied an ensemble modeling approach, consisting of random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), to classify bare soil. We found that the HBSI outperformed other existing bare-soil indices with over 91% accuracy for Sentinel-2 and AVIRIS-NG. Furthermore, the combination of the HBSI and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed a better performance in bare-soil classification, with >92% accuracy for Sentinel-2 and >97% accuracy for AVIRIS-NG images. Also, the RF-SVM ensemble surpassed the performance of the individual models. The novelty of HBSI is due to its development, since it utilizes the blue band in addition to the NIR and SWIR2 bands from the high-spectral-resolution data from AVIRIS-NG to improve the accuracy of bare-soil mapping.

TI  - Navigating nature's toll: Assessing the ecological impact of the refugee crisis in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The Rohingya crisis in Myanmar's Rakhine state has resulted in a significant influx of refugees into Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. However, the ecological impact of this migration has received limited attention in research. This study aimed to address this gap by utilizing remote sensing data and machine learning techniques to model the ecological quality (EQ) of the region before and after the refugee influx. To quantify changes in land use and land cover (LULC), three supervised machine learning classification methods, namely artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF), were applied. The most accurate LULC maps obtained from these methods were then used to assess changes in ecosystem service valuation and function resulting from the land use changes. Furthermore, fuzzy logic models were employed to examine the EQ conditions before and after the Rohingya influx. The findings of the study indicate that the increased number of Rohingya refugees has led to a 9.58% decrease in forest area, accompanied by an 8.25% increase in settlement areas. The estimated total ecosystem services value (ESV) in the research area was $67.83 million in 2017 and $67.78 million in 2021, respectively. The ESV for forests experienced a significant decline of 21.97%, equivalent to a decrease of $5.33 million. Additionally, the reduction in forest lands has contributed to a 13.58% decline in raw materials and a 14.57% decline in biodiversity. Furthermore, utilizing a Markovian transition probability model, our analysis reveals that the EQ conditions in the area have deteriorated from "very good" or "good" to "bad" or "very bad" following the Rohingya influx. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of integrating ecological considerations into decision-making processes and developing proactive measures to mitigate the environmental impact of such large-scale migrations.

TI  - Low Prevalence of <i>Schistosoma mekongi</i> Infection and High Prevalence of Other Helminth Infections among Domestic Animals in Southern Lao People's Democratic Republic
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - The prevalence of Schistosoma mekongi in humans in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has been relatively well monitored and has decreased due to effective interventions such as preventative chemotherapy with mass drug administration of praziquantel and community awareness programs. However, the prevalence among potential domestic reservoir animals remains broadly unclear, except for a few villages in the endemic area. Therefore, we conducted S. mekongi surveys for the domestic animals that had contact with Mekong River water. We conducted a cross-sectional study of the domestic animals in the seven sentinel villages in the Khong and Mounlapamok Districts of Champasak Province in southern Lao PDR in 2018 by random sampling with a statistically reliable sample size. Stool samples of the five predominant domestic animal species, cattle (n = 160), pig (n = 154), buffalo (n = 149), dog (n = 143), and goat (n = 85), were collected and examined using parasitological FECT method and the LAMP technique. The microscopic analysis did not detect any eggs of S. mekongi in the stool samples of any animal species. However, S. mekongi DNA was detected by the LAMP test in dog stool samples (0.7%; 1/143). On the other hand, the prevalence of other helminths was quite high and heterogeneous among animal species and sentinel sites by the microscopic analysis. These findings suggested that an intervention for S. mekongi infection should focus solely on human populations. However, periodic surveillance for S. mekongi infection among dogs should be conducted to monitor a possible resurgence of S. mekongi infection in the domestic animal population.

TI  - Thaw-Season InSAR Surface Displacements and Frost Susceptibility Mapping to Support Community-Scale Planning in Ilulissat, West Greenland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In permafrost regions, ground surface deformations induced by freezing and thawing threaten the integrity of the built environment. Mapping the frost susceptibility of the ground at a high spatial resolution is of practical importance for the construction and planning sectors. We processed Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data from thawing seasons 2015 to 2019, acquired over the area of Ilulissat, West Greenland. We used a least-squares inversion scheme to retrieve the average seasonal displacement (S) and long-term deformation rate (R). We secondly investigated two different methods to extrapolate active layer thickness (ALT) measurements, based on their statistical relationship with remotely sensed surface characteristics. A generalized linear model (GLM) was first implemented, but the model was not able to fit the data and represent the ALT spatial variability over the entire study domain. ALT were alternatively averaged per vegetation class, using a land cover map derived by supervised classification of Sentinel-2 images. We finally estimated the active layer ice content and used it as a proxy to map the frost susceptibility of the ground at the community scale. Fine-grained sedimentary basins in Ilulissat were typically frost susceptible and subject to average seasonal downward displacements of 3 to 8 cm. Areas following a subsiding trend of up to 2.6 cm/yr were likely affected by permafrost degradation and melting of ground ice below the permafrost table. Our approach enabled us to identify frost-susceptible areas subject to severe seasonal deformations, to long-term subsidence induced by degrading permafrost, or to both. Used in combination with traditional site investigations, InSAR maps provide valuable information for risk management and community planning in the Arctic.

TI  - Machine Learning and VIIRS Satellite Retrievals for Skillful Fuel Moisture Content Monitoring in Wildfire Management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the fuel moisture content (FMC) of 10 h dead vegetation is crucial for managing and mitigating the impact of wildland fires. The combination of in situ FMC observations, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, and satellite retrievals has facilitated the development of machine learning (ML) models to estimate 10 h dead FMC retrievals over the contiguous US (CONUS). In this study, ML models were trained using variables from the National Water Model, the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) NWP model, and static surface properties, along with surface reflectances and land surface temperature (LST) retrievals from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument on the Suomi-NPP satellite system. Extensive hyper-parameter optimization resulted in skillful FMC models compared to a daily climatography RMSE (+44%) and an hourly climatography RMSE (+24%). Notably, VIIRS retrievals played a significant role as predictors for estimating 10 h dead FMC, demonstrating their importance as a group due to their high band correlation. Conversely, individual predictors within the HRRR group exhibited relatively high importance according to explainability techniques. Removing both HRRR and VIIRS retrievals as model inputs led to a significant decline in performance, particularly with worse RMSE values when excluding VIIRS retrievals. The importance of the VIIRS predictor group reinforces the dynamic relationship between 10 h dead fuel, the atmosphere, and soil moisture. These findings underscore the significance of selecting appropriate data sources when utilizing ML models for FMC prediction. VIIRS retrievals, in combination with selected HRRR variables, emerge as critical components in achieving skillful FMC estimates.

TI  - Using Remote and Proximal Sensing in Organic Agriculture to Assess Yield and Environmental Performance
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite and sensor-based systems of site-specific fertilization have been developed almost exclusively in conventional farming. Agronomic and ecological advantages can also be expected from these digital methods in organic farming. However, it has not yet been investigated whether the algorithms and models are also applicable under organic farming conditions. In this study, the digital data and systems tested in the years 2021 and 2022 in southern Germany were (a) reflectance measurements with a tractor-mounted multispectral sensor, calculation of the vegetation index REIP, and application of algorithms; (b) satellite data in combination with the plant growth model PROMET; and (c) determination of the vegetation index NDVI based on satellite data. They were used to determine plant parameters (crop yield, biomass potential) and to calculate nitrogen balances at a high spatial resolution (10 x 10 m). The digital systems were tested at two sites with different organic farming systems (arable farming and dairy farming). Validation of the digital methods was carried out with ground-truth data from manual biomass sampling and combine harvester yield measurement. The nitrate leaching risk from the crop rotations of the farms was analyzed via site-specific N balancing using multi-year satellite data. The N balances were validated by measuring nitrate concentrations in leakage water. Additionally, soil properties, such as soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN), were measured at the sub-field level. Using geostatistics, plant data, soil properties, and nitrate measurements were transferred into grids of the same resolution to enable correlation analyses. The correlations between yield determined with digital systems and the validation data were up to r = 0.77. Site-specific N balancing showed moderately positive correlations with nitrate concentrations in leakage water (r = 0.50-0.66). The strongly positive influence of the soil properties SOC and TN on crop yields underlines the importance of soil organic matter on soil fertility and site-specific yield potentials. The results show that digital methods allow the spatially high-resolution determination of yields and nitrogen balances in organic farming. This can be the basis for new management strategies in organic farming, e.g., the targeted use of limited nutrients to increase yields. Further validations under differentiated soil, climate, and management conditions are required to develop remote and proximal sensing applications in organic farming.

TI  - Predicting Water Quality Distribution of Lakes through Linking Remote Sensing-Based Monitoring and Machine Learning Simulation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study links monitoring and simulation models to predict water quality distribution in lakes using an optimized neural network and remote sensing data processing. Two data driven models were developed. First, a monitoring model was established that is able to convert spectral images to TDS distribution. Moreover, a simulation model was developed to generate a TDS distribution map for unseen scenarios for which no spectral images are available. Outputs of the monitoring model were applied as the observations for training the simulation model. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) was utilized in the system performance measurement of the models. Based on the results in the case study, the monitoring model was sufficiently robust to convert the operational land imager spectral bands of Landsat 8 to the TDS distribution map. The NSE was more than 0.6 for the monitoring model, which confirms the predictive skills of the model. Furthermore, the simulation model was highly reliable in generating the TDS distribution map of the lakes. Three tests were carried out to demonstrate the reliability of the model. When comparing the results of the monitoring model and simulation model, an NSE of more than 0.6 was found for all the tests. It is recommendable to apply the proposed method instead of conventional hydrodynamic models that might be highly time consuming for simulating water quality parameters distribution in lakes. Low computational complexity is the main advantage of the proposed method.

TI  - The worldwide COVID-19 lockdown impacts on global secondary inorganic aerosols and radiative budget
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Global lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) led to air pollutant emission reductions. While the COVID-19 lockdown impacts on both trace gas and total particulate pollutants have been widely investigated, secondary aerosol formation from trace gases remains unclear. To that end, we quantify the COVID-19 lockdown impacts on NOx and SO2 emissions and sulfate-nitrate-ammonium aerosols using multiconstituent satellite data assimilation and model simulations. We find that anthropogenic emissions over major polluted regions were reduced by 19 to 25% for NOx and 14 to 20% for SO2 during April 2020. These emission reductions led to 8 to 21% decreases in sulfate and nitrate aerosols over highly polluted areas, corresponding to >34% of the observed aerosol optical depth declines and a global aerosol radiative forcing of +0.14 watts per square meter relative to business-as-usual scenario. These results point to the critical importance of secondary aerosol pollutants in quantifying climate impacts of future mitigation measures.

TI  - Modern and Projected Characteristics of the Seasonal Cycle of Ice Cover in the Russian Arctic Seas
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics of the sea ice conditions in the seas of the Russian Arctic during the period of satellite measurements were studied, and quantitative estimates of their changes in the second half of the 21st century were obtained based on the results of the CMIP6 climate model ensemble using non-mitigation and moderate mitigation scenarios of anthropogenic impact, SSP585 and SSP245, respectively. It has been revealed that the dates of closing (DOC) of the sea ice cover and the length of the open water season (LOWS) are in general successfully reproduced by an ensemble of models. It is shown that DOC will be observed on the average about one month and ten days later under SSP245 scenario and two months later under the SSP585 scenario in 2061-2080 compared to period 1981-2020. At the same time, the increase of LOWS is more than 2.5 months under SSP245 scenario and almost four months under the SSP585 scenario. The most significant changes in DOC are expected in the northern parts of the Barents and Kara seas and in the northwestern part of the Laptev Sea: 2-2.5 months and 2.5-3 months later for the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, respectively.

TI  - Definition and Validation of Vineyard Management Zones Based on Soil Apparent Electrical Conductivity and Altimetric Survey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the current context of increasing costs of production factors, it is essential to optimize the management of available resources, seeking to incorporate technologies that improve knowledge of the variables involved in the agronomic production process. The aim of this study is to define and validate management zones (MZ) in a 3.3 ha vineyard located near evora, in the South of Portugal. A contact sensor ("Veris 2000 XA") was used to map soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and a precision altimetric survey of the field was carried out with a global navigation satellite system receiver (GNSS). The results of these surveys were submitted to geostatistical treatments that allowed the definition of three MZ (less, intermediate, and more productive potential). The validation of such MZ was carried out by laboratory analysis of soil samples (texture, pH, organic matter-OM, moisture content, phosphorous, potassium, exchange bases, and cation exchange capacity-CEC), measurements of soil compaction (cone index-CI) with an electronic cone penetrometer, and through indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI, and Normalized Difference Water Index-NDWI) obtained by remote sensing (RS) using Sentinel-2 satellite images. All these parameters (soil parameters and RS indices) proved the validity of the MZ (of less, intermediate, and more productive potential) defined from the ECa and altimetric survey. This validation attests to the interest of expeditious technological tools for monitoring ECa as a fundamental step in implementing smart agronomic decision-making processes.

TI  - Repeatability and timing of tropical influenza epidemics
T2  - PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Much of the world experiences influenza in yearly recurring seasons, particularly in temperate areas. These patterns can be considered repeatable if they occur predictably and consistently at the same time of year. In tropical areas, including southeast Asia, timing of influenza epidemics is less consistent, leading to a lack of consensus regarding whether influenza is repeatable. This study aimed to assess repeatability of influenza in Vietnam, with repeatability defined as seasonality that occurs at a consistent time of year with low variation. We developed a mathematical model incorporating parameters to represent periods of increased transmission and then fitted the model to data collected from sentinel hospitals throughout Vietnam as well as four temperate locations. We fitted the model for individual (sub)types of influenza as well as all combined influenza throughout northern, central, and southern Vietnam. Repeatability was evaluated through the variance of the timings of peak transmission. Model fits from Vietnam show high variance (sd = 64-179 days) in peak transmission timing, with peaks occurring at irregular intervals and throughout different times of year. Fits from temperate locations showed regular, annual epidemics in winter months, with low variance in peak timings (sd = 32-57 days). This suggests that influenza patterns are not repeatable or seasonal in Vietnam. Influenza prevention in Vietnam therefore cannot rely on anticipation of regularly occurring outbreaks.Author summaryMuch of the world experiences influenza in yearly recurring seasons, particularly in temperate locations. Such seasons occur each year with predictable timing. In tropical locations, even if there are influenza epidemics each year that are labeled influenza seasons, their timing is less consistent and predictable. Here, we define repeatability to refer to regular epidemics that are consistent and predictable in their timing, such as a yearly epidemic occurring during the same time of year. We measured the repeatability of influenza in Vietnam using data collected from ten years of sentinel surveillance. Using a mathematical model, we measured repeatability by estimating the timings of epidemics and how they spread throughout the year. We found that influenza epidemics in northern, central, and southern Vietnam varied widely in their timing; even if an epidemic occurred each year, their timings were typically inconsistent. By contrast, influenza epidemics were highly repeatable in four temperate locations examined. Through this, we show that influenza in Vietnam does not show consistent timings, making preparedness efforts such as vaccination campaigns difficult to design.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Features of the Surface Urban Heat Island of Bacau City (Romania) during the Warm Season and Local Trends of LST Imposed by Land Use Changes during the Last 20 Years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using MODIS and Landsat LST images, the present paper advances a series of results on the characteristics of the surface heat island (SUHI) of Bacau City (Romania) during the warm season (April to September) for a period of 20 years (2001-2020). At the same time, given their higher temporal resolution and their availability for both day and night, MODIS LST was used to understand the spatial features of the SUHI in relation to land use. In this way, a total of 946 MODIS Terra and 483 Landsat satellite images were used to outline the main LST characteristics of the days with clear sky in this middle-sized city in northeast Romania. In order to analyze MODIS LST changes in relation to land use changes in the period 2001-2018, we used the standardized CORINE Land Cover datasets. With the help of the Rodionov test, we were able to determine the geometry and intensity of the SUHI. During the day, the spatial extension of the SUHI reaches its maximum level and is delimited by the isotherm of 31.0 & DEG;C, which is 1.5-2.0 & DEG;C warmer than the neighboring non-urban areas. During the night, the SUHI has a more regulated spatial extension around the central area of the city, delimited by the 15.5 & DEG;C isotherm with LST values that are 1.0-1.5 & DEG;C warmer than the surrounding non-urban areas. Additionally, from a methodological point of view, we highlight that resampled MODIS and Landsat images at a spatial resolution of 500 m can be used with confidence to understand the detailed spatial features of the SUHI. The results of this study could help the elaboration of future policies meant to mitigate the effects of urbanization on the SUHI in an era of increasing air temperatures during summer.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, in the field of urban climate there is a scientific need to compare Land Surface Temperature (LST) with screen-level air temperature (2mTair). This is done in our study for Iasi city, based on MODIS imagery and in situ observations. We assess firstly the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) under clear-sky conditions, outlining that SUHI is well expressed during the year, while its geometry tends to be more compact and regular during nighttime. In summer daytime SUHI extension reaches its peak, being outlined by the 35 degrees C isotherm, while in winter SUHI is absent during the day. LST increases clearly when imperviousness ratio (IMD) overpasses the 10% threshold, and its maximum is reached for IMD higher than 80%. The comparison with the in situ observations indicates that the LST - 2mTair differences are the highest during daytime in spring and summer (+ 5 to +7 degrees C), while during winter no major differences are observed. For the nighttime the LST is generally 1 to 3 degrees C lower than 2mTair. We also found that intense radiative conditions are prone to increase both the SUHI intensity, and the difference between LST and 2mTair. The results are meant to support the policies aiming to mitigate the heat island effects on human population.

TI  - Estimating Future Surface Water Availability Through an Integrated Climate-Hydrology-Management Modeling Framework at a Basin Scale Under CMIP6 Scenarios
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and increasing water demand due to population growth pose serious threats to surface water availability. The biggest challenge in addressing these threats is the gap between climate science and water management practices. Local water planning often lacks the integration of climate change information, especially with regard to its impacts on surface water storage and evaporation as well as the associated uncertainties. Using Texas as an example, state and regional water planning relies on the use of reservoir "Firm Yield" (FY)-an important metric that quantifies surface water availability. However, this existing planning methodology does not account for the impacts of climate change on future inflows and on reservoir evaporation. To bridge this knowledge gap, an integrated climate-hydrology-management (CHM) modeling framework was developed, which is generally applicable to river basins with geographical, hydrological, and water right settings similar to those in Texas. The framework leverages the advantages of two modeling approaches-the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) and Water Availability Modeling (WAM). Additionally, the Double Bias Correction Constructed Analogues method is utilized to downscale and incorporate Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 GCMs. Finally, the DHSVM simulated naturalized streamflow and reservoir evaporation rate are input to WAM to simulate reservoir FY. A new term-"Ratio of Firm Yield" (RFY)-is created to compare how much FY changes under different climate scenarios. The results indicate that climate change has a significant impact on surface water availability by increasing reservoir evaporation, altering the seasonal pattern of naturalized streamflow, and reducing FY.

TI  - Prediction Aerospace Software to Detect Solar Activity and the Fast Tracking of Solar Activity Using Remote Sensing Instruments in Orbit
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, solar remote sensing instruments face problems regarding the short detection time for solar activity and the need to preheat the electronics before detection. The accurate orbit prediction function ensures that the maximum error of the payload electronics system preheating time is less than 8 s, enabling the electronics to obtain stable and reliable solar remote sensing data, and allowing the prediction function to adapt to the changes in preheating time and the limit position of turntable rotation. To achieve the complete detection of solar activity by a payload in orbit, a turntable with two directions of rotation was accurately controlled to achieve rapid capture and track the Sun's activity, and the delay time for tracking the Sun successfully was less than 8 s to ensure that the payload made full use of the solar detection time for full detection. The turntable's tracking error was less than 0.002 & DEG;, allowing the payload to obtain high-precision solar remote sensing data in orbit. The above methods enable the payload to realize the complete, stable, and high-precision detection of solar activity in orbit for wavelengths ranging approximately from 165 nm to 2400 nm.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This paper presents geospatial datasets, figures, and tables illustrating i) the location and total area of fish farms under cultivation; and ii) the spatiotemporal dynamics of reed cover in Hungarian fishponds generated from the published study of Sharma et al., [1]. Preliminary data for fish farm locations were obtained from the Institute of Agricultural Economics (AKI), followed by significant refinement based on high-resolution Google Earth Pro-imagery. The fishpond area dataset was validated against the values reported in annual statistical reports on aquaculture. In order to map reed vegetation freely available Sentinel-2 imagery (between 2017 and 2021) was accessed from the Copernicus Open Access Hub [2] and emergent macrophyte cover was classified using the NDVI-based threshold values [1]. Scientists, policymakers, and fish farmers can all benefit from such geospatial datasets. It could be used to monitor the extent of fishponds in Hungary and to design farm-level reed management plans to optimize the provision of ecological and production services.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing data reveal increased slope climbing of urban land expansion worldwide
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - The slope climbing of urban land expansion (SCUE) has become a ubiquitous phenomenon that results in distinctive characteristics in urban form, landscape, and governance. This phenomenon also results in challenges to sustainable urban development worldwide. However, some reports indicated that global urban land expansion is characterized by a slope-climbing trend. In our study, the global SCUE was quantified and evaluated based on the data from the satellite-based high-resolution (30 m) remote sensing at different levels (e.g., continental, national, and city levels) from 2000 to 2018. The results show that from 2000 to 2018, urban areas' average slope increased globally from 3.60 degrees to 3.70 degrees. The decrease in the slope spectrum of the urban land expansion peak values from 25.67% in 2000 to 24.98% in 2018 indicates that global urban land expanded into high-slope areas in later years. In Asia, Oceania, and South America, severe SCUE processes resulted in increments of 1.59%, 1.03%, and 1.32% in urban areas with a slope of > 5 degrees. Over the past 18 years, China has experienced a rapid SCUE process, as evidenced by the growth in the steepness of the slope spectrum and evenness of the slope spectrum. Compared with lowlands and mountains, hills exhibited pronounced SCUE. This finding reflects that hills are a key area of SCUE. Our study can provide new insights into the sustainability of urban economies, societies, management, and ecologies in hillside urbanization worldwide.

AB  - Gold mining generates major environmental impacts like landscape degradation, accumulation of waste rock dumps, and water contamination by suspended solids. Russia ranks third in the world in gold production, but the impact of gold mining has not been previously estimated for its vast northeastern part. This study provides a detailed overview of land-cover changes associated with gold mining in the Magadan region (northeast Russia) in the 21st century, where alluvial gold production has increased by a third in the last 20 years. A long-term series of Landsat and Sentinel-2 images obtained in July and August are used to compile two datasets of mining-impacted areas with totally removed vegetation for 2000-2002 and 2022. We calculated the NDVI difference and then discriminated mining-related vegetation losses from other bare areas, using additional data like the classification of landforms based on the digital surface model and the data on mining allotments. The total area of gold-mining sites was estimated as 41,206 ha in 2000-2002 and 72,602 ha in 2022, with an increase of 26,031 ha over the past 4-6 years. Moreover, this is a lower-boundary estimate, without taking into account man-made reservoirs and historical mines recovered by vegetation. The spatial distribution of mining sites has not changed significantly over the past two decades and has a maximum in the western part of the region. We found that the floodplains of the Berelekh and Debin Rivers (large tributaries of the Kolyma River) are most heavily impacted by gold mining with a removed vegetation canopy occupying 16.0% and 11.2% of their area. Along with the land degradation assessment, we found that 19,900 ha of historical gold-mining sites in the Berelekh River basin are recovered by vegetation, which is comparable in size to the areas impacted by mining over the past 20 years.

TI  - Assessment of Burned Areas during the Pantanal Fire Crisis in 2020 Using Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal biome-a tropical wetland area-has been suffering a prolonged drought that started in 2019 and peaked in 2020. This favored the occurrence of natural disasters and led to the 2020 Pantanal fire crisis. The purpose of this work was to map the burned area's extent during this crisis in the Brazilian portion of the Pantanal biome using Sentinel-2 MSI images. The classification of the burned areas was performed using a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) in the Google Earth Engine platform. Input variables in the algorithm were the percentiles 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90 of monthly (July to December) mosaics of the shade fraction, NDVI, and NBR images derived from Sentinel-2 MSI images. The results showed an overall accuracy of 95.9% and an estimate of 44,998 km(2) burned in the Brazilian portion of the Pantanal, which resulted in severe ecosystem destruction and biodiversity loss in this biome. The burned area estimated in this work was higher than those estimated by the MCD64A1 (35,837 km(2)), Fire_cci (36,017 km(2)), GABAM (14,307 km(2)), and MapBiomas Fogo (23,372 km(2)) burned area products, which presented lower accuracies. These differences can be explained by the distinct datasets and methods used to obtain those estimates. The proposed approach based on Sentinel-2 images can potentially refine the burned area's estimation at a regional scale and, consequently, improve the estimate of trace gases and aerosols associated with biomass burning, where global biomass burning inventories are widely known for having biases at a regional scale. Our study brings to light the necessity of developing approaches that aim to improve data and theory about the impacts of fire in regions critically sensitive to climate change, such as the Pantanal, in order to improve Earth systems models that forecast wetland-atmosphere interactions, and the role of these fires on current and future climate change over these regions.

TI  - Fine-scale accuracy assessment of the 2016 National Land Cover Dataset for stream-based wildlife habitat.
T2  - Journal of Wildlife Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficiently and effectively identifying and assessing potential wildlife habitat and important ecological resources is essential as rapid anthropogenic land use change alters and detrimentally affects terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Accuracy assessment of remotely sensed data supports ecological planning and management decisions, and is especially important when using freely available, coarse-resolution spatial datasets, such as the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). A popular dataset designed for application at larger regional to national spatial scales, the NLCD has been used in finer scale studies outside of its intended use, often without the imperative support of field-based accuracy assessment. We ground-truthed stratified random sampling points to assess the accuracy of the 2016 NLCD at a fine spatial scale relevant to stream-based ecological research. Our results demonstrated an overall accuracy of <65%, less than the United States Geological Survey recommended accuracy of >=85%. Results indicated that the NLCD may not be effective as a tool for stream-level studies and could provide erroneous results for fine-scale habitat assessment and planning when used as the only reference dataset. When conducting ecological research, it is important to consider the appropriate scale, resolution, and limitations of available datasets to achieve the most accurate results.

TI  - Prediction of the dynamics of land use land cover using a hybrid spatiotemporal model in Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities are prone to be the main drivers of land use land cover (LULC) changes, which have cascading effects on the environment and ecosystem services. The main objective of this study is to assess the historical spatiotemporal distributions of LULC changes as well as estimated future scenarios for 2035 and 2045 by considering the explanatory variables of LULC changes in Zanjan province, Iran. The LULC time-series technique was applied using three Landsat images for the years 1987, 2002, and 2019. Multi-layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN) is applied to model the relationships between LULC transitions and explanatory variables. Future land demand was calculated using a Markov chain matrix and multi-objective land optimization in a hybrid simulation model. Validation of the model's outcome was performed using the Figure of Merit index. The residential area in 1987 was 6406.02 ha which increased to 22,857.48 ha in 2019 with an average growth rate of 3.97%. Agriculture increased annually by 1.24% and expanded to 149% (890,433 ha) of the area occupied in 1987. Rangeland showed a decline concerning its area, with only about 77% (1,502,201 ha) of its area in 1987 (1,166,767 ha) remaining in 2019. Between 1987 and 2019, the significant net change was a conversion from rangeland to agricultural areas (298,511 ha). Water bodies were 8 ha in 1987, which increased to 1363 ha in 2019, with an annual growth rate of 15.9%. The projected LULC map shows the rangeland will further degrade from 52.43% in 2019 to 48.75% in 2045, while agricultural land and residential areas would be expanded to 940,754 ha and 34,727 ha in 2045 from 890,434 ha and 22,887 ha in 2019. The findings of this study provide useful information for the development of an effective plan for the study area.

TI  - Algorithms for Detecting Sub-Pixel Elevated Temperature Features for the NASA Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) Designated Observable
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the top priorities of the Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) Earth Observing System is the detection and retrieval of elevated temperature features (ETF) usually found in the vicinity of active fires and volcanic activity. We test the ability of currently proposed midwave (MIR: 3-5 mu m) and thermal infrared (TIR: 8-12 mu m) bands to detect ETF within the 400-1200 K range. Specifically, our investigation aims to compare and contrast the use of the 4 and 4.8 mu m MIR bands. We use land surface temperature data obtained by the airborne Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) instrument over active fire and lava flows to model at-sensor SBG radiances in the 3-12 mu m range. This is achieved using the Temperature Emissivity Uncertainty Simulator (TEUSim) with the designated/proposed SBG MIR and TIR band characteristics. For ETF detection, we applied the Normalized Thermal Index (NTI) and Enhanced Thermal Index (ETI) to determine a suitable threshold for a wide range of ETF sizes and temperatures. We find that combining an NTI threshold of -0.7 followed by an ETI threshold of 0.02 accurately identifies ETFs at a 97% rate. Sensor noise up to 0.5 K has negligible effects on ETF detection in the 400-1200 K range. The currently proposed SBG MIR and TIR bands are sufficient to detect unsaturated ETFs caused by wildfire and volcanic activities at a similar to 3 day revisit and subpixel ETF area of similar to 9 m(2) (at 500 K) that is unattainable by current satellite TIR instruments.Plain Language Summary The upcoming NASA Earth Observing System focusing on surface biology and geology (SBG) science and applications aims to improve the detection sensitivity of elevated surface temperature (ETF) anomalies such as wildfires and lava flows at high spatial resolution (60 m). In this study, we test whether the proposed SBG midwave and thermal infrared bands can detect ETFs in the 400-1200 K range. We use surface temperature data collected over active wildfires and lava flows from airborne instrument and model the at-sensor SBG radiances in the 3-12 mu m range. We used a combination of two thermal indexes (Normalized and Enhanced) previously developed for other infrared satellite data to determine a suitable threshold for a range of ETF sizes and temperatures. We find that the proposed SBG MIR and TIR bands can detect ETFs with a high accuracy rate of 97%, even at subpixel areas up to 9 m 2 that current satellite TIR instruments cannot achieve. Additionally, sensor noise has negligible effects on ETF detection. These findings could help improve the detection and monitoring of wildfires and volcanic activities and they may also be relevant for other thermal anomaly investigations, including those from anthropogenic sources.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of cerebral embolic protection devices for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: An updated meta-analysis
T2  - HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and AimsCerebral embolic protection (CEP) devices are employed to capture embolic debris and reduce the risk of stroke during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Evidence is mixed regarding the safety and efficacy of CEP. We aimed to summarize the safety and effectiveness of CEP use during TAVR. MethodsElectronic databases, including PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Embase, were searched using relevant search terms for articles relating to CEP. All relevant data from 20 studies were extracted into a standardized form. Statistical analyses were performed using Revman 5.4. Odds ratio (OR) or mean differences (MDs) were used to estimate the desired outcome with a 95% confidence interval (CI). ResultsTwenty studies (eight randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) involving 210,871 patients (19,261 in the CEP group and 191,610 in TAVR without the CEP group) were included. The use of CEP was associated with a lower odds of 30-day mortality by 39% (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.53-0.70) and stroke by 31% (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.52-0.92). Comparing devices, benefit in terms of mortality and stroke was observed with the use of the Sentinel device (Boston Scientific), but not among other devices. No differences were observed in the outcomes of acute kidney injury, major or life-threatening bleeding events, or major vascular complications between groups. When only RCTs were included, there were no observed differences in the primary or secondary outcomes for CEP versus no CEP use during TAVR. ConclusionsThe totality of evidence suggests a net benefit for the use of CEP, weighted by studies in which the Sentinal device was used. However, given the RCT subanalysis, additional evidence is needed to identify patients at the highest risk of stroke for optimal decision-making.

TI  - Trigeminal Function in Sino-Nasal Health and Disease
T2  - BIOMEDICINES
M3  - Review
AB  - The upper airway (nasal passages, paranasal sinuses, pharynx, and glottis) provides the sentinel portion of the human respiratory tract, with the combined senses of olfaction (cranial nerve I) and trigeminal sensation (cranial nerve V) signaling the quality of inspired air. Trigeminal function also complements the sense of taste (in turn mediated by cranial nerves VII, IX and X), and participates in the genesis of taste aversions. The ability of trigeminal stimulation in the upper aero-digestive tract to trigger a variety of respiratory and behavioral reflexes has long been recognized. In this context, the last three decades has seen a proliferation of observations at a molecular level regarding the mechanisms of olfaction, irritation, and gustation. Concurrently, an ever-widening network of physiological interactions between olfaction, taste, and trigeminal function has been uncovered. The objective of this review is to summarize the relatively recent expansion of research in this sub-field of sensory science, and to explore the clinical and therapeutic implications thereof.

TI  - Blue Color Indices as a Reference for Remote Sensing of Black Sea Water
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose to analyze the values of the "blue" color index for further use in additional atmospheric correction of Level 2 remote sensing reflectance data for the waters of the Black Sea. Regardless of seasonal phenomena, atmospheric conditions, and the type of water, the average color index in the short-wave region, according to in situ measurements CI(412/443), varies from 0.77 to 0.83. The most frequently observed value is 0.8. In turn, the values of the "blue" color index CI(412/443) according to the satellite data of MODIS Aqua/Terra, VIIRS SNPP, and OLCI Sentinel 3A scanners showed a large scatter in values based on the standard deviation of the sample. The paper proposes to introduce the value of the minimum allowable threshold CI(412/443) > 0.59 based on the small variance found from in situ measurements, as well as on the basis of a theoretical estimate of the possible values of the index CI(412/443) when varying the backscattering exponent and the exponent for the absorption approximation. The quality check of the remote sensing data showed that, according to this selection criterion, 15% of data are physically incorrect for MODIS Aqua, 30% for MODIS Terra, 20% for Sentinel 3A, and 26% for VIIRS SNPP. In the course of the work, it was shown that the MODIS Aqua satellite provides the most high-quality and reliable information about the optical characteristics of the Black Sea.

TI  - Characterization of terrestrial ecosystems state based on interannual variations of RUE (Rain Use Efficiency)
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems degradation has intensified in recent decades and climate change is expected to increase the risk of such processes in the coming years, especially in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. The purpose of this work is to characterize the state of the terrestrial ecosystems of the Spanish mainland and the Balearic Islands through the temporal analysis of the variable RUE (Rain Use Efficiency) during the period 2004-2018. Annual RUE images have been calculated as the quotient between annual gross primary production (GPP) and annual cumulative precipitation (PPT) in a 1 km spatial resolution, and the values have been later normalized. The annual GPP is derived from the daily GPP, obtained using satellite data (Monteith method) and the PPT from daily precipitation images, which are computed by applying a kriging to the data from AEMet network stations. Temporal analysis of the RUE has been made by calculating the slope from a Mann-Kendall test and Sen-Theil method. RUE has been analyzed at three levels of study: at regional level, by vegetation types and at pixel level. The results have shown a negative trend of the normalized RUE (between-0.05 and-0.25 year-1) for most of the area, for the 9 classes of vegetation (the forest classes being the ones that have presented the steepest slopes) and in 5 of the 8 ecosystems analyzed at pixel level. A decline in the RUE indicates some degree of degradation in vegetation cover. From the analysis of the results it has been extracted that the interannual variability of the RUE is largely mediated by precipitation, presenting a negative correlation. On the other hand, it has been observed that GPP has experienced a progressive increase in recent years known as greening process.

TI  - Rainbows of Comfort in Rising Seas: How Literalist Bible Interpretations Impact Climate Change Communication in the Marshall Islands
T2  - WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Republic of the Marshall Islands is beginning to feel the impacts of climate change. Its geography and low-lying landscape have put it at a disadvantage to fight the coming seas. National leadership and environmental groups continue to provide locals with communications about the challenges to come. While climate change is a concept of science, there may be local barriers to its public internalization. This study seeks to determine if there is a relationship between fundamentalist Christian views, climate change communication, and Marshallese perceptions of global environmental change. The Marshall Islands has a deeply religious population, the majority of whom are fundamentalist Christians. A mixed-methods survey is employed to assess the impact that the belief in biblical literalism, the Noahic Covenant, and apocalyptic narratives exert over Marshallese views of environmental change. Results demonstrate that nonelite Marshallese inhabi-tants do not see climate change as an existential threat but rather as a sign of the end times and the Second Coming of Christ. This has significant implications for human security and migration outcomes if current climate communication methods are ineffective with respect to urgency. If locals see climate impacts through a religious lens, climate change communication must incorporate biblical concepts and address contextual understandings.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The purpose of this study is to investigate how biblical literalism impacts the way in which Marshall Islanders interpret information on climate change and its impacts. Religion is a strong factor in the development of cosmology and/or worldview of all peoples; it provides a lens through which people understand the events of their existence. Our results show that climate impacts are interpreted by the followers of some literalist sects to be signs of biblical apocalypse. Viewing climate impacts as divine will pose a challenge to the need for relocation planning, adaptation, and personal safety.

TI  - Indigenous Peoples and Type 2 Diabetes: A Discussion of Colonial Wounds and Epistemic Racism
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF DIABETES
M3  - Article
AB  - Racism is rooted in historic and ongoing colonial strategies designed to erase, silence, and dismiss Indigenous peoples' voices, personhood, and worldview. Although within health care today interpersonal racism (discriminatory treatment) is commonly reported on, racism also influences our understanding of health conditions and related treatments. Epistemic racism, the discrimination of how we know, operates through the questions we ask to advance our evidence, and whose knowledge is sought and deemed valid. Epistemic racism is a colonial mechanism that marginalizes and diminishes the power of Indigenous peoples' voices and knowledge bases. In this work, we begin by sharing 2 stories of Indigenous peoples and type 2 diabetes (T2D) from an Indigenous knowledge base and a biomedical knowledge base. Our discussion of epistemic racism, which underlies reported T2D health disparities among Indigenous peoples, includes providing examples of knowledge emerging when the dominance of the biomedical knowledge base is disrupted through centring Indigenous knowledge and peoples. Indigenous-led research, in respectful relations with biomedical worldviews, is imperative. Unsilencing Indigenous peoples' voices and knowledge is necessary when addressing identified T2D health disparities and is truly a health priority. Indigenous revitalization, that is, acceptance of Indigenous knowledge bases, is valid and vital to health and well-being-it is time for ReconciliACTION. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - E-Agriculture Planning Tool for Supporting Smallholder Cocoa Intensification Using Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing approaches are often used to monitor land cover change. However, the small physical size (about 1-2 hectare area) of smallholder orchards and the cultivation of cocoa (Theobroma cocoa L.) under shade trees make the use of many popular satellite sensors inefficient to distinguish cocoa orchards from forest areas. Nevertheless, high-resolution satellite imagery combined with novel signal extraction methods facilitates the differentiation of coconut palms (Cocos nucifera L.) from forests. Cocoa grows well under established coconut shade, and underplanting provides a viable opportunity to intensify production and meet demand and government targets. In this study, we combined grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textural features and vegetation indices from Sentinel datasets to evaluate the sustainability of cocoa expansion given land suitability for agriculture and soil capability classes. Additionally, it sheds light on underexploited areas with agricultural potential. The mapping of areas where cocoa smallholder orchards already exist or can be grown involved three main components. Firstly, the use of the fine-resolution C-band synthetic aperture radar and multispectral instruments from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, respectively. Secondly, the processing of imagery (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) for feature extraction using 22 variables. Lastly, fitting a random forest (RF) model to detect and distinguish potential cocoa orchards from non-cocoa areas. The RF classification scheme differentiated cocoa (for consistency, the coconut-cocoa areas in this manuscript will be referred to as cocoa regions or orchards) and non-cocoa regions with 97 percent overall accuracy and over 90 percent producer's and user's accuracies for the cocoa regions when trained on a combination of spectral indices and GLCM textural feature sets. The top five variables that contributed the most to the model were the red band (B4), red edge curve index (RECI), blue band (B2), near-infrared (NIR) entropy, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), indicating the importance of vegetation indices and entropy values. By comparing the classified map created in this study with the soil and land capability legacy information of Bougainville, we observed that potential cocoa regions are already rated as highly suitable. This implies that cocoa expansion has reached one of many intersecting limits, including land suitability, political, social, economic, educational, health, labour, and infrastructure. Understanding how these interactions limit cocoa productivity at present will inform further sustainable growth. The tool provides inexpensive and rapid monitoring of land use, suitable for a sustainable planning framework that supports responsible agricultural land use management. The study developed a heuristic tool for monitoring land cover changes for cocoa production, informing sustainable development that balances the needs and aspirations of the government and farming communities with the protection of the environment.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban wetlands are highly neglected and are encroached upon to accommodate more settlements or to dump waste materials. They are susceptible to encroachment and undergo Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) change thereby diminishing their value. This study aims to examine and assess the spatial-temporal LULC change for selected wetlands of Delhi NCR vis-a-vis ecosystem services. Landsat imageries for the years 1998, 2008 and 2018 are used to understand the change dynamics using supervised classification with overall accuracy of more than 80% for all years. Classification was done separately for Delhi NCR and 5 km buffer around the wetlands. In Delhi NCR the net percent change during the 20-year period was found to be +5.22% and +8.56% for built-up and cropland respectively. During the same period, the plantations/forest cover and water bodies changed by -8.30% and -0.50% respectively. Plantations/forest cover has shown a negative net percent change in six wetlands, with Najafgarh experiencing the highest (-10.75%), followed closely by (-5.18%) and Asola Wildlife Sanctuary (-5.21%). The LULC change analysis has pointed to the loss of wetland area to built-up and/or cropland which is going to affect the ecosystem services provided by these wetlands. Geospatial tools are an important tool to understand the changing LULC in such sensitive ecosystems. It is needed to manage wetlands sustainably so that the corresponding ecosystem services could be preserved.

TI  - Study on Yield Estimation of Wheat Varieties Based on Multi-Source Data
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pre-production estimation of wheat production is related to the formulation of agricultural production plans, food security, national economy and macro-decision-making, and the application of drones can estimate wheat production in a non-destructive, fast, accurate, timely and efficient manner. The machine learning method is used to fully tap the potential of multi-source remote sensing data to estimate the grain yield of multiple wheat varieties and to clarify the effect of multi-source data fusion on improving the yield estimation accuracy of cultivars. It is significant for crop field management and ensuring a high and stable yield in wheat. In this study, field trials of winter wheat were carried out with 140 main wheat varieties in the Huanghuai wheat region as materials. The drone platform equipped with red green blue (RGB) and multispectral sensors were used to collect the canopy information of 140 winter wheat varieties during the grain filling period. Six machine learning algorithms were used, namely Ridge Regression (RR) support vector regression (SVR) Random Forest Regression (RFR) Gaussian Process (GP), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Cubist, to build yield estimation models from single sensor data and multi-source data fusion. Coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE) and relative root mean square error (RRMSE) were used to evaluate the estimation model. The results showed that the selected 10 visible vegetation indices and 13 multispectral covered indices were significantly correlated with the measured yield (p<0. 05), and the absolute value of the correlation coefficient from high to low was multispectral vegetation index (0. 54 similar to 0. 83), color index (0. 45 similar to 0. 61), texture feature (<0. 45), all six machine learning algorithms have the highest yield estimation and prediction accuracy when using multi-source data fusion. Multi-source data fusion yield estimation accuracy (average coefficient of determination R-2 = 0. 50 similar to 0. 71) > multi-spectral sensor yield estimation accuracy (R-2 = 0. 53 similar to 0. 69) > RGB sensor yield estimation accuracy (R-2 = 0. 35 similar to 0. 51). Compared with RGB data, the R-2 of multi-source data fusion increases by 0. 17 similar to 0. 23, and the mean root mean square error (RMSE) decreases by 0. 06 similar to 0. 09 t center dot hm(-2); compared with multi-spectral data, the R-2 increases by 0. 01 similar to 0. 06, and the RMSE decreases by 0. 01 similar to 0. 03 t center dot hm(-2). Compared with the other five algorithms, the multi-source data fusion model established by the Cubist algorithm has the highest yield estimation accuracy, with an R-2 of 0. 71 and an RMSE of 0. 29 t center dot hm(-2). It shows that compared with the yield estimation model of single sensor data, multi-source data fusion can effectively improve the yield estimation accuracy of winter wheat varieties, and the Cubist algorithm can better process multi-mode data to improve the yield prediction accuracy, providing theoretical guidance for predicting the yield of different wheat varieties.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variations of Atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub> in Monsoon Asia Detected by Satellite Observations of GOSAT and TROPOMI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-based measurements, such as the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite, provide global observations of the column-averaged CH4 concentration (XCH4). Due to the irregular observations and data gaps in the retrievals, studies on the spatial and temporal variations of regional atmospheric CH4 concentrations are limited. In this paper, we mapped XCH4 data over monsoon Asia using GOSAT and TROPOMI observations from April 2009 to December 2021 and analyzed the spatial and temporal pattern of atmospheric CH4 variations and emissions. The results show that atmospheric CH4 concentrations over monsoon Asia have long-term increases with an annual growth rate of roughly 8.4 ppb. The spatial and temporal trends of XCH4 data are significantly correlated with anthropogenic CH4 emissions from the bottom-up emission inventory of EDGAR. The spatial pattern of gridded XCH4 temporal variations in China presents a basically consistent distribution with the Heihe-Tengchong Line, which is mainly related to the difference in anthropogenic emissions in the eastern and western areas. Using the mapping of XCH4 data from 2019 to 2021, this study further revealed the response of atmospheric CH4 concentrations to anthropogenic emissions in different urban agglomerations. For the urban agglomerations, the triangle of Central China (TCC), the Chengdu-Chongqing City Group (CCG), and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) show higher CH4 concentrations and emissions than the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and nearby areas (BTH). The results reveal the spatial and temporal distribution of CH4 concentrations and quantify the differences between urban agglomerations, which will support further studies on the drivers of methane emissions.

TI  - Lake Cyanobacterial Bloom Color Recognition and Spatiotemporal Monitoring with Google Earth Engine and the Forel-Ule Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms represent a significant environmental problem, threatening aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Caused by the eutrophication of water bodies and global climate change, these blooms have altered freshwater ecosystems worldwide during recent decades. Although cyanobacterial blooms are typically caused by blue-green cyanobacteria, which derive their color from the phycocyanin pigment, other pigmented cyanobacterial blooms have been frequently observed in water bodies. These blooms pose a serious environmental threat to inland waters, endangering global public health and aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, comprehending the mechanism of color variation in cyanobacterial blooms is crucial for revealing the outbreak mechanism and implementing effective prevention and control measures. This study developed a human-machine interactive workflow for extracting cyanobacterial blooms and recognizing their colors based on the Forel-Ule index and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument data. Using this workflow, the authors conducted spatiotemporal analysis and statistical analysis of bloom color for cyanobacterial blooms in four typical eutrophic lakes from 2019 to 2022. The findings indicated a declining trend in cyanobacterial blooms across the four studied lakes over the years, among which Hulun Lake experienced an annual increase in cyanobacterial blooms and emerged as the lake with the most severe outbreak of such blooms in 2022. The yellowing status of cyanobacterial blooms varied among the four lakes, with Taihu Lake and Dianchi Lake exhibiting a relatively high proportion of green-yellow and yellow cyanobacterial blooms, followed by Chaohu Lake, whereas Hulun Lake had the lowest occurrence. The workflow developed in this study was implemented in Google Earth Engine and provided an automated, integrated, and rapid monitoring solution for the long-term monitoring and color recognition of cyanobacterial blooms.

TI  - Bi-Objective Crop Mapping from Sentinel-2 Images Based on Multiple Deep Learning Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate assessment of the extent of crop distribution and mapping different crop types are essential for monitoring and managing modern agriculture. Medium and high spatial resolution remote sensing (RS) for Earth observation and deep learning (DL) constitute one of the most major and effective tools for crop mapping. In this study, we used high-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery from Google Earth Engine (GEE) to map paddy rice and winter wheat in the Bengbu city of Anhui Province, China. We compared the performance of different popular DL backbone networks with the traditional machine learning (ML) methods, including HRNet, MobileNet, Xception, and Swin Transformer, within the improved DeepLabv3+ architecture, Segformer and random forest (RF). The results showed that the Segformer based on the combination of the Transformer architecture encoder and the lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) decoder achieved an overall accuracy (OA) value of 91.06%, a mean F1 Score (mF1) value of 89.26% and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) value of 80.70%. The Segformer outperformed other DL methods by combining the results of multiple evaluation metrics. Except for Swin Transformer, which was slightly lower than RF in OA, all DL methods significantly outperformed RF methods in accuracy for the main mapping objects, with mIoU improving by about 13.5 similar to 26%. The predicted images of paddy rice and winter wheat from the Segformer were characterized by high mapping accuracy, clear field edges, distinct detail features and a low false classification rate. Consequently, DL is an efficient option for fast and accurate mapping of paddy rice and winter wheat based on RS imagery.

TI  - CBIR-SAR System Using Stochastic Distance
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes a system for Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) using stochastic distance for Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The methodology consists of three essential steps for image retrieval. First, it estimates the roughness ((alpha) over cap) and scale ((gamma) over cap) parameters of the GI0 distribution that models SAR data in intensity. The parameters of the model were estimated using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation and the fast approach of the Log-Cumulants method. Second, using the triangular distance, CBIR-SAR evaluates the similarity between a query image and images in the database. The stochastic distance can identify the most similar regions according to the image features, which are the estimated parameters of the data model. Third, the performance of our proposal was evaluated by applying the Mean Average Precision (MAP) measure and considering clippings from three radar sensors, i.e., UAVSAR, OrbiSaR-2, and ALOS PALSAR. The CBIR-SAR results for synthetic images achieved the highest MAP value, retrieving extremely heterogeneous regions. Regarding the real SAR images, CBIR-SAR achieved MAP values above 0.833 for all polarization channels for image samples of forest (UAVSAR) and urban areas (ORBISAR). Our results confirmed that the proposed method is sensitive to the degree of texture, and hence, it relies on good estimates. They are inputs to the stochastic distance for effective image retrieval.

TI  - Changes in the dynamical, thermodynamical and hydrometeor characteristics prior to extreme rainfall events along the southwest coast of India in recent decades
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Extremes in rainfall have links with atmospheric dynamics, thermodynamics, and deep cloud properties. Employing station-based gridded rainfall data, analysis product of sea surface temperature (SST), reanalysis product of dynamic/thermodynamic parameters and remotely sensed cloud properties, we demonstrate the features and evolution of rainfall extremes over the southwest coast of India (8-14 degrees N, 75-77.5 degrees E) during monsoon season. Analysis of the frequency and total amount of extreme rainfall reveals that the northwest coast (14-20 degrees N) typically serves as the central node for the precipitation extremes. However, linear trends in rainfall extremes are remarkably different across the northwest and southwest coasts of India. Specifically, we noted a marked decrease in extreme rain events between 14 and 16 degrees N along the northwest coast, while at the same time, the southwest coast emerges as a hot spot for extreme rain events. Results suggest that the evolution of rainfall extremes on the southwest coast is linked to the warming of the south-central Arabian sea (AS), enhanced SST gradient between north and south AS, and low pressure over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) four days before the event day. Under the influence of these factors, moisture-laden winds shift from the northwest coast to the southwest coast of India. Three days before the extreme precipitation, the BoB low-pressure centre advances westward and eventually merges with the trough of low along the west coast on the event day and creates a considerable increase in the mid-tropospheric vorticity. Meteorological conditions on extreme rainfall days over the southwest coast are portrayed by a significant reduction of sea level pressure, an intense flow of low-level jets from the Arabian sea and a cyclonic vortex at mid-troposphere. These elements favour a substantial rise in moist static energy (MSE) throughout the troposphere, leading to deep convective clouds with copious ice content and extreme rainfall over the southwest coast.

TI  - FCCC: Forest Cover Change Calculator User Interface for Identifying Fire Incidents in Forest Region using Satellite Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - For the ecosystem to maintain a balance between the social and environmental spheres, forests play a crucial role. The greatest threat to forests for this significance, is fires and natural disasters caused by several factors. It is crucial to assess the genesis and behavioral characteristics of fires in forest areas. The discovery of the forest fire areas and the intensity of the fire affected are greatly facilitated by the satellite image obtained by different sensors and data sets. We are suggesting a novel approach to compute changes using spectral indices, using landsat-9 and sentinel-2 satellite datasets for measuring the change in forest areas affected by fire accidents over Kochi areas on March 2023. Kochi is a city in Kerala, South India, and is located at 9 degrees 50' 20.7348" N and 77 degrees 10' 13.8828" E. coordinates. Computation is performed by calculating forest area before the fire incident (pre-fire) and after the fire incident (post-fire) and total loss is calculated by the difference between pre-fire and post-fire incident. The proposed work uses Sentinel-2 and Landsat-9 satellite images to recover burn scars using several vegetation indicators. We have identified the fire locations using the object-based classification approach. For verification of results computed by vegetation indices, we have also performed land use land cover classification and calculated the changes in forest areas. Accuracy is computed by the confusion matrix with an accuracy of 89.45% and the kappa coefficient with an accuracy of 87.68%. In particular, there was a strong correlation between forest loss and the burned area in the subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest zone (6.9%) and the deciduous coniferous forest zone (18.9% of the lands). These findings serve as a foundation for future forecasts of fire-induced forest loss in regions with similar climatic and environmental conditions.

T2  - Recenti Progressi in Medicina
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Air pollution and extreme temperatures have been associated with multiple adverse health effects, especially on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The evidence of a relationship between daily exposures and mortality from metabolic, nervous and mental causes needs to be strengthened. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between daily exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and extreme temperatures (heat and cold) with cause-specific mortality in the entire Italian population. Methods. The daily counts of deaths from natural, cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, diabetes, nervous and mental causes were provided by Istat at the municipal level for the period 2006-2015. Through the application of machine-learning models based on satellite data and spatiotemporal variables, population-weighted exposures to daily mean PM2.5 (2013-2015) and air temperature (2006-2015) were estimated at municipality level. Time-series models adjusted for seasonal and long-term trends were applied, and associations between the above exposures and different causes of death at the national level were estimated. Results. The study found a marked effect of PM2.5 on deaths from nervous causes, with a % increase of risk (IR%) of 6.55% (95% confidence interval: 3.38%-9.81%) per PM2.5 increases of 10 mu g/m(3). The study also highlighted significant effects of low and high temperatures on all study outcomes. The effects were greater for high temperatures. In particular, the effects of heat, expressed as a % increase in risk per temperature increase from the 75(th) to the 99(th) percentile, show the highest associations with mortality from nervous causes (58.3%; 95%CI: 49.7%-67.5%), mental causes (48.4%; 95%CI: 40.4%-56.9%), respiratory causes 45.8%; 95%CI: 39.7%-52.1%) and metabolic causes (36.9%; 95%CI: 30.6%- 43.5%). Discussion. The study showed a strong association between daily exposure to PM2.5 and extreme temperatures, especially heat, with mortality outcomes, especially those under-investigated, such as diabetes, metabolic, nervous and mental causes.

TI  - Integrating Proteomics and Lipidomics for Evaluating the Risk of Breast Cancer Progression: A Pilot Study
T2  - BIOMEDICINES
M3  - Article
AB  - Metastasis is a serious and often life-threatening condition, representing the leading cause of death among women with breast cancer (BC). Although the current clinical classification of BC is well-established, the addition of minimally invasive laboratory tests based on peripheral blood biomarkers that reflect pathological changes in the body is of utmost importance. In the current study, the serum proteome and lipidome profiles for 50 BC patients with (25) and without (25) metastasis were studied. Targeted proteomic analysis for concertation measurements of 125 proteins in the serum was performed via liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC-MRM MS) using the BAK 125 kit (MRM Proteomics Inc., Victoria, BC, Canada). Untargeted label-free lipidomic analysis was performed using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), in both positive and negative ion modes. Finally, 87 serum proteins and 295 lipids were quantified and showed a moderate correlation with tumor grade, histological and biological subtypes, and the number of lymph node metastases. Two highly accurate classifiers that enabled distinguishing between metastatic and non-metastatic BC were developed based on proteomic (accuracy 90%) and lipidomic (accuracy 80%) features. The best classifier (91% sensitivity, 89% specificity, AUC = 0.92) for BC metastasis diagnostics was based on logistic regression and the serum levels of 11 proteins: alpha-2-macroglobulin, coagulation factor XII, adiponectin, leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, Ig mu chain C region, apolipoprotein C-IV, carbonic anhydrase 1, apolipoprotein A-II, apolipoprotein C-II and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1.

AB  - Introduction: Data on the prevalence of clinically significant antigens (Rh, Kell, Kidd, Duffy, MNSs, Lewis, P and Lutheran) among the Indian donor population is sparse.Objective: This prospective study was aimed at determining the prevalence of 21 clinically significant antigens for the first time in the South Indian donor population.Method: A total of 672 regular O group blood donors were enrolled for Rh (C,c, E, e) and Kell (K) antigens typing. Of these, 188 donors were typed for other clinically significant antigens (k, Kp(a), Kp(b), Jk(a), Jk(b), Fy(a), Fy(b), M, N, S, s, P1, Le(a), Le(b), Lu-a and Lu-b).Results: Antigen frequencies were expressed in percentages. In our study, R1R1 and rr were the most common phenotypes among D+ and D- donors, respectively. Among the Rh antigens, the e antigen was expressed by 97.5% and 100% of D+ and D- donors, respectively. The K antigen was found in only 0.15% of donors. In the Duffy and Kidd blood group system, Fy (a+b+) and Jk (a+b+) were the most frequent phenotypes, respectively. In the MNSs blood group system, M+N+ and S-s+ were the most common phenotypes reported. The Le (a-b+) was found to be the phenotype with the highest prevalence in the Lewis blood group system. The Lu (a-b+) was the only phenotype found in the Lutheran blood group system.Conclusion: Knowledge regarding the prevalence of antigens in a given population is essential in developing cost-effective in-house panels and a rare donor registry comprising donors typed negative for a high-frequency antigen or a combination of common multiple antigens.

TI  - Impacts of cement industry air pollutants on the environment and satellite data applications for air quality monitoring and management
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The cement industry plays critical role in any country's development and economic growth. Cement is extensively used in construction sector and infrastructural projects. Abundant raw material availability, infrastructure demands, urbanization, and recent government initiatives-Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) project and housing for all under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), India-stood at second place in cement-producing country in the world. Cement plants are emitting 15% of global pollutions into the environment among various industries. Cement industry byproducts include dust/particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), toxic gases (COx, NOx, SOx, CH4, and VOCs), noise, and heavy metals (Cr, Ni, Co, Pb, and Hg), which cause climate change, global warming, and health risks as well as negative impact on flora and fauna. The Terra, Aura, Sentinel-5P, GOSAT, and other satellite datasets allow estimation of cement industry major air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using regression models, artificial neural network-based models, machine learning models, and the tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD) retrieval algorithm. This review article explores the evolution of the Indian cement industry, air pollutants from the cement industry, social and environmental implications, satellite datasets, models used for assessing air pollutants, and challenges for the long-term sustainability of the cement industry.

AB  - At the research points, the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation and Normalized Green Red Difference indices is characterized by a determination coefficient equal to 0.52. The estimation of the emission of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide in the forest air at an altitude of 40 m above the level of the soil cover during the growing season showed differences in their values during the daytime and at night. The results helped determine promising methods of inventory of the carbon landfill forest area for aboveground woody biomass assessment based on data obtained from several sources and land forest estimation research. The research involved: 1) integration of an unmanned aerial vehicle -based digital camera and lidar sensors in order to optimize the efficiency and cost of data collection; 2) taking advantage of high-resolution aerial photographs and sparse lidar point clouds using an information fusion approach and the ability to compensate for their shortcomings.

TI  - Reconstruction of a Monthly 1 km NDVI Time Series Product in China Using Random Forest Methodology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is one of the most common metrics used to describe vegetation dynamics. Unfortunately, low-quality pixels resulting from contamination (by features including clouds, snow, aerosols, and mixed factors) have impeded NDVI products' widespread application. Researchers have thought of several ways to improve NDVI quality when contamination occurs. However, most of these algorithms are based on the noise-negative deviation principle, which aligns low-value NDVI products to an upper line but ignores cases where absolute surface values are low. Consequently, to fill in these research gaps, in this article, we use the random forest model to produce a set of high-quality NDVI products to represent actual surface characteristics more accurately and naturally. Climate and geographical products are used as model inputs to describe environmental factors. They represent the random forest (RF) model that establishes relationships between MODIS NDVI products and meteorological products in high-quality areas. In addition, auxiliary data and empirical knowledge are employed to meet filling requirements. Notably, the random forest (RF) algorithm exhibits a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.024 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.034, in addition to a coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.974. Furthermore, the MAE and RMSE of the RF-based method decreased by 0.014 and 0.019, respectively, when compared to those of the STSG (spatial-temporal Savitzky-Golay) plan and by 0.013 and 0.015, respectively, when compared to the LSTM (long short-term memory) method. R-2 increased by 0.039 and 0.027, respectively, compared to the STSG and LSTM methods. We introduced a novel series of NDVI products that demonstrated consistent spatial and temporal connectivity. The novel product exhibits enhanced adaptability to intricate environmental conditions and promises the potential for utilization in investigating vegetation dynamics within the Chinese region.

TI  - Multi-Level Perceptual Network for Urban Building Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images benefits various practical applications. However, automation of this process is challenging due to the variety of building surface coverings, complex spatial layouts, different types of structures, and tree occlusion. In this study, we propose a multilayer perception network for building extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images. By constructing parallel networks at different levels, the proposed network retains spatial information of varying feature resolutions and uses the parsing module to perceive the prominent features of buildings, thus enhancing the model's parsing ability to target scale changes and complex urban scenes. Further, a structure-guided loss function is constructed to optimize building extraction edges. Experiments on multi-source remote sensing data sets show that our proposed multi-level perception network presents a superior performance in building extraction tasks.

TI  - Temporal Changes of Leaf Spectral Properties and Rapid Chlorophyll-A Fluorescence under Natural Cold Stress in Rice Seedlings
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, hyperspectral remote sensing data are widely used in nutrient management, crop yield forecasting and stress monitoring. These data can be acquired with satellites, drones and handheld spectrometers. In this research, handheld spectrometer data were validated by chlorophyll-a fluorescence measurements under natural cold stress. The performance of 16 rice cultivars with different origins and tolerances was monitored in the seedling stage. The studies were carried out under field conditions across two seasons to simulate different temperature regimes. Twenty-four spectral indices and eleven rapid chlorophyll-a fluorescence parameters were compared with albino plants. We identified which wavelengths are affected by low temperatures. Furthermore, the differences between genotypes were characterized by certain well-known and two newly developed (AAR and RAR) indices based on the spectral difference between the genotype and albino plant. The absorbance, reflectance and transmittance differences from the control are suitable for the discrimination of tolerant-sensitive varieties, especially based on their shape, peak and shifting distance. The following wavelengths are capable of determining the tolerant varieties, namely 548-553 nm, 667-670 nm, 687-688 nm and 800-950 nm in case of absorbance; above 700 nm for reflectance; and the whole spectrum (400-1100 nm) for transmittance.

TI  - Assessing the Use of Burn Ratios and Red-Edge Spectral Indices for Detecting Fire Effects in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Burn severity is commonly assessed using Burn Ratios and field measurements to provide land managers with estimates of the degree of burning in an area. However, less commonly studied is the ability of spectral indices and Burn Ratios to estimate field-measured fire effects. Past research has shown low correlations between fire effects and Landsat-derived Burn Ratios, but with the launch of the Sentinel-2 constellation, more spectral bands with finer spatial resolutions have become available. This paper explores the use of several red-edge-based indices and Burn Ratios alongside more 'traditional' spectral indices for predicting fire effects, measured from the Maple and Berry fires in Wyoming, USA. The fire effects include ash depth, char depth, post-fire dead lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta; PICO) density/stumps, mean basal diameter, cone density on dead post-fire trees, coarse wood percent cover/volume/mass, percent cover of ghost logs and initial regeneration of post-fire PICO/aspen density. All-possible-models regression was used to determine the best models for estimating each fire effect. Models with satisfactory R-2 values were constructed for post-fire dead PICO stumps (0.663), coarse wood percent cover (0.691), coarse wood volume (0.833), coarse wood mass (0.838), ash depth (0.636) and percent cover of ghost logs (0.717). Red-edge-based indices were included in all of the satisfactory models, which shows that the red-edge bands may be useful for measuring fire effects.

TI  - Unveiling Air Pollution in Crimean Mountain Rivers: Analysis of Sentinel-5 Satellite Images Using Google Earth Engine (GEE)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents an assessment of atmospheric pollutant concentrations based on state-of-the-art geoinformation research methods that utilize Sentinel-5 satellite imagery, the cloud computing platform Google Earth Engine (GEE), and ArcGIS 10.8 software. The spatial distributions of some pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, methane) in the atmosphere are analyzed on the example of the basins of the Zapadnyy Bulganak, Alma, Kacha, Belbek, and Chernaya rivers on the north-western slope of the Crimean Mountains. The concentrations of the average annual and average monthly values of pollutants for each catchment area are compared. The GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform is used for extracting annual and monthly average rasters of pollutant substances, while ArcGIS is utilized for enhanced data visualization and in-depth analytical processing. Background concentrations of pollutants within protected natural areas are calculated. By comparing the spatial and temporal distribution of pollutant values with the background concentrations within these protected areas, a complex index of atmospheric pollution is constructed. The spatial and temporal variability of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations has been thoroughly examined. Based on the regression analysis (R > 0.85), the field of values of the total amount of emissions (which are analyzed for only six points in the study area and in the surrounding areas) was restored on the basis of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the field of distribution of nitrogen dioxide values (NO2). Since air pollution can have negative consequences, both for human health and for the ecosystem as a whole, this study is of great importance for assessing the ecological situation within the river basins of the north-western slope of the Crimean Mountains. This work also contributes to a general understanding of the problem of gas emissions, whose study is becoming increasingly relevant. The aim of this research is to assess the potential application of Sentinel-5 satellite imagery for air quality assessment and pollution analysis within the river basins of the north-western slopes of the Crimean Mountains. The significance of this study lies in the innovative use of Sentinel-5 satellite imagery to investigate air pollution in extensive regions where a regular network of observation points is lacking.

TI  - Estimation of Crop Water Productivity Using GIS and Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The global demand for food is growing with the population and urbanization, which puts pressure on water resources, which need assessing and quantifying water requirements. Adopting efficient irrigation methods to optimize water use is essential in this situation. In this study, crop water productivity (CWP) of major crops in the Rohri canal command area was estimated by the ratio of yield and actual evapotranspiration (ETa). Analyzing the CWP of major crops, water scarcity challenges can be tackled by selecting the most feasible irrigation methods. However, ETa was calculated and aggregated for all four stages of the crop growth period: initial, crop development, flowering stage, and maturity seasons. The crop yield data were obtained from the districts' agricultural statistics. For this purpose, evapotranspiration products of Landsat 5 and 8 were downloaded from Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux (EEFlux). Landsat images were processed in a GIS environment to calculate ETa. The approach suggests developing a CWP database for major crops like wheat, cotton, and rice to improve irrigation water management. The objectives of this study are to estimate and analyze the difference in the CWP and evapotranspiration of major crops for the Rabi and Kharif seasons with high and moderate flows during 1998-2019. It comprises nine districts of Sindh that come under the Rohri Canal command area. To analyze the difference in CWP between the Rabi and Kharif seasons for all study crops of the seasons of Rabi (2014-2015 and 2016-2017) and Kharif (1998 and 2017). The growing periods for wheat, cotton, and rice in the Rohri Canal command area are 160, 195, and 180 days, respectively. The estimated ETa of the Rohri canal command area and CWP were in good agreement with the literature-reported values. Hence, enhanced agricultural productivity can be achieved by making considerable investments to improve agricultural research and extension systems.

TI  - Climatology of Cloud Base Height Retrieved from Long-Term Geostationary Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud base height (CBH) is crucial for parameterizing the cloud vertical structure (CVS), but knowledge concerning the temporal and spatial distribution of CBH is still poor owing to the lack of large-scale and continuous CBH observations. Taking advantage of high temporal and spatial resolution observations from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on board the geostationary Himawari-8 satellite, this study investigated the climatology of CBH by applying a novel CBH retrieval algorithm to AHI observations. We first evaluated the accuracy of the AHI-derived CBH retrievals using the active measurements of CVS from the CloudSat and CALIPSO satellites, and the results indicated that our CBH retrievals for single-layer clouds perform well, with a mean bias of 0.3 & PLUSMN; 1.9 km. Therefore, the CBH climatology was compiled based on AHI-derived CBH retrievals for single-layer clouds for the time period between September 2015 and August 2018. Overall, the distribution of CBH is tightly associated with cloud phase, cloud type, and cloud top height and also exhibits significant geographical distribution and temporal variation. Clouds at low latitudes are generally higher than those at middle and high latitudes, with CBHs peaking in summer and lowest in winter. In addition, the surface type affects the distribution of CBH. The proportion of low clouds over the ocean is larger than that over the land, while high cloud occurs most frequently over the coastal area. Due to periodic changes in environmental conditions, cloud types also undergo significant diurnal changes, resulting in periodic changes in the vertical structure of clouds.

TI  - Snapshot Stokes Polarimetry Method Based on Dammann Grating
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Polarization is a key parameter of light, accurate and rapid measurement of which plays a significant role in a variety of areas such as remote sensing technology, Mueller matrix measurement, and biological diagnosis. Stokes parameters directly reflect the light intensity of the polarization component of light, and all parameters can be directly determined by the measurement of light intensity. On this basis, the polarization distribution, vector quality factor, and intra- modal phase can be measured. The measurement methods of Stokes parameters mainly include the division-of-time and division-of-amplitude methods. The division-of-time method refers to the measurement of required intensities one by one, which is only applicable to static polarized light. The division-of-amplitude method can overcome shortcomings encountered by the division-of-time method, but it also faces many problems such as the complexity of the device, the uneven distribution of light intensity, and different propagation distances. In this study, a Stokes polarimetry method based on a polarization-insensitive Dammann grating is proposed. The Stokes parameters of the polarized beam can be calculated by the intensity spots in a single snapshot, and the polarization distribution, vector quality factor, and intramodal phase of the polarized beam can be further obtained. This method has simple measuring equipment and does not need any rotating components. The measurement can be completed with a snapshot and has reliable accuracy.Methods The measurement principle of the proposed method is described in Fig. 1. Formulas for calculating Stokes parameters, the polarization distribution, the vector quality factor, and the intra-modal phase of the polarized light are derived. The experimental setup is built upon the measurement principle. In the experiment, different vector polarized beams, circularly polarized beams, and elliptically polarized beams are generated to measure the target polarized beam. The polarization- insensitive Dammann grating is used to divide the incident polarized beam into four identical beams in a spatially symmetrical position. After being collimated by a convex lens, four beams are modulated by wave plates and a polarizer and finally captured by a CCD. Via the captured intensity images, Stokes parameters of the measured polarized beam are calculated, and the polarization distribution, vector quality factor, and the intra-modal phase of the polarized light beam are obtained. Finally, according to the measurement principle, we analyze the influence of the phase retardation deviation and fast axis azimuth deviation of wave plates and the transmittance axis deviation of the polarizer on Stokes parameter measurement.Results and Discussions First, the generated radially polarized beam is used for the initial calibration, which is divided into four identical beams, as shown in Fig. 2. Four light spots recorded in Fig. 2 are used to calibrate the center position of the light spot, which is beneficial to the subsequent measurement. After that, the radially polarized beam is measured. On the basis of the four light spots recorded in a snapshot (Fig. 3), Stokes parameters of the radially polarized beam are calculated (Fig. 4), and then the polarization distribution is reconstructed ( Fig. 5). The above experimental measurement results are all compared to the corresponding theoretical simulation results, and they have a good agreement. Then, more polarized beams are measured, and their experimental measurement results of reconstructed polarization distribution conform well to the theoretical simulation results (Fig. 6). The measurement results of the generated elliptically polarized beams are compared with those of the commercial polarimeter to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the measurement method. Table 1 shows the relative measurement errors of different elliptically polarized beams between the proposed measurement method and the polarimeter, and the average relative error is 6. 97%, which indicates the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. Additionally, the vector quality factor and intra-modal phase of different polarized beams are measured. At last, the analysis of the influence of some existing errors on Stokes parameter measurement shows that the phase retardation deviation and fast axis azimuth deviation of wave plates and the transmittance axis deviation of the polarizer could bring about a maximum measurement error of around 9% to Stokes parameter measurement.Conclusions This study proposes a method of measuring Stokes parameters of arbitrary polarized beams based on a polarization-insensitive Dammann grating with a snapshot. The Dammann grating is used to divide the incident polarized beam into four identical beams in a spatially symmetrical position. After being collimated by the lens, the four beams pass through different wave plates and a polarizer and are eventually captured by a CCD. The Stokes parameters of the polarized beam can be calculated by a simple superposition of the intensity spots in a single snapshot, and the polarization distribution, vector quality factor, and intra-modal phase of the polarized beam can be further obtained. The experimental measurement results are in good agreement with the theoretical simulation results. The average relative error of elliptically polarized beams between the proposed measurement method and the commercial polarimeter is 6. 97%, which verifies the feasibility and accuracy of this measurement method. The Dammann grating used in this method is designed according to the wavelength of the incident beam and the required separation angle. It can accept the spot diameter of the incident beam in a wide range and has no requirements for the polarization of the incident beam. Hence, the measuring device has certain universality. The proposed Stokes polarimetry method is simple and can obtain reliable results without all-digital devices, which effectively reduces the cost. The subsequent use of wave plates with higher precision of phase retardation and rotation mounts with higher precision of rotation can further improve the measurement accuracy.

TI  - Study of the Response of Environmental Factors of the Coastal Area in Zhoushan Fishery to Typhoon In-fa Based on Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The response of typical environmental factors in Zhoushan Fishery, including sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), and chlorophyll a (Chl-a), before and after Typhoon In-fa was analyzed using satellite data and reanalysis data in this study. Additionally, this study simultaneously elucidated the mechanism by which the typhoon affected these factors. The results showed that: (1) the strong vertical mixing caused by In-fa provoked a decrease in SST, while the asymmetric typhoon wind stress and vertical difference in temperature structure before the typhoon caused a more robust cooling of SST on the right side of the In-fa track; (2) despite the strong mixing and inflow of hypersaline seawater increasing SSS, the combined effect of intense rainfall and diluted water inflow caused an overall decrease in SSS after In-fa's landing; (3) In-fa caused the Chl-a concentration to decrease first and then increase. The high cloudiness and low Chl-a seawater inflow inhibited the phytoplankton growth during the typhoon, while the abundant light, rich surface nutrients under the upwelling effect, and transport of rich land-based substances induced rapid phytoplankton reproduction after the typhoon; and (4) the change in Chl-a concentration, current, temperature, and salinity induced by a typhoon are essential factors that affect fish behavior and community composition in fisheries. This study provides a point of reference to reveal the response of environmental factors to typhoons and their effects on fishery resources in fisheries located on nearshore estuarine shallow waters with intensive islands.

In particular, the Fisher-Shannon method allows to calculate two quantities, the Fisher Information Measure (FIM) and the Shannon entropy power (SEP), which are used to characterise the complexity of a time series in terms of organisation/disorder. Pilot sites located both in urban (Milano, Torino, and Roma) and peri-urban areas (Appia Park, Castel Porziano, and Castel Volturno) were selected. Among the six sites, Roma, Castel Porziano, and Castel Volturno are affected by the parasite Toumeyella parvicornis. The time series was analysed using the products available in Google Earth Engine. To explore and characterise long-term vegetation dynamics, the time series was analysed using a multistep processing chain based on the (i) normalisation of the satellite time series, (ii) removal of seasonality and any other periodical cycles using SSA, (iii) analysis of the de-trended data using the Fisher-Shannon statistical method, and (iv) validation through comparison with independent data and ancillary information. Our findings point out to a clear discrimination between healthy and unhealthy sites, being the first (Milano, Torino, Appia) characterised by a larger FIM (lower SEP) and the second (Roma, Castel Porziano, Castel Volturno) by a lower FIM (larger SEP). The results of the investigations showed that the use of the SSA and Fisher-Shannon statistical methods coupled with the NDVI time series of the MODIS satellite made it possible to effectively identify and characterise subtle but physically significant signals veiled by seasonality and annual cycles.

TI  - A Parallel Solution of Timing Synchronization in High-Speed Remote Sensing Data Transmission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the problem that the timing synchronization calculation in high-speed remote sensing signal reception is complex and it is difficult for it to be parallel, this paper deduces and designs a parallel timing error estimation and correction scheme. This paper presents the design of polyphase DFT filter banks with non-maximum decimation. The feedforward timing error estimation and correction method is then improved to enhance synchronization performance. Finally, an implementation scheme for parallel timing error estimation and correction is proposed using the polyphase filter bank time domain decomposition method and the filter polyphase model. In the estimation module, the parallel implementation structure of the joint second-order and fourth-order cyclic statistics methods is designed, which improves the estimation accuracy. In the correction module, a fractional delay filtering method with higher accuracy is adopted in order to improve the calibration accuracy and reduce the computational complexity. The timing synchronization of a high-speed remote sensing signal with timing error is simulated and verified. The experimental results show that the parallel method proposed in this paper greatly reduces the processing speed of subband data, and has a good synchronization performance, which is close to the theoretical limit in the demodulation error rate. This paper utilizes a multi-phase DFT filter bank architecture to achieve parallel timing synchronization, which presents a novel approach for the future parallel reception of high-speed remote sensing signals.

TI  - Lymphatic Complications Following Sentinel Node Biopsy or Pelvic Lymphadenectomy for Endometrial Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is performed worldwide in patients with endometrial cancer (EC). The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the occurrence rate of lymphatic complications between SNB and pelvic lymphadenectomy (LND) for EC. The medical records of women who underwent SNB or pelvic LND for EC between September 2012 and April 2022 were assessed. A total of 388 patients were enrolled in the current study. Among them, 201 patients underwent SNB and 187 patients underwent pelvic LND. The occurrence rates of lower-extremity lymphedema (LEL) and pelvic lymphocele (PL) were compared between the patients who underwent SNB and those who underwent pelvic LND. The SNB group had a significantly lower occurrence rate of lower-extremity LEL than the pelvic LND group (2.0% vs. 21.3%, p < 0.01). There were no patients who had PL in the SNB group; however, 4 (2.1%) patients in the pelvic LND group had PL. The occurrence rates of lower-extremity LEL and PL were significantly lower in patients who underwent SNB than those who underwent pelvic LND. SNB for EC has a lower risk of lymphatic complications compared to systemic LND.

TI  - Exploring Switzerland's Land Cover Change Dynamics Using a National Statistical Survey
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and reliable Land Use and Cover change information is crucial to efficiently mitigate the negative impact of environmental changes. Switzerland has the ambitious objective of being a sustainable country while remaining an attractive business location with a high level of well-being. However, this aspiration is hampered by increasing pressures that are significantly impacting the environment and putting serious demands on land. In the present study, we used the national Land Cover (LC) dataset, named ArealStatistik, produced by the Federal Statistical Office, to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of Land Cover in Switzerland, providing a comprehensive assessment of land cover change at the national scale. Results indicate that, in general, Switzerland has undergone small, spatially dispersed, dynamic, and gradual change trends, with high rates of transition between low growing Brush Vegetation and forest LC classes in recent years. These pixel-level trends are more important in the lower altitude plateau and Jura regions, while greater changes in the spatial configuration of LC are observed in the alpine regions. However, findings also suggest that identifying drivers and understanding the rate of change are limited by the spatial resolution and temporal update frequency of the ArealStatistik. The ability to understand these drivers would benefit from a high-resolution annual LC dataset. Such a data product can be produced using the ArealStatistik together with dense satellite data time-series and Machine/Deep Learning techniques.

TI  - Validation of a Case Definition to Identify Patients Diagnosed With Cardiovascular Disease in Canadian Primary Care Practices
T2  - CJC OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death globally. This study validates a primary care-based electronic medical record case definition for CVD.Methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional study explores electronic medical record data from 1574 primary care providers participating in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network. A reference standard was created by reviewing medical records of a subset of patients in this network (n = 2017) for coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Together, these data produced a CVD reference. We applied validated case definitions to an active patient population (> 1 visit between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019) to estimate prevalence using the exact binomial test (N = 689,301). Descriptive statistics, c2 tests, and t tests characterized patients with vs without CVD.Results: The optimal CVD Case Definition 2 had a sensitivity of 68.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 61.6%-74.8%), a specificity of 97.8% (95% CI: 97.0%-98.4%), a positive predictive value of 77.7% (95% CI: 71.6%-82.7%), and a negative predictive value of 96.5% (95% CI: 95.8%-97.1%). Included in this CVD definition was a strong CAD case definition with sensitivity of 91.6% (95% CI: 84.6%-96.1%), specificity of 98.3% (95% CI: 97.6%-98.8%), a PPV of 74.8% (95% CI: 67.8%80.7%), and an NPV of 99.5% (95% CI: 99.1%-99.7%). This CVD definition also included CeVD and PVD case definitions with low sensitivity (77.6% and 36.6%) but high specificity (98.6% and 99.0%). The estimated prevalence of CVD among primary care patients is 11.2% (95% CI, 11.1%-11.3%; n = 77,064); the majority had CAD (6.4%).Conclusions: This study validated a definition of CVD and its component partsdCAD, CeVD, and PVD. Understanding the prevalence and disease burden for patients with CVD within primary care settings can improve prevention and disease management.

TI  - A Biocultural Dialogue between Thoreau and Taoist Thought: Rethinking Environmental Ethics, Nature, Spirituality and Place
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A fundamental question of the 21st century centers around the role and place of humans in their environment. Given the great acceleration of consumptive practices engaged in the 20th century, humans stand on the brink of a 6th extinction event. In order to determine our place and role in our global environment, we need to reflect on where we are and what the future will be-we need to focus on the habits of our "co-inhabitation" of the planet. Given the positive and negative impacts of international and global activities, intercultural dialogues are necessary for the care of the ecology of the planet, and one of the most prescient dialogues is between Eastern and Western world views. While much comparative research has been conducted regarding the connection between American Transcendentalism and Chinese ancient philosophy, relatively little philosophical work has been conducted to demonstrate the connectivity between Henry David Thoreau and Taoism. Yet there are, in fact, profound similarities between the American naturalist and Chinese philosophy, in particular Taoism. This paper aimed to discover and manifest the connection and similarities between the philosophy of Thoreau and the ancient worldview of Taoism. Through this comparative study and intercultural dialogue, we seek to trace historical precedents and intercultural dialogue between American Transcendentalism and ancient Chinese philosophy in order to explore the groundwork for a new vision of environmental awareness in order to promote a better future with a community of co-inhabitants and emphasis on the well-being of all.

TI  - Research on Rice Fields Extraction by NDVI Difference Method Based on Sentinel Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - To meet the challenge of food security, it is necessary to obtain information about rice fields accurately, quickly and conveniently. In this study, based on the analysis of existing rice fields extraction methods and the characteristics of intra-annual variation of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the different types of ground features, the NDVI difference method is used to extract rice fields using Sentinel data based on the unique feature of rice fields having large differences in vegetation between the pre-harvest and post-harvest periods. Firstly, partial correlation analysis is used to study the influencing factors of the rice harvesting period, and a simulation model of the rice harvesting period is constructed by multiple regression analysis with data from 32 sample points. Sentinel data of the pre-harvest and post-harvest periods of rice fields are determined based on the selected rice harvesting period. The NDVI values of the rice fields are calculated for both the pre-harvest and post-harvest periods, and 33 samples of the rice fields are selected from the high-resolution image. The threshold value for rice field extraction is determined through statistical analysis of the NDVI difference in the sample area. This threshold was then utilized to extract the initial extent of rice fields. Secondly, to address the phenomenon of the "water edge effect" in the initial data, the water extraction method based on the normalized difference water index (NDWI) is used to remove the pixels of water edges. Finally, the extraction results are verified and analyzed for accuracy. The study results show that: (1) The rice harvesting period is significantly correlated with altitude and latitude, with coefficients of 0.978 and 0.922, respectively, and the simulation model of the harvesting period can effectively determine the best period of remote sensing images needed to extract rice fields; (2) The NDVI difference method based on sentinel data for rice fields extraction is excellent; (3) The mixed pixels have a large impact on the accuracy of rice fields extraction, due to the water edge effect. Combining NDWI can effectively reduce the water edge effect and significantly improve the accuracy of rice field extraction.

TI  - The Detection of Green Tide Biomass by Remote Sensing Images and In Situ Measurement in the Yellow Sea of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The world's largest macroalgae bloom (also known as green tide) has been reported since the 29th Olympic Games in 2008, which is verified as the fast reproduction of floating green macroalgae (Ulva prolifera). It is helpful to assess the biomass of macroalgae for the government of marine environment protection. In this study, the synchronization cruise experiment was firstly introduced, which aimed to investigate the biomass evaluation of Ulva prolifera in the Yellow Sea of China. The Floating Algae Index by Polarimetric SAR image (FAIPS) was then proposed. Finally, the floating algae biomass evaluation model was demonstrated and verified, which showed an exponential relationship between FAIPS and wet biomass per area (kg/m(2)) of macroalgae. The model proposed in this paper can be used in the biomass assessment of floating algae in the presence of polarimetric SAR images, regardless of daylight and cloud coverage over the sea surface.

TI  - Monitoring Surface Subsidence Using Distributed Scatterer InSAR with an Improved Statistically Homogeneous Pixel Selection Method in Coalfield Fire Zones
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Statistically homogeneous pixel (SHP) selection is an important process in the distributed scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DS-InSAR) approach. However, prevalent methods struggle to appropriately balance the efficiency and accuracy of selection. To solve this problem, the authors of this study improved the Hypothesis Test of Confidence Interval (HTCI) to propose an adaptive method to select the level of saliency and confidence interval for the HTCI, called Adp-HTCI. The proposed method can accurately select homogeneous pixels while inheriting the high efficiency of the HTCI. Once homogeneous pixels have been chosen, the eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix is used to optimize their phase and perform temporal processing. We used the proposed method along with data on 31 scenes from the Sentinel-1 satellite from 2 June 2021 to 28 May 2022 to monitor the deformation of the surface of the fire zone in the Sikeshu coalfield. The selection results of homogeneous pixels indicate that the proposed Adp-HTCI algorithm can increase the number of selected homogeneous pixels while ensuring the accuracy of the selection results, thereby enhancing the estimation accuracy and reliability of subsequent parameter solving. The DS-InSAR results showed that the cumulative maximum subsidence in the study area within a year reached-138 mm and the point density used by the DS-InSAR approach was 17.28 times higher than that used by the StaMPS approach. The results of cross-analysis with the results of StaMPS verified the accuracy of the DS-InSAR-based approach.

TI  - Observing Tropical Cyclone Morphology Using RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1960s, meteorological satellites have been able to monitor tropical cyclones and typhoons. Their images have been acquired by passive remote sensing instruments that operate in the visible and infrared bands, where they only display the cloud-top structure of tropical cyclones and make it a challenge to study the air-sea interaction near the sea surface. On the other hand, active remote sensors, such as spaceborne microwave scatterometers and synthetic aperture radars (SARs), can "see" through clouds and facilitate observations of the air-sea interaction processes. However, SAR acquires images and provides the wind field at a much higher resolution, where the eye of a tropical cyclone at surface level can be identified. The backscattered signals received by the SAR can be processed into a high-resolution image and calibrated to represent the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) of the sea surface. In this study, 33 RADARSAT-2 and 102 Sentinel-1 SAR images of Atlantic and Indian Ocean tropical cyclones and Pacific typhoons from 2016 to 2021, which display eye structure, have been statistically analyzed with ancillary tropical cyclone intensity information. To measure the size of the eye, a 34-kt (;17 m s21) contour is defined around it and the amount and size of pixels within the eye is utilized to provide its area in square kilometers. Additionally, an azimuthal wavenumber for each shape of the eye was assigned. Results showed that eye areas increase with decreasing wind speed and increasing wavenumber and demonstrate that SAR-derived data are useful for studying tropical cyclones at the air-sea interface and provide results of these behaviors closely to data derived from best track archives.

TI  - Multidisciplinary Analysis of the Nippur Sulcus Region on Ganymede
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - On Jupiter's largest moon Ganymede, we focus on the southern region of Nippur Sulcus, including the Epigeus palimpsest crater. This region displays geologically recent terrains and has good coverage of optical and near infrared remote sensing data, primarily returned by the NASA Galileo mission. We first use high-resolution optical imagery to carry out a detailed geological mapping. We combine hyperspectral data to infer the surface composition of this area. We then apply two theoretical models. The first is a self-similar clustering that uses the mapping of the grooves present in this region to infer the thickness of the ice shell. A second model is used to estimate the radar clutter noise induced by the estimated local topography, which is key for constraining future radar measurements. Based on all findings, we provide a possible evolutionary history of the Nippur Sulcus and Epigeus areas. This exercise shows the potential of an interdisciplinary data analysis combining wide-ranging scientific objectives such as geology, surface composition, and geophysics in view of the future close exploration that will be conducted on Ganymede by the JUICE spacecraft. Our work combines multiple analysis techniques that could be applied to other regions of interest and will prove crucial when JUICE data become available.

TI  - Prognostic Significance of Size, Location, and Number of Lymph Node Metastases in Endometrial Carcinoma
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional lymph node metastasis is a well-established negative predictive prognostic factor in endometrial carcinomas. Recently, our approach to the pathologic evaluation of lymph nodes in endometrial carcinomas has changed, mainly due to the utilization of immunohistochemical stains in the assessment of sentinel lymph nodes, which may result in the identification of previously unrecognized disease [particularly isolated tumor cells (ITCs)] on hematoxylin and eosin stained slides. However, the clinical significance of this finding is not entirely clear. Following the experience in other organs systems such as breast, the Eight Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer's Cancer Staging Manual has recommended utilizing the N0(i+) terminology for this finding, without impact in the final tumor stage. We performed a comparative retrospective multi-institutional survival analysis of 247 patients with endometrial carcinoma with regional lymph node metastasis of various sizes identified in nonsentinel lymphadenectomy, demonstrating that the cumulative survival of patients with isolated tumor cells in regional lymph nodes is not statistically different from patient with negative lymph nodes, and is statistically different from those with lymph nodes showing micrometastasis or larger metastatic deposits. In addition, we evaluated the prognostic implications of the number of involved regional lymph nodes, demonstrating a worsening prognosis as the number of involved lymph nodes increases from none to one, and from one to more than one. Our data suggests that regional lymph nodes with isolated tumor cells in patients with endometrial carcinoma should likely be considered, for staging purposes, as negative lymph nodes, simply indicating their presence with the (i+) terminology.

TI  - Applying a 1D Convolutional Neural Network in Flood Susceptibility Assessments-The Case of the Island of Euboea, Greece
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main scope of the study is to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network model (1D-CNN), in flood susceptibility assessment, in a selected test site on the island of Euboea, Greece. Logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), gradient boosting (GB), and a deep learning neural network (DLNN) model are the benchmark models used to compare their performance with that of a 1D-CNN model. Remote sensing (RS) techniques are used to collect the necessary flood related data, whereas thirteen flash-flood-related variables were used as predictive variables, such as elevation, slope, plan curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index, lithology, silt content, sand content, clay content, distance to faults, and distance to river network. The Weight of Evidence method was applied to calculate the correlation among the flood-related variables and to assign a weight value to each variable class. Regression analysis and multi-collinearity analysis were used to assess collinearity among the flood-related variables, whereas the Shapley Additive explanations method was used to rank the features by importance. The evaluation process involved estimating the predictive ability of all models via classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the success and predictive rate curves (AUC). The outcomes of the analysis confirmed that the 1D-CNN provided a higher accuracy (0.924), followed by LR (0.904) and DLNN (0.899). Overall, 1D-CNNs can be useful tools for analyzing flood susceptibility using remote sensing data, with high accuracy predictions.

TI  - A Study of the Relationships between Depths of Soil Constraints and Remote Sensing Data from Different Stages of the Growing Season
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of salinity and sodicity in the root zone can limit root development and impact crop yield. Topsoil constraints are likely to have the greatest impact on crop growth early in the growing season, when plant roots are still shallow. Later in the growing season, subsoil constraints may have a greater impact as roots reach deeper into the soil. This study investigated whether different patterns of spatial variation in crop growth would be evident in remote sensing data captured from different stages of the growing season, with the aim of providing a means of indicating whether soil constraints in the topsoil and in the subsoil might be impacting crop growth. If a topsoil constraint is impacting growth, we might expect its effects to show through a negative correlation between the soil constraint and the early-season vegetation index. However, we would not expect to observe the impact of a subsoil constraint until later in the season (when roots have reached the constraint). To test the results from the analysis of remote sensing data, we used soil data from five fields from across Australia's northern grains-growing region. We used these data to assess soil constraint severity and correlations between the soil constraints and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). The results of the study were inconclusive, and it was difficult to identify a dominant soil constraint with a clear relationship to crop growth. The soil data were also insufficient to draw conclusions about the depths of any dominant soil constraints. Furthermore, there was a lot of subjectivity in the interpretations of the correlations between remote sensing and soil data. The study also investigated the consistency of the spatial variation in EVI over multiple years, but the results were still inconclusive. In conclusion, this study highlights the challenges of using remote sensing data to diagnose soil constraints in agricultural settings. While remote sensing can provide useful insights into crop growth, interpreting these data and drawing meaningful conclusions about soil constraints requires further research and development.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Approaches for Oil Spill Detection: A Bibliometric Review of Research Trends and Challenges
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
AB  - Oil spill detection and mapping using deep learning (OSDMDL) is crucial for assessing its impact on coastal and marine ecosystems. A novel approach was employed in this study to evaluate the scientific literature in this field through bibliometric analysis and literature review. The Scopus database was used to evaluate the relevant scientific literature in this field, followed by a bibliometric analysis to extract additional information, such as architecture type, country collaboration, and most cited papers. The findings highlight significant advancements in oil detection at sea, with a strong correlation between technological evolution in detection methods and improved remote sensing data acquisition. Multilayer perceptrons (MLP) emerged as the most prominent neural network architecture in 11 studies, followed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) in 5 studies. U-Net, DeepLabv3+, and fully convolutional network (FCN) were each used in three studies, demonstrating their relative significance too. The analysis provides insights into collaboration, interdisciplinarity, and research methodology and contributes to the development of more effective policies, strategies, and technologies for mitigating the environmental impact of oil spills in OSDMDL.

TI  - Variations in land surface temperatures in small-scale urban areas in Vietnam during Covid-19 restrictions: Case studies from Da Nang, Hue and Vinh City
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important variable in urban microclimate research. At the end of 2019, the emergence of Covid-19 pandemic has changed the world in a manner that forced many countries to impose restrictions in human activities. As a measure to prevent the expansion of Covid-19 infections, most of the major cities have entered a prolonged lockdown period and reduction in human activities between the early 2020 and the late 2021. These restrictions were strict in most of the cities in Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam. The present study investigated the variations in LST and NDVI observed in three rapidly growing urban areas, namely Da Nang, Hue and Vinh, in Vietnam using Landsat-8 imagery acquired between 2017 and 2022. There has been a slight reduction in LST in the study sites, particularly in Da Nang City, during the lockdown period but not as high as observed in recently conducted studies from big metropolitan cities, including in Vietnam. It is also observed that LST estimated from built-up areas and other impervious surfaces remained relatively stable during the study period which is similar to the results from recent studies.

TI  - Google Earth Engine: A Global Analysis and Future Trends
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The continuous increase in the volume of geospatial data has led to the creation of storage tools and the cloud to process data. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based platform that facilitates geoprocessing, making it a tool of great interest to the academic and research world. This article proposes a bibliometric analysis of the GEE platform to analyze its scientific production. The methodology consists of four phases. The first phase corresponds to selecting "search" criteria, followed by the second phase focused on collecting data during the 2011 and 2022 periods using Elsevier's Scopus database. Software and bibliometrics allowed to review the published articles during the third phase. Finally, the results were analyzed and interpreted in the last phase. The research found 2800 documents that received contributions from 125 countries, with China and the USA leading as the countries with higher contributions supporting an increment in the use of GEE for the visualization and processing of geospatial data. The intellectual structure study and knowledge mapping showed that topics of interest included satellites, sensors, remote sensing, machine learning, land use and land cover. The co-citations analysis revealed the connection between the researchers who used the GEE platform in their research papers. GEE has proven to be an emergent web platform with the potential to manage big satellite data easily. Furthermore, GEE is considered a multidisciplinary tool with multiple applications in various areas of knowledge. This research adds to the current knowledge about the Google Earth Engine platform, analyzing its cognitive structure related to the research in the Scopus database. In addition, this study presents inferences and suggestions to develop future works with this methodology.

TI  - Disentangling Shallow Subsidence Sources by Data Assimilation in a Reclaimed Urbanized Coastal Plain, South Flevoland Polder, the Netherlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - This research targets disentangling shallow causes of anthropogenically induced subsidence in a reclaimed and urbanized coastal plain. The study area is the city of Almere, in the South Flevoland polder, the Netherlands, which is among the countries' fastest subsiding areas. The procedure consists of integrating Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data with high-resolution phreatic groundwater and lithoclass models, and a database containing construction details. The InSAR data were derived from Sentinel-1, one ascending and one descending track, over a period from March 2015 until June 2020. The two main parts of the workflow are isolation of the InSAR points of structures without a pile foundation and a data assimilation procedure. The shrinkage of surficial clay beds by phreatic groundwater level lowering is identified as the main cause of subsidence in the area, with an average contribution of 6 mm per year. The history-matched physics-based model predicts that 1 m drop in phreatic groundwater level now translates into 10 mm of subsidence in the next 5 years. Additionally, a groundwater deficiency due to severe dry periods should be considered as an accelerator of subsidence. To ensure a robust network to estimate subsidence, we recommend a consistent monitoring strategy of the phreatic groundwater level.

TI  - Forests as Markets<i> The</i><i> Overstory,</i> Neoliberalism, and Other Fictions of Spontaneous Order
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay argues for the deep affinities between neoliberalism and environmental thought that embraces such figures as fungi, swarms, and especially trees. While critics like Rob Nixon turn to trees to promote modes of cooperative biology and plant communication as blueprints for more symbiotic forms of sociality that offer alternatives to "hyperindividu-alism and hyperconsumption," they share with neoliberalism a more fundamental ontology of what Friedrich Hayek (after Michael Polanyi) calls "spontaneous order." Drawing on recent revisionary scholarship on neoliberalism, the first half of the essay argues that neoliberal-ism is less usefully thought of as an individualist anthropology than as a worldview that subordinates individuals to a nontransparent and distributed higher intelligence-that of the market. The second half of the essay illustrates the uncomfortable overlap between neo-liberal and environmental imaginaries through a discussion of Richard Powers's celebrated novel The Overstory. The overwhelmingly positive reception of the novel has praised its power to embody the arboreal life cycle it represents, but it has remained curiously blind to the way the novel's formal choices ask its characters to submit to the powers of a superior computerized intelligence-a gesture that is conspicuously close to the way neoliberalism compels individuals' submission to nontransparent market forces. The novel and its critical reception, like particular strands in the environmental humanities more generally, show that the opposition between the environmental imagination and neoliberalism is neutral-ized by a shared commitment to fictions of spontaneous order.

TI  - Methodology for the analysis of the frequency of shallow water bodies in the Pampean region, Argentina
T2  - INVESTIGACIONES GEOGRAFICAS-SPAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The shallow lakes of the Pampa region in Argentina are highly prone to variability in temperature and precipitation regime. These ecosystems are fundamental in environmental processes, but their presence and environmental services are unknown. Climate variability and agricultural activities have threatened them in recent decades by intervening and modifying the regional hydrography. This study seeks to monitor the evolution of shallow lakes and their relationship with climate variability over a period of 35 years using satellite imagery and meteorological data. It aims to study the dynamics in accordance with the change in temperature and precipitations. The historical collection of Landsat for 1986-2021 related to climate data through an ANCOVA analysis and a climate index of evapotranspiration-precipitation have been used. The results allow us to identify the distribution in the basin of the shallow lakes as semi-permanent, emphasizing that temperatures have a more substantial effect than the precipitations that would determine their presence or drying out. The proposed methodology frames the need to generate this type of information about the response of the hydrographic system to potential hazard and the identification of vulnerabilities.

TI  - DIGITALESCAPE Project-Aerial Remote Sensing, HBIM, and Archaeology for the Preservation and Dissemination of the Cultural Heritage at Risk in the Sierra Sur and Sierra Morena Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The province of Jaen (Andalusia, Spain), despite being declared the European territory with the largest number of defensive constructions (castles, fortifications, etc.), has few conservation plans, with many remains included on the Red List of Spanish Heritage lying abandoned. This poses a challenge for landscape conservation and the optimal use of the province's tourism potential. In this paper, we present the early implementation of an ongoing methodological approach designed to alleviate this situation. It takes advantage of data from the Sentinel 2A and 2B satellites, HBIM, RPAS, GIS, and fieldwork that will be applied across five archaeological case studies. It was tested for the first time in the village of Magana. Three main objectives and phases of this methodological approach were designed: 1. Preparation of an environmental risk chart with which to answer such questions as "How have climate change, anthropic alterations and environmental characteristics affected the state of conservation of certain heritage sites?" 2. Preparation of HBIM models to foster monitorisation and conservation policies for the main archaeological remains and improving their protection based on digital and technological tools. 3. Building a smart tourism app for mobile devices aimed at promoting smart tourism by digitalising and virtualising tourist itineraries and archaeological remains. Finally, public administrations will be apprised of the need to implement a conservation policy for cultural assets and their surroundings in a simple, quick, and cost-effective manner.

TI  - Evaluating the Performance of Sentinel-3A OLCI Products in the Subarctic Northeast Pacific
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The subarctic northeast Pacific (SNEP) is a high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) region in the ocean, where phytoplankton growth and productivity are limited by iron. Moreover, there is a limited application of high spatial (300 m) and temporal resolution (daily) ocean color (OC) satellite imagery in studying the phytoplankton dynamics in this region. To address this issue, we aim to validate the remote sensing reflectance (Rrs; sr(-1)(& lambda;)) and chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration derived from the Polymer atmospheric correction algorithm against in situ data for the SNEP obtained during 2019 and 2020. Additionally, we performed qualitative analysis using weekly binned surface Chla maps to determine whether the product reflects the general pattern over a latitudinal and longitudinal domain. We processed the daily Level-1 image using Polymer and binned them weekly using Graphic Processing Tool (GPT). The validation results indicate that Polymer exhibits higher radiometric performance in the blue and green bands and fails to represent in situ Rrs in the red band. Furthermore, the Polymer slightly over- and underestimates reflectance between 0.0012 and 0.0018 sr(-1) in the green band. On the other hand, excellent agreement was found between satellite-derived versus in situ Chla, followed by a slight overestimation of in situ Chla in the range from 0.17 to 0.28 mg/m(3). The weekly binned Chla spatial map revealed a spatially homogeneous distribution of surface Chla in Central Alaska, but a substantial increase in Chla (& GE;0.7 mg/m(3)) was recorded toward Southeast Alaska (SEA) and the British Columbia (BC) shelf. Furthermore, Chla derived from latitudinal and longitudinal transects indicates high Chla toward 57 & DEG;N and -135 & DEG;W, respectively. Overall, the results of this study emphasize the need to obtain high-quality matchups from under-sampled oligotrophic waters, which are crucial for satellite validation, in addition to highlighting the importance of using high spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery to study phytoplankton dynamics in the SNEP.

TI  - Invasive Cutaneous Melanoma: Evaluating the Prognostic Significance of Some Parameters Associated with Lymph Node Metastases
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: This study aimed to assess the clinical-pathological profile of patients with invasive cutaneous melanomas and to identify the parameters with a prognostic role in the lymph nodal spread of this malignant tumor. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective study on patients with invasive cutaneous melanomas who underwent surgery in the "Pius Brinzeu" County Clinical Emergency Hospital from Timisoara, Romania, and were evaluated for the status of loco-regional lymph nodes. We selected and analyzed some parameters searching for their relationship with lymph node metastases. Results: We identified 79 patients with invasive cutaneous melanomas (29 men and 50 women, mean age 59.36 years). A percentage of 58.3% of melanomas had Breslow tumor thickness >2 mm; 69.6% of melanomas showed a Clark level IV-V. Tumor ulceration was present in 59.5% of melanomas. A mitotic rate of & GE;5 mitoses/mm(2) was observed in 48.1% of melanomas. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), non-brisk, were present in 59.5% of cases and 22.8% of patients had satellite/in-transit metastasis (SINTM). Tumor regression was identified in 44.3% of cases. Lymph nodes metastases were found in 43.1% of patients. Statistical analysis showed that lymph node metastases were more frequent in melanomas with Breslow thickness >2 mm (p = 0.0002), high Clark level (p = 0.0026), mitotic rate >5 mitoses/mm(2) (p = 0.0044), ulceration (p = 0.0107), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.0182), SINTM (p = 0.0302), and non-brisk TILs (p = 0.0302). Conclusions: The Breslow thickness >2 mm, high Clark level, high mitotic rate and ulceration are the most important prognostic factors for lymph nodal spread in cutaneous melanomas. However, some melanomas without these clinical-pathological features can have an unexpected, aggressive evolution, which entails the necessity of close and prolonged clinical follow-up of patients, including those with lesions considered without risk.

TI  - A Model Integrating Satellite-Derived Shoreline Observations for Predicting Fine-Scale Shoreline Response to Waves and Sea-Level Rise Across Large Coastal Regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived shoreline observations combined with dynamic shoreline models enable fine-scale predictions of coastal change across large spatiotemporal scales. Here, we present a satellite-data-assimilated, "littoral-cell"-based, ensemble Kalman-filter shoreline model to predict coastal change and uncertainty due to waves, sea-level rise (SLR), and other natural and anthropogenic processes. We apply the developed ensemble model to the entire California coastline (approximately 1,760 km), much of which is sparsely monitored with traditional survey methods (e.g., Lidar/GPS). Water-level-corrected, satellite-derived shoreline observations (obtained from the CoastSat toolbox) offer a nearly unbiased representation of in situ surveyed shorelines (e.g., mean sea-level elevation contours) at Ocean Beach, San Francisco. We demonstrate that model calibration with satellite observations during a 20-year hindcast period (1995-2015) provides nearly equivalent model forecast accuracy during a validation period (2015-2020) compared to model calibration with monthly in situ observations at Ocean Beach. When comparing model-predicted shoreline positions to satellite-derived observations, the model achieves an accuracy of <10 m RMSE for nearly half of the entire California coastline for the validation period. The calibrated/validated model is then applied for multi-decadal simulations of shoreline change due to projected wave and sea-level conditions, while holding the model parameters fixed. By 2100, the model estimates that 24%-75% of California's beaches may become completely eroded due to SLR scenarios of 1.0-3.0 m, respectively. The satellite-data-assimilated modeling system presented here is generally applicable to a variety of coastal settings around the world owing to the global coverage of satellite imagery.

TI  - Near Real-Time Flood Mapping with Weakly Supervised Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in deep learning and computer vision are making significant contributions to flood mapping, particularly when integrated with remotely sensed data. Although existing supervised methods, especially deep convolutional neural networks, have proved to be effective, they require intensive manual labeling of flooded pixels to train a multi-layer deep neural network that learns abstract semantic features of the input data. This research introduces a novel weakly supervised approach for pixel-wise flood mapping by leveraging multi-temporal remote sensing imagery and image processing techniques (e.g., Normalized Difference Water Index and edge detection) to create weakly labeled data. Using these weakly labeled data, a bi-temporal U-Net model is then proposed and trained for flood detection without the need for time-consuming and labor-intensive human annotations. Using floods from Hurricanes Florence and Harvey as case studies, we evaluated the performance of the proposed bi-temporal U-Net model and baseline models, such as decision tree, random forest, gradient boost, and adaptive boosting classifiers. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a comprehensive assessment that (1) covered multiple test sites with varying degrees of urbanization, and (2) utilized both bi-temporal (i.e., pre- and post-flood) and uni-temporal (i.e., only post-flood) input. The experimental results showed that the proposed framework of weakly labeled data generation and the bi-temporal U-Net could produce near real-time urban flood maps with consistently high precision, recall, f1 score, IoU score, and overall accuracy compared with baseline machine learning algorithms.

TI  - Chinese Soil Moisture Observation Network and Time Series Data Set for High Resolution Satellite Applications
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - High-quality ground observation networks are an important basis for scientific research. Here, an automatic soil observation network for high-resolution satellite applications in China (SONTE-China) was established to measure both pixel- and multilayer-based soil moisture and temperature. SONTEChina is distributed across 17 field observation stations with a variety of ecosystems, covering both dry and wet zones. In this paper, the average root mean squared error (RMSE) of station-based soil moisture for well-characterized SONTE-China sites is 0.027 m(3)/m(3) (0.014 similar to 0.057 m(3)/m(3)) following calibration for specific soil properties. The temporal and spatial characteristics of the observed soil moisture and temperature in SONTE-China conform to the geographical location, seasonality and rainfall of each station. The time series Sentinel-1 C-band radar signal and soil moisture show strong correlations, and the RMSE of the estimated soil moisture from radar data was lower than 0.05 m(3)/m(3) for the Guyuan and Minqin stations. SONTE-China is a soil moisture retrieval algorithm that can validate soil moisture products and provide basic data for weather forecasting, flood forecasting, agricultural drought monitoring and water resource management.

AB  - The expansion of power development industry is facing enormous pressure to reduce carbon emissions in the context of global decarbonization. Using solar energy instead of traditional fossil energy to adjust energy structure is one of the important means for reducing carbon emissions. Existing research focuses on the evaluation of the generation potential of centralized or distributed photovoltaic power plants, rather than the comprehensive evaluation of multi-type power plants. Based on multi-source remote sensing data for information extraction and suitability evaluation, this paper develops a method to comprehensively evaluate the construction potential of multi-type photovoltaic power stations and determine the potential of photovoltaic power generation and carbon emission reduction on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). The results showed that estimating the power generation potential of only single-type photovoltaic power stations cannot accurately reflect the photovoltaic power generation potential of QTP. It is also demonstrated that the emission reduction effect of the photovoltaic power generation in all prefecture-level cities of QTP can meet national emission reduction targets, showing high annual power generation potential, of which 86.59% is concentrated in Qinghai province's Guoluo, Yushu, and Haixi. An accurate estimation of the photovoltaic power generation potential in QTP can provide a useful theoretical basis for developing carbon-saving and emission reduction strategies for clean energy in China.

TI  - Human activities dominate a staged degradation pattern of coastal tidal wetlands in Jiangsu province, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The tidal wetlands in Jiangsu Province (JS) play a crucial role as a major blue carbon sink in the eastern coastal area of China. These wetlands also contribute significantly function to biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services. However, due to the escalating impact of anthropogenic activities and climatic changes, the ecological scope, structure, and function of tidal wetlands have changed drastically. This study aims to depict the spatiotemporal dynamics of these wetlands and explore the driving forces behind these changes. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of all the available Landsat imagery (5096 images, 30-m spatial resolution) using the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. The outputs consist of annual land cover maps of JS coastal zone, from 1990 to 2020. Results indicate that the generated coastal maps generally exhibit an exceptionally high average accuracy (92.62%) and there were 2666.54 km2 of tidal wetlands (Spartina alterniflora: 240.86 km2, Suaeda salsa: 37.31 km2, Phragmites australis: 150.63 km2, intertidal flat: 2158.18 km2, supratidal barren flat: 79.53 km2) in 2020, amounting to a 23.43% decrease of the initial year 1990. The tidal wetlands landscape had a staged decline during 1990-2020, and the hydrological vegetation habitat was the area with the greatest variability. Over the past three decades, the losses of tidal wetlands amounted to 1,466.22 km2, partially offset by gains of 650.05 km2. The two most substantial sources of losses were intertidal flat and Suaeda salsa with the most significant ratio of loss to gain (4.80, 10.31, respectively). Generally, we categorized tidal wetlands degradation into three transformation processes: human activities, species invasion, and natural succession. Human activities, particularly the conversion of intertidal flat into aquafarm, dominated the entire degradation process. Meanwhile, in the main driving analysis, we discovered that 60% of these losses and gains were directly tied to human activities. The indirect driving process includes natural coastal movements, climate change, unobservable human activities, and their aggregate effects, which gradually assist tidal wetlands ecosystems to re-establish and recover. The annual coastal wetland maps and detailed information on the evolutionary patterns and the corresponding drivers are valuable for identifying blue carbon distribution and enhancing the ecological services of the coastal zone.

TI  - Assessment of Six Machine Learning Methods for Predicting Gross Primary Productivity in Grassland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland gross primary productivity (GPP) is an important part of global terrestrial carbon flux, and its accurate simulation and future prediction play an important role in understanding the ecosystem carbon cycle. Machine learning has potential in large-scale GPP prediction, but its application accuracy and impact factors still need further research. This paper takes the Mongolian Plateau as the research area. Six machine learning methods (multilayer perception, random forest, Adaboost, gradient boosting decision tree, XGBoost, LightGBM) were trained using remote sensing data (MODIS GPP) and 14 impact factor data and carried out the prediction of grassland GPP. Then, using flux observation data (positions of flux stations) and remote sensing data (positions of non-flux stations) as reference data, detailed accuracy evaluation and comprehensive trade-offs are carried out on the results, and key factors affecting prediction performance are further explored. The results show that: (1) The prediction results of the six methods are highly consistent with the change tendency of the reference data, demonstrating the applicability of machine learning in GPP prediction. (2) LightGBM has the best overall performance, with small absolute error (mean absolute error less than 1.3), low degree of deviation (root mean square error less than 3.2), strong model reliability (relative percentage difference more than 5.9), and a high degree of fit with reference data (regression determination coefficient more than 0.97), and the prediction results are closest to the reference data (mean bias is only -0.034). (3) Enhanced vegetation index, normalized difference vegetation index, precipitation, land use/land cover, maximum air temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and evapotranspiration are significantly higher than other factors as determining factors, and the total contribution ratio to the prediction accuracy exceeds 95%. They are the main factors influencing GPP prediction. This study can provide a reference for the application of machine learning in GPP prediction and also support the research of large-scale GPP prediction.

TI  - The spherical cap harmonic model of lithospheric magnetic anomaly in Chinese region derived from CSES satellite data
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES) was launched successfully in February 2018. It is China's first satellite to measure geophysical fields with scientific goals in both space and solid earth physics. In this work, we used the CSES scalar magnetic data to derive a regional lithospheric magnetic field model in Chinese region by spherical cap harmonic analysis. The night-side data from March 2018 to May 2022 under quiet space weather condition (Kp <= 2o) were selected. Then the core and external field were removed by CHAOS-7 model. The obtained lithospheric magnetic anomaly was used to produce the spherical cap harmonic model in Chinese region with a maximum degree to 53.17, corresponding to wavelength at the Earth's surface of 752 km. This model can clearly reveal the long-wavelength magnetic anomalies in China and surrounding regions: the magnetic high anomalies over Tarim basin, Sichuan basin, Songliao basin, Baikal Lake and Bengal basin, and the magnetic low anomaly in southern Himalayan-Tibetan plateau. It is compared to the spherical cap harmonic model using Swarm-A satellite data and the CHAOS-7 spherical harmonic model, which indicates that they are generally consistent with small differences in details of amplitude and spatial distribution, and the CSES model is still reliable by downward continuation to 100 km altitude.

TI  - Fast and Accurate Refocusing for Moving Ships in SAR Imagery Based on FrFT
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is capable of monitoring the ocean all day, regardless of weather conditions. However, moving ships exhibit azimuth defocus in SAR images, which severely hampers ship recognition performance. Ships typically move in a linear motion at sea. For refocusing linear moving ships, existing SAR autofocus algorithms cannot accurately extract defocus information and require multiple iterations. To overcome the poor focusing quality and high computational complexity of existing refocusing algorithms, this paper proposes a fast and accurate refocusing scheme for moving ships in SAR imagery based on Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT). Firstly, the azimuth line with the strongest energy in the SAR image is selected as the best azimuth line representing its motion property. Then, according to the entropy variation law of the azimuth line after FrFT, the azimuth line's optimal rotation order is determined by the proposed minimum entropy search method, which can accurately and quickly obtain defocus information. In the final refocusing module, the scheme provides two ways, i.e., fast or fine refocusing approaches, to generate well-focused images. The fast refocusing approach performs FrFT on each azimuth line at the optimal rotation order of the best azimuth line. The fine refocusing approach takes the optimal rotation order of the best azimuth line as the initial value and further searches for the optimal rotation order of other azimuth lines. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, experiments are carried out on a number of Gaofen-3 SAR images in different acquisition modes. The experimental results show that the proposed fast refocusing approach can achieve the fastest speed, which is 2.1% of the traditional FrFT-based method's processing time. Moreover, the proposed fine refocusing approach has the best focusing performance, achieving the lowest image entropy among existing methods.

TI  - Automatic Pear Extraction from High-Resolution Images by a Visual Attention Mechanism Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, forest and fruit resource surveys are mainly based on ground surveys, and the information technology of the characteristic forest and fruit industries is evidently lagging. The automatic extraction of fruit tree information from massive remote sensing data is critical for the healthy development of the forest and fruit industries. However, the complex spatial information and weak spectral information contained in high-resolution images make it difficult to classify fruit trees. In recent years, fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have been shown to perform well in the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images because of their end-to-end network structures. In this paper, an end-to-end network model, Multi-Unet, was constructed. As an improved version of the U-Net network structure, this structure adopted multiscale convolution kernels to learn spatial semantic information under different receptive fields. In addition, the "spatial-channel" attention guidance module was introduced to fuse low-level and high-level features to reduce unnecessary semantic features and refine the classification results. The proposed model was tested in a characteristic high-resolution pear tree dataset constructed through field annotation work. The results show that Multi-Unet was the best performer among all models, with classification accuracy, recall, F1, and kappa coefficient of 88.95%, 89.57%, 89.26%, and 88.74%, respectively. This study provides important practical significance for the sustainable development of the characteristic forest fruit industry.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes of ecological environment quality and climate drivers in Zoige Plateau
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological environment is the essential material basis of human survival and connects regional economy with socially sustainable development. However, climate changes characterized by global climate warming have caused a series of ecological environmental problems in recent years. Few studies have discussed various climate factors affecting the ecological environment, and the spatial non-stationary effects of different climate factors on the ecological environment are still unclear. Dynamically monitoring ecological environment changes in fragile areas and identifying its climate-driving mechanism are essential for ecological protection and environmental repair. Taking Zoige Plateau as a case, this paper simulated the eco-environmental quality during 1987-2020 using remote sensing data, utilized Geodetector method to identify the contributions of various climate drivers to ecological environment quality, and then adopted the Geographically Weighted Regression model to explore the spatial non-stationary impacts of climate factors on ecological environment quality. The results showed that the ecological quality in the middle regions of the Zoige Plateau was slightly better than in the surrounding marginal areas. For the whole area of Zoige Plateau, the average ecological environment quality index was 54.92, 53.99, 56.17, 57.88, 63.44, 56.93, 59.43, and 59.76 in 1987, 1992, 1997, 2001, 2006, 2013, 2016 and 2020, respectively, which indicated that eco-environmental quality witnessed several fluctuations during the study period but showed a generally increasing trend. Among five climate factors, the temperature was the dominant climate factor affecting the ecological environment quality (q value: 0.11-0.19), sunshine duration (0.03-0.17), wind speed (0.03-0.11), and precipitation (0.03-0.08) were the main climate drivers, while the explanatory power of relative humidity to ecological environment quality was relatively small. Such various climate factors impacting the ecological environment quality demonstrated distinct spatial non-stationary and the range of driving impact varied with time. Temperature, sunshine duration, wind speed, and relative humidity promoted ecological environment quality in most regions (regression coefficients > 0), while precipitation mainly had a negative inhibitory impact (regression coefficients < 0). Meanwhile, the greater impacts of these five climate factors were concentrated in high-elevation regions of the south and west or the northern areas. The appropriate enhancement of climate warming and air humidity was beneficial to the improvement of the ecological environment, but the excessive precipitation would result in landslides and exhibit inhibition of vegetation growth. Therefore, selecting cold-tolerant herbs and shrubs, and strengthening climate monitoring and early warning systems (such as drought and excessive precipitation) are essential for ecological restoration.

TI  - Study on the Erosion and Deposition Changes of Tidal Flat in Jiangsu Province Using ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological dynamics of tidal flats are subject to continuous transformations attributed to the interplay of the tidal erosion and sedimentation processes. Accordingly, the realization of a dynamic monitoring system for tidal flats holds significant importance in facilitating the judicious utilization and safeguarding of tidal flats resources. In this study, an integrated methodology was implemented to monitor and assess the tidal flats in Jiangsu province. Specifically, a collection of five multispectral images from the Sentinel-2 satellite was acquired, coupled with data derived from the ICESat-2 satellite. Through the application of advanced techniques, including convolutional neural networks and machine learning algorithms, a comprehensive combined model for inverting tidal flats topography was developed. The accuracy disparity between various model combinations was meticulously evaluated, thereby enabling the acquisition of detailed topography information encompassing the entirety of Jiangsu's tidal flats for the year 2021. Comparative analysis against measured topographic data demonstrated that the overall accuracy of the combined model inversion surpassed 80%. Additionally, this study conducted an extensive investigation into the temporal evolution of tidal flats in Jiangsu by integrating data from 2008 to 2021, focusing particularly on the measured topography from 2008. Consequently, the study successfully delineated the various types of tidal flats present in Jiangsu and elucidated their corresponding evolutionary trends.

TI  - Spatiotemporal pattern of vegetation water use efficiency between 2003 and 2017 and its coupling relationship with artificial carbon sequestration in the karst region of Southwestern China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - After extensive ecological restoration in the karst region of Southwestern China, a potential zone for achieving "carbon neutrality" has emerged, despite facing water scarcity. We analyzed the dynamics of water use efficiency (WUE) and its correlations with soil moisture (SM) and leaf area index (LAI) from 2003 to 2017 using PML-V2 data and multiple datasets for SM and LAI. Advantageous areas for artificial carbon sequestration (CS) were also identified. Key findings are as follows: (1) Temporally, WUE exhibited fluctuating growth at an annual rate of 0.01 gCmm -1H2O (P < 0.05). The advantage areas for CS accounted for 15.96%, with over 31.74% of regions needing management intervention. (2) Monthly WUE was highest in the peak forest plain (PFP) landform (2.88 gCmm(-1)H(2)O), while PFP experiencing an annual decrease of 0.0021 gCmm(-1)H(2)O. (3) Monthly WUE was highest in forests (2.88 gCmm 1H2O), followed by shrubs (2.49 gCmm(-1)H(2)O), farmland (2.32 gCmm(-1)H(2)O) and grassland (1.93 gCmm(-1)H(2)O), while farmland showing the highest rate of increase (0.02). (4) WUE and SM exhibited both positive (14.26%similar to 26.02%) and negative (14.19%similar to 30.98%) correlations. In positive areas, WUE decreased as the drought stress index (DSI) increased for all vegetation types. Clear DSI threshold observed for farmland (0.29 to 0.42) and grassland (0.19 to 0.30). However, the peak values for forests and shrubs were less pronounced. There was a transitional point in the negative impact of DSI on WUE, which increased at a faster rate for all vegetation types when DSI exceeded 0.53. (5) WUE and LAI exhibited both positive (27.09% similar to 30.25%) and negative (23.37%similar to 34.57%) correlations. In positive areas, WUE increased as LAI increased for all vegetation types. However, forests exhibited threshold LAI values of 1.85 based on MODIS data, 2.71 based on GLASS data, and 2.59 based on GEOV2 data, shrubs had values of 1.69, 2.66, and 2.23, respectively. While grassland displayed LAI values of 0.79, 0.70, and 0.72, respectively. In negative areas, WUE decreased as LAI increased for all vegetation types. The minimum WUE values were observed when the LAI of farmland was 3.14 based on MODIS data, 4.05 based on GLASS data, and for grassland, it was 1.04, 1.97, and 1.76 based on the GEOV2 data, respectively. This study helps us to identify areas with potential for enhancing CS. It also assists in making informed decisions regarding the implementation of ecological restoration initiatives by considering SM as the limiting factor for adjustment measures and utilizing LAI as the reference standard.

TI  - Evaluating Urban Building Damage of 2023 Kahramanmaras, Turkey Earthquake Sequence Using SAR Change Detection
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - On February 6, 2023 (local time), two earthquakes (Mw7.8 and Mw7.7) struck central and southern Turkey, causing extensive damage to several cities and claiming a toll of 40,000 lives. In this study, we propose a method for seismic building damage assessment and analysis by combining SAR amplitude and phase coherence change detection. We determined building damage in five severely impacted urban areas and calculated the damage ratio by measuring the urban area and the damaged area. The largest damage ratio of 18.93% is observed in Nurdagi, and the smallest ratio of 7.59% is found in Islahiye. We verified the results by comparing them with high-resolution optical images and AI recognition results from the Microsoft team. We also used pixel offset tracking (POT) technology and D-InSAR technology to obtain surface deformation using Sentinel-1A images and analyzed the relationship between surface deformation and post-earthquake urban building damage. The results show that Nurdagi has the largest urban average surface deformation of 0.48 m and Antakya has the smallest deformation of 0.09 m. We found that buildings in the areas with steeper slopes or closer to earthquake faults have higher risk of collapse. We also discussed the influence of SAR image parameters on building change recognition. Image resolution and observation geometry have a great influence on the change detection results, and the resolution can be improved by various means to raise the recognition accuracy. Our research findings can guide earthquake disaster assessment and analysis and identify influential factors of earthquake damage.

TI  - Fine-Resolution Forest Height Estimation by Integrating ICESat-2 and Landsat 8 OLI Data with a Spatial Downscaling Method for Aboveground Biomass Quantification
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) with fine details is crucial for effective forest monitoring and management, where forest height plays a key role in AGB quantification. In this study, we propose a random forest (RF)-based down-scaling method to map forest height and biomass at a 15-m resolution by integrating Landsat 8 OLI and Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) LiDAR data. ICESat-2 photon data are used to derive canopy parameters along 15-m segments, which are considered sample plots for the extrapolation of discrete forest height. Fourteen variables associated with spectral features, textual features and vegetation index are extracted from pan-sharpened Landsat 8 images. A regression function is established between these variables and ICESat-2-derived forest height to produce a 15-m continuous forest height distribution data based on the 30-m forest height product using the RF algorithm. Finally, a wall-to-wall forest AGB at 15-m spatial resolution is achieved by using an allometric model specific to the forest type and height. The Jilin Province in northeast China is taken as the study area, and the forest AGB estimation results reveal a density of 61.15 Mg/ha with a standard deviation of 89.46 Mg/ha. The R-2 between our predicted forest heights and the ICESat-2-derived heights reaches 0.93. Validation results at the county scale demonstrate reasonable correspondence between the estimated AGB and reference data, with consistently high R-2 value exceeding 0.65. This downscaling method provides a promising scheme to estimate spatial forest AGB with fine details and to enhance the accuracy of AGB estimation, which may facilitate carbon stock measurement and carbon cycle studies.

TI  - Field-Measured Hydraulic Traits and Remotely Sensed NDVI of Four Subtropical Tree Species Showed Transient Declines during the Drought-Heatwave Event
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Unpredictable drought-heatwave events occur frequently worldwide, causing low water availability (drought) and high temperatures (hot), with consequences for forest decline and mortality. Our knowledge of the potential instantaneous reactions and subsequent recovery of water-related physiological processes and vegetation indices in hot drought events remains unclear. Here, we investigated how the 2022 summer drought-heatwave event in the subtropical regions of China affected hydraulic traits and NDVI values in the forests of four common subtropical tree species. During the hot drought, the NDVI values of all four forests decreased (-31%similar to-23%), accompanied by leaf scorch and tree crown dieback. Among the four species, a hot drought event caused an instantaneous descent in hydraulic conductivity (K-s, -72%similar to-31%), stomatal conductance (g(s), -94%similar to-50%), and midday water potential (-40%similar to-169%), with severe drought-induced stem xylem embolism. A trade-off was found between resistance and resilience in hot-drought-induced hydraulic dysfunction, as species with lower declines in K-s and g(s) during the hot drought had a shorter recovery in the post-stress phase. This study highlights that the 2022 hot drought event had severe negative instantaneous impacts on the forests of four subtropical tree species, which were reflected both in water-related physiological processes in the field and in remote sensing data from satellites.

TI  - Effect of GNSS radio occultation observations on the prediction of the 2021 Henan rainstorm
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately predicting heavy rainstorms remains challenging due to limited spatial and temporal measurements. Nowadays, space-borne Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) data provides high spatial-resolution atmospheric parameters, which can improve the precision of heavy rainfall prediction. This study investigates the impact of GNSS radio occultation observations on forecasting the extremely heavy rainfall that occurred in Henan, China, on July 20, 2021. We assimilate GNSS radio occultation data from Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate-2 (COSMIC-2), MetOp-A/B/C, and Fengyun (FY)-3C GNOS in Weather Research and Forecasting Model Data Assimilation (WRFDA) three-dimensional framework (3DVAR) system, using the local refractivity operator. Control experiment (CNTL) and RO are designed to assess the impact of GNSS radio occultation on this extreme rainfall prediction, and RO + GNOS is conducted to further evaluate the influence of GNSS RO data onboard FY-3C. The fractions skill score (FSS) is used to quantify the accuracy of predicted precipitation at given thresholds. The results demonstrate that assimilating GNSS radio occultation data improves precipitation forecasts in terms of the distribution and quantity, due to more precise initial conditions for the moisture field. The study also finds that RO and RO + GNOS produce similar increments and outperform the CNTL, indicating a more accurate humidity field near Henan and more explicit water vapor channels. Moreover, the study reveals that assimilating additional data from GNOS onboard FY-3C significantly enhances the prediction of this record-breaking rainfall.

TI  - Characteristics of Air Pollutant Distribution and Sources in the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea in Spring Based on Multiple Observation Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The composition of marine aerosol is quite complex, and its sources are diverse. Across the East China Sea (ECS) and the Yellow Sea (YS), multi-dimensional analysis of marine aerosols was conducted. The characteristics of carbonaceous aerosols and gaseous pollutants were explored through in situ ship-based observation, MERRA-2 reanalysis datasets and TROPOMI data from Sentinel-5P satellite. Black carbon (BC)'s average concentration is 1.35 & PLUSMN; 0.78 mu g/m(3), with high-value BC observed during the cruise. Through HYSPLIT trajectory analysis, sources of BC were from the northern Eurasian continent, the Shandong Peninsula, the ECS and Northwest Pacific Ocean (NWPO). The transport of marine sources like ship emissions cannot be ignored. According to the absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE), BC originates from biomass burning (BB) in the shortwave band (similar to 370 nm) and from fossil fuel combustion in the longwave band (similar to 660 nm). Organic carbon (OC), sulfate (SO42-) and BC report higher Angstrom exponent (AE) while dust and sea salt reveal lower AE, which can be utilized to classify the aerosols as being fine- or coarse-mode, respectively. OC has the highest AE (ECS: 1.98, YS: 2.01), indicating that anthropogenic activities could be a significant source. The process of biomass burning aerosol (BBA) mixed with sea salt could contribute to the decline in BBA's AE. Ship emissions may affect the distribution of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the ECS, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tropospheric NO2 over the YS has the highest value (up to 12 x 10(15) molec/cm(2)). Stratospheric NO2 has a ladder-like distribution from north to south, and the variation gradient was lower than that in the troposphere. Carbon monoxide (CO) accumulates in the south and east of the ECS and the east of the YS, while the variation over the eastern YS is relatively frequent. Seas near the Korean Peninsula have extremely high CO concentration (up to 1.35 x 10(17) molec/cm(2)).

TI  - HIGH PREVALENCE OF <i>CYTAUXZOON FELIS</i> IN BOBCATS (<i>LYNX RUFUS</i>) ACROSS OKLAHOMA AND OCCURRENCE IN WEST TEXAS, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cytauxzoonosis is a fatal tick-borne disease in domestic cats caused by infection with the apicomplexan Cytauxzoon felis. Bobcats are the natural wild-vertebrate reservoirs for C. felis, and infections are typically subclinical and chronic in this species. The present study was done to determine the prevalence and geographic distribution of C. felis infection in wild bobcats from Oklahoma and the occurrence in northwestern Texas. Tongue samples from 360 bobcats were collected from 53 counties in Oklahoma and 13 samples from three counties in Texas. For DNA extracted from each tongue sample, a probe-based droplet digital PCR assay was performed targeting the C. felis mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit III (cox3). Prevalence of C. felis infection was calculated for each county sampled, and data from individual counties were combined according to geographic regions and compared using chi-square tests. Overall prevalence of C. felis in bobcats from Oklahoma was 80.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75.6-83.8). The prevalence of infection was.90% for bobcats from central, northeastern, south-central, and southeastern regions of Oklahoma, but,68% for bobcats from northwestern and southwestern regions. Bobcats from central counties in Oklahoma were 25.693 times more likely to be infected with C. felis compared to all other bobcats sampled from the state. Higher prevalence estimates of C. felis in bobcats appeared to be in counties where known tick vectors are most common. Occurrence of C. felis in bobcats from northwestern Texas was 30.8% (95% CI, 12.4%-58.0%) based on 13 samples. Results of this study support the utilization of bobcats as sentinel animals to identify geographic areas with risk of C. felis infection to domestic cats.

TI  - Identification of Water Layer Presence in Paddy Fields Using UAV-Based Visible and Thermal Infrared Imagery
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate identification of the water layer condition of paddy fields is a prerequisite for precise water management of paddy fields, which is important for the water-saving irrigation of rice. Until now, the study of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing data to monitor the moisture condition of field crops has mostly focused on dry crops, and research on the water status of paddy fields has been relatively limited. In this study, visible and thermal infrared images of paddy fields at key growth stages were acquired using a UAV remote sensing platform, and three model input variables were constructed by extracting the color features and temperature features of each field, while K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR) analysis methods were applied to establish a model for identifying the water layer presence in paddy fields. The results showed that KNN, SVM, and RF performed well in recognizing the presence of water layers in paddy fields; KNN had the best recognition accuracy (89.29%) via algorithm comparison and parameter preference. In terms of model input variables, using multisource remote sensing data led to better results than using thermal or visible images alone, and thermal data was more effective than visible data for identifying the water layer status of rice fields. This study provides a new paradigm for monitoring the water status of rice fields, which will be key to the precision irrigation of paddy fields in large regions in the future.

TI  - Early Crop Mapping Based on Sentinel-2 Time-Series Data and the Random Forest Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Early-season crop mapping and information extraction is essential for crop growth monitoring and yield prediction, and it facilitates agricultural management and rapid response to agricultural disasters. However, training classifiers by remote sensing classification features for early crop prediction can be challenging, as early-season mapping can only use remote sensing image data during part of the crop growth period. In order to overcome this limitation, this study takes the Sanjiang Plain as an example to investigate the earliest identification time of rice, maize and soybean based on Sentinel-2 time-series data and the random forest classification algorithm. Crop information extraction was then performed. Following the analysis of the remote sensing classification features by the random forest importance approach and the subsequent normalization, the optimal features greater than or equal to 0.5 have yielded quite results in early crop mapping, and their overall accuracy was the highest in early-season mapping. The overall accuracy was observed to improve by 5% for 10 to 20 days of delay. In addition, rice, maize, and soybean were mapped at the irrigation transplanting period (10 May), jointing stage (9 July) and flowering (29 July), with an overall accuracy of 90.4%, 90.0% and 90.9%, respectively. This study shows that features suitable for early crop classification can be selected by random forest importance analysis as well as the ability of remote sensing to extract crop acreage information within the reproductive period.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Classification of High-Resolution Satellite Images for Mangrove Mapping
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed information about mangroves is crucial for ecological and environmental protection and sustainable development. It is difficult to capture small patches of mangroves from satellite images with relatively low to medium resolution. In this study, high-resolution (0.8-2 m) images from Chinese GaoFen (GF) and ZiYuan (ZY) series satellites were used to map the distribution of mangroves in coastal areas of Guangdong Province, China. A deep-learning network, U-2-Net, with attention gates was applied to extract multi-scale information of mangroves from satellite images. The results showed that the attention U-2-Net model performed well on mangrove classification. The overall accuracy, precision, and F1-score values were 96.5%, 92.0%, and 91.5%, respectively, which were higher than those obtained from other machine-learning methods such as Random Forest or U-Net. Based on the high-resolution mangrove maps generated from long satellite image time series, we also investigated the spatiotemporal evolution of the mangrove forest in Shuidong Bay. The results can provide crucial information for government administrators, scientists, and other stakeholders to monitor the dynamic changes in mangroves.

TI  - Plant optics: underlying mechanisms in remotely sensed signals for phenotyping applications.
T2  - AoB PLANTS
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Optical-based remote sensing offers great potential for phenotyping vegetation traits and functions for a range of applications including vegetation monitoring and assessment. A key strength of optical-based approaches is the underlying mechanistic link to vegetation physiology, biochemistry, and structure that influences a spectral signal. By exploiting spectral variation driven by plant physiological response to environment, remotely sensed products can be used to estimate vegetation traits and functions. However, oftentimes these products are proxies based on covariance, which can lead to misinterpretation and decoupling under certain scenarios. This viewpoint will discuss (i) the optical properties of vegetation, (ii) applications of vegetation indices, solar-induced fluorescence, and machine-learning approaches, and (iii) how covariance can lead to good empirical proximation of plant traits and functions. Understanding and acknowledging the underlying mechanistic basis of plant optics must be considered as remotely sensed data availability and applications continue to grow. Doing so will enable appropriate application and consideration of limitations for the use of optical-based remote sensing for phenotyping applications.

TI  - Developing a High-Resolution Seamless Surface Water Extent Time-Series over Lake Victoria by Integrating MODIS and Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To effectively monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of the surface water extent (SWE) in Lake Victoria, this study introduced a novel methodology for generating a seamless SWE time series with fine resolution by integrating daily a Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat imagery. In the proposed methodology, daily normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data with 30 m resolution were first generated based on the constructed pixel-by-pixel downscaling models between the simultaneously acquired MODIS-NDVI and Landsat-NDVI data. In the compositing process, a Minimum Value Composite (MinVC) algorithm was used to generate monthly minimum NDVI time series, which were then segmented into a seamless SWE time series of the years 2000-2020 with 30 m resolution from the cloud background. A comparison with the existing Landsat-derived JRC (European Joint Research Centre) monthly surface water products and altimetry-derived water level series revealed that the proposed methodology effectively provides reliable descriptions of spatio-temporal SWE dynamics. Over Lake Victoria, the average percentage of valid observations made using the JRC's products was only about 70% due to persistent cloud cover or linear strips, and the correlation with the water level series was poor (R-2 = 0.13). In contrast, our derived results strongly correlated with the water level series (R-2 = 0.54) and efficiently outperformed the JRC's surface water products in terms of both space and time. Using the derived SWE data, the long-term and seasonal characteristics of lake area dynamics were studied. During the past 20 years, a significant changing pattern of an initial decline followed by an increase was found for the annual mean SWE, with the lowest area of 66,386.57 km(2) in 2006. A general seasonal variation in the monthly mean lake area was also observed, with the largest SWE obtained during June-August and the smallest SWE observed during September-November. Particularly in the spring of 2006 and the autumn of 2020, Lake Victoria experienced intense episodes of drought and flooding, respectively. These results demonstrate that our proposed methodology is more robust with respect to capturing spatially and temporally continuous SWE data in cloudy conditions, which could also be further extended to other regions for the optimal management of water resources.

TI  - The Heterogeneity of the Drivers of Urban Form in China: Perspectives from Regional Disparities and Development Stage Variations
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Although there have been many discussions about the influencing factors of urban expansion, the heterogeneity of the driving mechanisms behind urban form remains poorly understood. Therefore, this paper evaluated the heterogeneous impacts of potential determinants on urban form, considering regional disparities and the stage of development. Based on land use data collected from Landsat ETM and TM scenes, the landscape metrics of urban size, urban centrality, urban shape irregularity, and urban fragmentation were measured to describe the urban form of 265 Chinese cities. We find that the regional disparities and development-stage variations significantly affect urban form. All urban form variables showed a significant stair-stepping difference in cities at various development stages, indicating that as a city upgrades its level of development, the intensity of urban expansion gradually increases, the shape of the urban edge becomes more fragmented and the urban built-up area becomes more compact. Urban form in Chinese cities shows significant geographical heterogeneity in terms of its driving forces. The effect of the socioeconomic factors on urban form also presented changes depending on the development stage. Our results provide helpful references for policymakers within urban spatial structure planning and land resource management.

TI  - Historical Eco-Environmental Quality Mapping in China with Multi-Source Data Fusion
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the initiation of economic reforms and opening up, China has witnessed an unprecedented rate of development across all sectors. However, the country has also experienced severe ecological damage, surpassing that of many other nations. The rapid economic growth has come at the expense of the environment, revealing a significant lack of coordination between urbanization and eco-environmental protection in China. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive and continuous historical dataset of China's eco-environmental quality (EEQ) based on remote sensing, allowing for the analysis of spatial and temporal changes. Such data would provide objective, scientific, and reliable support for China's eco-environmental protection and pollution prevention policies, while addressing potential ecological risks resulting from urbanization. To achieve this, the entropy value method is employed to integrate multi-source remote sensing data and construct an evaluation system for China's EEQ. Historical data from 2000 to 2017 is plotted to illustrate China's EEQ over time. The findings of this study are as follows: (1) The entropy method effectively facilitates the construction of China's eco-environmental quality assessment system. (2) From 2000 to 2017, approximately 39.7% of China's regions witnessed a decrease in EEQ, while 60.3% exhibited improvement, indicating an overall enhancement in EEQ over the past eighteen years. (3) The Yangtze and Yellow River basins experienced improved EEQ due to China's ecological restoration projects. (4) The future EEQ in China demonstrates a subtle positive trend across diverse contexts. This study departs from conventional approaches to EEQ evaluation by leveraging the advantages of multivariate remote sensing big data, including objectivity, timeliness, and accessibility. It provides a novel perspective for future eco-environmental quality evaluation.

TI  - Clinical feasibility and oncological safety of non-radioactive targeted axillary dissection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer: a prospective diagnostic and prognostic study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Targeted axillary dissection (TAD) includes biopsy of clipped lymph node and sentinel lymph nodes. However, clinical evidence regarding clinical feasibility and oncological safety of non-radioactive TAD in a real-world cohort remains limited. Methods:In this prospective registry study, patients routinely underwent clip insertion into biopsy-confirmed lymph node. Eligible patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by axillary surgery. Main endpoints included the false-negative rate (FNR) of TAD and nodal recurrence rate. Results:Data from 353 eligible patients were analyzed. After completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 85 patients directly proceeded to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), furthermore, TAD with or without ALND was performed in 152 and 85 patients, respectively. Overall detection rate of clipped node was 94.9% (95% CI, 91.3-97.4%) and FNR of TAD was 12.2% (95% CI, 6.0-21.3%) in our study, with FNR decreasing to 6.0% (95% CI, 1.7-14.6%) in initially cN1 patients. During a median follow-up of 36.6 months, 3 nodal recurrences occurred (3/237 with ALND; 0/85 with TAD alone), with a 3-year freedom-from-nodal-recurrence rate of 100.0% among the TAD-only patients and 98.7% among the ALND patients with axillary pathologic complete response (P=0.29). Conclusions:TAD is feasible in initially cN1 breast cancer patients with biopsy-confirmed nodal metastases. ALND can safely be foregone in patients with negativity or a low volume of nodal positivity on TAD, with a low nodal failure rate and no compromise of 3-year recurrence-free survival.

TI  - Channel Activity Remote Sensing Retrieval Model: A Case Study of the Lower Yellow River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Meandering channel migration is a widespread phenomenon in rivers all around the world. Channel activity, which reflects the rate of change of a meandering channel, is calculated by averaging lateral channel migration. Channel migration can create new channels and abandon old ones, with effects on the natural environment. Floods can even lead to excessive rates of channel migration, which can threaten cities or farmland. Remote sensing can detect the spatial and temporal dynamic characteristics of the river channel, taking into account both spatial and temporal resolution, and can help in planning for the safety of the river channel in advance. Previous studies on river channels have suffered from a low accuracy of data, low level of automation, and subjectivity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a channel activity remote sensing retrieval model (CARSM) in this paper. CARSM extracts water using the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) combined with Otsu's method on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, then extracts the channel centerlines via water mask maps using RivWidthCloud, and finally calculates channel activity based on the geometric relationship of the channel centerlines. With more objective extraction results, CARSM can guarantee more than 95% accuracy of channel activity and its high degree of automation can save a lot of labor costs. We use Landsat images to monitor the channel of the Lower Yellow River and calculate the overall and segmental channel activity separately. Our results show that the overall channel activity of the Lower Yellow River has gradually decreased between 1990 and 2020, with decreases of 33.04% and 41.06%, respectively. Analysis of channel activity reveals that the water sediment pattern of the Lower Yellow River changed from siltation to scouring after the completion of Xiaolangdi Reservoir, and the Lower Yellow River is gradually becoming stable.

TI  - Implementing and Improving CBMZ-MAM3 Chemistry and Aerosol Modules in the Regional Climate Model WRF-CAM5: An Evaluation over the Western US and Eastern North Pacific
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The representation of aerosols in climate-chemistry models is important for air quality and climate change research, but it can require significant computational resources. The objective of this study was to improve the representation of aerosols in climate-chemistry models, specifically in the carbon bond mechanism, version Z (CBMZ), and modal aerosol modules with three lognormal modes (MAM3) in the WRF-CAM5 model. The study aimed to enhance the model's chemistry capabilities by incorporating biomass burning emissions, establishing a conversion mechanism between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and secondary organic carbons (SOCs), and evaluating its performance against observational benchmarks. The results of the study demonstrated the effectiveness of the enhanced chemistry capabilities in the WRF-CAM5 model. Six simulations were conducted over the western U.S. and northeastern Pacific region, comparing the model's performance with observational benchmarks such as reanalysis, ground-based, and satellite data. The findings revealed a significant reduction in root-mean-square errors (RMSE) for surface concentrations of black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC). Specifically, the model exhibited a 31% reduction in RMSE for BC concentrations and a 58% reduction in RMSE for OC concentrations. These outcomes underscored the importance of accurate aerosol representation in climate-chemistry models and emphasized the potential for improving simulation accuracy and reducing errors through the incorporation of enhanced chemistry modules in such models.

TI  - LAGRS-Veg: a spaceborne vegetation simulator for full polarization GNSS-reflectometry
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - During the past three decades, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) has become a promising remote sensing technique. In developing GNSS-R, several spaceborne missions have been launched, e.g., the UK's TDS-1, NASA's CYGNSS, and China's BuFeng-1A/B and FY-3E GNOS-R satellites.The application of GNSS-R to vegetation monitoring has attracted attention because GNSS-R signals have less saturation effect than those of a traditional monostatic radar. However, most previous related work has concentrated on the analysis of experimental data, with little attention given to the physical models or polarization. We present a spaceborne vegetation simulator for full polarization GNSS-R, i.e., the LAGRS-Veg (Land surface GNSS-R simulator-Vegetation) model. This model is based on the vegetation radiative transfer equation model and integrated with the GNSS scattering model. Thus, it provides a comprehensive end-to-end simulator for spaceborne GNSS-R study of vegetation. Using this simulator, the impact of vegetation water content, biomass, soil moisture, and surface roughness on delay Doppler map measurements can be thoroughly analyzed because they are all based on physical scattering mechanisms. The effects of observation geometry and different polarizations can all be included and analyzed using LAGRS-Veg. The presented work will benefit spaceborne data simulation, vegetation parameter retrievals, and future spaceborne sensor design.

TI  - Band-Optimized Bidirectional LSTM Deep Learning Model for Bathymetry Inversion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow water bathymetry is of great significance in understanding, managing, and protecting coastal ecological environments. Many studies have shown that both empirical models and deep learning models can achieve promising results from satellite imagery bathymetry inversion. However, the spectral information available today in multispectral or/and hyperspectral satellite images has not been explored thoroughly in many models. The Band-optimized Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BoBiLSTM) model proposed in this paper feeds only the optimized bands and band ratios to the deep learning model, and a series of experiments were conducted in the shallow waters of Molokai Island, Hawaii, using hyperspectral satellite imagery (PRISMA) and multispectral satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) with ICESat-2 data and multibeam scan data as training data, respectively. The experimental results of the BoBiLSTM model demonstrate its robustness over other compared models. For example, using PRISMA data as the source image, the BoBiLSTM model achieves RMSE values of 0.82 m (using ICESat-2 as the training data) and 1.43 m (using multibeam as the training data), respectively, and because of using the bidirectional strategy, the inverted bathymetry reaches as far as a depth of 25 m. More importantly, the BoBiLSTM model does not overfit the data in general, which is one of its advantages over many other deep learning models. Unlike other deep learning models, which require a large amount of training data and all available bands as the inputs, the BoBiLSTM model can perform very well using equivalently less training data and a handful of bands and band ratios. With ICESat-2 data becoming commonly available and covering many shallow water regions around the world, the proposed BoBiLSTM model holds potential for bathymetry inversion for any region around the world where satellite images and ICESat-2 data are available.

TI  - The land finance and eco-product value nexus: Evidence from fiscal decentralization in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to shed new light on the land finance and eco-product value nexus from the perspective of fiscal decentralization, using data collected from 276 Chinese prefectures between 2005 and 2020. We employed a two-way fixed effects model to explore land finance, fiscal decentralization, and the eco-product value nexus. Our findings revealed that land finance has a noticeable disincentive influence on eco-product value. The impact of land finance on the ecological value of wetlands is much higher than on that of other land types. Additionally, fiscal expenditure decentralization plays a negative regulatory role between land finance and eco-product value. This effect is further strengthened with an increase in the fiscal decentralization level. Our findings suggest that standardizing local government land-granting behavior and making land finance more ecologically friendly through policy implementation will effectively contribute to the sustainable development of China.

TI  - Combined PS-InSAR Technology and High-Resolution Optical Remote Sensing for Identifying Illegal Underground Mining in the Suburb of Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Illegal mining is one of the biggest problems in many coal mines. With the rapid development of the economy, driven by huge economic benefits, some outlaws illegally exploit mineral resources without a mining license, which is destructive and a potential safety hazard. In order to avoid inspection by law enforcement officials, some outlaws, regardless of the cost or risk, privately and surreptitiously excavate coal mines in self-built houses. The coal resources they excavate are shallow coal resources. Because surface buildings can maintain strong and stable radar scattering characteristics over a long time series, in this study, we combined PS-InSAR technology and high-resolution optical remote sensing to extract the subsidence information of surface buildings corresponding to PS point sets and analyzed their spatiotemporal characteristics. Finally, we developed a fast and accurate method for detecting suspected illegal mining sites from building subsidence information over a larger area. We also carried out a case study using Shandi Village, a suburb of Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, China, as our research object. QuickBird-2, WorldView-2 data, and 20 PALSAR scenes were selected for the experimental research, and two illegal mining sites were detected from 29 December 2006 to 9 January 2011. By comparing our results with previous investigation data, it was found that the accuracy rate reached 40% in local areas, and the detection rate reached 66.67%. In addition, the mining periods were basically consistent. This research shows that our method is feasible and has certain engineering applicability and practical value.

TI  - The Antarctic Amplification Based on MODIS Land Surface Temperature and ERA5
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With global warming accelerating, polar amplification is one of the hot issues in climate research. However, most studies focus on Arctic amplification, and little attention has been paid to Antarctic amplification (AnA), and there is no relevant research based on MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) land surface temperature observations. Compared with 128 stations' observations, MODIS can capture the variations in temperature over Antarctica. In addition, the temperature changes in Antarctica, East Antarctica, West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula during the period 2001-2018 reflected by the MODIS and ERA5 are basically consistent, and the temperature changes in Antarctica are negatively correlated with the Southern Annular Mode. AnA occurs under all annual and seasonal scales, with an AnA index greater than 1.27 (1.31) from the MODIS (ERA5), and is strongest in the austral winter and weakest in summer. AnA displays regional differences, and the signal from the MODIS is similar to that from ERA5. The strongest amplification occurs in East Antarctica, with an AnA index greater than 1.45 (1.48) from the MODIS (ERA5), followed by West Antarctica, whereas the amplified signal is absent at the Antarctic Peninsula. In addition, seasonal differences can be observed in the sub regions of Antarctica. For West Antarctica, the greatest amplification appears in austral winter, and in austral spring for East Antarctica. The AnA signal also can be captured in daytime and nighttime observations, and the AnA in nighttime observations is stronger than that in daytime. Generally, the MODIS illustrates the appearance of AnA for the period 2001-2018, and the Antarctic climate undergoes drastic changes, and the potential impact should arouse attention.

TI  - Aboveground Biomass Prediction of Arid Shrub-Dominated Community Based on Airborne LiDAR through Parametric and Nonparametric Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) of shrub communities in the desert is a basic quantitative characteristic of the desert ecosystem and an important index to measure ecosystem productivity and monitor desertification. An accurate and efficient method of predicting the AGB of a shrub community is essential for studying the spatial patterns and ecological functions of the desert region. Even though there are several entries in the literature on the AGB prediction of desert shrub communities using remote sensing data, the applicability and accuracy of airborne LiDAR data and prediction methods have not been well studied. We first extracted the elevation, density and intensity variables based on the airborne LiDAR, and then sample plot-level AGB prediction models were constructed using the parametric regression (nonlinear regression) and nonparametric methods (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Gradient Boosting Machine, and Multivariate adaptive regression splines). We evaluated accuracies of all the AGB prediction models we developed based on the fit statistics. Results showed that: (1) the elevation, density and intensity variables obtained from LiDAR point cloud data effectively predicted the AGB of the desert shrub community at a sample plot level, (2) the kappa coefficient of nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) model obtained was 0.6977 with an improvement by 13% due to the random effects included into the model, and (3) the nonparametric model, such as Support Vector Machine showed the best fit statistics (R-2 = 0.8992), which is 28% higher than the NLME-model, and effectively reduced the heteroscedasticity. The AGB prediction model presented in this paper, which is based on the airborne LiDAR data and machine learning algorithm, will provide a valuable tool to the managers and researchers for evaluating desert ecosystem productivity and monitoring desertification.

TI  - Water-Body Detection in Sentinel-1 SAR Images with DK-CO Network
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active microwave sensor with all-day/night and all-weather detection capability, which is crucial for detecting surface water resources. Surface water-body such as rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and ponds usually appear as dark areas in SAR images. Accurate and automated extraction of these water bodies can provide valuable data for the management and strategic planning of surface water resources and effectively help prevent and control drought and flood disasters. However, most deep learning-based methods rely on manually labeled samples for model training and testing, which is inefficient and may introduce errors. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel water-body detection method that combines optimization algorithms and deep learning techniques to automate water-body label extraction and improve the accuracy of water-body detection. First, this paper uses a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm, Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO), to optimize the initial cluster center of the K-means clustering algorithm, which is called the DBO-K-means (DK) method. The DK method divides the training images into four categories and extracts the water bodies in them to generate the water-body labels required for deep learning model training and testing, and the whole process does not require human intervention. Then, the labels generated by DK and training data set images are fed into the Classifier-Optimizer (CO) for training. The classifier performs a dense classification task at the pixel level, resulting in an initial result image with blurred boundaries of the water body. Then, the optimizer takes this preliminary result image and the original SAR image as input, performs fine-grained optimization on the preliminary result, and finally generates a result image with a clear water-body boundary. Finally, we evaluated the accuracy of water-body detection using multiple performance indicators including ACC, precision, F1-Score, recall, and Kappa coefficient. The results show that the values of all indicators exceed 93%, which demonstrates the high accuracy and reliability of our proposed water-body detection method. Overall, this paper presents a novel DK-based approach that improves the automation and accuracy of deep learning methods for detecting water bodies in SAR images by enabling automatic sample extraction and optimization of deep learning models.

TI  - Deformation Evaluation of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) Central Route over Handan in Hebei, China, Based on Sentinel-1A, Radarsat-2, and TerraSAR-X Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) is a megaproject which has been constructed to alleviate imbalanced water resource distribution between northern and southern China. It encompasses three routes distributed in the east, central, and west of China, respectively. The central route (CR) of the SNWDP starts from the Danjiangkou Reservoir and ends in Beijing and Tianjin, running through Hubei, Henan, and Hebei Provinces; it has been in service since December 2014. For this type of megaproject, efficient and effective safety monitoring during its operation is highly challenging to the management department. Multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) has been widely applied in monitoring land deformation, especially in a wide area. However, its ability to show the deformation of one specific facility along the SNWD has not been deeply investigated. This study investigates the capability of MT-InSAR in monitoring the deformation of the canal and ancillary facilities along the SNWD-CR over Handan, Hebei Province, in China, using Sentinel-1, Radarsat-2, and TerraSAR-X datasets. Deformation rates from March 2015 to March 2016 are obtained by applying permanent scatterers (PS)-InSAR to these three SAR datasets. After combining the deformation rates derived by the three datasets, deformation along the SNWDP-CR is evaluated using a method encompassing median absolute deviation (MAD) calculation and heatmap. The evaluation result reveals that one part of the western embankment of the open canal is subsiding at up to 10 mm/year, which may be associated with overirrigation. Besides this location, the most dangerous areas assessed by the proposed method are related to ancillary facilities, mainly aqueducts and crossing-canal bridges.

TI  - Aqua MODIS: 20 years of on-orbit calibration and performance
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its launch in May, 2002, Aqua MODIS has successfully operated for more than 20 years and has continuously generated a wide range of data products that have enabled and supported the remote sensing community and users worldwide for their studies of the Earth's system by monitoring changes in its key environmental parameters. Although Aqua MODIS, designed with a lifetime requirement of 6 years, is currently operated in its extended mission phase, it continues to make high quality global observations of the Earth's surface via its 36 spectral bands that cover wavelengths from visible to long-wave infrared. To date, all instrument on-board calibrators (OBC) remain capable of performing their design functions, providing various calibration data sets to help monitor on-orbit changes in sensor responses and performance characteristics. In addition to the OBC, regularly scheduled lunar observations and select Earth-view targets are used extensively to support sensor on-orbit calibration, especially for the calibration of the visible channels (or bands). We provide an overview of Aqua MODIS on-orbit calibration activities and methodologies for both reflective solar bands and thermal emissive bands, illustrate its on-orbit performance over the past 20 years using examples derived from OBC measurements, lunar observations, and Earth-view response trends, and describe various calibration improvements made over its entire mission. We focus on key issues identified since launch, such as solar diffuser degradation, electronic crosstalk, and on-orbit changes in sensor response versus scan-angle, along with approaches and strategies developed to mitigate their impact on sensor calibration quality. Also discussed in this paper are some of the key calibration enhancements incorporated recently in the Collection 6.1 and the upcoming Collection 7 Level-1B algorithms.

TI  - NPP and Vegetation Carbon Sink Capacity Estimation of Urban Green Space Using the Optimized CASA Model: A Case Study of Five Chinese Cities
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban area is a major source of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Urban green space (UGS) is an essential element to increase carbon sequestration directly and reduce emission indirectly. In this study, the net primary production (NPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was monitored in order to enhance the carbon sequestration function of UGS and promote urban low-carbon development. Based on the Sentinel-2 L2A satellite images, meteorological data, and vegetation type data in 2019, we used the optimized Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model to estimate the NPP values of UGS types including attached green space, park green space, protective green space, and regional space in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Xi'an. The NEP values were evaluated based on NPP and soil heterotrophic respiration (R-H) to quantify the vegetation carbon sink capacity. The accuracy test shows that the estimated NPP values based on the optimized CASA model are effective. The results indicate that the average NPP values (1008.5 gC & BULL;m(-2)& BULL;a(-1)) and vegetation carbon sink capacity (771.49 gC & BULL;m(-2)& BULL;a(-1)) of UGS in Beijing rank first among the cities, which is followed by the values in Guangzhou. The regional green space and park green space in five cities function as carbon sinks with high NPP values and have vegetation carbon sink capacity, whereas the attached green space in Shanghai and Xi'an as well as the protective green space in Guangzhou and Xi'an function as carbon sources. Moreover, the NEP distribution shows obvious spatial aggregation characteristics, that is, the high NEP values of UGS are clustered in mountainous forest areas in the west and north of Beijing, Northeast Guangzhou, and South Xi'an whereas the low NEP values are mostly concentrated in the urban built-up areas under strong influences of human activities. This research provides a new method for NPP and NEP estimation of UGS at the city scale and the scientific basis for the improvement of the vegetation carbon sink capacity of UGS.

TI  - Automatic Extraction of the Spatial Distribution of <i>Picea schrenkiana</i> in the Tianshan Mountains Based on Google Earth Engine and the Jeffries-Matusita Distance
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - As a distinct species in the Tianshan Mountains (TS) of Central Asia (CA), Picea schrenkiana plays a significant role in water purification, soil and water conservation, and climate regulation. In the context of climate change, rapidly and accurately obtaining its spatial distribution has critical decision-making significance for maintaining ecological security in the arid area of CA and the sustainable development of the "Silk Road Economic Belt". However, conventional methods are extremely challenging to accomplish the high-resolution mapping of Picea schrenkiana in the TS, which is characterized by a wide range (9.97 x 10(5) km(2)) and complex terrain. The approach of geo-big data and cloud computing provides new opportunities to address this issue. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to propose an automatic extraction procedure for the spatial distribution of Picea schrenkiana based on Google Earth Engine and the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance, which considered three aspects: sample points, remote-sensing images, and classification features. The results showed that (1) after removing abnormal samples and selecting the summer image, the producer accuracy (PA) of Picea schrenkiana was improved by 2.95% and 0.24%-2.10%, respectively. (2) Both the separation obtained by the JM distance and the analysis results of eight schemes showed that spectral features and texture features played a key role in the mapping of Picea schrenkiana. (3) The JM distance can seize the classification features that are most conducive to the mapping of Picea schrenkiana, and effectively improve the classification accuracy. The PA and user accuracy of Picea schrenkiana were 96.74% and 96.96%, respectively. The overall accuracy was 91.93%, while the Kappa coefficient was 0.89. (4) The results show that Picea schrenkiana is concentrated in the middle TS and scattered in the remaining areas. In total, 85.7%, 66.4%, and 85.9% of Picea schrenkiana were distributed in the range of 1500-2700 m, 20-40 & DEG;, and on shady slope and semi-shady slope, respectively. The automatic procedure adopted in this study provides a basis for the rapid and accurate mapping of the spatial distribution of coniferous forests in the complex terrain.

TI  - Remote Sensing Study on the Coupling Relationship between Regional Ecological Environment and Human Activities: A Case Study of Qilian Mountain National Nature Reserve
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing human-environment coupling is important in understanding the mechanisms and developments of human-environment systems. However, the current frameworks and approaches evaluating the relationship between human activities and the ecological environment remain limited. Integrating the vegetation-impervious surface-soil-air framework, Mann-Kendall test, correlation analysis, two-step floating catchment area method, coupling analysis, and optimal parameters-based geographical detector, this study comprehensively evaluate the environmental changes and analyzes the coupling relationship between environment and human activities, mainly in terms of habitat quality, landscape pattern, and ecological services. The study area was the Qilian Mountain National Nature Reserve in Gansu province, China, an ecologically fragile region with an environment closely linked to human activities. Along with district and county census data, various remote-sensing products (e.g., MODIS, Landsat) were used to assess the ecological level and human-environment coupling state of the study site from 2003 to 2019. The main results show: (1) The remote sensing composite index, which integrates eight ecological sub-indices, effectively captures the spatial and temporal variations of the ecological environment in the study area, providing comprehensive and detailed environmental information. (2) Analysis using the Mann-Kendall-correlation classification, coupling degree, and two-step floating catchment area methods consistently demonstrates a gradual coordination between human activities and the ecological environment in the study area. (3) In comparison to spatially interpolated population data, the remote sensing human activity index more significantly represents the spatial impact of human activities on the ecological environment. (4) The environmental aspects most strongly associated with human activities include carbon fixation and oxygen release, vegetation, humidity, and soil. (5) The ecological environment level does not uniformly deteriorate with increasing population density, and a notable alignment is observed between changes in the ecological environment and the implementation of government environmental protection policies.

However, limited research has evaluated green space demand specifically in terms of carbon storage and carbon emissions. This study introduces a novel methodological framework that aligns ecosystem service functions with both supply and demand, considering carbon storage and carbon emissions as crucial perspectives. The goal was to develop a comprehensive approach to assess the matching between the supply and demand of green spaces based on their carbon-related ecosystem services. The following research questions were developed to guide this study: (1) What are the spatial and temporal characteristics of carbon storage? (2) What are the spatiotemporal variations in carbon emissions on a city scale? (3) How does a city obtain the demand priority evaluation of green spaces in terms of carbon neutrality? Using Guangzhou as a case study, we employed the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs (InVEST) model to measure the spatial and temporal patterns of carbon storage. Remote sensing data were utilized, along with emission factors, to analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of carbon emissions. The line of best fit method was employed to predict future carbon storage and carbon emissions, as well as population density and average land GDP. Based on these predictions, we prioritized the demand for green spaces. The results indicate the future demand priority order for green spaces in different districts. We suggest that this green space demand evaluation model can serve as a reference for future policy making and be applied to other cities worldwide.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Variation and Multi-dimensional Detection of Driving Mechanism of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentration in the Chengdu-Chongqing Urban Agglomeration from 2000 to 2021
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on the spatio-temporal variation and driving mechanism of PM2.5 concentration in the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration are of great significance for regional atmospheric environment protection and national economic sustainable development. Based on PM2.5 remote sensing data, DEM data, in situ meteorological data, MODIS NDVI data, population density data, nighttime lighting data, road network data, and land use type data, a series of mathematical methods such as Theil-Sen Medium analysis and Mann-Kendall significance test, combined with the Geo-detector model were used to analyze the spatio-temporal variation and multi-dimensional detection of the driving mechanism of PM2.5 concentration in the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. The results showed that the overall PM2.5 concentration showed a fluctuating downward trend in the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration from 2000 to 2021, and the PM2.5 pollution was the most prominent in winter. PM2.5 concentration exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity with "high in the middle and low in the surrounding areas." The high-PM2.5 concentration areas were mainly concentrated in Zigong, Neijiang, Ziyang, and Guang'an, and the areas with a PM2.5 concentration decrease were mainly concentrated in the west of Chongqing. Influencing detection results showed that the spatial heterogeneity of PM2.5 concentration in the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration was influenced by the combined effects of climate factors, topographic factors, vegetation cover, and anthropogenic factors. Furthermore, elevation, slope, and road network density were regarded as the dominant factors influencing the spatial heterogeneity of PM2.5 concentration in the study area. Topographic factors and climate factors showed the highest and lowest contribution rate to the spatial heterogeneity of PM2.5 concentration, respectively. The contribution rate of topographic factors and anthropogenic factors had gradually increased, and the contribution rate of climate factors and vegetation cover had gradually decreased in the study area from 2000 to 2021. Interaction detection results showed that the spatial heterogeneity of PM2.5 concentration in the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration was mostly affected by the interaction effects of elevation and road network density, slope, precipitation, sunshine duration, and land use type. The interaction detection results exhibited obvious regional differences on the city level. For instance, the spatial heterogeneity of PM2.5 concentration in Chengdu, Deyang, and Leshan was mostly affected by the interaction between different influencing types, and the spatial heterogeneity of PM2.5 concentration in Dazhou, Meishan, Ya'an, Ziyang, Neijiang, and Zigong was mostly affected by the interaction within a single influencing type.

TI  - Morphological adjustments of the Yamuna River in the Himalayan foothills in response to natural and anthropogenic stresses
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers can adjust to natural and anthropogenic stresses through changes in flow regime and sediment dynamics. Flow regulation due to dam construction can modify sediment transport processes, causing morphological adjustments and changes in conveyance capacity. In this study, we explored morphological adjustments along a 46 km segment of the Yamuna River in the Himalayan foothills from Dakpathar Barrage to Hathni Kund Barrage using a combination of remote sensing approaches. The cloud computing platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used to analyse multi-temporal collections of Landsat satellite imagery acquired between 1989 and 2021. Active river channels (including water and exposed sediment) were classified using an MNDWI and NDVI thresholding approach from annually resolved temporal composite images. Declassified CORONA satellite imagery (acquired in 1965, 1973 and 1976) was manually digitized to provide longer-term insights into channel change. Morphological adjustments were assessed using the RivMAP toolbox, providing quantitative information on the rates of bank erosion and accretion, bank line shifts and changes in active channel width. Results showed a substantial narrowing of the active channel after 2013, which coincided with the construction of the Lakhwar-Vyasi Dam. We calculated a 67% reduction in mean active channel width, narrowing from similar to 800 m in 1989 to similar to 250 m in 2021. During the same period, evidence of sand mining in the active channel indicates a substantial increase in mining activities after 2015. The concept of stasis was explored under different flow regulation scenarios to suggest that the river has undergone a state of inactivity, where the river is doing nothing for much longer durations. We suggest that the combined effects of flow regulation and increased mining activities during the same period have altered river morphology, and further stresses due to a combination of human activities can be damaging for the river regime. This study sheds light on the potential implications of multiple stresses acting on the Yamuna River at the same time, which can inform future sustainable river management activities.

TI  - Does Narcissism Influence Entrepreneurial Intentions? A Theory of Planned Behaviour Perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research on entrepreneurship has established that individuals with certain personality traits are more likely to take up entrepreneurial careers as compared to others. However, it is still unclear whether and how the dark side of individuals' personality impacts entrepreneurial career intentions. Accordingly, this study, building on the theory of planned behaviour, seeks to explore the mechanisms through which narcissism-a dark personality trait-impacts entrepreneurial intention. The authors contend that narcissism shapes the individual's attitude and worldview of the prevailing subjective norms, which collectively translate into evaluating entrepreneurship as a favourable career choice. This study empirically validates the hypotheses using a sample of 220 postgraduate students in an Indian business school. The findings offer crucial implications for individuals trying to make career choices; and demonstrate that it would be helpful for individuals to explore the dark side of their personality before arriving at an appropriate career choice.

TI  - Snow Cover and Climate Change and Their Coupling Effects on Runoff in the Keriya River Basin during 2001-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a significant component of the cryosphere, snow cover plays a crucial role in modulating atmospheric circulation and regional hydrological equilibrium. Therefore, studying the dynamics of snow cover and its response to climate change is of great significance for regional water resource management and disaster prevention. In this study, reanalysis climate datasets and a new MODIS snow cover extent product over China were used to analyze the characteristics of climate change and spatiotemporal variations in snow cover in the Keriya River Basin (KRB). Furthermore, the effects of climate factors on snow cover and their coupling effects on runoff were quantitatively evaluated by adopting partial least squares regression (PLSR) method and structural equation modeling (SEM), respectively. Our findings demonstrated the following: (1) Air temperature and precipitation of KRB showed a significant increase at rates of 0.24 & DEG;C/decade and 14.21 mm/decade, respectively, while the wind speed did not change significantly. (2) The snow cover frequency (SCF) in the KRB presented the distribution characteristics of "low in the north and high in the south". The intra-annual variation of snow cover percentage (SCP) of KRB displayed a single peak (in winter), double peaks (in spring and autumn), and stability (SCP > 75%), whose boundary elevations were 4000 m and 6000 m, respectively. The annual, summer, and winter SCP in the KRB declined, while the spring and autumn SCP experienced a trend showing an insignificant increase during the hydrological years of 2001-2020. Additionally, both the annual and seasonal SCF (except autumn) will be further increased in more than 50% of the KRB, according to estimates. (3) Annual and winter SCF were controlled by precipitation, of which the former showed a mainly negative response, while the latter showed a mainly positive response, accounting for 43.1% and 76.16% of the KRB, respectively. Air temperature controlled SCF changes in 45% of regions in spring, summer, and autumn, mainly showing negative effects. Wind speed contributed to SCF changes in the range of 11.23% to 26.54% across annual and seasonal scales. (4) Climate factors and snow cover mainly affect annual runoff through direct influences, and the total effect was as follows: precipitation (0.609) > air temperature (-0.122) > SCP (0.09).

TI  - Analysis of Growing Season Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Variation and Its Influencing Factors on the Mongolian Plateau Based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent dust storms on the Mongolian Plateau have adversely affected the ecological environmental quality of East Asia. Studying the dynamic changes in vegetation coverage is one of the important means of evaluating ecological environmental quality in the region. In this study, we used Landsat remote sensing images from 2000 to 2019 on the Mongolian Plateau to extract yearly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data during the growing season. We used partial correlation analysis and the Hurst index to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of the NDVI before and after the establishment of nature reserves and their influencing factors on the GEE cloud platform. The results showed that (1) the proportion of the region with an upwards trend of NDVI increased from 52.21% during 2000-2009 to 67.93% during 2010-2019, indicating a clear improvement in vegetation due to increased precipitation; (2) the increase in precipitation and positive human activities drove the increase in the NDVI in the study region from 2000 to 2019; and (3) the overall trend of the NDVI in the future is expected to be stable with a slight decrease, and restoration potential is greater for water bodies and grasslands. Therefore, it is imperative to strengthen positive human activities to safeguard vegetation. These findings furnish scientific evidence for environmental management and the development of ecological engineering initiatives on the Mongolian Plateau.

TI  - An Illustration of FY-3E GNOS-R for Global Soil Moisture Monitoring
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - An effective soil moisture retrieval method for FY-3E (Fengyun-3E) GNOS-R (GNSS occultation sounder II-reflectometry) is developed in this paper. Here, the LAGRS model, which is totally oriented for GNOS-R, is employed to estimate vegetation and surface roughness effects on surface reflectivity. Since the LAGRS (land surface GNSS reflection simulator) model is a space-borne GNSS-R (GNSS reflectometry) simulator based on the microwave radiative transfer equation model, the method presented in this paper takes more consideration on the physical scattering properties for retrieval. Ancillary information from SMAP (soil moisture active passive) such as the vegetation water content and the roughness coefficient are investigated for the final algorithm's development. At first, the SR (surface reflectivity) data calculated from GNOS-R is calculated and then calibrated, and then the vegetation roughness factor is achieved and used to eliminate the effects on both factors. After receiving the Fresnel reflectivity, the corresponding soil moisture estimated from this method is retrieved. The results demonstrate good consistency between soil moisture derived from GNOS-R data and SMAP soil moisture, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9599 and a root mean square error of 0.0483 cm(3)/cm(3). This method succeeds in providing soil moisture on a global scale and is based on the previously developed physical LAGRS model. In this way, the great potential of GNOS-R for soil moisture estimation is presented.

TI  - Sea Surface Chlorophyll-a Concentration Retrieval from HY-1C Satellite Data Based on Residual Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A residual network (ResNet) model was proposed for estimating Chl-a concentrations in global oceans from the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) observed by the Chinese ocean color and temperature scanner (COCTS) onboard the HY-1C satellite. A total of 52 images from September 2018 to September 2019 were collected, and the label data were from the multi-task Ocean Color-Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) daily products. The results of feature selection and sensitivity experiments show that the logarithmic values of R(rs)565 and R(rs)520/Rrs443, R(rs)565/R(rs)490, R(rs)520/R(rs)490, R(rs)490/R(rs)443, and R(rs)670/R(rs)565 are the optimal input parameters for the model. Compared with the classical empirical OC4 algorithm and other machine learning models, including the artificial neural network (ANN), deep neural network (DNN), and random forest (RF), the ResNet retrievals are in better agreement with the OC-CCI Chl-a products. The root-mean-square error (RMSE), unbiased percentage difference (UPD), and correlation coefficient (logarithmic, R(log)) are 0.13 mg/m(3), 17.31%, and 0.97, respectively. The performance of the ResNet model was also evaluated against in situ measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) and field survey observations in the East and South China Seas. Compared with DNN, ANN, RF, and OC4 models, the UPD is reduced by 5.9%, 0.7%, 6.8%, and 6.3%, respectively.

TI  - Characteristics and Driving Mechanism of Urban Construction Land Expansion along with Rapid Urbanization and Carbon Neutrality in Beijing, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Escalating urban issues in Beijing call for comprehensive exploration of urban construction land expansion towards the goal of carbon neutrality. Firstly, urban construction land in Beijing during the period 2005-2020 was accurately detected using Landsat images and impervious surface data, and then its expansion characteristics were revealed. Finally, the driving mechanism of urban construction land expansion was explored using geographically and temporally weighted regression from the input-output perspective. The results showed that the expansion speed and intensity of urban construction land in Beijing showed an overall tendency to slow down, and the center of urban expansion shifted to the new urban development zone and ecological function conservation zone. Urban construction land expansion in the central urban area was first scattered and then compact, while that in the new urban development zone and ecological function conservation zone primarily followed an outward pattern. The permanent population, per capita GDP, and per capita retail sales of social consumer goods were the primary driving factors of urban construction land expansion in Beijing, the impacts of which varied significantly among different districts of Beijing. All these results can provide a solid foundation for improving land use policies towards the goal of carbon neutrality in highly urbanized areas.

TI  - Population genetic structure of<i> Dermatophagoides</i><i> farinae</i> (Acari: Pyroglyphidae) from different geographic populations based on mitochondrial cytochrome b gene
T2  - SYSTEMATIC AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dermatophagoides farinae (Acari: Pyroglyphidae) has been regarded as an important source of indoor allergens due to its prevalence and close proximity to humans. This study serves as an introductory probe into the population genetic structure of D. farinae, for which a few related studies of population genetic structure are available. In this study, the genetic structure of seven D. farinae populations in China was investigated based on the 372 bp mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene. A total of 29 haplotypes of the 68 cytb gene sequences were detected. The network diagram could be divided into Branch I (regions north of the Yangtze River: SJZ, CZ, FY and HN) and Branch II (regions south of the Yangtze River: AQ, WX and WH). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) conducted according to the results of the network diagram revealed major genetic differentiation among groups, indicating that a significant genetic structure existed among groups. The results of population genetic structure could be largely attributed to geographical isolation. The existence of gene flow in a few populations may be influenced by grain trade activities. This study may facilitate a better understanding of the population genetic structure of D. farinae and could be utilized as the foundation for the development of efficient management strategies for D. farinae.

TI  - Corn Phenology Detection Using the Derivative Dynamic Time Warping Method and Sentinel-2 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate determination of crop phenology information is essential for effective field management and decision-making processes. Remote sensing time series analyses are widely employed to extract the phenological stages. Each crop's phenological stage has its unique characteristic on the crop plant, while the satellite-derived crop phenology refers to some key transition dates in time series satellite observations. Current techniques primarily estimate specific phenological stages by detecting points with distinctive features on the remote sensing time series curve. But these stages may be different from the Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt and CHemical Industry (BBCH) scale, which is commonly used to identify the phenological development stages of crops. Moreover, when aiming to extract various phenological stages concurrently, it becomes necessary to adjust the extraction strategy for each unique feature. This need for distinct strategies at each stage heightens the complexity of simultaneous extraction. In this study, we utilize the Sentinel-2 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data and propose a phenology extraction framework based on the Derivative Dynamic Time Warping (DDTW) algorithm. This method is capable of simultaneously extracting complete phenological stages, and the results demonstrate that the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs, days) of detected phenology on the BBCH scale for corn were less than 6 days overall.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Estimation from Landsat-9 Thermal Infrared Data Using Ensemble Learning Method Considering the Physical Radiance Transfer Process
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating land surface temperature (LST) is a critical concern in thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing. According to the thermal radiance transfer equation, the observed data in each channel are coupled with both emissivity and atmospheric parameters in addition to the LST. To solve this ill-posed problem, classical algorithms often require the input of external parameters such as land surface emissivity and atmospheric profiles, which are often difficult to obtain accurately and timely, and this may introduce additional errors and limit the applicability of the LST retrieval algorithms. To reduce the dependence on external parameters, this paper proposes a new algorithm to directly estimate the LST from the top-of-atmosphere brightness temperature in Landsat-9 two-channel TIR data (channels 10 and 11) without external parameters. The proposed algorithm takes full advantage of the adeptness of the ensemble learning method to solve nonlinear problems. It considers the physical radiance transfer process and adds the leaving-ground bright temperature and atmospheric water vapor index to the input feature set. The experimental results show that the new algorithm achieves accurate LST estimation results compared with the ground-measured LST and is consistent with the Landsat-9 LST product. In subsequent work, further studies will be undertaken on developing end-to-end deep learning models, mining more in-depth features between TIR channels, and reducing the effect of spatial heterogeneity on accuracy validation.

TI  - Comparative analysis of deep learning-based pansharpening methods for improved image classification accuracy
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpened images are frequently utilized as base data in image classification applications. Nonetheless, the accuracy of image classification heavily relies on the efficiency of the pansharpening strategy applied. With numerous existing pansharpening approaches available, it becomes challenging for analysts to select the one that yields the best outcome. Recently, the deep learning (DL)-based pansharpening approaches have become popular due to their capabilities. Thus, this study aims at examining the image classification performance of pansharpened images generated by several commonly used DL-based pansharpening algorithms that rely on pre-trained models and comparing them with those of several traditional pansharpening algorithms. The experiments that were conducted in two test sites indicated that the DL-based pansharpening algorithms could be used in various circumstances. It can also be inferred that the DL-based pansharpening algorithms enhanced the image classification accuracy more effectively than many other traditional algorithms. The use of pre-trained models led to robust pansharpening results and, therefore, superior classification accuracies in most cases.

TI  - Improving the Accuracy of Flood Susceptibility Prediction by Combining Machine Learning Models and the Expanded Flood Inventory Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sufficient historical flood inventory data (FID) are crucial for accurately predicting flood susceptibility using supervised machine learning models. However, historical FID are insufficient in many regions. Remote sensing provides a promising opportunity to expand the FID. However, whether the FID expanded by remote sensing can improve the accuracy of flood susceptibility modeling needs further study. In this study, a framework was proposed for improving the accuracy of flood susceptibility prediction (FSP) by combining machine learning models and the expanded FID using Sentinel-1A radar images. Five widely used machine learning models were employed to verify the accuracy of the proposed method by taking Wuhan City as a case study, including the random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Sentinel-1A images from time points before, during, and after flood events were used to expand the FID for training the machine learning models. The results showed that the performance of the machine learning models for predicting flood susceptibility was improved greatly by considering the expanded FID, being improved by approximately 1.14-19.74% based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Among the used machine learning models, taking into account all the statistical indicators, the ANN showed the best performance, while the SVM showed the best generalization performance in Wuhan City. According to the results of the ANN model, approximately 19% of the area in Wuhan City, mainly distributed near rivers and lakes, is at a high flood susceptibility level. This study provides an essential reference for flood susceptibility analyses in regions with limited flood sampling data.

TI  - Erosion hotspot identified along the sandy coast of Shanwei: characteristics and origin
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the measured beach profile data of Sanzhou Bay from 2015 to 2019, an erosion hotspot was identified along the Shanwei coastline of eastern Guangdong, where the maximum retreat distance of the shoreline exceeded 80 m and the erosion rate was more than 20 m/a. To determine the time at which the erosion hotspot started and the potential causes of its formation, this study used 63 Landsat satellite images from 1986 to 2019 to construct a time series of shoreline positions over the past 30 years by extracting their high-tide shorelines. Next, the M-K trend test method was introduced to evaluate the non-linear shoreline behavior based on the single-transect method. The results showed that the time of approximately 2013 marked the start of the erosion hotspot, the erosion hotspot was characterized by erosion rates of more than 2 m/a (a maximum rate of 31.6 m/a), and the affected shoreline more than 4.3 km from 2013 to 2019. Furthermore, this erosion hotspot was proved to be caused by artificial sand mining in the nearshore zone, which destroyed the original beach's morphodynamic equilibrium. With the aid of storm events, soil cliffs composed of loose sediment on the backshore were sacrificed to achieve a new equilibrium, resulting in an extremely significant retreat parallel to the coast on the west side of the study area, which reflects the combined effect of human and natural processes. This study provides a concrete example of the rapid response of shorelines to artificial sand mining activities, and the associated finding is a stark warning about the cautious development and utilization of coastal zones and the strict regulation of human activities.

TI  - Study on Accuracy Evaluation of MODIS AOD Products and Spatio-Temporal Distribution Characteristics of AOD in Hangzhou
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, although the quality of the atmospheric environment has improved in some regions, monitoring air quality remains crucial. Aerosol optical thickness (aerosol optical depth, AOD) reflects the attenuation effect of atmospheric aerosol on light, which is an important parameter in aerosol research and plays an important role in the study of the atmosphere. Based on the CE-318 photometer data of 2015, 2016, and 2020 in Hangzhou and the MODIS satellite AOD data of 2015, 2016, and 2020, this paper first obtains the correlation between the MODIS AOD data and the ground-measured data by linear fitting. Then, the spatial and temporal distribution of the MODIS AOD data from 2012 to 2020 is analyzed. The analysis results indicate that the average correlation coefficient between the MODIS AOD data and ground-measured data is 0.77, and the average relative error is 30.53%. Thus, the MODIS AOD data can be used as an important basis for atmospheric research in Hangzhou. Based on this, the conclusions are as follows: (1) the AOD value in Hangzhou has been decreasing in recent years, from 0.43 in 2012 to 0.28 in 2020, with an average annual decrease of 0.017. (2) The AOD value in Hangzhou is large in spring and summer, and small in autumn and winter, with an average AOD value of 0.45 in spring, 0.39 in summer, 0.30 in autumn, and 0.33 in winter. (3) The AOD value in Hangzhou is large in the east and small in the west, and the AOD values in the Hangzhou urban area, Xiaoshan, and Yuhang are higher.

TI  - The Timing of Global Floods and Its Association With Climate and Topography
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Until recently, the development of a global geography of floods was challenged by the fragmentation and heterogeneity of in situ data and the high costs of processing large amounts of remote sensing data. Such geography would facilitate the exploration of large-scale drivers of flood extent and timing including wide latitudinal, climate, and topographic effects. Here we used a monthly data set spanning 30 years (Global Surface Water) to develop a worldwide geographical characterization of slow floods (1-degree grid), weighting the relative contribution of seasonal, interannual, and long-term fluctuations on overall variability, and quantified precipitation-flooding delays where seasonality dominated. We explored the dominance of different flooding timings across five main Koppen-Geiger climates and seven topography classes derived from modeled water table depths (i.e., hydro-topography) to contribute top-down insight about the most salient, cross-regional flooding patterns and their likely large-scale drivers. Our results showed that, globally, the mean extent of floods averaged 0.48% of the global land area, predominantly associated with hydro-topography (>2x more extensive in flatter landscapes). Climate drove flood timings, with predictable, seasonally dominated fluctuations in cold regions, interannual, and mixed patterns in temperate climates, and more irregular (higher variability) and unpredictable (less seasonal) patterns in arid regions. Net gains of flooded area dominated temporal variability in 9% of the cells including boreal clusters likely affected by warming trends. We propose that this new geographical perspective of floods can aid different avenues of hydrological research in the upscaling and extrapolation of field studies and the parsimonious representation of floods in hydroclimatic models.

TI  - Variations of Remote-Sensed Forel-Ule Index in the Bohai and Yellow Seas during 1997-2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water color, often quantified using the Forel-Ule Index (FUI), is a crucial parameter for assessing the water quality and ecological health of coastal waters. However, there is limited research on the spatiotemporal variations of FUI and the associated influencing factors in the Bohai and Yellow Seas. In this study, we utilized multi-sensor satellite datasets to retrieve monthly FUI products for the Bohai and Yellow Seas spanning the period from September 1997 to December 2019. Subsequently, we examined significant spatial disparities and variations across multiple timescales in the remotely sensed FUI time series. The climatological annual mean FUI map reveals a decreasing trend from nearshore to offshore regions, with similar spatial patterns observed in terms of overall and interannual FUI variability. The annual variations in wind field, sea surface temperature (SST), and ocean stratification play a key role in the seasonal dynamics of FUI by modulating the sediment resuspension process, resulting in low FUI values in summer and high FUI values in winter. Linear regression analysis of FUI anomaly indicates a long-term decreasing trend in FUI for the three bays of the Bohai Sea, while upward trends in FUI predominantly prevail in the central Yellow Sea. Factors related to interannual FUI variations, such as surface winds, SST, river outflow, rainfall, and anthropogenic activities, are qualitatively discussed. The findings of this study provide the first comprehensive evaluation of water color variations and their underlying mechanisms in the Bohai and Yellow Seas.

TI  - Nickel Grade Inversion of Lateritic Nickel Ore Using WorldView-3 Data Incorporating Geospatial Location Information: A Case Study of North Konawe, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The North Konawe region in Indonesia, known for its lateritic nickel (Ni) deposits, holds significant potential for obtaining Ni resources. However, the complex topographic conditions of this area pose challenges. Exploring the application of remote sensing technology to reveal the spectral response mechanism of Ni grade from high-precision multispectral data and inversion of Ni grade represents a novel direction in future Ni resource exploration. Traditional remote sensing inversion methods solely consider the spectral characteristics of sample data and ignore vital geospatial location information. As a result, efficiently obtaining regional details of target substance content over large areas has become challenging. The introduction of the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method offers an opportunity for fine-grained Ni grade inversion based on remote sensing. This study focused on the E and K blocks within the lateritic Ni mining area in North Konawe. Through utilizing the WordView-3 multispectral data which exhibits immense potential in quantitative remote sensing inversion studies, GWR was employed to integrate spectral features and spatial information. The goal was to reveal the correlation between multispectral remote sensing data and Ni grade. The obtained results were then compared and analyzed with multiple linear regression (MLR) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) models. The findings revealed that GWR achieved the highest coefficient of determination R-2 of 0.96, surpassing MLR and BPNN values of 0.05 and 0.17, respectively. Additionally, GWR exhibited the lowest root mean square error of 0.04, which was lower than those of MLR and BPNN with the values of 0.25 and 0.23, respectively. These results confirmed the enhanced stability and accuracy of the GWR method compared to MLR and BPNN. Furthermore, GWR effectively mapped the spatial distribution trends of Ni grades in the study area, providing evidence of the method's effectiveness in Ni grade inversion. The study also delved into the inversion effect of the GWR method in areas with varying weathering crust thickness and vegetation cover. The research revealed that higher values of weathering crust thickness negatively impacted the inversion effect. However, the influence mechanism of vegetation cover on Ni grade inversion necessitated further investigation. These results served as a significant demonstration of the remote sensing inversion of mineral resource grades in similar areas. They provided valuable insights for future exploration and decision-making processes.

TI  - Dialogue between Confucianism and Holmes Rolston, III-Its Significance for Theology in the Planetary Climate Crisis
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Holmes Rolston, III examined the significance of Asian thought for Western evaluations of nature and questioned if Asian Romanticism can inform the realistic decision making required for practice. However, Rolston's general evaluation of Asian thought ignored Confucianism. This study launches a dialogue between Rolston and contemporary Confucianism on environmental philosophy and highlights the following points in response to Rolston: First, Confucianism is grounded on an "anthropocosmic" worldview and bases its environmental ethics on its affirmation of the "virtue of life and growth" and the related vision of "unity of heaven and human beings"; it is thus an objective environmental virtue ethics with the characteristics of sacred humanism that avoids anthropocentrism. Second, Confucian ethics is built on the premise of "one principle with various manifestations" and advocates for practicing benevolence through "love with gradations", which avoids an excessively idealistic ecocentrism. Furthermore, Confucianism may adopt Rolston's recommendation for Asian thought concerning the incorporation of evolutionary biology into Asian traditions to facilitate their own transformation and thus contribute to environmental philosophy. Upon an exploration of the compatibility and possible reciprocal illumination between Confucianism and Rolston, this paper points out the implications of the above dialogue for theology in the planetary climate crisis.

TI  - Enhanced soil moisture improves vegetation growth in an arid grassland of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change impacts on grasslands that cover a quarter of the global land area, have become unprecedented during the 21(st) century. One of the important ecological realms, arid grasslands of northern China, which occupy more than 70% of the region's land area. However, the impact of climate change on vegetation growth in these arid grasslands is not consistent and lacks corresponding quantitative research. In this study, NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and climate factors including temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, soil moisture, and meteorological drought were analyzed to explore the determinants of changes in grassland greenness in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (northern China) during 1982-2016. The results showed that grasslands in Inner Mongolia witnessed an obvious trend of seasonal greening during the study period. Two prominent climatic factors, precipitation and soil moisture accounted for approximately 33% and 27% of grassland NDVI trends in the region based on multiple linear regression and boosted regression tree methods. This finding highlights the impact of water constraints to vegetation growth in Inner Mongolia's grasslands. The dominant role of precipitation in regulating grassland NDVI trends in Inner Mongolia significantly weakened from 1982 to 1996, and the role of soil moisture strengthened after 1996. Our findings emphasize the enhanced importance of soil moisture in driving vegetation growth in arid grasslands of Inner Mongolia, which should be thoroughly investigated in the future.

TI  - Reconstructing Groundwater Storage Changes in the North China Plain Using a Numerical Model and GRACE Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater has been extensively exploited in the North China Plain (NCP) since the 1970s, leading to various environmental issues. Numerous studies have utilized Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data to analyze changes in groundwater storage in the NCP and provide valuable insights. However, the low spatial resolution of GRACE data has posed challenges for its widespread application, and there have been limited studies focusing on refining groundwater storage changes in the NCP. In addition, the lack of data on the gap period between GRACE and GRACE-FO hinders in-depth research on regional groundwater storage anomalies (GWSA). This paper applied a groundwater storage model called NGFLOW-GRACE to construct a groundwater storage change model in the NCP at spatial resolutions of both 1 & DEG; and 0.05 & DEG;. The groundwater storage change model was calibrated and driven using gratis data, with hydrogeological parameter values estimated using the shuffled complex evolution algorithm (SCE-UA). The model exhibited favorable performance, with correlation coefficients greater than 0.85 during the calibration period and 55% of coefficients greater than 0.50 during the validation period. Interestingly, the results indicate that different combinations of remote sensing data do not significantly impact the outcomes, while the hydraulic gradient coefficient demonstrates the highest sensitivity. Appropriate reconstructed data were selected within the empty window period, and by downscaling the model to a resolution of 0.05 & DEG;, a complete cycle (January 2003 to December 2020) of GWSA was derived. Through comprehensive comparisons with previous research findings on both temporal and spatial scales, it can be concluded that the downscaled groundwater storage changes obtained from the established model demonstrated high reliability.

TI  - Adapting an Existing Empirical Algorithm for Microwave Land Surface Temperature Retrieval in China for AMSR2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To extend the time span of the microwave (MW) land surface temperature (LST) dataset in China, this study proposed an optimized empirical algorithm for Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) LST retrieval based on the algorithm for its predecessor, the AMSR-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). A modified comprehensive classification system of environmental variables (CCSEV) that considered the impact of landform, landcover, atmospheric conditions, and solar radiation on the variation of LST was first constructed, and the LST for each class in the CCSEV was then retrieved through stepwise regression using the brightness temperature in different AMSR2 channels. The results indicate that the annual RMSE of the AMSR2 LST, compared to the reference Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST from 2012 to 2020, varies between 3.26 K and 3.61 K in the daytime and 2.76 K and 2.96 K in the nighttime, respectively. The RMSE of the AMSR2 LST compared to the field measurements at the sites of the Beidahe river basin and Naqu regions varies between 4.16 K and 5.26 K in the daytime and 2.4 K and 5.17 K in the nighttime. The accuracy is relatively low in the warmer months and daytime due to the stronger solar radiation, and is also relatively low in western China due to the dominate highly fluctuating topography and barren and arid landcover. Generally, the accuracy of the AMSR2 LST is comparable with that of the AMSR-E LST retrieved by the predecessor algorithm, which facilitates coherent long-term applications using AMSR series LST datasets.

TI  - Estimation of the Total Soil Nitrogen Based on a Differential Evolution Algorithm from ZY1-02D Hyperspectral Satellite Imagery
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise fertilizer application in agriculture requires accurate and dependable measurements of the soil total nitrogen (TN) concentration. Henan Province is one of the most important grain-producing areas in China. In order to promote the development of precision agriculture in Henan Province, this study took the high-standard basic farmland construction area in central Henan Province as the research area. Using single-phase images acquired from the ZY1-02D satellite hyperspectral sensor on 28 January 2021 (with a spatial resolution of 30 m x 30 m, a spectral range that covered 400-2500 nm, and a revisit period of 3 days) for spectral reflectance transformation and feature spectral band extraction. Based on multiple representation models, such as multiple linear regression, partial least squares regression, and support vector machine (SVM), all bands, feature bands, feature band combinations, and differential evolution (DE) algorithms were used to extract the secondary characteristic variables of the combination of characteristic bands, which were used as model inputs to estimate the content of TN in the study area. It was found that (1) the spectral reflectance transformation could help to improve the accuracy of prediction by reducing the interference from noise in the model, but the optimal spectral transformation method differed between different models and even between the training and test sets of the same model; (2) the estimation accuracy of the TN content model based on the minimum shrinkage and feature selection operator of the feature band was usually better than that of the full band, the feature combination band contained more effective information related to the TN content, and the combination of the DE algorithm and the SVM model achieved a better estimation accuracy for secondary feature extraction and TN content estimation of the feature combination band; and (3) ZY1-02D hyperspectral satellite data have the potential for the dynamic and non-destructive monitoring of regional TN content.

TI  - Soil Zn Content Inversion by Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data and Considering Soil Types
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, the research of hyperspectral inversion methods for heavy metals is mostly focused on single areas or not consider the influence of soil type on the inversion results. However, the differences of soil type and soil forming factors may have a certain degree in influence on the applicability of hyperspectral data-based inversion model of soil parameters. Hyperspectral remote sensing data proposed a method for inverting soil Zn metal content and considering soil types. It extracted the characteristic spectrum of soil spectrally active constituents with strong sorption and retention for the heavy metal from laboratory spectra of soil samples to enhance the inversion mechanism. For each soil type, the improved genetic algorithm (IGA) was employed on the characteristic spectrum to select the effective bands furtherly, and these bands were used to construct model by the partial least squares regression ( PLSR). Finally, different modeling methods are evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-2) relative deviation (RPD) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). The proposed method was validated by 38 yellow soil samples and 35 red soil samples collected in the Dong River lead-zinc mining area in Chenzhou City, Hunan province, and then the soil Zn content inversion model of each of the two soil types was constructed by the characteristic spectrum of organic matter and clay minerals extracted from the laboratory spectra and finally both were modeled by the IGA-b PLSR. The results showed, when modeling with all soil samples regardless of soil types, comparing with inversion using the entire spectral range, the R-2 and RPD were improved from 0. 624 and 1. 668 to 0. 755 and 2. 069 and the RMSEP decreased by 40. 591 by using the characteristic spectrum associated with soil organic matter and clay minerals. When considering soil types and modeling respectively, comparing with the inversion without considering soil types, for yellow soil, the R-2 was improved from 0. 761 to 0. 879, RPD was improved from 2. 137 to 3. 001, and the RMSEP decreased by 74. 737; for red soil, the R-2 was improved from 0. 866 to 0. 939, RPD was improved from 2. 848 to 4. 212, and the RMSEP decreased by 89. 358. Inversion models for yellow and red soil samples met the criteria for an excellent model. Therefore, the proposed hyperspectral remote sensing inversion method of soil heavy metals content, which extracts the characteristic spectrum of soil spectrally active constituents and takes into account the soil type, is beneficial to improve the accuracy of heavy metal inversion and lays the foundation for monitoring of soil heavy metal pollution on a large scale by using hyperspectral remote sensing images.

TI  - Landscape Pattern Changes and Climate Response in Nagqu Hangcuo National Wetland Park in the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are vital ecosystems in the Tibetan Plateau that play a crucial role in water conservation, flood storage, and biodiversity maintenance. They are sensitive to climate change and typically have high ecological and environmental quality levels due to minimal human disturbance. This study aimed to quantify landscape pattern changes within the Nagqu Hangcuo National Wetland Park (NNWP) and identify the impact of climate on wetland change. Using remote sensing data from six periods (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015), dynamic change analysis, landscape pattern analysis, and correlation analysis were employed to determine the evolutionary features of the wetland landscape and explore their relationship with climatic factors. The results showed that the total wetland area increased from 15.11 km(2) in 1990 to 15.23 km(2) in 2015. The meadow area increased the most among landscape types, primarily converted from swamps. Over 25 years, the fragmentation of the NNWP's landscape increased while diversity decreased and its shape became more complex. Meadows were more sensitive to climatic factors than other landscape types, with correlation coefficients between wetland separation and sunshine duration being more significant than other climatic factors. Therefore, it is imperative to monitor landscape pattern changes and the effects of climate change to better protect wetland parks through long-term planning, suitable mechanisms, and advanced technology.

AB  - Nature reserves are special habitats established for representative plant and animal ecosystems, and it is important to strengthen the monitoring and protection of nature reserves for ecological environmental protection. In this paper, 23 typical nature reserves of different levels and types on Hainan Island were selected as the study area. The InVEST model and LandTrendr algorithm were applied in habitat quality assessment and to anthropogenic disturbances of the study area from 2000 to 2021, respectively. Finally, an assessment mode was established, coupling the habitat quality assessment and anthropogenic disturbances, to analyze the spatial and temporal conservation effectiveness of the 23 nature reserves. The results indicate that the 23 nature reserves had good overall conservation effectiveness; 21 had an excellent effectiveness rating, and 2 had a good effectiveness rating between 2000 and 2021. Three of the nature reserves, namely, Dazhoudao, Dongzhaigang and Bangxi, have become significantly more effective. Provincial nature reserves are less effective than national nature reserves in terms of conservation, and are a key concern for follow-up. The conservation effectiveness of the four provincial nature reserves-Nanwan, Qinglangang, Dongfangheilianpilu and Qilinlai-is low, and there has been no significant trend of improvement over the past 21 years. The spatial and temporal changes in the conservation effectiveness of 23 nature reserves on Hainan Island over 21 years can provide scientific data support for the development of nature reserves and departmental supervision in Hainan Province.

TI  - Characteristics and Influencing Factors of Internal Solitary Waves in the Penghu Channel Based on Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - Journal of Coastal Research
M3  - Article
AB  - The Taiwan Strait has always been considered a hot spot for the occurrence of internal waves in the ocean. Recent research shows that the Penghu Channel also has a strong and previously unknown source of internal solitary waves (ISWs). In this paper, 23 satellite remote sensing images covering the Penghu Channel from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Envisat advanced synthetic aperture radar, HY-1D, and GF-1 satellites are examined to reveal the sea surface characteristics of the area's ISWs through image interpretation and dynamics analysis and to study the local generation of ISWs and their evolutionary characteristics in this sea area. The results show that SE and SW crosspropagating ISWs exist in the Penghu Channel. They are generated near the Penghu Islands and the continental shelf of Taiwan at the same latitude and propagate in a countercurrent direction along the Penghu Channel. The ISWs from these two directions meet and continue to propagate southward in a V shape, with various wave-wave interactions occurring in the middle of the channel, such as Mach and resonance interactions, depending on the strength and angle characteristics of the ISWs. SAR images also show that waveform broadening occurs during the propagation of ISWs to the shallow shelf and the ISWs' polarity transition phenomenon. Although the specific generation mechanism is not clear, it is speculated that the interaction of the tidal current with the complex topography of the Penghu Channel is the main source of energy for these ISWs. In addition, the combination of drifting buoy data and analysis of hydrographic conditions in the Penghu Channel indicates that ISW phenomena on the sea surface are observed more frequently during summer flood tides with low wind speeds, low sea conditions, strong stratification, and strong currents.

TI  - Reconstruction of all-weather land surface temperature based on a combined physical and data-driven model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, the remote sensing (RS) thermal infrared (TIR) images that are commonly used to obtain land surface temperature (LST) are contaminated by clouds and thus cannot obtain spatiotemporal integrity of LST. To solve this problem, this study combined a physical model with strong interpretability with a data-driven model with high data adaptability. First, the physical model ( Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model) was used to generate LST source data. Then, combined with multisource RS data, a data-driven method (random forest (RF)) was used to improve the accuracy of the LST, and a model framework for a data-driven auxiliary physical model was formed. Finally, all- weather MODIS-like data with a spatial resolution of 1 km were generated. Beijing, China, was used as the study area. The results showed that in cases of more clouds and fewer clouds, the reconstructed all-weather LST had a high spatial continuity and could restore the spatial distribution details of the LST well. The mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (rho) in the case of more (fewer) clouds were ranked as follows: MAE < 1 K (< 2 K), RMSE < 2 K (< 2 K), and. > 0.9. The errors obeyed an approximately normal distribution. The total MAE, RMSE, and rho were 0.80 K, 1.09 K, and 0.94 K, respectively. Generally, the LST reconstructed in this paper had a high accuracy, and the model could provide all-weather MODIS-like LST to compensate for the disadvantages of satellite TIR images (i.e., contamination by clouds and inability to obtain complete LST values).

TI  - Cryosphere as a temporal sink and source of microplastics in the Arctic region
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) pollution has become a serious environmental issue of growing global concern due to the increasing plastic production and usage. Under climate warming, the cryosphere, defined as the part of Earth's layer characterized by the low temperatures and the presence of frozen water, has been expe-riencing significant changes. The Arctic cryosphere (e.g., sea ice, snow cover, Greenland ice sheet, per-mafrost) can store and release pollutants into environments, making Arctic an important temporal sink and source of MPs. Here, we summarized the distributions of MPs in Arctic snow, sea ice, seawater, rivers, and sediments, to illustrate their potential sources, transport pathways, storage and release, and possible effects in this sentinel region. Items concentrations of MPs in snow and ice varied about 1-6 orders of magnitude in different regions, which were mostly attributed to the different sampling and measurement methods, and potential sources of MPs. MPs concentrations from Arctic seawater, river/ lake water, and sediments also fluctuated largely, ranging from several items of per unit to >40,000 items m-3, 100 items m-3, and 10,000 items kg -1 dw, respectively. Arctic land snow cover can be a temporal storage of MPs, with MPs deposition flux of about (4.9-14.26) x 108 items km -2 yr-1. MPs transported by rivers to Arctic ocean was estimated to be approximately 8-48 ton/yr, with discharge flux of MPs at about (1.65-9.35) x 108 items/s. Average storage of MPs in sea ice was estimated to be about 6.1x1018 items, with annual release of about 5.1x1018 items. Atmospheric transport of MPs from long-distance terrestrial sources contributed significantly to MPs deposition in Arctic land snow cover, sea ice and oceanic surface waters. Arctic Great Rivers can flow MPs into the Arctic Ocean. Sea ice can temporally store, transport and then release MPs in the surrounded environment. Ocean currents from the Atlantic brought high concentrations of MPs into the Arctic. However, there existed large uncertain-ties of estimation on the storage and release of MPs in Arctic cryosphere owing to the hypothesis of aver-age MPs concentrations. Meanwhile, representatives of MPs data across the large Arctic region should be mutually verified with in situ observations and modeling. Therefore, we suggested that systematic mon-itoring MPs in the Arctic cryosphere, potential threats on Arctic ecosystems, and the carbon cycle under increasing Arctic warming, are urgently needed to be studied in future.(c) 2023 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

TI  - Landslide Hazard Assessment in Highway Areas of Guangxi Using Remote Sensing Data and a Pre-Trained XGBoost Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a novel method for assessing landslide hazards along highways using remote sensing and machine learning. We extract geospatial features such as slope, aspect, and rainfall over Guangxi, China, and apply an extreme gradient boosting model pre-trained on contiguous United States datasets. The model produces susceptibility maps that indicate landslide probability at different scales. However, the lack of accurate data on historical landslides in Guangxi challenges the model evaluation and comparison between regions. To overcome this, we calibrate the model to fit the local conditions in Guangxi. The calibrated model agrees with the observed landslide locations, implying its capability to capture regional variations in landslide mechanisms. We apply the model at a 30 m resolution along the Heba Expressway and validate it against reports from July 2021 to March 2022. The model correctly predicts five of seven landslide events in this period with a reasonable alarm rate. This framework has the potential for large-scale landslide risk management by informing transportation planning and infrastructure maintenance decisions. More data on landslide timing and human disturbance events may improve the model's accuracy across diverse geographical areas and terrains.

TI  - Differences in the evolution of urban and rural surface thermal environment and their responses to urban renewal in Shanghai, China.
T2  - Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The rapid and extensive urbanization has profound impacts on urban thermal environment. It is of great significance to comprehensively understand how urbanization affects the evolution of urban thermal environment for urban ecological safety, environmental quality, and residents' health. Based on daily land surface temperature (LST) products of MODIS Aqua satellite in the summer of 2002-2020, we investigated the evolution of urban-rural differences in surface summer thermal environment in Shanghai during 2002-2020 and its response to urban spatial renewal. We used normalized land surface temperature (NLST) and urban heat island ratio index (URI) as the surface thermal environment measurement indicators, by combining vegetation index and impervious surface cove-rage, and used M-K trend analysis and interpretation analysis. The results showed that the linear growth rate of LST in Shanghai was 0.09 ℃·a-1 (2002-2020), and that URI showed a trend of first increasing (2002-2010) and then decreasing (2010-2020). The mean summer LST was generally in the order of urban core>suburban>rural. 1.6% of the areas showed a significant cooling trend, of which 54.0% were distributed in the urban core. 39.5% of the regions showed a significant warming trend, of which 77.6% were distributed in the suburban. In general, there were concentrated significant cooling areas in the highly urbanized urban areas, while there was a significant warming trend in the suburban. The transformation from urban expansion to urban renewal was the main reason for the emergence of concentrated and significant cooling areas in the urban. Nearly 20% of the urban area showed a signi-ficant increase of vegetation coverage. Urban renewal projects such as gathering vegetation or dispersing impervious surfaces in highly urbanized areas are important ways to effectively improve the urban residential thermal environment.

TI  - Mapping Irish Water Bodies: Comparison of Platforms, Indices and Water Body Type
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of water bodies is essential for the management and regulation of water resources. Traditional methods for measuring water quality are always time-consuming and expensive; furthermore, it can be very difficult capture the full spatiotemporal variations across regions. Many studies have shown the possibility of remote-sensing-based water monitoring work in many areas, especially for water quality monitoring. However, the use of optical remotely sensed imagery depends on several factors, including weather, quality of images and the size of water bodies. Hence, in this study, the feasibility of optical remote sensing for water quality monitoring in the Republic of Ireland was investigated. To assess the value of remote sensing for water quality monitoring, it is critical to know how well water bodies and the existing in situ monitoring stations are mapped. In this study, two satellite platforms (Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI) and four indices for separating water and land pixel (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI; Normalized Difference Water Index-NDWI; Modified Normalized Difference Water Index-MNDWI; and Automated Water Extraction Index-AWEI) have been used to create water masks for two scenarios. In the first scenario (Scenario 1), we included all pixels classified as water, while for the second scenario (Scenario 2) accounts for potential land contamination and only used water pixels that were completed surround by other water pixels. The water masks for the different scenarios and combinations of platforms and indices were then compared with the existing water quality monitoring station and to the shapefile of the river network, lakes and coastal and transitional water bodies. We found that both platforms had potential for water quality monitoring in the Republic of Ireland, with Sentinel-2 outperforming Landsat due to its finer spatial resolution. Overall, Sentinel-2 was able to map similar to 25% of the existing monitoring station, while Landsat-8 could only map similar to 21%. These percentages were heavily impacted by the large number of river monitoring stations that were difficult to map with either satellite due to their location on smaller rivers. Our results showed the importance of testing several indices. No index performed the best across the different platforms. AWEI(nsh) (Automated Water Extraction Index-no shadow) and Sentinel-2 outperformed all other combinations and was able to map over 80% of the area of all non-river water bodies across the Republic of Ireland. While MNDWI was the best index for Landsat-8, it was the worst performer for Sentinel-2. This study showed that optical remote sensing has potential for water monitoring in the Republic of Ireland, especially for larger rivers, lakes and transitional and coastal water bodies.

TI  - Intelligent identification of oceanic eddies in remote sensing data via Dual-Pyramid UNet
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanic eddies are an omnipresent phenomenon of seawater flow and critical in transporting oceanic energy and material. Consequently, mastering and comprehending the characteristics of ocean eddies through detecting and recognizing eddies contributes to the understanding of oceanography. In traditional oceanography, a series of methods to identify eddies with physical or geometric characteristics have been developed. Deep learning frame-works have recently been applied in the eddy detection field. In this paper, a Dual-Pyramid UNet architecture that combines a pyramid split attention (PSA) module and atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) is proposed to iden-tify oceanic eddies from remote sensing data. The encoder and decoder parts can effectively integrate low-level and high-level features, thus ensuring that feature information is not lost in large quantities after the nonlinear connection mode. In addition, the PSA and ASPP modules are introduced into the encoding, decoding, and skip connections to enhance feature extraction. Experiments were implemented in two typical study areas -the North Atlantic and South Atlantic. The recognition results demonstrate that Dual-Pyramid UNet can outperform four other competitive AI-based methods, especially for eddy edges and small-scale eddies.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring of Rice Diseases and Pests from Different Data Sources: A Review
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Rice is an important food crop in China, and diseases and pests are the main factors threatening its safety, ecology, and efficient production. The development of remote sensing technology provides an important means for non-destructive and rapid monitoring of diseases and pests that threaten rice crops. This paper aims to provide insights into current and future trends in remote sensing for rice crop monitoring. First, we expound the mechanism of remote sensing monitoring of rice diseases and pests and introduce the applications of different commonly data sources (hyperspectral data, multispectral data, thermal infrared data, fluorescence, and multi-source data fusion) in remote sensing monitoring of rice diseases and pests. Secondly, we summarize current methods for monitoring rice diseases and pests, including statistical discriminant type, machine learning, and deep learning algorithm. Finally, we provide a general framework to facilitate the monitoring of rice diseases or pests, which provides ideas and technical guidance for remote sensing monitoring of unknown diseases and pests, and we point out the challenges and future development directions of rice disease and pest remote sensing monitoring. This work provides new ideas and references for the subsequent monitoring of rice diseases and pests using remote sensing.

TI  - A CatBoost-Based Model for the Intensity Detection of Tropical Cyclones over the Western North Pacific Based on Satellite Cloud Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A CatBoost-based intelligent tropical cyclone (TC) intensity-detecting model was built to quantify the intensity of TCs over the Western North Pacific (WNP) with the cloud-top brightness temperature (CTBT) data of Fengyun-2F (FY-2F) and Fengyun-2G (FY-2G) and the best-track data of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA-BST) in recent years (2015-2018). The CatBoost-based model was featured with the greedy strategy of combination, the ordering principle in optimizing the possible gradient bias and prediction shift problems, and the oblivious tree in fast scoring. Compared with the previous studies based on the pure convolutional neural network (CNN) models, the CatBoost-based model exhibited better skills in detecting the TC intensity with the root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.74 m s(-1). In addition to the three mentioned model features, there are also two reasons for the model's design. On one hand, the CatBoost-based model used the method of introducing prior physical factors (e.g., the structure and shape of the cloud, deep convections, and background fields) into its training process. On the other hand, the CatBoost-based model expanded the dataset size from 2342 to 13,471 samples through hourly interpolations of the original dataset. Furthermore, this paper investigated the errors of this model in detecting the different categories of TC intensity. The results showed that the deep learning-based TC intensity-detecting model proposed in this paper has systematic biases, namely, the overestimation (underestimation) of intensities in TCs which were weaker (stronger) than at the typhoon level, and the errors of the model in detecting weaker (stronger) TCs were smaller (larger). This implies that more factors than the CTBT should be included to further reduce the errors in detecting strong TCs.

TI  - Estimation of forest canopy closure in northwest Yunnan based on multi-source remote sensing data colla-boration.
T2  - Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Forest canopy closure (FCC) is an important parameter to evaluate forest resources and biodiversity. Using multi-source remote sensing collaborative means to achieve regional forest canopy closure inversion with low cost and high-precision is a research hotspot. Taking ICESat-2/ATLAS data as the main information source and combined with data of 54 measured plots, we estimated FCC value by the Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm improved random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) model at footprint-scale. Combined with multi-source remote sensing image Sentinel-1/2 and terrain factors, we estimated the regional-scale FCC value of Shangri-La in the northwest Yunnan based on deep neural network (DNN) optimized by BO algorithm. The results showed that six characteristic parameters (percentage of tree canopy, standard deviation of relative height of photons at the top of the canopy, minimum canopy height, difference between 98% canopy height and median canopy height in the segment, number of top canopy photons, apparent surface reflectance) out of the 50 parameters that were extracted from ATLAS lidar footprint had higher contribution rate after RF characteristic variable optimization, which could be used as model variable for footprint-scale remote sensing estimation. Among BO-RF, BO-KNN, and BO-GBRT models, the FCC results estimated by the BO-GBRT model were the best at footprint-scale. The coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.65, the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.10, the mean absolute residual (RS) was 0.079, and the prediction accuracy (P) was 0.792 for leave-one-out cross validation. It could be used as the FCC estimation model of 74808 ATLAS footprints for forest in the study area. We used the ATLAS footprint-scale FCC value of forest as the large sample data of the regional-scale BO-DNN model and combined with multi-source remote sensing factors to estimate FCC in the study area, the accuracy of the 10-fold cross-validation BO-DNN model was R2=0.47, RMSE=0.22, P=0.558. The mean values of FCC in the study area estimated by BO-DNN model and ordinary Kriging (OK) interpolation were 0.46 and 0.52, respectively, and the values mainly distributed in 0.3-0.6, accounting for 77.8% and 81.4%, respectively. The FCC efficiency obtained directly by the OK interpolation method was higher (R2=0.26), but the prediction accuracy was significantly lower than the BO-DNN model (R2=0.49). The FCC high value was distributed from northwest to southeast in the study area, and the northern and southeastern regions were the main distribution areas of high and low FCC values, respectively. It had certain advantages to estimate mountain area FCC based on ICESat-2/ATLAS high-density footprint, and the estimation results of small sample data at footprint-scale could be used as large sample data of deep learning model at region-scale, which would provide a reference for the low-cost and high-precision to FCC estimation on the footprint-scale up to the extrapolated regional-scale.

TI  - A Prediction Model of Maize Field Yield Based on the Fusion of Multitemporal and Multimodal UAV Data: A Case Study in Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction of crop yield plays a crucial role in national economic development, encompassing grain storage, processing, and grain price trends. Employing multiple sensors to acquire remote sensing data and utilizing machine learning algorithms can enable accurate, fast, and nondestructive yield prediction for maize crops. However, current research heavily relies on single-type remote sensing data and traditional machine learning methods, resulting in the limited robustness of yield prediction models. To address these limitations, this study introduces a field-scale maize yield prediction model named the convolutional neural network-attention-long short-term memory network (CNN-attention-LSTM) model, which utilizes multimodal remote sensing data collected by multispectral and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The model incorporates meteorological data throughout the crop reproductive stages and employs the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red edge (NDRE), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) for the initial part of the vegetative stage (initial part of the V period), the later part of the vegetative stage (later part of the V period), the reproductive stage (R period), and the maturity stage (M period), along with LIDAR data for Point(75-100) in the later part of the V period, Point(80-100) in the R period, and Point(50-100) in the M period, complemented by corresponding meteorological data as inputs. The resulting yield estimation demonstrates exceptional performance, with an R-2 value of 0.78 and an rRMSE of 8.27%. These results surpass previous research and validate the effectiveness of multimodal data in enhancing yield prediction models. Furthermore, to assess the superiority of the proposed model, four machine learning algorithms-multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest regression (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and backpropagation (BP)-are compared to the CNN-attention-LSTM model through experimental analysis. The outcomes indicate that all alternative models exhibit inferior prediction accuracy compared to the CNN-attention-LSTM model. Across the test dataset within the study area, the R-2 values for various nitrogen fertilizer levels consistently exceed 0.75, illustrating the robustness of the proposed model. This study introduces a novel approach for assessing maize crop yield and provides valuable insights for estimating the yield of other crops.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Stock Volume Using Sentinel-2 MSI, Landsat 8 OLI Imagery and Forest Inventory Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest stock volume (FSV) is a key indicator for measuring forest quality, evaluating forest management capabilities, and the main factor for evaluating forest carbon sequestration levels. In this study, to achieve an accurate estimation of FSV, we used Ninth Beijing Forest Inventory data (FID), and Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI imagery to establish FSV models. The performance of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery data in estimating forest volume in Huairou District, Beijing, China was compared. The combination of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data was employed to create a new data source. Two variable selection methods, linear stepwise regression (LSR) and recursive feature elimination (RFE), were used to extract feature variables. The multiple linear regression(MLR) models, Back Propagation (BP) neural network models, and Random Forest (RF) models were employed to estimate forest volume in the study area based on the feature variables obtained from both data sources. The research results indicate (1) the Sentinel-2-based model achieved higher accuracy compared to the same model based on the Landsat 8 factor set. The correlation between the red-edge band of Sentinel-2 imagery and FSV is more significant than that of other characteristic variables used. Variables derived from the red-edge band have the potential to reduce model errors; (2) the estimation accuracy of the model can be significantly improved by using the RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) method to select remote sensing feature variables. RFE is based on the importance ranking of all feature variables and selects the feature variables that contribute the most to the model. In the variable group selected by RFE, the texture features and the derived features from the red-edge band, such as Sen(B5), Sen(RVI), Sen(mNDVIre), and Sen(B5Mean), contribute the most to the improvement of model accuracy. Furthermore, in the optimal Landsat 8-Sentinel-2 RFE-RF model, where texture features are involved, the rRMSE is greatly reduced by 3.7% compared to the joint remote sensing RFE-RF model without texture features; (3) the MLR, BP, and RF models based on the modeling factor set established on Sentinel-2 have accuracy superior to the model accuracy established based on the modeling factor set of Landsat 8. Among them, the Random Forest (RF) method inverted by the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method using Sentinel-2A image has the best inversion accuracy effect (R-2 = 0.831, RMSE = 12.604 m(3) ha(-1), rRMSE = 36.411%, MAE = 9.366 m(3) ha(-1)). Comparing the performance of the models on the test set, the ranking is as follows, Random Forest (RF) model > Back Propagation (BP) neural network model > multiple linear regression (MLR) model. The feature variable screening based on the Random Forest's recursive feature elimination (RFE) method is better than the linear stepwise regression (LSR). Therefore, the RFE-RF method based on the joint variables from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data to establish a new remote sensing data source provides the possibility to improve the estimation accuracy of FSV and provides reference for forest dynamic monitoring.

TI  - Prediction and Analysis of Chlorophyll-a Concentration in the Western Waters of Hong Kong Based on BP Neural Network
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is an important indicator of water environmental conditions; thus, the simultaneous monitoring of large-area water bodies can be realized through the remote sensing-based retrieval of Chl-a concentrations. Together with hyperspectral remote sensing data, a BP neural network model was used to invert chlorophyll-a concentration, with remote sensing reflectance as the input factor. Given the presence of many bands in the hyperspectral data, selecting an appropriate band reflectance as the input factor is crucial to improving inversion accuracy. In this study, a Pearson correlation analysis method was proposed to select bands. A normality test was performed on the reflectance of each band of the Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral remote sensing data, and the significance index was p < 0.05. The absolute kurtosis value was less than 10, and the absolute skewness value was less than 3, indicating that the Pearson method was applicable. Pearson correlation analysis was utilised to calculate the correlation coefficient between the reflectance data and chlorophyll-a concentration. Five reflectance data with high correlation were selected as the input factors, and chlorophyll-a concentration was adopted as the output factor. An error backpropagation network model was constructed to predict chlorophyll-a concentration, and a Garson function was added to clarify the connection weights of the input factors in the model construction process. Model 12 was determined as the optimal model on the basis of the criteria of the coefficient of determination, the average relative variance, and the minimum mean square error. The chlorophyll-a concentration was predicted for July and November 2020 in the study area, and the results showed that the predicted values had a small error compared with the measured values. The root-mean-square error and mean relative error of the chlorophyll-a concentration predicted and measured values were 2.12 & mu;g/L and 9.66%, respectively. Significant spatial differences in the Chl-a concentration were observed in the study area due to the influence of islands and land; the Chl-a concentration in July was generally higher than that in November. The results of these studies provide a reference for monitoring the water environment in the study area.

TI  - Enhancing Forest Canopy Height Retrieval: Insights from Integrated GEDI and Landsat Data Analysis
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy height is a crucial indicator for assessing the structure and function of the forest ecosystems. It plays a significant role in carbon sequestration, sink enhancement, and promoting green development. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of GEDI L2A version 2 data in estimating ground elevation and canopy height by comparing it with airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Among the six algorithms provided by the GEDI L2A data, algorithm a2 demonstrated higher accuracy than the others in detecting ground elevation and canopy height. Additionally, a relatively strong correlation (R-squared = 0.35) was observed between rh95 for GEDI L2A and RH90 for ALS. To enhance the accuracy of canopy height estimation, this study proposed three backpropagation (BP) neural network inversion models based on GEDI, Landsat 8 OLI, and Landsat 9 OLI-2 data. Multiple sets of relative heights and vegetation indices were extracted from the GEDI and Landsat datasets. The random forest (RF) algorithm was employed to select feature variables with a cumulative importance score of 90% for training the BP neural network inversion models. Validation against RH90 of ALS revealed that the GEDI model outperformed the OLI or OLI-2 data models in terms of accuracy. Moreover, the quality improvement of OLI-2 data relative to OLI data contributed to enhanced inversion accuracy. Overall, the models based on a single dataset exhibited relatively low accuracy. Hence, this study proposed the GEDI and OLI and GEDI and OLI-2 models, which combine the two types of data. The results demonstrated that the combined model integrating GEDI and OLI-2 data exhibited the highest performance. Compared to the weakest OLI data model, the inversion accuracy R-squared improved from 0.38 to 0.74, and the MAE, RMSE, and rRMSE decreased by 1.21 m, 1.81 m, and 8.09%, respectively. These findings offer valuable insights for the remote sensing monitoring of forest sustainability.

TI  - Estimation of the Seawater Lidar Ratio by MODIS: Spatial-Temporal Characteristics and Ecological Significance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lidar ratio of seawater is an essential quantity related to both lidar retrieval and water constituent. However, few studies discuss its spatial-temporal characteristics and ecological significance, which limits its applications in lidar remote sensing and marine science. This paper investigates the spatial-temporal characteristics and ecological significance of the lidar ratio of seawater using satellite passive remote sensing, which is validated by in situ measurements. Spatially, nearshore lidar ratio values are higher than offshore, mainly owing to the high concentration of colored dissolved organic matter in nearshore water. Temporally, the lidar ratio in each hemisphere exhibits lower values in summer than in winter due to the annual boom-bust cycle of phytoplankton. Furthermore, the variability patterns of the lidar ratio are nearly consistent with those of the chlorophyll-to-carbon ratio, implying the high ecological significance of phytoplankton physiology. These findings will provide the foundation for the application of lidar ratio in marine science and lidar remote sensing.

TI  - Interferometry modeling and model-based height estimation for buildings in urban DSM reconstruction based on interferometric synthetic aperture radar technology
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Benefiting from the advantage of weather and illumination independence, less processing data and shorter data time span, spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar technology has certain potential in building 3D reconstruction and urban DSM reconstruction because of its sensitivity to height. However, the phase mixture in the building layover area makes it difficult to realize the accurate building height reconstruction. Therefore, an interferometry model of high-rise buildings was established by comprehensively analyzing the relationship between building structure, scattering mechanisms, and the geometry of interferometric imaging. At the same time, a model-based height estimation method was proposed for high-rise buildings with complex structures and mixed layover interferometric phase. The established interferometry models of buildings are the basis of the height estimation, which reveals the phase mixing mechanism, phase variation characteristics, and the relationship between phase and height. Further, based on the established model, the characteristics and difference of the mixed layover interferometric phase and the pure facade interferometric phase can be obtained. Then, based on these characteristics and by detection of the facade-only imaging area, the pure facade interferometric phase can be recovered from the mixed layover interferometric phase, and the building facade height can be reconstructed by the conversion between phase and height. A pair of TerraSAR-X data located in Harbin city, China was used for experiment and the results show that the height estimation algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively obtain the building height and the DSM in urban area, and for the results of building heights, the average absolute error is within 2 m and the root mean square error is between 2 and 4 m.

TI  - Using GEDI as training data for an ongoing mapping of landscape-scale dynamics of the plant area index
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf or plant area index (LAI, PAI) information is frequently used to describe vegetation structure in environmental science. While field measurements are time-consuming and do not scale to landscapes, model-based air- or space-borne remote-sensing methods have been used for many years for area-wide monitoring. As of 2019, NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission delivers a point-based LAI product with 25 m footprints and periodical repetition. This opens up new possibilities in integrating GEDI as frequently generated training samples with high resolution (spectral) sensors. However, the foreseeable duration of the system installed on the ISS is limited. In this study we want to test the potential of GEDI for regional comprehensive LAI estimations throughout the year with a focus on its usability beyond the lifespan of the GEDI mission. We study the landscape of Hesse, Germany, with its pronounced seasonal changes. Assuming a relationship between GEDI's PAI and Sentinel-1 and -2 data, we used a Random Forest approach together with spatial variable selection to make predictions for new Sentinel scenes. The model was trained with two years of GEDI PAI data and validated against a third year to provide a robust and temporally independent model validation. This ensures the applicability of the validation for years outside the training period, reaching a total RMSE of 1.12. Predictions for the test year showed the expected seasonal and spatial patterns indicated by RMSE values ranging between 0.75 and 1.44, depending on the land cover class. The overall prediction performance shows good agreement with the test data set of the independent year which supports our assumption that the usage of GEDI's PAI beyond the mission lifespan is feasible for regional studies.

TI  - The Misinformation Receptivity Framework Political Misinformation and Disinformation as Cognitive Bayesian Inference Problems
T2  - EUROPEAN PSYCHOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating the truthfulness of new information is a difficult and complex task. Notably, there is currently no unified theoretical framework that addresses the questions of (1) how individuals discern whether political information is true or (deliberately) false, (2) under what conditions individuals are most susceptible to believing misinformation, and (3) how the structure of political and communicative environments skews cognitive processes of truth, discernment, and interpretation generation. To move forward, we propose the Misinformation Receptivity Framework (MRF). Building on Bayesian and probabilistic models of cognition, the MRF suggests that we can conceptualize misinformation receptivity as a cognitive inference problem in which the reliability of incoming misinformation is weighed against the reliability of prior beliefs. This "reliability-weighting" process can model when individuals adopt or reject misinformation, as well as the ways in which they creatively generate interpretations rather than passively discern truth versus falsehood. Moreover, certain communication contexts can lead people to rely excessively on incoming (mis)information or conversely to rely excessively on prior beliefs. The MRF postulates how such environmental properties can heighten the persuasiveness of different kinds of misinformation. For instance, the MRF predicts that noisy communication contexts, in which the reliability of inputs is ambiguous, make people susceptible to highly partisan and ideological misinformation or disinformation that amplifies their existing belief systems. By contrast, the MRF predicts that contextual instability renders people susceptible to misinformation that would be considered extreme or worldview-incongruent in conditions of stability. The MRF formally delineates the interactions between cognitive and communicative mechanisms, offering insights and testable hypotheses on when, how, and why different kinds of misinformation proliferate.

TI  - Travel-Related Diagnoses Among US Nonmigrant Travelers or Migrants Presenting to US GeoSentinel Sites-GeoSentinel Network, 2012-2021
T2  - MMWR-MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WEEKLY REPORT
M3  - Article
AB  - Problem/Condition: During 2012-2021, the volume of international travel reached record highs and lows. This period also was marked by the emergence or large outbreaks of multiple infectious diseases (e.g., Zika virus, yellow fever, and COVID-19). Over time, the growing ease and increased frequency of travel has resulted in the unprecedented global spread of infectious diseases. Detecting infectious diseases and other diagnoses among travelers can serve as sentinel surveillance for new or emerging pathogens and provide information to improve case identification, clinical management, and public health prevention and response.Reporting Period: 2012-2021.Description of System: Established in 1995, the GeoSentinel Network (GeoSentinel), a collaboration between CDC and the International Society of Travel Medicine, is a global, clinical-care-based surveillance and research network of travel and tropical medicine sites that monitors infectious diseases and other adverse health events that affect international travelers. GeoSentinel comprises 71 sites in 29 countries where clinicians diagnose illnesses and collect demographic, clinical, and travel-related information about diseases and illnesses acquired during travel using a standardized report form. Data are collected electronically via a secure CDC database, and daily reports are generated for assistance in detecting sentinel events (i.e., unusual patterns or clusters of disease). GeoSentinel sites collaborate to report disease or population-specific findings through retrospective database analyses and the collection of supplemental data to fill specific knowledge gaps. GeoSentinel also serves as a communications network by using internal notifications, ProMed alerts, and peer-reviewed publications to alert clinicians and public health professionals about global outbreaks and events that might affect travelers. This report summarizes data from 20 U.S. GeoSentinel sites and reports on the detection of three worldwide events that demonstrate GeoSentinel's notification capability.Results: During 2012-2021, data were collected by all GeoSentinel sites on approximately 200,000 patients who had approximately 244,000 confirmed or probable travel-related diagnoses. Twenty GeoSentinel sites from the United States contributed records during the 10-year surveillance period, submitting data on 18,336 patients, of which 17,389 lived in the United States and were evaluated by a clinician at a U.S. site after travel. Of those patients, 7,530 (43.3%) were recent migrants to the United States, and 9,859 (56.7%) were returning nonmigrant travelers.Among the recent migrants to the United States, the median age was 28.5 years (range = <19 years to 93 years); 47.3% were female, and 6.0% were U.S. citizens. A majority (89.8%) were seen as outpatients, and among 4,672 migrants with information available, 4,148 (88.8%) did not receive pretravel health information. Of 13,986 diagnoses among migrants, the most frequent were vitamin D deficiency (20.2%), Blastocystis (10.9%), and latent tuberculosis (10.3%). Malaria was diagnosed in 54 (<1%) migrants. Of the 26 migrants diagnosed with malaria for whom pretravel information was known, 88.5% did not receive pretravel health information. Before November 16, 2018, patients' reasons for travel, exposure country, and and latent tuberculosis (10.3%). Malaria was diagnosed in 54 (<1%) migrants. Of the 26 migrants diagnosed with malaria for whom pretravel information was known, 88.5% did not receive pretravel health information.Before November 16, 2018, patients' reasons for travel, exposure country, and exposure region were not linked to an individual diagnosis. Thus, results of these data from January 1, 2012, to November 15, 2018 (early period), and from November 16, 2018, to December 31, 2021 (later period), are reported separately. During the early and later periods, the most frequent regions of exposure were Sub-Saharan Africa (22.7% and 26.2%, respectively), the Caribbean (21.3% and 8.4%, respectively), Central America (13.4% and 27.6%, respectively), and South East Asia (13.1% and 16.9%, respectively). Migrants with diagnosed malaria were most frequently exposed in Sub-Saharan Africa (89.3% and 100%, respectively). Among nonmigrant travelers returning to the United States, the median age was 37 years (range = <19 years to 96 years); 55.7% were female, 75.3% were born in the United States, and 89.4% were U.S. citizens. A majority (90.6%) were seen as outpatients, and of 8,967 nonmigrant travelers with available information, 5,878 (65.6%) did not receive pretravel health information. Of 11,987 diagnoses, the most frequent were related to the gastrointestinal system (5,173; 43.2%). The most frequent diagnoses among nonmigrant travelers were acute diarrhea (16.9%), viral syndrome (4.9%), and irritable bowel syndrome (4.1%). Malaria was diagnosed in 421 (3.5%) nonmigrant travelers. During the early (January 1, 2012, to November 15, 2018) and later (November 16, 2018, to December 31, 2021) periods, the most frequent reasons for travel among nonmigrant travelers were tourism (44.8% and 53.6%, respectively), travelers visiting friends and relatives (VFRs) (22.0% and 21.4%, respectively), business (13.4% and 12.3%, respectively), and missionary or humanitarian aid (13.1% and 6.2%, respectively). The most frequent regions of exposure for any diagnosis among nonmigrant travelers during the early and later period were Central America (19.2% and 17.3%, respectively), Sub-Saharan Africa (17.7% and 25.5%, respectively), the Caribbean (13.0% and 10.9%, respectively), and South East Asia (10.4% and 11.2%, respectively).Nonmigrant travelers who had malaria diagnosed were most frequently exposed in Sub-Saharan Africa (88.6% and 95.9% during the early and later period, respectively) and VFRs (70.3% and 57.9%, respectively). Among VFRs with malaria, a majority did not receive pretravel health information (70.2% and 83.3%, respectively) or take malaria chemoprophylaxis (88.3% and 100%, respectively).Interpretation: Among ill U.S. travelers evaluated at U.S. GeoSentinel sites after travel, the majority were nonmigrant travelers who most frequently received a gastrointestinal disease diagnosis, implying that persons from the United States traveling internationally might be exposed to contaminated food and water. Migrants most frequently received diagnoses of conditions such as vitamin D deficiency and latent tuberculosis, which might result from adverse circumstances before and during migration (e.g., malnutrition and food insecurity, limited access to adequate sanitation and hygiene, and crowded housing,). Malaria was diagnosed in both migrants and nonmigrant travelers, and only a limited number reported taking malaria chemoprophylaxis, which might be attributed to both barriers to acquiring pretravel health care (especially for VFRs) and lack of prevention practices (e.g., insect repellant use) during travel. The number of ill travelers evaluated by U.S.GeoSentinel sites after travel decreased in 2020 and 2021 compared with previous years because of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated travel restrictions. GeoSentinel detected limited cases of COVID-19 and did not detect any sentinel cases early in the pandemic because of the lack of global diagnostic testing capacity.Public Health Action: The findings in this report describe the scope of health-related conditions that migrants and returning nonmigrant travelers to the United States acquired, illustrating risk for acquiring illnesses during travel. In addition, certain travelers do not seek pretravel health care, even when traveling to areas in which high-risk, preventable diseases are endemic. Health care professionals can aid international travelers by providing evaluations and destination-specific advice. Health care professionals should both foster trust and enhance pretravel prevention messaging for VFRs, a group known to have a higher incidence of serious diseases after travel (e.g., malaria and enteric fever). Health care professionals should continue to advocate for medical care in underserved populations (e.g., VFRs and migrants) to prevent disease progression, reactivation, and potential spread to and within vulnerable populations. Because both travel and infectious diseases evolve, public health professionals should explore ways to enhance the detection of emerging diseases that might not be captured by current surveillance systems that are not site based.

TI  - Deep learning-based building height mapping using Sentinel-1 and Sentienl-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mapping building height at a fine scale is crucial for comprehending urban systems. However, existing methods suffer from limitations such as coarse resolutions, long delays, and limited applicability for large-scale mapping. This challenge is particularly significant in China, where rapid urbanization has led to complex urban scenario. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that capitalizes on publicly available Sentinel-1/-2 and crowdsourced data. Our method employs a dual-branch structure building height estimation network (BHE-NET) and an improved multi-modal Selective-Kernel (MSK) module to fuse optical and SAR features. The validation results, derived from building height data across 63 cities, demonstrate strong performance with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.65 m. We further test the scalability of our approach by mapping three most developed urban agglomerations in China. In comparison with four recent studies, our method captures finer details of building height while mitigating the overestimation in urban high-density building clusters. Moreover, we further investigate the relationship between population and mean building height as well as the building volume at city level. Our work opens up new possibilities for producing fine-scale building height map of China at a 10-m resolution using remote sensing data.

TI  - Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease preceding primary central nervous system lymphoma: causality or coincidence?
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionPrimarycentral nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare extranodal lymphomatous malignancy that affects the brain, spinal cord, leptomeninges, or eyes, in the absence of systemic diffusion. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is a newly identified benign immune-mediated CNS inflammatory disorder with specific anti-MOG antibody seropositivity. These two seemingly unrelated nosological entities both have abundant clinical and radiological manifestations, and whether there is a potential link between them is unclear.Case reportWe describe a 49-year-old man who presented progressive headache, dizziness, and unsteady gait with multifocal scattered T2 hyperintensities with contrast enhancement. The serum anti-MOG antibody test was positive, and a brain biopsy showed inflammatory infiltration. Initially, he was diagnosed with MOGAD and his condition improved after corticosteroid therapy. The patient relapsed with exacerbation of symptoms and neuroimaging showed new mass-forming lesions four months later. A second brain biopsy confirmed PCNSL.DiscussionThis is the first report of histologically confirmed successive MOGAD and PCNSL. Our case broadens the phenotypic spectrum of sentinel lesions in PCNSL. Though rare, PCNSL should be considered in patients diagnosed with benign CNS inflammatory disorder and responding well to steroid treatment when their clinical symptoms worsen and the imaging deteriorates. A timely biopsy is critical for accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy.

TI  - Analysis of sediment from an irrigation dam in an agricultural valley impacted by the mega-drought in central Chile
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Chile has been affected since 2010 by an increasing mega-drought accompanied by a historically low precipitation rate, as a probable consequence of climate change. Additionally, the increasing pressure exerted by the withdrawals of human activities, such as agriculture and metal mining, promotes conditions of hydric scarcity. Despite this intensive use of the watersheds and the sustained and increasing aridity, it has not been explored whether an artificial sedimentary record can trace these changes in the agricultural valleys of the region. To unravel and evaluate the recent environmental/climatic variability, the effects of the mega-drought that has pertained since 2010, extractivist pressures on a Mediterranean valley in central Chile, and sediment records were obtained from an irrigation dam and studied through a multi-proxy analysis. The dam was built and has been in operation since 1975 and is located in the Aconcagua River Valley, Valparaiso, Chile. Magnetic properties, carbon content, mineral composition, and metal content were analyzed from sediments of a 120 cm long core. Changes in vegetation cover from 1990 to 2020 were analyzed through NDVI filters. Horizons associated with drier conditions were observed in the upper zone of the core, which corresponded from the year 2001 to the present, assuming a constant sedimentation rate of 2.72 cm & BULL;yr(-1). Additionally, the characteristic alternation of dry-wet conditions was observed in the deep horizon of the dam sediments. The concentrations of Cu, Pb, Al, and As have increased over the years, while the concentration of Mo has decreased. Some of these elements are associated with copper mining, existing in the valley. Analysis of Landsat images from the year 2000 to the present has identified a significant decrease in vegetation cover associated with dry/wet periods, which may be related to cycles of El Nino/La Nina events. Although not all the proxies analyzed were sensitive enough to detect changes at the desired resolution, since the dam is very recent, the results shed light on the effects of the interaction between industrial activities and the decrease of water availability in multiple-use watersheds, suggesting variations in metals concentrations and changes in water availability, probably promoted by anthropic activities, climatic events, and increasing aridity in the Aconcagua River Valley.

TI  - Comparisons between temporal statistical metrics, time series stacks and phenological features derived from NASA Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 data for crop type mapping
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectrotemporal features that capture changes in reflectance over time are useful for characterizing the land cover of highly dynamic crops. Currently, temporal statistical metrics, time series stacks and phenological features are the three spectrotemporal features commonly used in crop type mapping. The three types of features differ in their calculation methods and physical implications. However, there has been limited investigation on the performance comparisons between them for crop type mapping. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the three features derived from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) data for crop type mapping. The HLS data were first pre-processed with cloud masking, temporal compositing and gap filling to create the gap-free time series for extracting the three spectrotemporal features. Crop reference data were obtained through a field survey conducted over a study area of 14.5 km by 8 km near College Station, Texas, USA. For the calibration of the Random Forest (RF) classification model with different sets of spectrotemporal features, 30% of the total reference data were used, and the remaining 70% were used for quantitative accuracy assessment. Results showed that although all three spectrotemporal features yielded accurate crop type maps, time series stacks performed better in crop classification with an overall accuracy (OA) of 96.62% and Kappa of 0.95, compared to temporal statistical metrics (OA of 92.19% and Kappa of 0.88) and phenological features (OA of 90.87% and Kappa of 0.86). In addition, time series stacks outperformed temporal statistical metrics and phenological features for all individual crop types mapped in terms of user's accuracy, producer's accuracy and F1-score. Moreover, the effects of temporal density, interval and depth on time series stacks were analyzed. The analysis suggested that the optimal crop mapping results for time series stacks were achieved using the monthly composites of the combined Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data from March to October. Supplementary experiments conducted in two additional areas confirmed the consistency of the results from this study, thereby demonstrating the scalability of the methods used. This research provides valuable insights into spectrotemporal feature selection and optimization for accurate crop type mapping. And finally, a new webbased application named "Crop Mapper" was developed with Google Earth Engine to facilitate the availability of crop type maps derived from monthly gap-free Landsat Sentinel-2 time series for the areas once the training samples were available.

TI  - Modern Changes of the Urban Heat Island in Moscow
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the meteorological network data for the period of 1991-2020, as well as the radiometric measurements of the surface temperature T-S of Moscow region by the Terra and Aqua satellites over the period of 2000-2020, the daily course and long-term changes in the urban heat island (UHI) of Moscow in the field of both air temperature T at a height of 2 m and T-S are studied. For the analysis of T-S, 1379 satellite images over 21 years in clear and slightly cloudy sky, when UHI analysis is possible, are selected. The average annual values of T-S were obtained using their normalization by separate seasons. The daily course of Moscow UHI in the air is weakly expressed, especially when compared with the rural area not only of the city center, but also of its entire area: only the weakening of this phenomenon in fall and in the prewinter season (from October to December) is reliable. According to the satellite data, the surface UHI is marked by a maximum in June-July with the strongest vegetation development and a minimum in fall when leaves fall, with intermediate values in winter and spring. The rapid growth of T took place in 1991-2020 both in Moscow and in rural areas at approximately the same speed. As a result, there have been no statistically significant directional changes in the UHI intensity both in the air and on the surface as a whole over the past 20-30 years. The likely reasons for the general stabilization of the UHI in Moscow are both natural and socio-economic factors: the approximate constancy of the probability of clear weather (which contributes to intensification of this phenomenon) and the biomass in the region (which determines heat losses due to transpiration), deceleration and cessation of the growth of the population and energy consumption of the city, and deindustrialization. Additional reasons are the gradual relocation of residents to the new outskirts of Moscow, as well as quarantine restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

TI  - Streamflow and flood prediction in Rwanda using machine learning and remote sensing in support of rural first-mile transport connectivity
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding, an increasing risk in Rwanda, tends to isolate and restrict the mobility of rural communities. In this work, we developed a streamflow model to determine whether floods and rainfall anomalies explain variations in rural trail bridge use, as directly measured by in-situ motion-activated digital cameras. Flooding data and river flows upon which our investigation relies are not readily available because most of the rivers that are the focus of this study are ungauged. We developed a streamflow model for these rivers by exploring the performance of process-based and machine learning models. We then selected the best model to estimate streamflow at each bridge site to enable an investigation of the associations between weather events and pedestrian volumes collected from motion-activated cameras. The Gradient Boosting Machine model (GBM) had the highest skill with a Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) score of 0.79 followed by the Random Forest model (RFM) and the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with KGE scores of 0.73 and 0.66, respectively. The physically-based Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC) had a KGE score of 0.07. At the 50% flow exceedance threshold, the GBM model predicted 90% of flood events reported between 2013 and 2022. We found moderate to strong positive correlations between total monthly crossings and the total number of flood events at four of the seven bridge sites (r = 0.36-0.84), and moderate negative correlations at the remaining bridge sites (r = -0.33- -0.53). Correlation with monthly rainfall was generally moderate to high with one bridge site showing no correlation and the rest having correlations ranging between 0.15-0.76. These results reveal an association between weather events and mobility and support the scaling up of the trail bridge program to mitigate flood risks. The paper concludes with recommendations for the improvement of streamflow and flood prediction in Rwanda in support of community-based flood early warning systems connected to trail bridges.

TI  - Unsupervised learning framework for region-based damage assessment on xBD, a large satellite imagery
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Population-based damage assessment is crucial for providing timely aid in case of natural hazards such as floods, tsunami, and hurricanes. One of the quickest methods to do this task is to employ remote sensing data and observe the damage. Most of the previous works have restricted themselves to damage detection and classification with respect to buildings. However, no framework exists that makes a conclusion about the overall damage done in an area affected by the hazard. In this work, we present an unsupervised density-based clustering algorithm that automatically makes spatial groups of affected regions and assigns the label based on the degree of damage to the region. The algorithm automatically selects the optimum number of clusters based on the spatial distribution of the data and works well with any shape of the hazard-affected region. The demographic estimate for the affected region is then presented based on the area of the region and the census data. The navigation information is provided with aid of Google Maps depicting the overall damage along with possibility of transportation. For evaluation of the framework, we employ xBD which is the largest annotated building damage classified data set till date. The results correctly identify the regions and perform extremely well on the silhouette score and the DB index.

TI  - The use of honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) as biological monitors for pathogenic bacteria and antimicrobial resistance: A systematic review*
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - The phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasingly real and relevant health problem. It is essential to verify the spread of this phenomenon in the environment. The European honey bee, Apis mellifera L., is a globally managed pollinator continuously used for biomonitoring thanks to its morphological and behavioural characteristics. During their foraging activities, a large number of honey bees move in the area surrounding the hive within a 1.5 km of radius. Besides, their body covered with hair and bristles are able to intercept pollen and minute particles, such as atmospheric particles, contaminants and microorganisms. For these reasons, A. mellifera L. is widely used as an environmental sentinel, especially for detecting pollutants, pesticides, microorganisms, and AMR. This systematic review aimed to collect and summarize the role of honey bee colonies as a biological monitor of AMR pathogenic bacteria and the environmental spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). From honey bees were isolated a wide range of pathogenic and environmental bacteria strains, harbouring AMR and ARGs. However, AMR and ARGs were detected not only in environmental bacteria but also in symbiotic bacteria colonizing the bee gut. This systematic review highlights the employment of potential use of honey bees as AMR sentinel helpful for ecosystem health to implement possible control measures for humans, animals and plants, in the context of the "One-Health" approach.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Pre-launch simulated satellite data are useful to develop retrieval algorithms and to facilitate the rapid release of retrieval products after launch. Here we introduce the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) EarthCARE synthetic data based on simulations using a 3.5 kmhorizontal-mesh global storm-resolving model. Global aerosol transportsimulation results are added for aerosol retrieval developers. Syntheticdata were produced corresponding to the four EarthCARE instrument sensors,namely a 94 GHz cloud-profiling radar (CPR), a 355 nm atmospheric lidar(ATLID), a seven-channel multispectral imager (MSI), and a broadbandradiometer (BBR). JAXA EarthCARE synthetic data include a standard productwith data for two orbits and a research product with shorter frames and moredetailed instrument settings. In the research products, random errors in theCPR are considered based on the observation window, and noise in ATLIDsignals are added using a noise simulator. We consider the spectralmisalignment effect of the visible and near-infrared MSI channels based onresponse functions depending on the angle from the nadir. We introduce plansfor updating the JAXA EarthCARE synthetic data using large eddy simulationmodel data and the implementation of a three-dimensional radiation model.The JAXA EarthCARE synthetic data are available publicly.

TI  - Evaluating how well active fault mapping predicts earthquake surface-rupture locations
T2  - GEOSPHERE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Earthquake surface-fault rupture location uncertainty is a key factor in fault displacement hazard analysis and informs hazard and risk mitigation strategies. Geologists often predict future rupture locations from fault map-ping based on the geomorphology interpreted from remote-sensing data sets. However, surface processes can obscure fault location, fault traces may be mapped in error, and a future rupture may not break every fault trace. We assessed how well geomorphology-based fault mapping predicted surface ruptures for seven earthquakes: 1983 M 6.9 Borah Peak, 2004 M 6.0 Parkfield, 2010 M 7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah, 2011 M 6.7 Fukushima-Hamadori, 2014 M 6.0 South Napa, 2016 M 7.8 Kaikoura, and 2016 M 7 Kumamoto. We trained geo-science students to produce active fault maps using topography and imagery acquired before the earthquakes. A geologic professional completed a "con-trol" map. Mappers used a new "geomorphic indicator ranking" approach to rank fault confidence based on geomorphologic landforms. We determined the accuracy of the mapped faults by comparing the fault maps to published rupture maps. We defined predicted ruptures as ruptures near a fault (50-200 m, depending on the fault confidence) that interacted with the landscape in a similar way to the fault. The mapped faults predicted between 12% to 68% of the principal rupture length for the studied earthquakes. The median sep-aration distances between predicted ruptures and strong, distinct, or weak faults were 15-30 m. Our work highlights that mapping future fault ruptures is an underappreciated challenge of fault displacement hazard analysis-even for experts-with implications for risk management, engineering site assess-ments, and fault exclusion zones.

TI  - Decoupling in the vertical shape of HCHO during a sea breeze event: The effect on trace gas satellite retrievals and column-to-surface translation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of sea breeze circulation on stratification of the vertical formaldehyde (HCHO) concentration vertical profiles is explored using a regional atmospheric chemical transport model (CTM) for three synoptically stagnant days focused on the east coast of the U.S in June 2018. During this event, a significant thermal contrast between the Atlantic Ocean and the terrestrial regions (12-17 degrees C), observed by moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and well-captured by the WRF-CMAQ model (15-18 degrees C), is conducive to monsoon-like flow, perpendicular to the shorelines, carrying clean marine air masses over the land within a few hundreds of meters above the surface. In contrast, the westerly continental polluted air masses prevail in higher altitudes. These two conflicting flows result in atypical vertical shapes of HCHO concentrations increasing with altitude. This decoupling pattern is so pronounced that we observe total column HCHO negatively correlate with surface concentrations. Comparisons of an accredited global model, GEOS-CF, to surface wind measurements and MODIS skin temperature indicate its poor representation of the sea breeze timing and strength, resulting in GEOS-CF HCHO vertical shapes being drastically different from the WRF-CMAQ. Based on radiative transfer calculations, the differences in the vertical distribution of HCHO between the WRF-CMAQ and that of GEOS-CF in the first 3 km are sufficient to induce a 20-30% error in air mass factors (thus total vertical HCHO column abundances). Through an experiment involving converting HCHO total columns to surface mixing ratios, we demonstrate that GEOS-CF allocates noticeably more HCHO molecules (40-150%) to the surface layer due to the misrepresentation of the vertical shape of HCHO during the sea breeze event. It is known that a significant fraction of the human population lives in coastal areas prone to detrimental effects caused by air pollution, and elevated pollutant concentrations usually occur in synoptically stagnant atmospheric conditions when local circulation patterns come into play; accordingly, our experiments emphasize the importance of the effect a priori profiles can have on satellite-derived applications under such conditions. To ensure that the quantitative representation of satellite-based trace gas retrievals on a daily basis is trustworthy and useable for air quality applications, atmospheric models providing a priori profiles for satellite retrievals should be welltuned to reproduce complex local circulation such as sea-land breezes.

TI  - Case report: Vulval sebaceous carcinoma: a report of two cases and literature review focus on treatment and survival
T2  - PATHOLOGY & ONCOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Extraocular sebaceous carcinoma (SC) arising in the vulva is extremely rare that no treatment consensus has been well-defined.Case presentation: We here presented two cases of vulval SC in a 31-year-old and a 62-year-old woman, respectively. Radical wide local excision was performed with free margin and they received no postoperative adjuvant therapy. No evidence of disease was detected after follow-ups for 12 months and 49 months, respectively. A comprehensive literature review of vulval SC was further conducted and other ten cases were included. The mean age was 55.9 years, nine patients were diagnosed with FIGO stage I diseases while the remaining three patients had metastatic lesions at initial diagnosis. Surgery was the mainstay treatment option that 11 (91.7%) underwent surgical resection, of which 5 patients received inguinal lymphadenectomy and 2 patients showed lymph nodes involved. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy were given in 2 and 1 patient, respectively. Two patients experienced recurrence within 1 year after initial therapy. At the final follow-up, ten patients had no evidence of disease, one patient was alive with the disease, and only one died of the disease.Conclusion: Radical wide local excision may be preferred in early-stage vulval SC and utilization of sentinel lymph node sampling should be recommended. Postoperative adjuvant therapy may be spared in patients with negative surgical margin and absence of lymph node involvement. Treatment of vulval SC referring to the guidelines of vulvar cancer should be administered in case of positive margins or metastatic disease.

TI  - Improved estimation of aboveground biomass of regional coniferous forests integrating UAV-LiDAR strip data, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imageries
T2  - PLANT METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundForest aboveground biomass (AGB) is not only the basis for estimating forest carbon storage, but also an important parameter for evaluating forest carbon cycle contribution and forest ecological function. Data saturation and fewer field plots limit the accuracy of AGB estimation. In response to these questions, we constructed a point-line-polygon framework for regional coniferous forests AGB mapping using field survey data, UAV-LiDAR strip data, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imageries in this study. Under this framework, we explored the feasibility of acquiring the LiDAR sampling plots using the LiDAR sampling strategy consistent with the field survey, and analyzed the potentials of multi-scale wavelet transform (WT) textures and tree species stratification for improving AGB estimation accuracy of coniferous forests in North China.ResultsThe results showed that UAV-LiDAR strip data of high density point clouds could be used as a sampling tool to achieve sample amplification. Experimental comparison results showed that the Sentinel-based AGB estimation models incorporating the multi-scale WT textures and SAR data performed better, and the model based on coniferous forests tree species significantly improved the performance of AGB estimation. Additionally, the accuracy comparison using different validation sets indicated that the proposed LiDAR sampling strategy under the point-line-polygon framework was suitable for estimating coniferous forests AGB on a large area. The highest accuracy of AGB estimation of larch, Chinese pine and all coniferous forests was 74.55%, 78.96%, and 73.42%, respectively.ConclusionsThe proposed approach can successfully alleviate the data signal saturation issue and accurately produce a large-scale wall-to-wall high-resolution AGB map by integrating optical and SAR data with a relative small number of field plots.

TI  - Spatiotemporal networks for ENSO forecasting with LICOM3 and remote sensing data
T2  - ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a complex coupled ocean-atmosphere event, usually manifested as an abnormal increase or decrease in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. ENSO is one of the critical factors causing global climate extremes and ecosystem turbulence. Therefore, long-term robust ENSO predictions are essential for people's productive life and social development. The statistical and dynamic models still face challenges in making long-lead-time ENSO forecasts, and the accuracy can be improved. Here, we have created three innovative efforts for ENSO forecasting: (1) To compensate for the lack of Remote Sensing (RSS) dataset, we apply transfer learning with the large SST dataset simulated from the LASG/IAP Climate Ocean Model Version 3 (LICOM3). (2) We propose a novel encoder-decoder structure with multiple Spatiotemporal prediction units (ST-Pred) named ED-PredRNN. The ST-Pred changes the original transfer direction by adding spatiotemporal memory cells, allowing the model to extract more information. (3) To reduce the memory bandwidth load, we use FP32 and FP16 mixed-precision computing methods to improve model training and inference speed.The result shows that during 2011-2020 verification period, the correlation skills of the Nino 3.4 index predicted by ED-PredRNN are over 0.77/0.64/0.53 within the lead time of 6/12/18 months respectively, which is superior to existing statistical models. Also, the precise predictions of the El Nino event (such as 2015/16) and the La Nina event (such as 2010/11), as well as a reasonable forecast for neutral ENSO conditions (2014), demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed model.

TI  - Volcanic evolution through geomorphological mapping: A case study of Cerro Bravo volcano (Colombia)
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Geomorphological mapping is essential for identifying landforms, determining erosion, and reconstructing the morphological evolution over time. The relative chronology between features can be established, supporting the study of the potential hazard and associated risks in volcanic terrains. Geomorphological analysis, performed on a 12.5 m ALOS PALSAR DEM, along with field-work and new K-Ar geochronological data, help to clarify the overall evolution of the Cerro Bravo volcano. The observed north-south arrangement of the craters, the stratigraphic relationships, and the new K-Ar ages reveal that the volcanic activity migrated towards the north, with the younger activity concentrated north of the volcanic area. This evolution, which occurred from the Middle Pleistocene to the Holocene, is evidenced by four consecutive semicircular crater-like structures associated with four building stages. Effusive and explosive activity was observed in all recorded volcanic activity stages, indicating a consistent volcanological behavior of this volcano over time, characterized by a bimodal effusiveexplosive eruption style. The effusive activity involved lava domes and lava flows, while the explosive activity included dome collapses and Plinian eruptions. This morphological study can help assess the geological risk and potential hazards of inaccessible areas.

TI  - Prevalence of Neck Pain in Soldiers as a Result of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury-Associated Trauma
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Introduction Many of the injury mechanisms that cause mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) also create forces commonly associated with whiplash, resulting in cervical pain injury. The prevalence of associated neck pain with mTBI is not well established. There is a strong indication that injury to the cervical spine may aggravate, cause, and/or impact recovery of symptoms and impairments associated with the concussive event and its primary effect on the brain. The purpose of this study is to help identify the prevalence of ensuing cervical pain within 90 days of a previously documented mTBI and to examine the role of neck pain during concurrent concussive symptoms, in a military population stationed at a large military installation. Materials and Methods This retrospective design utilized a de-identified dataset using predetermined search and filter criteria, which included male active duty service members (SMs), 20 to 45 years of age, who received medical care at any clinic on Fort Liberty (Fort Bragg, NC) during fiscal year (FY) 2012 to FY 2019, with documented cervicalgia and mTBI (via the International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revision, Clinical Modification codes), verified using electronic medical records. The final dataset served as the basis for subject sampling and was analyzed to determine the total number of documented cervicalgia and mTBI diagnoses. Results are presented as descriptive statistics. Approval for this study was received from the Andrews University Office of Research (18-097) and the Womack Army Medical Center Human Protections Office. Results Between FY 2012 and FY 2019, 14,352 unique SMs accessed a Fort Bragg, NC health care facility, at least once (). Overall, 52% of SMs diagnosed with cervicalgia were found to have a previously diagnosed mTBI during the 90 days before the cervicalgia diagnosis. In contrast, the prevalence of same-day cervicalgia and mTBI diagnosis was <1% (). The prevalence of isolated cervicalgia diagnosis at any time during the reporting period was 3%, whereas isolated mTBI diagnosis was 1% (). Conclusions Over 50% of SMs diagnosed with cervicalgia had sustained a documented mTBI within 90 days prior, whereas less than 1% were diagnosed with cervicalgia at the time of initial primary care or emergency room encounter following the mTBI event. This finding suggests that the close anatomical and neurophysiological connections between the head and the cervical spine are both likely to be impacted through the same mechanism of injury. Delayed evaluation (and treatment) of the cervical spine may contribute to lingering post-concussive symptoms. Limitations of this retrospective review include the inability to assess the causality of the relationship between neck pain and mTBI, as only the existence and strength of the prevalence relationship can be identified. The outcome data are exploratory and intended to identify relationships and trends that may suggest further study across installations and across mTBI populations.

TI  - Evaluation of the physicochemical quality and antimicrobial performance of amoxicillin and amoxicillin
T2  - RESULTS IN CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Antibiotic discs used in medical analysis laboratories are sourced from multiple manufacturers and suppliers and must meet stringent quality requirements. This study aimed to assess the quality and performance of amoxicillin and amoxicillin + clavulanic acid discs used in Burkina Faso. An evaluation of the use of antibiotic discs was initially conducted in the 20 sentinel laboratories for antimicrobial resistance surveillance in Burkina Faso. Then, various brands of amoxicillin and amoxicillin + clavulanic acid discs samples were collected from medical laboratories and local distributors. Quality control tests (identification and assay) were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography according to the validated method adapted from the USP monograph. The performance of the discs was assessed by testing their efficacy against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 strains. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 were resistant to 30% of amoxicillin + clavulanic acid discs and to 55.6% of amoxicillin discs collected. In addition, only 22.2% and 45.5% of amoxicillin and amoxicillin + clavulanic acid discs tested met the specifi-cations for amoxicillin contents. No brand of amoxicillin + clavulanic acid discs collected met the specifications for clavulanic acid content. Extending this study to a larger number of antibiotics would enable better docu-mentation of the antibiotic disc quality..

TI  - Quantifying radiation in the axillary bed at the site of lymphedema surgical prevention
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeImmediate lymphatic reconstruction (ILR) is a procedure known to reduce the risk of lymphedema in patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). However, patients who receive adjuvant radiotherapy are at increased risk of lymphedema. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent of radiation at the site of surgical prevention.MethodsWe recently began deploying clips at the site of ILR to identify the site during radiation planning. A retrospective review was performed to identify breast cancer patients who underwent ILR with clip deployment and adjuvant radiation therapy from October 2020 to April 2022. Patients were excluded if they had not completed radiotherapy. The exposure and dose of radiation received by the site was determined and recorded.ResultsIn a cohort of 11 patients, the site fell within the radiation field in 7 patients (64%) and received a median dose of 4280 cGy. Among these 7 patients, 3 had sites located within tissue considered at risk of oncologic recurrence and the remaining 4 sites received radiation from a tangential field treating the breast or chest wall. The median dose to the ILR site for the 4 patients whose sites were outside the radiation fields was 233 cGy.ConclusionOur findings suggest that even when the site of surgical prevention was not within the targeted radiation field during treatment planning, it remains susceptible to radiation. Strategies for limiting radiation at this site are needed.

TI  - Coastal erosion in temperate barriers: an anthropized sandy beach in Buenos Aires, Argentina
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal erosion is a common issue in urbanized areas located on sandy barriers in Latin America, making them highly vulnerable to both natural and human induced disasters. This pose a significant threat to the long-term sustainability of these coastal systems. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the medium-term shoreline evolution of a highly-anthropized beach sector located within a coastal barrier system of Buenos Aires, Argentina. For this purpose, a geospatial analysis based on aerial imagery and high-resolution satellite data was conducted for the 1965-2021 period. Additionally, the study aimed to identify critical erosive sectors and to provide estimations for the near-future shoreline evolution of these beaches. The results showed contrasting patterns, with sectors presenting shoreline retreat rates up to 0.7 m/yr while others demonstrated accretion rates exceeding 0.6 m/yr. Despite these along-shore variations in erosion/accretion balances, more than 70% of the shoreline presented an erosional trend for the studied period. This led to the identification of an erosional hot spot covering 30% of the urbanized waterfront. Furthermore, the 2030 forecast suggests that a highly urbanized beach sector could suffer a shoreline retreat of about 20 m. These results could be directly linked to the historical land use/land cover changes, mainly related to dune stabilization processes and to the implantation of urban surfaces. At this point, erosive patterns could be mainly caused by local cross-shore imbalances due to these anthropogenic disturbances. It is expected that the results of the present study will serve as a basis for coastal management policies, and the proposed method will be a useful tool for assessing coastal erosion hazard.

TI  - Global evaluation of simulated surface shortwave radiation in CMIP6 models
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface solar radiation (SSR) is the main energy source of Earth system, and has direct influence on climate change, the hydrological cycle, and the development of renewable energy technologies. In this study, we compared simulated monthly SSR profiles generated from 62 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models against natural SSR observational data collected at 226 GEBA sites during 1990-2014. The accuracy with which CMIP6 models simulated spatial features of SSR was further assessed using ISCCP-ITP satellite data. Our results show that most CMIP6 models overestimate the monthly SSR averaged over all GEBA sites, with an averaged mean bias error (MBE) of approximately 7.8 W/m2. The root mean square error (RMSE) for individual models ranged from 26 to 38 W/m2, and the RMSE for their ensemble mean decreased by an average of 8.1 W/m2. Averaging of the multi-model ensemble led to a significant improvement in the correlation coefficient, which increased from 0.90 to 0.96. Ground-based data showed that the accuracy and annual trend for the CMIP6 multi-model mean (MMM) simulations were more accurate than any individual model. The spatial distribution of CMIP6 MMM multi-year average SSR values agrees well with ISCCP-ITP satellite data retrievals; however, the overall model performance is overestimated in most locations on Earth (e.g., the southern Sahara Desert, the land along the Mediterranean Sea, and the Yangtze River Delta plain), but underestimated in some others (e.g., the Rocky Mountains, the Andes Mountains, Indonesia). The results of this study will allow more accurate predictions to be made of future SSR data produced by CMIP6 models.

TI  - Potential of Using Machine Learning Regression Techniques to Utilize Sentinel Images for Bathymetry Mapping of Nile River
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the potential of using the Sentinel-2 images for deriving bathymetric maps for the Nile River in Egypt. Regression analysis technique with the aid of in situ measurements were used. Exploring the effects of the size of calibration data, and water depth is another aim of this paper. Linear and machine learning regression techniques (Fine Decision Tree (FDT), and Random Forest (RF) Algorithms) are investigated. The study area is about 23 km between Assiut and Delta barrages. Around 82,000 depth points, are available. Regression models are developed using the depth data and the corresponding digital values of the 13 Sentinel-2 imagery bands. The linear regression model was not applicable (R2 = 0.02). The FDT, and RF models, have (R2 = 0.86) when half of the depth points were used for calibration, and the RMSE of the testing data (the other half of the depth points) equaled to 2.86 and 2.09 m, respectively. When fewer points were used for calibration, the R2 = 0.83 and 0.84, and RMSE = 2.65 and 2.19 m, for FDT and RF, respectively. When only the shallow water areas were considered, the RMSE reached 1.51 and 1.30 m for the FDT and RF, respectively. The VNIR bans of Sentinel-2 images are not enough to estimate the water depth of the Nile river. Collecting in situ measurements for small areas, is adequate for estimating the water depth and produces bathymetry maps for the Nile River in Egypt, and larger in situ measurements are not required. & COPY; 2023 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Catastrophic rhabdomyolysis following breast reconstruction operation using an abdominal flap: a case report
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially fatal clinical syndrome resulting from the damage or breakdown of skeletal muscle, which can also lead to permanent disabilities. Based on our review of studies on rhabdomyolysis after prolonged surgeries, no other cases of rhabdomyolysis caused by muscle injury in the buttock area following breast reconstruction have been reported, making the current report the first to share information related to patient conditions and treatment progress in such cases.Case Description: Here, we present the case of a 57-year-old Asian patient with left breast cancer. We performed immediate breast reconstruction using a deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap anastomosed to the internal mammary vessels after a skin-sparing mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy. The surgery exceeded the estimated time because, after anastomosis, severe congestion was observed in the flap and because of the need to perform re-anastomosis and the reconstruction of the internal mammary vein twice. The surgical team eventually re-performed the breast reconstruction using a contralateral pedicled transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap. The patient underwent breast reconstruction in a sitting position to ensure a symmetrical and natural breast shape resembling its original state. Additionally, a brown splint was placed underneath both legs to keep the hip and knees flexed to ensure donor-site closure when using an abdominal-based flap The Patient was closely monitored in the early postoperative period. On postoperative day (POD) 3, patient developed hypotension and was deemed to have experienced a hypovolemic shock. A complete laboratory workup was performed, and a rhabdomyolysis diagnosis was made based on the laboratory results. We believe that rhabdomyolysis resulted from prolonged pressure on the large gluteus maximus muscle located below the site of the pressure sore in the present patient.Conclusions: Postoperative rhabdomyolysis often results from prolonged surgery. Given the possibility of prolonged procedure time in patients undergoing breast reconstruction, the current case emphasizes the need to identify each patient's risk factors for rhabdomyolysis and prepare for possible rhabdomyolysis to prevent ischemic injuries and reduce the risk of complications such as hypovolemic shock.

TI  - Morusin shows potent antitumor activity for melanoma through apoptosis induction and proliferation inhibition
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe discovery of new anti-melanoma drugs with low side effect is urgently required in the clinic. Recent studies showed that morusin, a flavonoid compound isolated from the root bark of Morus Alba, has the potential to treat multiple types of cancers, including breast cancer, gastric cancer, and prostate cancer. However, the anti-cancer effect of morusin on melanoma cells has not been investigated.MethodsWe analyzed the effects of morusin on the proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, cell migration and invasion ability of melanoma cells A375 and MV3, and further explored the effects of morusin on tumor formation of melanoma cell. Finally, the effects of morusin on the proliferation, cycle, apoptosis, migration and invasion of A375 cells after knockdown of p53 were detected.ResultsMorusin effectively inhibits the proliferation of melanoma cells and induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Consistently, CyclinB1 and CDK1 that involved in the G2/M phase transition were down-regulated upon morusin treatment, which may be caused by the up-regulation of p53 and p21. In addition, morusin induces cell apoptosis and inhibits migration of melanoma cells, which correlated with the changes in the expression of the associated molecules including PARP, Caspase3, E-Cadherin and Vimentin. Moreover, morusin inhibits tumor growth in vivo with little side effect on the tumor-burden mice. Finally, p53 knockdown partially reversed morusin-mediated cell proliferation inhibition, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and metastasis.ConclusionCollectively, our study expanded the spectrum of the anti-cancer activity of morusin and guaranteed the clinical use of the drug for melanoma treatment.

TI  - Impact of extreme climatic events on the total suspended matter concentrations in coastal waters using OceanSat-2 observations
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in rainfall and associated erosion levels on the land are the main factor that determines seasonal shifts in coastal ocean color variables. Extreme climate and weather events such as floods and rainfall induced land-slides can cause significant impact on water quality property in coastal areas. Studies showing quantitative variability of total suspended matter (TSM) in coastal waters in response to extreme rainfall events are rarely attempted due to the lack of observational and cloud free satellite data products. Here, we investigate the effects of extreme floods that occurred during 14-19 August 2018 in the Western Ghats, and their impacts on TSM concentrations in coastal waters by analyzing OceanSat-2 images. Our results show that the TSM level during the flood stages was more than twice that of normal periods. The excess amount of sediment load from terrigenous sources transported through the rivers has impacted in high TSM concentrations (>23 mg/l) in the coastal waters as compared to normal conditions (<10 mg/l). Furthermore, we noticed that the strong wind mixing and its directionality had a significant impact on resuspension of TSM distributions and their dispersal pathways in Kerala coast.

TI  - The response of the brood pouch transcriptome to synthetic estrogen exposure in the Gulf pipefish (<i>Syngnathus scovelli</i>)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Endocrine disruptors have devastating impacts on the reproductive physiology of aquatic organisms. The Gulf pipefish, Syngnathus scovelli, is a sexually dimorphic species, which demonstrates predictable morphological, physiological, behavioral, and genetic responses to synthetic estrogen exposure. It has a broad geographic range, spanning freshwater and marine environments, making it a potential sentinel species across a wide range of habitats. In this study, we investigated the effects of ecologically relevant levels of 17 & alpha;-ethinylestradiol (EE2) exposure on gene expression patterns in the male pipefish's brood pouch. We also characterized the extent to which EE2-exposed males developed coloration patterns that are normally restricted to females. We identified differentially expressed genes in the brood pouches of pregnant and non-pregnant males when males were exposed to 5ng/L EE2 from the second to eighth day of pregnancy (which normally lasts about 2 weeks). Our result revealed several potential candidate genes that have a role in the brood pouch's response to environmental estrogens. We also identified genes that were differentially expressed between mid-gestation pregnant males and non-pregnant males. We found an overall greater effect of EE2 exposure in the transcriptomes of non-pregnant males, which may explain why estrogen-exposed males exhibited difficulty receiving eggs in previous studies. The offspring developed similarly in the control and estrogen treatments, highlighting a potential link between the timing of EE2 exposure and its effects on male pregnancy. These results provide insight into how breeding pipefish populations may still exist even though they are found in freshwater and coastal locations where they are periodically exposed to potentially high concentrations of endocrine-disrupting compounds. We also present examples of female-typical coloration development on males due to EE2 exposure and identify candidate brood pouch genes that can be utilized as biomarkers, contributing to the development of the Gulf pipefish as a sentinel model for ecotoxicology.

TI  - Satellite-based electron density background definition at mid-latitudes and comparison with IRI-2016 model under different solar conditions
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A new method to define a background for the ionospheric electron density (Ne) is proposed, making use of mid-latitude measurements under different solar conditions from the Langmuir Probes onboard CHAMP and three identical Swarm satellites. In particular, CHAMP measurements during the years 2004 and 2009, and Swarm observations during 2016 and 2017 have been considered in the 15 & DEG;-wide latitudinal belt from 35 & DEG;N to 50 & DEG;N, and from 0 & DEG; to 360 & DEG; in longitude. CHAMP/Swarm in-situ Ne measurements have been then used to check and compare this new defined background with the one computed directly from IRI-2016 Ne output at satellite altitude. The distributions of the relative deviations between the two backgrounds, and of positive and negative anomalies (i.e., Ne variations from each background greater than 30%) with respect to the geomagnetic activity levels have been evaluated under each investigated condition, namely year/satellite, season, night-time or noon hours. Results of this comparison highlight a general overestimation of Ne from IRI during noon hours, while a better agreement between the two backgrounds is found during night-time. However, an underestimation of IRI with respect to Swarm-derived background is found for 2017 data. Finally, the analysis of 2004 plasma data suggests that the IRI2016 model can be used as a background during periods characterized by high levels of geomagnetic activity. Due to the difficulties to construct a background for satellite data, the proposed method can be considered an useful tool for analyses of electron density varia & COPY; 2023 COSPAR.

TI  - Automatic built-up area extraction by feature-level fusion of Luojia 1-01 nighttime light and Sentinel satellite imageries in Google Earth Engine
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, with the non-stop expansion of urbanization, mapping urban areas and monitoring their dynamic changes have become challenges for governments and also a hot topic for researchers. Remote sensing imageries play a key role in urban studies, the extraction of urban built-up areas, and monitoring their changes. A variety of studies have proposed methods for the extraction of regional, national, and global built-up areas. However, the majority of them used limited features and applied a manual sample selection strategy for classification, leading to time-consuming and low-efficient algorithms. This paper proposes a fully automatic procedure to real-time extract built-up areas by integrating the Luojia 1-01 nighttime lights (NTL) images, Sentinel-2 multispectral data, Sentinel-1 Radar images, and SRTM elevation data in cloud-computing Google Earth Engine. Firstly, potential built-up areas (PBA) and non-built-up areas (NBA) are obtained by applying Otsu and multi-level thresholding to some of the extracted spectral-textural-spatial (STS) features and by applying logical rules. Secondly, built-up and non-built-up samples are automatically selected and are used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised classifier and to classify the hybrid feature set so that a preliminary classified map (PCM) can be obtained. Thirdly, the PCMs are automatically corrected using the non-built-up area, and morphological operations in the so-called post-classification to provide a refined classified map (RCM) and final built-up map. Four study areas in Northern America, Europe (Scandinavia), the Middle East, and Eastern Asia were selected to test the proposed method. Also, five state-of-the-art built-up products, accompanied by Google Earth images, were used as the reference data. The results indicate that the proposed method can accurately and automatically select samples and map built-up areas with a spatial resolution of 10 m. Its performance is validated with an average overall accuracy of 94.4% and an average Kappa coefficient of 0.89 and by visual comparison of our method results with other reference data. The proposed method has significant potential to be used in real-time extracting built-up areas and in monitoring their dynamic changes on national & COPY; 2023 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Intestinal parasitic infections in a community from Pampa del Indio, Chaco (Argentina) and their association with socioeconomic and environmental factors
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Neglected tropical diseases are a group of 20 disabling diseases, which, in particular, are the most common chronic infections in the most vulnerable people. This study aimed to characterize the infection by intestinal parasites (IPs) in dwellings from a peri-urban neighborhood in Pampa del Indio, Chaco (Argentina), and its association with socioeconomic and environmental variables. Single stool samples were collected from all individuals older than 1 year through household visits and processed using coprological sedimentation and flotation techniques. Standardized questionnaires were used at the household level to collect socio-economic information. Environmental variables were obtained from the Planetscope image, Landsat 8 images and remote sensors, while land-use layers were obtained through the use of a maximum likelihood algorithm. Stool samples were provided by 314 individuals. The prevalence of IPs found was 30.6% (n = 96), with a predominance of Giardia lamblia (12.7%, n = 40) and Hymenolepis nana (7.6%, n = 24). The only soil-transmitted helminth found was Strongyloides stercoralis with a 2.5% prevalence (n = 8). Individuals of adult age (> 18 years) were 0.65 times less likely to present parasitic infections with respect to children and adolescents. The only environmental variable that was closely associated with the presence of IPs, was the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), a measure of humidity; being higher around houses with positive individuals. Most of the IPs found in this study were of water-borne transmission and those transmitted directly from person-to-person, therefore fecal contamination is present. We believe that the low prevalence of STH in this area, which requires a passage through the soil, is related to the environmental characteristics, which are unsuitable for the development/permanence of the infective stages of these parasites. The geospatial data and tools used herein proved to be useful for the study of the relationship between the different factors that influence the presence of IPs in a community, from an eco-health approach.

TI  - Pandemic management: Analysis of availability and relevance of surveillance indicators by COVID-Task- Forces in the German federal state of Lower Saxony
T2  - INFECTION PREVENTION IN PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Locally, the introduction of measures during times of a pandemic emergency is embodied in a pandemic containment plan created by the Robert Koch Institute in 2017. In addition to central indicators such as incidence rates and number of deaths, various indicators are used at the local level to assess the pandemic situation. So far, there hasn't been analyses of the availability and perceived relevance of the surveillance indicators used to manage the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by the local German pandemic task forces.Aim: This study examined whether local decision-makers had access to surveillance -related indicators in a way that they could be used to make informed decisions in response to the pandemic situation.Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted, using an online questionnaire developed by experts of The Public Health Agency of Lower Saxony and The University Medical Center Go & BULL;ttingen (UMG). All local COVID-19 task forces of the German state of Lower-Saxony were enrolled in the study.Findings: The surveillance indicators assessed by survey respondents as most available and relevant are included under the German Infection Protection Act (IfSG). In contrast, the indicators that are not bound by the IfSG have a significantly lower availability and an inconsistent assessment of relevance.Conclusion: Against the background of efficiency, it seems central to be able to reliably provide the highly weighted surveillance indicators. Nevertheless, the relevance assess-ment gap between the indicators embedded in the IfSG and the ones that are not may be explained by cognitive processes such as anchoring bias. The collection and use of indi-cators to assess the pandemic situation and to evaluate measures should be the subject of continuous multidisciplinary discussions.

TI  - Reconciliation of energy use disparities in brick production in India
T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Energy conservation in brick production is crucial to achieving net-zero carbon emissions from the building sector, especially in countries with major expansions in the built environment. However, widely disparate energy consumption estimates impede benchmarking its importance relative to the steel and cement industries. Here we modelled Indian brick production and its regional energy consumption by combining a nationwide questionnaire survey on feedstock, process variables and practices with remote sensing data on kiln enumeration. We found a large underreporting in current official estimates of energy consumption, with actual energy consumption comparable to that in the steel and cement industries in the country. With a total estimated production of 233 & PLUSMN; 15 billion bricks per year, the brick industry consumes 990 & PLUSMN; 125 PJ yr(-1) of energy, 35 & PLUSMN; 6 Mt yr(-1) coal and 25 & PLUSMN; 6 Mt yr(-1) biomass. The main drivers of energy consumption for brick production are the kiln technology, the production capacity and the fuel mix used. The results suggest that improving operating practices would be a first step in making brick production more energy efficient.Energy efficient brick production is crucial for the carbon footprint, especially in countries with a continuously expanding built environment. This study models Indian brick production and reveals a large underreporting in official energy consumption estimates, as well as key drivers affecting its performance.

TI  - A combined approach for individualized lymphadenectomy in gastric cancer patients
T2  - PATHOLOGY & ONCOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Gastric cancer ranks as the fifth most common cancer globally. The presence of lymph node metastasis is a significant prognostic factor influencing survival. Postoperative morbidity and nodal staging accuracy are heavily affected by the extent of lymph node dissection. Our study aimed to explore the potential integration of two contemporary methods, sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) and the Maruyama Computer Program (MCP), to improve the accuracy of nodal staging.Materials and methods: We conducted a prospective data collection involving patients with gastric adenocarcinoma from 2008 to 2018 at the Department of Surgery, University of Debrecen, Hungary. Data from 100 consecutive patients were collected. The primary and secondary endpoints included evaluating the rate of node-negative patients and the diagnostic accuracy of our combined approach.Results: Sentinel node mapping was successful in 97 out of 100 patients. We found that using the threshold value of the Maruyama Index (MI) & GE; 28, all metastatic stations of sentinel-node-negative patients could be identified. Our method achieved 100% sensitivity and negative predictive value, with a specificity of 60.42% (95% CI = 46.31%-72.98%).Discussion: The combined application of SNNS and MCP has proven to be an effective diagnostic technique in the synergistic approach for identifying metastasis-positive lymph node stations. Despite its limitations, this combination may assist clinicians in customizing lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer patients.

TI  - Assessing trends in breast care surveillance metrics after implementing surgeon-specific tracking and performance reporting in a large, integrated cancer network
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThere are few quality metrics and benchmarks specific to surgical oncology. Development of a surgeon-level performance metrics system based on peer comparisons is hypothesized to positively influence surgical decision-making. This study established a tracking and reporting system comprised of evidence and consensus-based metrics to assess breast care delivered by individual surgeons. MethodsSurgeons' performance is assessed by a surveillance tracking system of metrics pertaining to referrals and surgical elements. This retrospective analysis of prospectively collected breast care data reports on recurring 6-month and cumulative data from nine care locations from 2015 to 2021. ResultsBreast care was provided to 6659 patients by 41 surgeons. A total of 27 breast care metrics were evaluated over 7 years. Metrics with consistent, proficient results were retired after 18 months, including the rate of core biopsy, specimen orientation, and referrals to medical oncology, genetics, and fertility, among others. In clinically node-negative, hormone receptor-positive patients 70 years of age or older, the cumulative rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy significantly decreased by 40% over 5.5 years (p < .001). The overall breast conservation rate for T0-T2 cancer increased 10% over 7 years. At the surgeon level, improvements were made in the median number of SLNs removed and in operative note documentation. ConclusionsImplementation of a surgeon-specific, peer comparison-based metric and tracking system has yielded substantive changes in breast care management. This process and governance structure can serve as a model for quantification of breast care at other institutions and for other disease sites.

TI  - Enhanced extracellular production of raw starch-degrading a-amylase in<i> Bacillus</i><i> subtilis</i> through expression regulatory element modification and fermentation optimization
T2  - MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Raw starch-degrading a-amylase (RSDA) can hydrolyze raw starch at moderate temperatures, thus contributing to savings in starch processing costs. However, the low production level of RSDA limits its industrial application. Therefore, improving the extracellular expression of RSDA in Bacillus subtilis, a commonly used industrial expression host, has great value.Results In this study, the extracellular production level of Pontibacillus sp. ZY raw starch-degrading a-amylase (AmyZ1) in B. subtilis was enhanced by expression regulatory element modification and fermentation optimization. As an important regulatory element of gene expression, the promoter, signal peptide, and ribosome binding site (RBS) sequences upstream of the amyZ1 gene were sequentially optimized. Initially, based on five single promoters, the dual-promoter P-veg-P-ylB was constructed by tandem promoter engineering. Afterward, the optimal signal peptide SPNucB was obtained by screening 173 B. subtilis signal peptides. Then, the RBS sequence was optimized using the RBS Calculator to obtain the optimal RBS1. The resulting recombinant strain WBZ-VY-B-R1 showed an extracellular AmyZ1 activity of 4824.2 and 41251.3 U/mL during shake-flask cultivation and 3-L fermenter fermentation, which were 2.6- and 2.5-fold greater than those of the original strain WBZ-Y, respectively. Finally, the extracellular AmyZ1 activity of WBZ-VY-B-R1 was increased to 5733.5 U/mL in shake flask by optimizing the type and concentration of carbon source, nitrogen source, and metal ions in the fermentation medium. On this basis, its extracellular AmyZ1 activity was increased to 49082.1 U/mL in 3-L fermenter by optimizing the basic medium components as well as the ratio of carbon and nitrogen sources in the feed solution. This is the highest production level reported to date for recombinant RSDA production.Conclusions This study represents a report on the extracellular production of AmyZ1 using B. subtilis as a host strain, and achieved the current highest expression level. The results of this study will lay a foundation for the industrial application of RSDA. In addition, the strategies employed here also provide a promising way for improving other protein production in B. subtilis.

For area-wide mapping approaches with at least a field resolution, Earth Observation is a valuable data source to extract bare soil areas and to quantify SOC contents for these areas.In this context, compositing techniques of multi-temporal image archives are widely used to overcome the limitation of vegetation cover of fields during the overpass of the satellite. Comparing current bare soil compositing approaches, two aspects are of particular importance: 1) the index for bare soil selection and 2) the length of the compositing period for recurrent analyses. In this study, we applied the Soil Composite Mapping Processor (SCMaP) to the full archive of Landsat data between 2005 and 2019 to optimize parameters for soil reflectance composite (SRC) generation of multitemporal satellite imagery for SOC predictions. For this purpose, three spectral indices (PV + BLUE, PV + IR2, and NBR2) for SRC generation were implemented in the SCMaP chain. For all three indices a validation of the extracted bare soil dates with field observations and phenological information from the crop calendar showed a reliable extraction of bare soil dates. Due to the crops in the investigation area, spring and autumn months indicated the highest proportion of correctly selected bare soil dates. We also analyzed the SOC modeling capabilities of different composed SRCs (indices and varying seasonal and temporal lengths) in combination with available legacy data. In comparison to a seasonal pre-selection of scenes (spring and autumn months) included in the SRC, the different indices showed a minor influence on SOC modeling. However, PV + BLUE performed best (R2: 0.56 - 0.72, RMSE: 1.09 - 1.29%, RPD: 1.51 - 1.91). Furthermore, we compared the SOC model capabilities for different SRC compositing lengths (3-, 5-, 7-, 10-and 15-years). For PV + BLUE and PV + IR2, longer compositing lengths (from three to 15 years) resulted in an increase of the model accuracies and performances. However, for NBR2 this was not as clear. Based on the results at least a 5-year compositing period is required for recurrent SOC predictions using Landsat data.

TI  - Automatic lineaments detection using radar and optical data with an emphasis on geologic and tectonic implications: a case study of Kabul Block, eastern Afghanistan
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The earth's surface linear features, expressing geological lineaments, play a key role in identifying hydrothermal alteration and mineralization zones, as well as in understanding tectonic settings of a region. The objective of this investigation is to utilize a method for extracting lineaments automatically, which will be integrated and applied to identify geological-based lineaments by making use of remote sensing data. The study will further examine the structural pattern and temporal-spatial evolution of the lineaments and establish their connection with the primary active faults present in the Kabul Block. Multi-sensor data from radar (DEM (Digital Elevation Model)-5m, Sentinel-1B GRD (Ground Range Detected)) and optical sensors (Sentinel-2 MSI (Multispectral Instrument) and ASTER) were processed using spatial and spectral filters before automatic lineament extraction. LINE-module algorithm was applied to various illuminated hill-shades of DEM-5m, filtered HH (Horizonal-Horizonal) and VH (Vertical-Horizontal) of Sentinel-1GRD and PC1 (Principle Component) of Sentinel-2A MSI, and ASTER data to detect linear surface features. Extensive testing was conducted to verify the accuracy of extracted lineaments and to exclude any artificial lineaments in the study area. The radar and optical data results were compared while taking into consideration the geological and tectonic settings of the study area to select the most appropriate extracted lineaments. The DEM-5m and Sentinel-1B GRD showed the best result for identifying lineaments, and these were found to be highly correlated with previously available data in the Kabul Block. The final results of DEM-5m and Sentinel-1B GRD were further analyzed. The extracted lineaments were found to trend predominantly in a NW-SE and NE-SW directions, which is consistent with the results of other data. Temporal evolution and spatial distribution reveal that a high density of the lineaments is associated with Paleogene and Quaternary formations, while a low density is observed in Proterozoic, Paleozoic, and Mesozoic formations. The west and southwest edges of the Kabul Block are controlled by compressive stress trending NNW-SSE, while the north and southeast margins are influenced by NE-SW and & SIM; N-S trending compressive stress.

TI  - Worldviews about change: Their structure and their implications for understanding responses to sustainability, technology, and political change
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - People hold different perspectives about how they think the world is changing or should change. We examined five of these "worldviews" about change: Progress, Golden Age, Endless Cycle, Maintenance, and Balance. In Studies 1-4 (total N = 2733) we established reliable measures of each change worldview, and showed how these help explain when people will support or oppose social change in contexts spanning sustainability, technological innovations, and political elections. In mapping out these relationships we identify how the importance of different change worldviews varies across contexts, with Balance most critical for understanding support for sustainability, Progress/Golden Age important for understanding responses to innovations, and Golden Age uniquely important for preferring Trump/Republicans in the 2016 US election. These relationships were independent of prominent individual differences (e.g., values, political orientation for elections) or context-specific factors (e.g., self-reported innovativeness for responses to innovations). Study 5 (N = 2140) examined generalizability in 10 countries/regions spanning five continents, establishing that these worldviews exhibited metric invariance, but with country/region differences in how change worldviews were related to support for sustainability. These findings show that change worldviews can act as a general "lens" people use to help determine whether to support or oppose social change.

TI  - Public perceptions of climate tipping points
T2  - PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Coverage of climate tipping points has rapidly increased over the past 20 years. Despite this upsurge, there has been precious little research into how the public perceives these abrupt and/or irreversible large-scale risks. This article provides a nationally representative view on public perceptions of climate tipping points and possible societal responses to them (n = 1773). Developing a mixed-methods survey with cultural cognition theory, it shows that awareness among the British public is low. The public is doubtful about the future effectiveness of humanity's response to climate change in general, and significantly more doubtful about its response to tipping points specifically. Significantly more people with an egalitarian worldview judge tipping points likely to be crossed and to be a significant threat to humanity. All possible societal responses received strong support. The article ends by considering the prospects for 'cultural tipping elements' to tip support for climate policies across divergent cultural worldviews.

T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundAxillary surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is becoming less extensive. We evaluated the evolution of axillary surgery after NAC on the multi-institutional I-SPY2 prospective trial.MethodsWe examined annual rates of sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery with resection of clipped node, if present), axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and SLN and ALND in patients enrolled in I-SPY2 from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2021 by clinical N status at diagnosis and pathologic N status at surgery. Cochran-Armitage trend tests were calculated to evaluate patterns over time.ResultsOf 1578 patients, 973 patients (61.7%) had SLN-only, 136 (8.6%) had SLN and ALND, and 469 (29.7%) had ALND-only. In the cN0 group, ALND-only decreased from 20% in 2011 to 6.25% in 2021 (p = 0.0078) and SLN-only increased from 70.0% to 87.5% (p = 0.0020). This was even more striking in patients with clinically node-positive (cN+) disease at diagnosis, where ALND-only decreased from 70.7% to 29.4% (p < 0.0001) and SLN-only significantly increased from 14.6% to 56.5% (p < 0.0001). This change was significant across subtypes (HR-/HER2-, HR+/HER2-, and HER2+). Among pathologically node-positive (pN+) patients after NAC (n = 525) ALND-only decreased from 69.0% to 39.2% (p < 0.0001) and SLN-only increased from 6.9% to 39.2% (p < 0.0001).ConclusionsUse of ALND after NAC has significantly decreased over the past decade. This is most pronounced in cN+ disease at diagnosis with an increase in the use of SLN surgery after NAC. Additionally, in pN+ disease after NAC, there has been a decrease in use of completion ALND, a practice pattern change that precedes results from clinical trials.

TI  - Retrieval and validation of the dawn-dusk land surface temperature from FY-3E MERSI-LL
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important physical parameter that reflects changes in surface processes. Remote sensing makes it possible to obtain global or regional LSTs with high spatial and temporal resolution. Feng-Yun 3E (FY-3E) is the world's first civilian dawn-dusk orbiting meteorological satellite on board the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager - Low-Light (MERSI-LL) sensor capable of acquiring LST at 250 m spatial resolution at dawn and dusk. By complementing with existing polar-orbiting satellites, FY-3E can fill the satellite observation gap within the 6-hour assimilation window and further enhance the observation capability of LST. To retrieve accurate LST from MERSI-LL, the generalized split-window (GSW) method was developed. The GSW coefficients were derived from the simulation dataset produced by Moderate Resolution Transmittance Code 5.2 with an atmospheric profile database. As a key input to the GSW algorithm, the land surface emissivity was dynamically estimated by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Emissivity Dataset in combination with the fractional vegetation cover. The water vapour content is calculated in real time by the split-window covariance/variance ratio method. The comparison between retrieved LSTs and in situ LSTs shows that the GSW algorithm can effectively retrieve the LSTs of vegetation cover surfaces. The root mean square error ranged from 0.79 to 1.79 K at dawn and from 1.32 to 1.92 K at dusk.

TI  - Non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery with one-step nucleic acid amplification for early gastrointestinal tumors: Personal experience and literature review
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUNDLaparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery is a safe, organ-sparing surgery that achieves full-thickness resection with adequate margins. Recent studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of these procedures. However, these techniques are limited by the exposure of the tumor and mucosa to the peritoneal cavity, which could lead to viable cancer cell seeding and the spillage of gastric juice or enteric liquids into the peritoneal cavity. Non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery (NEWS) is highly accurate in determining the resection margins to prevent intraperitoneal contamination because the tumor is inverted into the visceral lumen instead of the peritoneal cavity. Accurate intraoperative assessment of the nodal status could allow stratification of the extent of resection. One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) can provide a rapid method of evaluating nodal tissue, whilst near-infrared laparoscopy together with indocyanine green can identify relevant nodal tissue intraoperatively.AIMTo determine the safety and feasibility of NEWS in early gastric and colon cancers and of adding rapid intraoperative lymph node (LN) assessment with OSNA.METHODSThe patient-based experiential portion of our investigations was conducted at the General and Oncological Surgery Unit of the St. Giuseppe Moscati Hospital (Avellino, Italy). Patients with early-stage gastric or colon cancer (diagnosed via endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, and computed tomography) were included. All lesions were treated by NEWS procedure with intraoperative OSNA assay between January 2022 and October 2022. LNs were examined intraoperatively with OSNA and postoperatively with conventional histology. We analyzed patient demographics, lesion features, histopathological diagnoses, R0 resection (negative margins) status, adverse events, and follow-up results. Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively.RESULTSA total of 10 patients (5 males and 5 females) with an average age of 70.4 +/- 4.5 years (range: 62-78 years) were enrolled in this study. Five patients were diagnosed with gastric cancer. The remaining 5 patients were diagnosed with early-stage colon cancer. The mean tumor diameter was 23.8 +/- 11.6 mm (range: 15-36 mm). The NEWS procedure was successful in all cases. The mean procedure time was 111.5 +/- 10.7 min (range: 80-145 min). The OSNA assay revealed no LN metastases in any patients. Histologically complete resection (R0) was achieved in 9 patients (90.0%). There was no recurrence during the follow-up period.CONCLUSIONNEWS combined with sentinel LN biopsy and OSNA assay is an effective and safe technique for the removal of selected early gastric and colon cancers in which it is not possible to adopt conventional endoscopic resection techniques. This procedure allows clinicians to acquire additional information on the LN status intraoperatively. (c) The Author(s) 2023. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Existential Nihilism Scale (ENS): Theory, Development, and Psychometric Evaluation
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Existential nihilism is a worldview characterized by the belief that the totality of existence is meaningless and any attempt to change or rectify this, with the goal of establishing meaning, is futile. Despite the rich but often ambiguous philosophical and cultural history of existential nihilism, its impact on mental health and society remains largely unknown due to a gap in the scientific measurement literature. To address this gap, an 8-item scale measuring the proposed construct was rigorously developed and tested in accordance with psychometric theory and scale development guidelines. Two identical studies were conducted with an undergraduate sample (N = 329) and a community sample (N = 307) to evaluate the scale's item quality, reliability, internal structure, convergent validity, concurrent validity, discriminant validity, and incremental validity. Evaluation of the Existential Nihilism Scale (ENS) provided evidence of strong psychometric properties. This new measure promises to contribute to future research examining the impact of existential nihilism on mental health, wellbeing, and social outcomes.

TI  - Spatial characteristics of urban evapotranspiration effects on the thermal environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important process of the regional hydrothermal cycle. However, it is unclear how the mitigation of urban ET in urban thermal environments occurs in a spatial context. Landsat 8 satellite images from 2014 to 2018 of Xuzhou and corresponding meteorological observations were selected, and the improved mono-window algorithm (IMW) and urban RS-PM model were applied to invert land surface temperature (LST) and ET, respectively. In addition, spatial analysis methods (a profile analysis, standard deviation ellipse (SDE) analysis, and bivariate Moran's I) were employed to quantify and simulate the spatial characteristics of the ET effect on LST. The results indicated the following: (1) There was a significant linear negative correlation between ET and LST, which confirms that ET has a negative effect on LST; (2) the SDE overlap ratios between patches with higher ET and lower LST imply that higher ET patches have a significant impact on the spatial distribution of LST; and (3) bivariate Moran's I between ET and LST and their linear mixture spectral analysis (LISA) maps reveal a significant negative spatial correlation between ET and LST. In addition, the landscape pattern of higher ET parches is also an important factor affecting the environmental temperature.

TI  - Global evaluation of Doppler velocity errors of EarthCARE cloud-profiling radar using a global storm-resolving simulation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud-profiling radar (CPR) on the Earth Clouds, Aerosol, and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) satellite (EC-CPR) is the first satellite-borne Doppler radar. In a previous study, we examined the effects of horizontal (along-track) integration and simple unfolding methods on the reduction of Doppler errors in the EC-CPR observations, and those effects were evaluated using two limited scenes in limited-latitude and low-pulse-repetition-frequency (PRF) settings. In this study, the amount of data used was significantly increased, and the area of the data used was extended globally. Not only low-PRF but also high-PRF settings were examined. We calculated the EC-CPR-observed Doppler velocity from pulse-pair covariances using the radar reflectivity factor and Doppler velocity obtained from a satellite data simulator and a global storm-resolving simulation. The global data were divided into five latitudinal zones, and each standard deviation of Doppler errors for 5 dBZe after 10 km integration was calculated. In the case of the low-PRF setting, the error without unfolding correction for the tropics reached a maximum of 2.2 m s(-1) and then decreased toward the poles (0.43 m s(-1)). The error with unfolding correction for the tropics became much smaller at 0.63 m s(-1). In the case of the high-PRF setting, the error without unfolding correction for the tropics reached a maximum of 0.78 m s(-1) and then decreased toward the poles (0.19 m s(-1)). The error with unfolding correction for the tropics was 0.29 m s(-1), less than half the value without the correction. The results of the analyses of the simulated data indicated that the zonal mean frequency of precipitation echoes was highest in the tropics and decreased toward the poles. Considering a limitation of the unfolding correction for discrimination between large upward velocity and large precipitation falling velocity, the latitudinal variation in the standard deviation of Doppler error can be explained by the precipitation echo distribution.

TI  - Improvements in mountain lake monitoring from satellite altimetry over the past 30 years-lessons learned from Tibetan lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry has been widely used for inland water monitoring and modeling in the present decade. In this paper, the availability, data quality, and quantity of a number of spaceborne radar altimetry missions (including Topex/Poseidon (TP), ERS-2, Envisat, Jason-1/-2/-3, CryoSat-2, Saral, and Sentinel-3) are investigated. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first paper to investigate the influences of onboard trackers, satellite flying directions, and land contamination on Level-1 waveforms and Level-2 measurements over large mountainous lakes. The analyses were conducted over eight Tibetan lakes, which are of varying sizes from ca. 93 to 1046 km2 and are sampled by multiple altimeters. From the results presented in this paper, it is demonstrated that the previous generation of altimeters, such as TP, Jason-1, ERS-2, and Envisat, shows a higher percentage of data unavailability and lower valid observation rates. Investigations of Level-1 waveforms show onboard tracker failing in locking on the lake surface, resulting in data loss or invalid measurements. In addition, the onboard tracking systems are sometimes unstable, resulting in larger along-track standard deviations (SD) (SD > 15 cm). In contrast, the recent generation of altimeters, i.e., Jason-3 and Sentinel-3 with open-loop tracking mode, significantly increases the data availability (> 90% passes and > 60% individual observations) and delivers higher precision measurements (SD around 10 cm). Moreover, the waveform leading edge is very consistent, indicating more stable onboard tracking. Higher quality Jason-3 and Sentinel-3 data allow monitoring of sub-and quasi-monthly lake variations, which are not revealed by e. g., TP and ERS-2 data due to poorer signal-to-noise ratios. Exceptionally, Saral Ka-band altimeter, operated in closed-loop tracking mode, is less affected by flying directions and land contamination (topography and land-scapes), delivering high quality measurements (SD around 7 cm for 40 Hz).This study provides a comprehensive comparison of multiple altimeters in monitoring lakes in mountainous areas, and demonstrates the substantial improvements achieved in the past decades. However, care has to be taken when merging data from old generation altimetry missions over mountainous lakes. The lessons learned from these Tibetan lakes can be taken across to other mountain lakes.

TI  - A generalized method for retrieving global daily mean land surface temperature from polar-orbiting thermal infrared sensor instantaneous observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Daily mean land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial indicator for investigating global long-term climate change. The polar-orbiting thermal infrared sensor (POTIRS) can provide limited instantaneous LSTs of a single day on a global scale. Several studies have developed algorithms to derive daily mean land surface temperature (DMLST) from limited instantaneous daily LST data, but these methods are restricted to using data from a single POTIRS after 2000. This study presents a generalized method for estimating global DMLST utilizing one daytime and one night-time observation from any POTIRS since 1981. The proposed method employs a simple linear regression of two instantaneous LST measurements from different observation times (once during the day and once at night) of POTIRSs based on in situ LST measurements from 227 flux stations operating in diverse climate regions globally. The results demonstrate that this simple linear regression model provides highly accurate estimates of DMLST under all-weather conditions, with a root mean square error (RMSE) value lower than 1.7 K. Additionally, the proposed method was employed to estimate DMLST from instantaneous LST products obtained from various sensors, including Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard the Terra satellite, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer aboard the polar-orbiting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite, and Meteorological Operational satellite. Validation results indicate that the DMLSTs estimated from these POTIRS products are in close agreement with the daily mean in situ LST, with RMSE values varying from 2.2 to 2.4 K. We expect that this generalized method will be useful for generating long-term and high-quality DMLST datasets.

TI  - Phenotyping urban built and natural environments with high-resolution satellite images and unsupervised deep learning
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities in the developing world are expanding rapidly, and undergoing changes to their roads, buildings, vegetation, and other land use characteristics. Timely data are needed to ensure that urban change enhances health, wellbeing and sustainability. We present and evaluate a novel unsupervised deep clustering method to classify and characterise the complex and multidimensional built and natural environments of cities into interpretable clusters using highresolution satellite images. We applied our approach to a high-resolution (0.3 m/pixel) satellite image of Accra, Ghana, one of the fastest growing cities in sub-Saharan Africa, and contextualised the results with demographic and environmental data that were not used for clustering. We show that clusters obtained solely from images capture distinct interpretable phenotypes of the urban natural (vegetation and water) and built (building count, size, density, and orientation; length and arrangement of roads) environment, and population, either as a unique defining charac- teristic (e.g., bodies of water or dense vegetation) or in combination (e.g., buildings surrounded by vegetation or sparsely populated areas intermixed with roads). Clusters that were based on a single defining characteristic were robust to the spatial scale of analysis and the choice of cluster number, whereas those based on a combina- tion of characteristics changed based on scale and number of clusters. The results demonstrate that satellite data and unsupervised deep learning provide a cost-effective, interpretable and scalable approach for real-time track- ing of sustainable urban development, especially where traditional environmental and demographic data are limited and infrequent.

TI  - Research on infrared hyperspectral remote sensing cloud detection method based on deep learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Infrared hyperspectral is susceptible to clouds, and accurately identifying whether the hyperspectral infrared sounder data is polluted by clouds is of great significance for numerical weather prediction and atmospheric parameter inversion. Since the complex spectral characteristics of clouds, the existing spectral threshold methods and machine learning methods have the difficulties of undetermined threshold and clear field of view (FOV) missed and false detections. In order to improve the cloud recognition accuracy of infrared hyperspectral data, three end-to-end cloud detection models combining deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) are proposed. In this paper, taking the High Spectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS) equipped with Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite as the research object, based on the same platform Moderate Resolution Spectral Imager-II (MERSI-II) cloud mask (CLM) product, the HIRAS Cloud dataset is established, and the accuracy test and qualitative analysis are carried out by using the test datasets and Typhoon Siamba, July 3, 2022, as well as the earth observation scene under the conditions of ice and snow surface. The test datasets analysis results show that the cloud detection accuracy of CNN and CNN-LSTM model is stable at 0.96, and the false alarm rate of cloud is 0.035 and 0.036, respectively, and the detection ability of DNN model is slightly inferior to the former two in the same hidden layer, with an accuracyof 0.94. In further qualitative research, we found that the CNN-LSTM model has high accuracy and robustness in infrared hyperspectral cloud detection, and the detection results in a variety of surface scenarios are consistent with the actual situation of whether clouds occur in the FOV of the instrument. Compared with CLM products, it can better identify clear ocean scenes, and provide fast and efficient cloud detection reference for data assimilation systems.

TI  - A systematic review of the microbial community in taiassuids: a One Health approach
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Collared and white-lipped peccaries are sympatric and are distributed in most of South America and in the humid tropical forests of Mexico and Central America. Historically, these species have been used as a source of protein by traditional and/or indigenous human communities, but currently they have been used for legal consumption in different countries. Thus, there has been greater interaction between these wild species and domestic animals and humans, enabling microbial interactions between different niches. The present study presents a systematic review of the literature on the microbial community of collared peccaries and white-lipped peccaries distributed throughout the world, focusing on experimental studies related to the detection of microorganisms as well as the prevalence of the animal species and its characterization of the studied population, in situ or ex situ. Seventy-two studies were selected, mainly in South American countries, related to different species of microorganisms isolated or serologically detected (viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites), either as microbiota, pathogens or commensals, many of which are of zoonotic interest, such as Leptospira, Toxoplasma, Brucella, among others. Therefore, these wild mammals are characterized as sentinel agents of anthropic action and require the implementation of studies in relation to their contribution to the spread of microorganisms, being a potential source of amplification and transmission of pathogens.

TI  - Exploring subcolony differences in foraging and reproductive success: the influence of environmental conditions on a central place foraging seabird
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - While differences in foraging and reproductive success are well studied between seabird colonies, they are less understood at a smaller subcolony scale. Working with little penguins (Eudyptula minor) at Phillip Island, Australia, we used an automated penguin monitoring system and performed regular nest checks at two subcolonies situated 2 km apart during the 2015/2016 breeding seasons. We examined whether foraging and reproductive success differed between subcolonies. We used satellite data to examine how sea surface temperature, as environmental pressure, in the foraging regions from each subcolony influenced their foraging performance. In the pre-laying and incubation breeding stages, the birds from one subcolony had a lower foraging success than birds from the other. However, this pattern was reversed between the subcolonies in the guard and post-guard stages. Breeding success data from the two subcolonies from 2004-2018 showed that reproductive success and mean egg-laying had a negative relationship with sea surface temperature. We highlighted that variation in foraging and reproductive success can arise in subcolonies, likely due to different responses to environmental conditions and prey availability. Differences at the subcolony level can help refine, develop and improve appropriate species management plans for conserving a range of colonial central place seabirds.

TI  - Interannual variability (2000-2013) of mesopelagic and bathypelagic particle fluxes in relation to variable sea ice cover in the eastern Fram Strait
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fram Strait connects the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans and is a key conduit for sea ice advected southward by the Transpolar Drift and northward inflow of warm Atlantic Waters. Continued sea ice decline and "Atlantification" are expected to influence pelagic-benthic coupling in the Fram Strait and Arctic as a whole. However, interannual variability and the impact of changing ice conditions on deepwater particle fluxes in the Arctic remain poorly characterized. Here, we present long-term sediment trap records (2000-2013) from mesopelagic (200 m) and bathypelagic (2,300 m) depths at two locations (HGIV and HGN) in the Fram Strait subjected to variable ice conditions. Sediment trap catchment areas were estimated and combined with remote sensing data and a high-resolution model to determine the ice cover, chlorophyll concentration, and prevailing stratification regimes. Surface chlorophyll increased between 2000 and 2013, but there was no corresponding increase in POC flux, suggesting a shift in the efficiency of the biological carbon pump. A decrease in particulate biogenic Si flux, %opal, Si:POC, and Si:PIC at mesopelagic depths indicates a shift away from diatom-dominated export as a feasible explanation. Biogenic components accounted for 72% & PLUSMN; 16% of mass flux at 200 m, but were reduced to 34% & PLUSMN; 11% at 2,300 m, substituted by a residual (lithogenic) material. Total mass fluxes of biogenic components, including POC, were higher in the bathypelagic. Biomarkers and partial differential C-13 values suggest both lateral advection and ice-rafted material contribute to benthic carbon input, although constraining their precise contribution remains challenging. The decadal time series was used to describe two end-members of catchment area conditions representing the maximum temperatures of Atlantic inflow water in 2005 at HGIV and high ice coverage and a meltwater stratification regime at HGN in 2007. Despite similar chlorophyll concentrations, bathypelagic POC flux, Si flux, Si:POC, and Si:PIC were higher and POC:PIC was lower in the high-ice/meltwater regime. Our findings suggest that ice concentration and associated meltwater regimes cause higher diatom flux. It is possible this will increase in the future Arctic as meltwater regimes increase, but it is likely to be a transient feature that will disappear when no ice remains.

TI  - Impact of climatic factors on temporal variability of sand fly abundance in Sri Lanka: Longitudinal study (2018 to 2020) with two-stage hierarchical analysis.
T2  - Research square
M3  - Preprint
AB  - Background: Phlebotomine sand flies serve as vectors for leishmaniasis, a major health concern, but a neglected tropical disease. The risk of vector activity is governed by climatic factors that vary in different geographic zones in the country. Thus, we aimed to quantify the effect of climatic variables on sand fly vector activity in ten sentinel sites across Sri Lanka.Methods: Mean rainfall, ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, soil temperature, evaporation, sunshine hours, and vector densities were recorded at monthly intervals in each location from March 2018 to February 2020. The association between weather variables and sand fly densities was analysed using a two-staged hierarchical procedure; Distributed Lag Non-Linear (DLNM) modelling framework and the DLNM method implemented in the R package dlnm (version number 2.4.6).Results: Moderate rainfall values up to 120 mm per month and increasing RH up to 82 at lag of 0 months along with increasing soil temperature and evaporation rate at lag of 2 months were associated with statistically significant increase in the sand fly activity. These associations were heterogeneous across study settings. Whereas increasing ambient and soil temperature, sunshine hours, evaporation rate appeared to reduce the sand fly activity homogeneously at lag of 0 month in all the study settings.Conclusions: The abundance of sand fly vectors varied in relation to selected climatic variables, either in real-time or with a time lag. This information can be utilized for predicting sand fly densities and for the development of effective strategies to prevent leishmaniasis transmission in specific settings.

TI  - Deep learning for check dam area extraction with optical images and digital elevation model: A case study in the hilly and gully regions of the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Check dams are widely used on the Loess Plateau of China to control soil and water loss, develop agricultural land and improve watershed ecology. Detailed information on the spatial distribution of check dams and the area of dam land is critical for quantitatively evaluating hydrological and ecological effects, planning the construction of new dams and repairing damaged dams. Therefore, this research presents a method that integrates deep learning and geospatial analysis to facilitate the extraction of check dam areas in broad areas from high-resolution Gaofen-2 (GF-2) multispectral imageries, including red (R), green (G), blue (B) and near-infrared (NIR) bands and digital elevation model (DEM). First, we generated three datasets with different band combinations (RGB, RGB + NIR and RGB + DEM) using GF-2 remote sensing images combined with Advanced Land Observing Satellite-the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar DEM data to determine the optimal data combination for dam area extraction. Next, four widely used semantic segmentation networks-Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), U-Net, PSPNet and DeepLabv3+-were modified to support the arbitrary number of input channels and evaluated for check dam area extraction. Finally, the check dam candidate areas in the Yan River basin were extracted from DEM using geospatial analysis to optimize the dam area extraction results. The results showed that all deep learning (DL) models could extract dam areas quickly and accurately with mean intersection over union and overall accuracy values >85% and >98%, respectively. PSPNet had the best performance for testing datasets with different band combinations. We also found that the DL models in the RGB + DEM images had the best remote sensing image segmentation results, avoiding many miss-classified pixels. The F-1 scores in the RGB + DEM test dataset for FCN U-Net, PSPNet and DeepLabv3+ reached up to 92%, or 3.3%, 2.3%, 1.9% and 3.1% higher than the corresponding values for RGB images. Potential check dam candidate regions (similar to 3969 km(2)) were obtained for application analysis, which reduced the original area by 50%. The DL models for the RGB + DEM images were applied in the dam candidate regions, extracting 91.9 km(2) of agricultural production dam land and 10.6 km(2) of runoff and sediment silted dam land. The extraction results will facilitate quantitative analyses of check dams, improve the management of these structures and promote the efficiency of controlling soil losses.

TI  - Multi-omics analysis revealed anthocyanin accumulation differences in purple tea plants 'Ziyan', 'Zijuan' and their dark-purple hybrid
T2  - SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant anthocyanins have many ecological functions and human health benefits. 'Ziyan' (ZY) and 'Zijuan' (ZJ) are well-known purple foliage tea cultivars representing two different varieties of Camellia sinensis; however, their anthocyanin profiles and crossbreeding potential are not well investigated. Here, we report the widely-targeted, anthocyanin-targeted metabolome and transcriptome analyses results of ZJ, ZY, and their hybrid ZZ that shows strong heterosis in foliage anthocyanin accumulation. A total of 417 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAM) were identified in widely-targeted analysis, and the DAM numbers of ZY_vs_ZJ, ZJ_vs_ZZ, ZY_vs_ZZ were 200, 197 and 137, respectively. Using the targeted ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, we identified 22 anthocyanins with a concentration of & GE; 1 & mu;g/g (dry weight) in the samples. The total anthocyanins in ZZ (4,574.78 & mu;g/g dry weight) exceeded the combined content of its two parental cultivars. Delphinidin-3-O-galactoside was the most dominant anthocyanin. ZZ and ZJ accumulated more peonidin and petunidin anthocyanins than ZY. However, ZZ accumulated significantly lower catechin and proanthocyanin levels compared with ZY and ZJ, respectively. The transcriptional comparisons revealed that the selective up-regulation of CsANSs, CsGSTs may play critical roles in the anthocyanin heterosis of ZZ.

TI  - Automated analysis of snowmelt from Sentinel-2 imagery to determine variable rate irrigation zones in the American Mountain West
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Variable rate irrigation (VRI) is used to save water whilst maintaining crop yields in semiarid regions. A key problem is to be able to inexpensively determine spatial patterns in soil moisture so that VRI zones can be defined. In Southern Idaho, USA, the annual precipitation is low and most fall as winter snow. This research investigates whether snow melt patterns measured using freely available time-series Sentinel 2 imagery from Google Earth Engine can define useful VRI zones for two arable fields (Grace and Rexburg). The normalized difference snow index (NDSI) was computed for each 10 m pixel with snow for all winter images of the fields for 2018-2022. NDSI values were ranked within each image and average ranks were calculated for each month and over several years. The patterns of March NDSI were most similar to patterns in yield and soil moisture observed in previous years. Zones were determined using K-means classification of the mean ranks of March NDSI. Kruskal Wallis H tests showed consistent and significant differences between zones for key soil, plant, and topographic variables. For the Grace site, differences between zones were more consistent in their order of magnitude than VRI zones which were calculated using a labor-intensive method. For the Rexburg site, zones were shown to be better when based on snowmelt data from March 2018 to 2022 rather than just March 2019. It is important to base zones on several years of data because in some years there was no snow observed in the Grace field in March. In locations where the majority of soil moisture comes from snowmelt, basing VRI zones on several years of snowmelt patterns in March is a useful and inexpensive tool for deriving meaningful VRI zones. The code used to automatically extract suitable sentinel images and calculate the NDSI is included so that practitioners can use this approach in other locations.

TI  - Satellite observations showed a negligible reduction in NO<sub>2</sub> pollution due to COVID-19 lockdown over Poland
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropospheric NO2 column from Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI (2018-2020) and Aura/OMI (2010-2020) over Poland, notably for 7 major Polish cities, was used to assess the annual variability and the COVID-19 lockdown effect. On a national scale, during lockdown (March-June 2020), strong sources of pollution were found in Katowice and Warszawa, as well as at the power plant in Belchatow. A gradual drop in OMI NO2 values between March and June was found for all cities and the entire domain of Poland, this being a part of the annual NO2 cycle derived for every year from 2010 to 2020. In fact, the gradual drop of NO2 in the lockdown year was within the typical monthly and annual variability. In March 2020, Krakow showed the highest NO2 reduction rate. A reduction of NO2 was observed in Gdansk, Wroclaw, and Warszawa during every month of the lock-down period. Several factors, including wind speed and direction, temperature, and increased emission sources, can limit the dispersion and removal of NO2. Although meteorological conditions have a significant impact on the annual cycle of NO2 in Poland, it is important to note that anthropogenic emissions remain the primary driver of NO2 concentrations. Therefore, the study concludes that the effect of COVID-19 restrictions on NO2 pollution was negligible and clarifies the current understanding of the COVID-19 effect over Poland, with an emphasis on hotspots in the major Polish cities and their vicinity. This is consistent with our understanding that the reduction of NO2 pollution is seen in cities due to reduced traffic (domestic, municipal, and airborne).

TI  - Parcel level staple crop type identification based on newly defined red-edge vegetation indices and ORNN
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of strategic importance for early estimating planting area and crop yield to identify staple crop types on parcel level in a remotely sensed way. Limited by remote sensor imaging mechanism and current sensor technology, remote sensing images usually cannot be of high resolution in both spatial and spectral aspects. So, it has been found in many studies that supplementary data or features such as synthetic aperture radar data or temporal characteristic of time series data are usually integrated for crop type identification, which demands lots of data and overlooks the most typical spectral characteristics. Thanks to the expanded detecting bands of several moderate resolution optical satellites, the red-edge bands reflecting specific spectral features of crops are available for precise classification. Nevertheless, only a few studies have concentrated on these bands and the potential value of red-edge bands has not been sufficiently stretched in practical use. In this study, two newly defined red-edge vegetation indices (REVIs) and their time series data have been used for distinguishing different crops efficiently. Firstly, according to the reflectance characteristics in optical images and the data distribution of crops in feature space, two kinds of variants of REVIs based on green band and red-edge band, namely, ReG_RVI and ReG_NDVI have been proposed. Then, the time series data of REVIs can be generated from remote sensing images and be fed into the recurrent neural network (RNN) as training data for crop type classification. Finally, object based image analysis and RNN are combined with the idea of majority voting to achieve accurate crop type identification on cultivated land parcel level. The experimental results of two study areas using time series images captured by Gaofen 6 wide field of view sensor show an overall accuracy of above 90 % in identifying crop types, which proves the effectiveness of the newly defined REVIs and the feasibility of the proposed methodology. The predicted model based on ReG_RVI time series data performed more stable. In addition, the proposed REVIs have been transferred to other satellite sensor images captured by Sentinel 2 to testify 16 crop types and the experimental results indicate that the proposed indices also had general applicability to a certain extent. In summary, the contribution of this article is that the newly defined REVIs exploit red-edge information more sufficiently and the proposed methodology provides an effective solution for accurate identification and mapping of crop types in large areas at the cultivated land parcel scale.

TI  - Mapping smallholder cashew plantations to inform sustainable tree crop expansion in Benin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cashews are grown by over 3 million smallholder farmers in >40 countries worldwide as a principal source of income. Expanding the area of cashew plantations and increasing productivity are critical to improving the livelihood of many smallholder communities. As the third largest cashew producer in Africa, Benin has nearly 200,000 smallholder cashew growers contributing 15% of the country's national export earnings. Expansion of the cashew industry is thus an essential economic driver and a governmental priority in Benin. However, a lack of information on where and how cashew trees grow across the country hinders decision-making that could support increased cashew production and poverty alleviation. By leveraging 2.4-m Planet Basemaps and 0.5-m aerial imagery, two newly developed deep learning algorithms, and large-scale ground truth datasets, we successfully produced the first-of-its-kind national map of cashew in Benin and characterized the expansion of cashew plantations between 2015 and 2021. In particular, we developed a SpatioTemporal Classification with Attention (STCA) model to map the distribution of cashew plantations with 2.4-m multi-temporal Planet Basemaps from 2019 to 2021, which can fully capture texture information from discriminative time steps during a growing season. The U-Net model was employed to map the distribution of cashew plantation with 0.5-m mono-temporal aerial imagery in 2015, which can achieve accurate and fast predictions even with limited training data. We further developed a Clustering Augmented Self-supervised Temporal Classification (CASTC) model to distinguish high-density versus low-density cashew plantations by automatic feature extraction and optimized clustering. Results show that the STCA model has an overall accuracy over 85% based on 1400 ground truth point samples from each year. The CASTC model achieved an overall accuracy of 76% based on 348 ground truth samples of planting density. We found that the cashew area in Benin has almost doubled to 519 & PLUSMN; 20 kha from 2015 to 2021 with 60% of new plantation development coming from cropland or fallow land, while encroachment of cashew plantations into protected areas has increased by 55%. Only about half of cashew plantations were high-density in 2021, suggesting high potential for intensification. Our study illustrates the power of combining highresolution remote sensing imagery and state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to better understand tree crops in the heterogeneous smallholder landscape, which can help efficiently allocate limited training and nursery resources for sustainable agricultural development.

AB  - This article examines the role of Russian officials, servicemen, veterans, and paramilitary organisations in coordinating patriotic education programmes in the Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples' Republics (DNR/LNR) since 2014. Three complementary objectives underpin these programmes: first, indoctrinating youth to a worldview which promotes cultural assimilation into Russian society and denigrates Ukrainian statehood and identity; second, shoring up de facto authorities' legitimacy by glorifying the DNR/LNR as fully-fledged states requiring protection from Ukraine and destined to be 'reunited' with Russia; third, building a training and recruitment mechanism to fill the ranks of 'republican' but also Russian military and security structures.

TI  - Mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet from 2013 to 2018 estimated using the input-output method with updated remote sensing products
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) has been losing ice mass and contributing to the rise in the global sea-level (GSL) for the last 4 decades, as quantified by using satellite observations. We developed a framework for implementing the state-of-the-art input-output (IO) method that has the advantage of explicit estimation of the mass balance of individual glaciers, basins and the continent. We estimated the mass balance of the AIS from 2013 to 2018 using improved observations and updated datasets recently made available, including annual ice flow velocity maps from the Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS_LIVE) dataset, the BedMachine and the Princess Elizabeth Land (PEL) Earth System Science Data (ESSD) datasets, and the surface mass balance from the RACMO 2.3 system. For example, using the improved ice thickness data, the proposed method for ice discharge estimation enables a 10% reduction of uncertainty in ice discharge. During the period of 2013-2018, an ice discharge acceleration of 6.9 & PLUSMN;6.5 Gt yr(-2) in West Antarctica (WA) was detected, which contributed significantly to the estimated mass loss of & SIM;1069 Gt (-178.2 & PLUSMN;108.9 Gt yr(-1)) in the AIS. On the other hand, Queen Maud Land, East Antarctica (EA), showed clearly a mass gain rate of 56.0 & PLUSMN;10.0 Gt yr(-1) due to the regional increase in surface mass balance. Our results extended the estimation period by 3 years in comparison to the published study using the same annual velocity maps from the ITS_LIVE dataset. Furthermore, our results, along with those from other studies using the IO method, reassures the acceleration of recent mass loss in WA and Wilkes Land in EA, which are caused by glacier thinning and ice shelf basal melting. Compared with the long-term mass balance record since 1979, our results suggest that the mass loss in AIS accelerated in the last decade. The developed framework can be modified for mass balance estimation of the AIS or for other ice sheets by using velocity maps from other satellite data or from different periods.

TI  - Gated aggregation network for cloud detection in remote sensing image
T2  - VISUAL COMPUTER
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Cloud detection is one of the important tasks in remote sensing image preprocessing, and this paper uses RGB preview images of remote sensing images to extract cloud regions efficiently. The preview images make the detection of cloud regions more challenging due to the lack of resolution and spectral information. The existing remote sensing image cloud detection methods, and feature fusion process, due to unreasonable feature fusion strategy, so that the encoded features cannot be fully utilized, which may introduce noise information, and ultimately lead to the problems of false detection and missing detection. To address these problems, this work designs a gated aggregation network (GANet) for remote sensing image cloud detection. GANet has a novel encoder-decoder architecture, a gated feature aggregation module (GFAM), and a pyramidal attention pooling module (PAPM). GFAM bridges the gap between high resolution with spatial details and low-resolution features with high-level semantics, fully selectively fusing semantic and spatial features to alleviate the semantic divide problem when fusing multi-level features. PAPM extracts multi-scale global contextual features without loss of resolution. The method is validated on three datasets: the publicly available 38-Cloud and SPARCS datasets and the self-built Landsat-8 cloud detection dataset with higher spatial resolution. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance under different evaluation metrics. Codes and datasets can be found at https://github.com/HaiLei-Fly/GANet/.

TI  - Evapotranspiration, gross primary productivity and water use efficiency over a high-density olive orchard using ground and satellite based data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The trade-off between increasing agricultural production and groundwater conservation, which is often the only irrigation source in arid regions, is a major challenge for water managers, decision-makers and the scientific community. Monitoring of the water use efficiency (WUE) provides a measure of the water lost from a canopy to the atmosphere relative to the biomass produced by the plants, and can be used to inform efforts that seek to reduce irrigation without impacting upon the yield. In this study, WUE was computed as the ratio between the gross primary productivity (GPP) and the evapotranspiration (ET). Both GPP and ET can be measured at the local scale using eddy covariance (EC) systems. However, in order to spatially evaluate WUE for larger areas or regions, local measurements are rarely representative. The spatiotemporal covariation of ET, GPP and WUE remains understudied, particularly at the scale of operational agroecosystems. In this study, Sentinel-2 optical bands were used to provide high spatiotemporal resolution estimates of ET via application of the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model. A key soil water stress constraint in PT-JPL was linked to the Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), while estimates of the GPP were delivered via the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM). In order to evaluate the water consumption and irrigation efficiency over an irrigated plantation of very high-density olive trees, ET, GPP and WUE were computed for a 1.5 year period, covering January 2019 to June 2021. Model estimates of both ET and GPP were compared to the EC measurements, with results providing a root mean square error (RMSE) of 63.3 W/m2 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.74 for ET and 2.3 g C/m2/day and 0.73 for GPP, respectively. Based on these estimates, WUE was then calculated as the ratio of the GPP and ET. Relative to in situ measured data, the results were biased, with ET overestimated and GPP underestimated. An alternative measure for WUE was determined based on a linear regression model of meteorological data derived from ERA5-Land and vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2 data. Overall, the best results were identified using an NDVI-based linear regression model, with an RMSE of 0.9 g C/Kg H2O and an R2 of 0.76. These results show the potential of high-resolution satellite data to assess WUE over agroecosystems, helping to overcome the limitations presented by in-situ measurements and supporting agricultural production and water resources management in water-limited regions.

TI  - Drivers of maize yield variability at household level in Northern Ghana and Malawi
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize is a staple food, but productivity has stagnated due to limited access to advanced farming methods and knowledge. To promote sustainable agriculture, understanding the factors affecting maize yield at the farm level is crucial. This study used panel data on maize yield and agronomic practices in Northern Ghana and Malawi from 2014 to 2020. Satellite-based environmental variables were extracted at household locations, and Random Forest modeling was used to identify factors influencing maize yield variability. The models performance was sub-par with low R-2 values (& SIM;0.1 and & SIM;0.24 for Northern Ghana and Malawi). Fertilizer and precipitation were the most important factors explaining maize yield variability. Spatial maps showed that Malawi's maize yield can increase with more fertilizer, but rainfall is essential. In Northern Ghana, relying solely on fertilizer may not be enough to boost maize production.

TI  - A Cosmic View of 'Tundra Gardens': Satellite Imagery Provides a Landscape-Scale Perspective of Arctic Fox Ecosystem Engineering
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Most animal ecology studies using remote sensing data have assessed how environmental characteristics shape animal abundance, distribution, or behavior. But the increasing availability of high-resolution data offers new opportunities to study how animals, in turn, shape ecosystems at diverse scales. We evaluate the efficacy of using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to quantify the effects of Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) denning activity (nutrient accumulation, bioturbation) on vegetation. Using an imagery-derived metric (NDVI), we compared maximum plant productivity and plant phenology patterns on 84 Arctic fox dens vs. reference sites, i.e., points generated within preferred denning habitat areas (predicted from a habitat selection analysis). We show that high-resolution imagery can be used to measure the effects of Arctic fox denning activity on vegetation. Plant productivity and the rate of green up were both greater on fox dens compared to reference (preferred-habitat) sites. Productivity on reference sites was lower than average productivity on the tundra (i.e., random sites), indicating foxes primarily establish dens in low-productivity areas. Plant productivity on dens was also unrelated to recent occupancy patterns, indicating fox denning activity has long-term legacy effects on plants that last beyond the lifetime of foxes. Our findings support Arctic foxes being classified as ecosystem engineers in low-Arctic tundra ecosystems by converting low-productivity sites into relatively high-productivity sites through their denning activity. We demonstrate the efficacy of using remote sensing technologies to study how predators increase landscape heterogeneity and influence ecosystem dynamics through patch-scale mechanisms, and ultimately advance our understanding of animal functional roles.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Algeria forest, particularly in the northeastern region, has undergone profound changes in recent years. The Oued Bouhamdane watershed has a great forest potential, which is threatened by several factors of natural and hu-man origin, resulting in a decrease in forest cover. It requires adequate forest monitoring to support the sustainable for-est management of this watershed, which is possible thanks to satellite imagery. The objective of this research is to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of the vegetation cover of the Oued Bouhamdane watershed between 2013 and 2022 using remote sensing data. This study is based on the use of Landsat 8 and 9 images for two dates in 2013 and 2022, and the calculation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to identify changes in vegetation cover between 2013 and 2022. The calculation of NDVI and the realization of the vegetation change map showed a regression of the forest cover between 2013 and 2022 with a rate of-5.53% of the total of the study area with a general negative change of 28.62% of the study area. This regression is essentially linked to natural and anthropogenic factors. This work can be a valuable tool for sustainable management of the forest of this watershed; moreover, the method is also adaptable to other watersheds of the northeastern region of Algeria.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater availability is a very determining issue, especially in semiarid and arid regions, for sustainable development and secured food production. In this premise, the detection and assessment of water stress are of utmost importance. In this study, the satellite-based Potential Available Water Storage (PAWS) index is used to test its feasibility for a basin-scale analysis of water stress in the Western Mediterranean Basin (WMB) in Turkiye. The coarse-resolution GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) estimates were downscaled based on the Random Forest (RF) model and then were integrated with fine-resolution precipitation data to derive fine-resolution PAWS values. The accuracy of the index was validated against the net water flux (NWF) and water storage deficit (WSD) values over the basin. The results revealed a good performance for the PAWS index for a local scale evaluation of water stress. The PAWS variations turned out to be highly correlated with the NWF (r = 0.72) and WSD (r = 0.66). The PAWS indicates that the WMB has suffered from a critical hydrological situation from 2003 to 2020 during which the basin has been under stress with the most critical situation in 2018 when the per capita water has fallen below 500 m(3) suggesting an absolute water stress status.

TI  - Comparison between deep learning architectures for the 1 km, 10/15-min estimation of downward shortwave radiation from AHI and ABI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of downward shortwave radiation (DSR) with high spatiotemporal resolution and short latency is critical. It is the fundamental driving force of surface energy, carbon, and hydrological circulations, and a key energy source for photovoltaic electricity. However, existing methods face significant challenges owing to cloud heterogeneity and their reliance on other satellite-derived products, which hinder the retrieval of accurate and timely DSR with high spatiotemporal resolution. In addition to the spectral features used in traditional approaches, deep learning (DL) can incorporate the spatial and temporal features of satellite data. This study developed and compared three DL methods, namely the DenseNet, the bidirectional gated recurrent unit without surface albedo as inputs (BiGRUnor), and the convolutional neural network with gated recurrent unit without surface albedo as inputs (CNNGRUnor). These methods were used to estimate DSR at 1 km and 10/15 min resolutions directly from top-of-atmosphere reflectance over the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Himawari-8 and the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard GOES-16 coverage, achieving high accuracies. The instantaneous root mean square error (RMSE) and relative RMSE for the three models were 68.4 (16.1%), 69.4 (16.3%), and 67.1 (15.7%) W/m2, respectively, which are lower than the baseline machine learning method, the multilayer perceptron model (MLP), with RMSE at 76.8 W/m2 (18.0%). Hourly accuracies for the three DL methods were 58.6 (14.1%), 57.8 (14.0%), and 57.3 (13.8%) W/m2, which are within the DSR RMSEs that we estimated for existing datasets of the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) (88.8 W/m2, 21.4%) and GeoNEX (77.8 W/m2, 18.8%). The study illustrates that DL models that incorporate temporal information can eliminate the need for surface albedo as an input, which is crucial for timely monitoring and nowcasting of DSR. Incorporating spatial information can enhance retrieval accuracy in overcast conditions, and incorporating infrared bands can further improve the accuracy of DSR estimation.

TI  - Decline of seagrass (<i>Posidonia oceanica</i>) production over two decades in the face of warming of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The response of Posidonia oceanica meadows to global warming of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, where the increase in sea surface temperature (SST) is particularly severe, is poorly investigated.Here, we reconstructed the long-term P. oceanica production in 60 meadows along the Greek Seas over two decades (1997-2018), using lepidochronology. We determined the effect of warming on production by reconstructing the annual and maximum (i.e. August) SST, considering the role of other production drivers related to water quality (i.e. Chla, suspended particulate matter, Secchi depth).Grand mean (& PLUSMN;SE) production across all sites and the study period was 48 & PLUSMN; 1.1 mg DW per shoot yr(-1). Production over the last two decades followed a trajectory of decrease, which was related to the concurrent increase in annual SST and SSTaug. Annual SST > 20 & DEG;C and SSTaug > 26.5 & DEG;C was related to production decline (GAMM, P < 0.05), while the rest of the tested factors did not help explain the production pattern.Our results indicate a persistent and increasing threat for Eastern Mediterranean meadows, drawing attention to management authorities, highlighting the necessity of reducing local impacts to enhance the resilience of seagrass meadows to global change threats.

TI  - Dissolved organic carbon dynamics and fluxes in Mississippi-Atchafalaya deltaic system impacted by an extreme flood event and hurricanes: a multi-satellite approach using Sentinel-2/3 and Landsat-8/9 data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Transport of riverine and wetland-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) spanning tidal wetlands, estuaries, and continental shelf waters functionally connects terrestrial and aquatic carbon reservoirs, yet the magnitude and ecological significance of this variable and its spatiotemporal linkage remains uncertain for coastal deltaic regions, such as Mississippi River Delta Plain, which includes Mississippi (MR) and Atchafalaya (AR) rivers and estuaries with vast expanses of wetlands and coastal forests. We examined DOC dynamics and fluxes in this large river-dominated wetland-estuarine system for the period between 2019 and 2021 that included an extreme river flood event in 2019, two major hurricanes (Barry in 2019 and Ida in 2021), and cold front passage using an improved adaptive quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA-AD) applied to multi-satellite sensors (Sentinel 3A/B OLCI, Landsat-8/OLI and Sentinel-2A/B MSI) with varying spectral and spatial (10/30/300 m) resolutions. The DOC estimates from multi-satellite sensors in combination with water fluxes were used to assess DOC fluxes from two large rivers (MR and AR) and small channels across the delta plain. Overall, this system delivered a total of 6.7 Tg C yr(-1) (1 Tg = 10(12)g) into the estuarine zone and the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM) during 2019. High DOC fluxes from the AR (1.3 Tg C yr(-1)) and MR (4.5 Tg C yr(-1)) were associated with the extreme flood event in 2019. Hurricanes that occurred in the study period also contributed to the wetland and estuarine DOC fluxes into continental shelf waters; for example, the passage of Hurricane Barry in July 2019, delivered over a 3-day period similar to 1.33 x10(9) g DOC from Barataria Basin into the nGoM. Sentinel 2-MSI land and water classification revealed that Hurricane Ida eroded a total of 1.34x10(8) m(2) of marshes in middle Barataria Basin, converting those habitats into open water with 3.0 m inundation depth and high DOC concentrations (16.4 mg L-1), a potentially large DOC source to the coastal waters. Overall, storms and flood events are major sources of DOC flux that facilitate transport of upstream carbon as well as transformation of carbon in the wetlands, through the conversion of vegetated wetland to open water.

TI  - A high-resolution wave energy assessment of south-east Australia based on a 40-year hindcast
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a third-generation ocean wave model (WAVEWATCH III; WW3) implemented on a high-resolution unstructured grid was developed to investigate wave energy in the south-east of Australia over the 40-year period from 1981 to 2020. The simulated wave power shows good agreement with values estimated from multiplatform satellite data. Thus, the modeled data were used to study statistics (mean conditions, seasonality, extremes, and long-term trends) of wave power in the domain, which show impacts of Southern Ocean swell and protection provided by the land mass of Tasmania. The results indicate increasing wave power trends, with the largest values in the southeastern part of the domain over the 40-year period. These positive trends are mainly a result of an increase in significant wave height rather than peak wave period. By utilizing the simulated wave properties, we estimated regional annual electric power at 14 coastal locations using 9 typical wave energy converters (WECs). To do so, we conducted a comprehensive analysis (seasonal variations, wave power roses, probability distributions, and bivariate probability distributions) at these locations. The results demonstrate that the western and southwestern coasts of the domain are promising generation sites but with large seasonal variability. The central and eastern coasts are protected by Tasmania, and exhibit more stable conditions but are far less energetic for electricity production. This study has critical implications for the region, which provides a benchmark for coastal WEC deployment.

TI  - A review of globally available data sources for modelling the Water-Energy-Food Nexus
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The Water-Energy-Food Nexus (WEFN) is gaining attention as an important approach to manage resources more holistically. Data availability, however, is a crucial barrier to WEFN implementation globally. To assist modellers and practitioners in navigating this barrier, 'data hierarchies' were created, based on a comprehensive review of openly globally available data in water, energy, and food sectors. Global data sources considered include Satellite Remote Sensing (RS), Reanalysis, Global Observation Networks and Land Surface Models. The data hierarchies detail what data are suitable for modelling water, energy, and food availability globally. Furthermore, the review has highlighted which variables are not well monitored by global data sources, and for the first time has dis-cussed global data sources' interactions in the WEFN. The findings from the review and the associated data interactions have been used to recommend priority areas from a WEFN perspective for improving global data availability, and include streamflow, wind speed, and hydropower data.

TI  - Fish to fight: Does catching more fish increase conflicts in Indonesia?
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To what extent do marine-based economic activities influence the onset of violent conflict? Despite ongoing debate over several decades around the relationship between natural resources and violent conflict, little of the relevant research has addressed the marine environment. Based on satellite data in Indonesia, this paper exploited geographical variations in ocean productivity to provide new evidence on the relationship between fisheries and violent conflict. Using a search-by-radius approach, we compiled a sample of 757 cells to represent spatial interactions and spillovers between land-based conflicts and catch landings on the sea. We found that both industrial and non-industrial catches exhibit a statistically significant positive influence on the occurrence of conflict events. Additionally, increased illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) catches are more likely than legal catches to cause violent conflict. An increase in fish catches in Indonesian waters fuels conflict of every kind, among which protests and riots are most sensitive to fisheries while fighting and terrorism are least sensitive. Overall, these empirical findings support the hypothesis that increased competition for common-pool resources contributes to the onset of violent conflict. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - The MTego trap: a potential tool for monitoring malaria and arbovirus vectors
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Odour-baited traps are useful for vector surveillance and control. However, most existing traps have shown inconsistent recapture rates across different mosquito species, necessitating the need for more effective and efficient traps. The MTego trap with integrated thermal stimuli has been developed as an alternative trap. This study was undertaken to determine and compare the efficacy of the MTego trap to that of the Biogents (BG) modular BG-Pro (BGP) trap for sampling different mosquito species in a semi-field system.Methods Fully balanced Latin square design experiments (no-choice and dual choice) were conducted in semi-field chambers using laboratory-reared female Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, Anopheles funestus, Anopheles arabiensis, Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti. There were 16 replicates, and 50 mosquitoes of each species were released in each chamber per replicate. The evaluated traps were as follows: the MTego trap baited with PM6 (MT-PM6), the MTego trap baited with BG-Lure (BGL) (MT-BGL), and the BGP trap baited with BG-Lure (BGP-BGL).Results In the no-choice test, the MT-BGL and BGP-BGL traps captured a similar proportion of An. gambiae (31% vs 29%, P-value = 0.519) and An. funestus (32% vs 33%, P = 0.520). The MT-PM6 and BGP-BGL traps showed no significant difference in capturing Ae. aegypti (33% vs 31%, P = 0.324). However, the BGP-BGL caught more An. arabiensis and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes than the other traps (P < 0.0001). In the dual-choice test of MT-PM6 vs BGP-BGL, similar proportions of An. funestus (25% vs 27%, P = 0.473) and Ae. aegypti (29% vs 25%, P = 0.264) were captured in the traps, while the BGP-BGL captured more An. gambiae, An. arabiensis and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes than the MT-PM6 (P < 0.0001).Conclusions This study demonstrated that the MTego trap has potential as a tool that can be used interchangeably with the BGP trap for sampling anthropophilic mosquitoes including African malaria vectors An. gambiae and An. funestus and the principal arbovirus vector Ae. aegypti.

TI  - Real-World Evaluation of the Management, Treatment Pathways and Outcome of Melanoma Patients with Target Therapies in Italy
T2  - ADVANCES IN THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In recent years, an increasing trend in the incidence of melanoma has been observed in Europe. Although early diagnosis and prompt intervention with local resection often results in positive outcomes, conversely, metastatic disease is still clinically challenging with a poor prognosis and a 5-year survival of around 30%. The growing awareness of melanoma biology and of antitumor immune responses has allowed the development of novel therapies targeted at specific molecular alterations occurring at advanced stages. This real-world analysis examined patients with melanoma in Italy, focusing on treatment patterns, outcome, time to discontinuation (TTD), and resource consumption.Methods: Two retrospective observational analyses were conducted for BRAF+ patients with metastatic melanoma and those with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy in an adjuvant setting, retrieving data from the administrative databases covering 13.3 million residents. The cohort melanoma BRAF+ in metastatic setting comprised 729 patients with targeted therapy (TT) (n = 671 with TT as first line and 79 as second line).Results:Median TTD was 10.6 months in first line and 8.1 months in second line. Median overall survival from the start of first TT line was 27 months and was 11.8 months for patients with brain metastasis. In the dabrafenib plus trametinib patients, main healthcare resource consumption tended to increase in the presence of brain metastasis. The cohort with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy under adjuvant therapy (n = 289) included 8% patients treated with dabrafenib plus trametinib or tested BRAF+, 5% BRAF wild-type, and 10% under immunotherapy.Conclusion: Our findings provided an overview on TT utilization on metastatic melanoma patients in real clinical practice and highlighted an increased burden in brain metastatic patients.

TI  - In-orbit demonstration of a re-trainable machine learning payload for processing optical imagery.
T2  - Scientific reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Cognitive cloud computing in space (3CS) describes a new frontier of space innovation powered by Artificial Intelligence, enabling an explosion of new applications in observing our planet and enabling deep space exploration. In this framework, machine learning (ML) payloads-isolated software capable of extracting high level information from onboard sensors-are key to accomplish this vision. In this work we demonstrate, in a satellite deployed in orbit, a ML payload called 'WorldFloods' that is able to send compressed flood maps from sensed images. In particular, we perform a set of experiments to: (1) compare different segmentation models on different processing variables critical for onboard deployment, (2) show that we can produce, onboard, vectorised polygons delineating the detected flood water from a full Sentinel-2 tile, (3) retrain the model with few images of the onboard sensor downlinked to Earth and (4) demonstrate that this new model can be uplinked to the satellite and run on new images acquired by its camera. Overall our work demonstrates that ML-based models deployed in orbit can be updated if new information is available, paving the way for agile integration of onboard and onground processing and "on the fly" continuous learning.

TI  - Fusion of MISR Stereo Cloud Heights and Terra-MODIS Thermal Infrared Radiances to Estimate Two-Layered Cloud Properties
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Our longest, stable record of cloud-top pressure (CTP) and cloud-top height (CTH) are derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) on Terra. Because of single cloud-layer assumptions in their standard algorithms, they provide only single CTP/CTH retrievals in multi-layered situations. In the predominant multi-layered regime of thin cirrus over low clouds, MODIS significantly overestimates cirrus CTP and emissivity, while MISR accurately retrieves low-cloud CTH. Utilizing these complementary capabilities, we develop a retrieval algorithm for accurately determining both-layer CTP and cirrus emissivity for such 2-layered clouds, by applying the MISR low-cloud CTH as a boundary condition to a modified MODIS CO2-slicing retrieval. We evaluate our 2-layered retrievals against collocated Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS) lidar observations. Relative to CATS, the mean bias of the upper cloud CTP and emissivity are reduced by similar to 90% and similar to 75% respectively in the new technique, compared to standard MODIS products. We develop an error model for the 2-layered retrieval accounting for systematic and random errors. We find up to 87% of all residuals lie within modeled 95% confidence intervals, indicating a near-closure of error budget. This reduction in error leads to a reduction in modeled atmospheric longwave radiative flux biases ranging between 5 and 40 W m(-2), depending on the position and optical properties of the layers. Given this large radiative impact, we recommend that the pixel-level 2-layered MODIS + MISR fusion algorithm be applied over the entire MISR swath for the 22-year Terra record, leading to a first-of-its-kind 2-layered cloud climatology from Terra's morning orbit.Plain Language Summary Our longest climate-quality record of global cloud-top heights (CTH) comes from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) on the Terra satellite. These sensors assume a single cloud-layer in retrieving CTH, even though similar to 30% of global cloud cover is multi-layered. Multi-layered clouds predominantly consist of thin ice clouds over low clouds. Under such conditions, MISR accurately retrieves low-cloud CTH, while MODIS systematically underestimates upper-cloud-layer CTH. Here, we have developed a 2-layered MODIS + MISR fusion CTH retrieval by using MISR's accurate low-cloud CTH as an input to a modified MODIS algorithm. This algorithm combines the complementary capabilities of MISR and MODIS in distinguishing higher and lower clouds and estimates both-layer cloud heights and high-cloud emissivity. Through comparisons against coincident Cloud-Aerosol Transport System lidar observations, we find that the new algorithm improves the accuracies in retrieved CTH and cloud emissivities by similar to 75% over standard MODIS products. We further demonstrate significant improvements in estimates of simulated atmospheric longwave radiation from our implementation. Owing to its large radiative impact, we suggest that the pixel-level fusion algorithm be applied to all 22 years of Terra record to facilitate public dissemination of the first 2-layered cloud record from its morning orbit.

T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Since its official establishment in 2010, Google Earth Engine (GEE) has developed rapidly and has played a significant role in the global remote sensing community. A bibliometric analysis was conducted on 1995 peer-reviewed articles related to GEE, indexed in the Scopus database up to December 2022 to investigate its trends and main applications. Our main findings are as follows: (1) The number of GEE-related articles has increased rapidly, with nearly 85% of them published in the last three years; (2) The top three domains where GEE has been extensively applied are earth and planetary sciences, environmental science, and agricultural and biological sciences. The majority of GEE-related articles were authored by scholars from China and the US, accounting for 58% of the total, with US scholars having the largest impact on the community, contributing to over 50% of the total citations; (3) Remote Sensing published the highest number of articles (26.82%), whereas Remote Sensing of Environment received the highest number of citations (30.40%); (4) The applications of GEE covered a broad range of topics, with a focus on land applications, water resource applications, climate change, and crop mapping; (5) Landsat imagery were the most popular and widely used dataset; and (6) Random forest, decision trees, support vector machines were the most commonly used machine learning algorithms in GEE. Although having a few limitations, this type of analysis should be conducted regularly to observe the development of this field on a regular basis, as the number of publications related to GEE is expected to continue to increase strongly in the coming years.

TI  - Detection of symptoms induced by vascular plant pathogens in tree crops using high-resolution satellite data: Modelling and assessment with airborne hyperspectral imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Infection by the fungus Verticillium dahliae (Vd) and the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) threatens the production of olives (Olea europaea L.) and almonds (Prunus dulcis Mill.) worldwide. Producing symptoms that resemble water stress or nutrient deficiency, infection by these vascular pathogens restricts water and nutrient flow through the xylem. Hyperspectral, narrow-band multispectral, and thermal imagery acquired at a high spatial resolution can detect disease symptoms, even before they are visible, potentially allowing growers to distinguish infected plants from those affected by confounding environmental stresses. Nevertheless, operational detection of vascular disease using high-resolution commercial satellite multispectral images remains to be evaluated. Here, we assessed the capacity of high-resolution Worldview-2 and -3 multispectral imagery to detect Xf and Vd infections in olive and almond orchards in Spain, Italy, and Australia between 2011 and 2021. We compared the accuracy of detecting both pathogens using the satellite imagery with results obtained using aerial highresolution hyperspectral and thermal imaging, with model-inverted plant traits, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and thermal data as a reference. Our results using spectral plant traits to examine disease progression at all stages showed that traits and their importance varied as a function of disease severity. Worldview-2 and -3 detected the disease incidence with overall accuracies ranging from 0.63 to 0.83 and kappa coefficients (& kappa;) ranging from 0.29 to 0.68. Nevertheless, detecting the early stages of disease with multispectral satellite data yielded poorer results, with & kappa; values of 0.22-0.45, compared with & kappa; values of 0.3-0.69 obtained from hyperspectral data. Typical multispectral bandsets available from satellite sensors cannot measure important plant traits such as the blue index NPQI, xanthophyll proxy PRIn, SIF, and anthocyanin levels, thus explaining the poorer results obtained from multispectral satellite data for the early detection of vascular diseases. Adding a thermal-based crop water stress indicator to the satellite data improved the overall accuracies by 10-15% and increased & kappa; by >0.2 units. This work shows that commercial multispectral high-spatial resolution imagery can be used to detect intermediate and advanced Xf and Vd infection, but that the early detection of disease symptoms requires hyperspectral and thermal data.

TI  - Modelling and Monitoring Land Use: Land Cover Change Dynamics of Cooch Behar District of West Bengal using Multi-Temporal Satellite Data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) change is an indicator of the sustainability of any region and requires regular monitoring. In measuring and analysing LULC changes, remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) have shown high efficiency. The present study was carried out in Cooch Behar District of West Bengal, India, with the objectives to estimate the area distribution under different LULC, its temporal change and prediction of future area under these LULCs. In order to achieve these objectives, Landsat satellite imagery for three periods, viz. 2001, 2011 and 2021, was used. Six LULC classes were identified using the Maximum likelihood algorithm. The results revealed that there was continuous decrease in natural vegetation from 2001 to 2021, whereas agricultural land and built-up area showed increasing trend. To assess the overall accuracy of the LULC classification, a total 250 reference test pixels were sampled based on a stratified random sampling method. The prediction was modelled by using Cellular Automata and Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN). Validation of the model was done using Modules for Land Use Change Evaluation (MOLUSCE). Using the trained model along with classified LULC maps of 2011 and 2021, CA further predicted the LULC map of 2031. From the results, it is evident that the area under natural vegetation declined, while built-up area and agricultural land increased. All other classes might face slight changes in their area in future.

TI  - Identification of Urban Growth Typology and its Association with Thermal Environment: A Study of Siliguri Urban Agglomeration, West Bengal, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and consequent disappearance of vegetation cover and increase in impervious surface have accelerated the increase in land surface temperature. The average surface temperature of the globe increased by 0.9 & DEG;C involving the year 1880 to 2012, and it is anticipated by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that the entire surface temperature would increase by 0.30 & DEG;C to 5.40 & DEG;C towards the end of the twenty-first century. Within the last few decades, efforts have been made for understanding the relationship between the increasing imperviousness and its potential influence on LST. This present paper intends to explore the association of urban growth typology on the thermal environment by identifying three types of urban growth typologies, i.e. edge expansion, infilling expansion and outlying expansion of Siliguri (UA) a medium size urban agglomeration (UA) area of West Bengal. This present paper extracts spatio-temporal variation of surface temperature and urban growth from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) as well as Landsat Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) images for selected time periods (1990, 2000, 2010 and 2019). The land surface temperature (LST) result showed that maximum LST and minimum LST have risen up 3.19 & DEG;C and 4.86 & DEG;C, respectively, in last 29 years. The built-up area has been increased to 29.28 km(2) within this period. This study also identified the location of hot spots and cold spots from the zonal mean standardized LST value for Siliguri (UA). The partial least square regression (PLSR) model has been adopted in order to articulate the change in the effects of urban growth typology in LST. The PLSR result showed the statistically acceptable associations between LST change and urban growth typology. The analysis also showed that at the beginning, the urban area expanded as edge expansion during the different phases and edge expansion along with infilling are the most significant factors for determining the LST change in this study area. This study may help in lowering the surface temperature effects through well-managed urbanization for the future urban growth of the urban agglomeration.

TI  - Phytolith assemblages reflect variability in human land use and the modern environment
T2  - VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Phytoliths preserved in soils and sediments can be used to provide unique insights into past vegetation dynamics in response to human and climate change. Phytoliths can reconstruct local vegetation in terrestrial soils where pollen grains typically decay, providing a range of markers (or lack thereof) that document past human activities. The ca. 6 million km(2) of Amazonian forests have relatively few baseline datasets documenting changes in phytolith representation across gradients of human disturbances. Here we show that phytolith assemblages vary on local scales across a gradient of (modern) human disturbance in tropical rainforests of Suriname. Detrended correspondence analysis showed that the phytolith assemblages found in managed landscapes (shifting cultivation and a garden), unmanaged forests, and abandoned reforesting sites were clearly distinguishable from intact forests and from each other. Our results highlight the sensitivity and potential of phytoliths to be used in reconstructing successional trajectories after site usage and abandonment. Percentages of specific phytolith morphotypes were also positively correlated with local palm abundances derived from UAV data, and with biomass estimated from MODIS satellite imagery. This baseline dataset provides an index of likely changes that can be observed at other sites that indicate past human activities and long-term forest recovery in Amazonia.

TI  - A gridded dataset of a leaf-age-dependent leaf area index seasonality product over tropical and subtropical evergreen broadleaved forests
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The quantification of large-scale leaf-age-dependent leaf area index has been lacking in tropical and subtropical evergreen broadleaved forests (TEFs), despite the recognized importance of leaf age in influencing leaf photosynthetic capacity in this biome. Here, we simplified the canopy leaves of TEFs into three age cohorts (i.e., young, mature, and old, with different photosynthesis capacities; i.e., V-c,V-max) and proposed a novel neighbor-based approach to develop the first gridded dataset of a monthly leaf-age-dependent leaf area index (LAI) product (referred to as Lad-LAI) at 0.25 degrees spatial resolution over the continental scale during 2001-2018 from satellite observations of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) that was reconstructed from MODIS and TROPOMI (the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument). The new Lad-LAI products show good performance in capturing the seasonality of three LAI cohorts, i.e., young (LAI(young); the Pearson correlation coefficient of R = 0 :36), mature (LAI(mature); R = 0 :77), and old (LAI(old); R = 0 :59) leaves at eight camera-based observation sites (four in South America, three in subtropical Asia, and one in the Democratic Republic of the Congo(DRC)) and can also represent their interannual dynamics, validated only at the Barro Colorado site, with R being equal to 0.54, 0.64, and 0.49 for LAI(young), LAI(mature), and LAI(old), respectively. Additionally, the abrupt drops in LAI(old) are mostly consistent with the seasonal litterfall peaks at 53 in situ measurements across the whole tropical region (R = 0 :82). The LAI seasonality of young and mature leaves also agrees well with the seasonal dynamics of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI; R = 0 :61), which is a proxy for photosynthetically effective leaves. Spatially, the gridded Lad-LAI data capture a dry-season green-up of canopy leaves across the wet Amazonian areas, where mean annual precipitation exceeds 2000 mmyr(-1), consistent with previous satellite-based analyses. The spatial patterns clustered from the three LAI cohorts also coincide with those clustered from climatic variables over the whole TEF region. Herein, we provide the average seasonality of three LAI cohorts as the main dataset and their time series as a supplementary dataset. These Lad-LAI products are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21700955.v4 (Yang et al., 2022).

TI  - Multi-sensor imaging of winter buried lakes in the Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have highlighted that meltwater in supraglacial lakes (SLs) can be buried during frozen season in the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). Meltwater in buried lakes (BLs) can even persist through the winter, disturbing the englacial thermal regime and providing an important buffer against GrIS's contribution to sea-level rise. However, little is known about the inter-annual BL dynamics in the GrIS, and there is no quantitative statistic about the overall buried percentage. Here, we conduct a satellite-based study to automatically map the winter BLs over the GrIS during 2017-2022 using multi-source optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. To eliminate the interferences from other weak microwave reflecting surfaces, summer SLs are first extracted from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images to determine the potential BL searching areas on winter Sentinel-1 images. A self-adaptive thresholding algorithm is proposed to extract BLs within the dilated summer SLs using histogram-based morphological edge detectors. BLs extracted by the proposed method and visual interpretation show a substantial agreement with a precision of 0.82 and a Kappa coefficient of 0.70. On average, a total buried lake area of 182.27 km2 was observed each winter during the period 2017-2022. BLs were mainly distributed in the Center-West, South-West and North-East Basins, with the majority occurring at elevations between 800 and 1700 m. In 2019-2020, a sudden extension of BLs was observed over the GrIS, especially in the North-East Basin where abnormally high temperatures and surface runoff were recorded. In 2021-2022, a widespread distribution of BLs in the South-West Basin was observed after abnormal snowfall. Overall, about 13% of the GrIS summer SLs can persist through winter, suggesting the potential for meltwater hydrofracture in winter over large areas.

TI  - Comparison of programmatic data from antenatal clinics with population-based HIV prevalence estimates in the era of universal test and treat in western Kenya
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo compare HIV prevalence estimates from routine programme data in antenatal care (ANC) clinics in western Kenya with HIV prevalence estimates in a general population sample in the era of universal test and treat (UTT). MethodsThe study was conducted in the area covered by the Siaya Health Demographic Surveillance System (Siaya HDSS) in western Kenya and used data from ANC clinics and the general population. ANC data (n = 1,724) were collected in 2018 from 13 clinics located within the HDSS. The general population was a random sample of women of reproductive age (15-49) who reside in the Siaya HDSS and participated in an HIV sero-prevalence survey in 2018 (n = 2,019). Total and age-specific HIV prevalence estimates were produced from both datasets and demographic decomposition methods were used to quantify the contribution of the differences in age distributions and age-specific HIV prevalence to the total HIV prevalence estimates. ResultsTotal HIV prevalence was 18.0% (95% CI 16.3-19.9%) in the ANC population compared with 18.4% (95% CI 16.8-20.2%) in the general population sample. At most ages, HIV prevalence was higher in the ANC population than in the general population. The age distribution of the ANC population was younger than that of the general population, and because HIV prevalence increases with age, this reduced the total HIV prevalence among ANC attendees relative to prevalence standardised to the general population age distribution. ConclusionIn the era of UTT, total HIV prevalence among ANC attendees and the general population were comparable, but age-specific HIV prevalence was higher in the ANC population in most age groups. The expansion of treatment may have led to changes in both the fertility of women living with HIV and their use of ANC services, and our results lend support to the assertion that the relationship between ANC and general population HIV prevalence estimates are highly dynamic.

TI  - Evaluation of sentinel lymph node localization in malignant melanoma by preoperative semiconductor gamma camera and planar lymphoscintigraphy
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionPerforming lymphoscintigraphy in a separate room, frees up the conventional gamma camera, coupled with the desire to directly localize sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in the operating theatre has led to the development of high-resolution semiconductor-detector based handheld gamma-cameras, CrystalCam. MethodsThis work consists of phantom and clinical studies. For the first part, a Jaszczak phantom with hollow spheres of various volumes were filled with the Tc-99m and the camera's sensitivity was measured at various distances to assess the possibilities and limitations of the device. The clinical study evaluates the effectiveness of CrystalCam in localizing SLN in 40 consecutive malignant melanoma patients compared to both conventional planar lymphoscintigraphy and hybrid SPECT/CT. SLNs detected by planar lymphoscintigraphy were marked on the patients' skin using a UV-marker. CrystalCam images were acquired in another room by another examiner and the SLNs were marked with a felt pen. The detected nodes by both camera systems were evaluated using UV-lamp and normal light to visualize the UV- and felt pen marks respectively. The concordance rate of the SLNs and higher-echelon nodes localized by both planar scintigraphy and CrystalCam imaging with respect to the total SLNs and higher-echelon nodes detected by SPECT/CT imaging are compared and statistically analyzed. ResultsThe results of the phantom study show a good correlation between activity and count-rates for all distancesSPECT/CT, CrystalCamm, and planar lymphoscintigraphy detected 69, 58, and 61 SLNs respectively. The concordance rate of 95.65% by the CrystalCam and planar scintigraphy implies both cameras are statistically coequal in preoperative SLN detection of malignant melanoma. For the higher-echelon nodes, SPECT/CT, planar and CrystalCam imaging systems identified 82, 48, and 13 respectively; thus, CrystalCam was statistically inferior to planar imaging. ConclusionThe handheld CrystalCam is a reliable instrument for localizing SLNs in surgical centers without an on-site nuclear medicine department.

TI  - Chronic exposure to tebuconazole alters thyroid hormones and plumage quality in house sparrows (Passer domesticus)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Triazoles belong to a family of fungicides that are ubiquitous in agroecosystems due to their widespread use in crops. Despite their efficiency in controlling fungal diseases, triazoles are also suspected to affect non-target vertebrate species through the disruption of key physiological mechanisms. Most studies so far have focused on aquatic animal models, and the potential impact of triazoles on terrestrial vertebrates has been overlooked despite their relevance as sentinel species of contaminated agroecosystems. Here, we examined the impact of tebuconazole on the thyroid endocrine axis, associated phenotypic traits (plumage quality and body condition) and sperm quality in wild-caught house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We experimentally exposed house sparrows to realistic concentrations of tebuconazole under controlled conditions and tested the impact of this exposure on the levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), feather quality (size and density), body condition and sperm morphology. We found that exposure to tebuconazole caused a significant decrease in T4 levels, suggesting that this azole affects the thyroid endocrine axis, although T3 levels did not differ between control and exposed sparrows. Importantly, we also found that exposed females had an altered plumage structure (larger but less dense feathers) relative to control females. The impact of tebuconazole on body condition was dependent on the duration of exposure and the sex of individuals. Finally, we did not show any effect of exposure to tebuconazole on sperm morphology. Our study demonstrates for the first time that exposure to tebuconazole can alter the thyroid axis of wild birds, impact their plumage quality and potentially affect their body condition. Further endocrine and transcriptomic studies are now needed not only to understand the underlying mechanistic effects of tebuconazole on these variables, but also to further investigate their ultimate consequences on performance (i.e. reproduction and survival).

TI  - Assessing the capability of three different altimetry satellite missions toobserve the Northern Current by using a high-resolution model
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last 3 decades, satellite altimetry has observed sea surface height variations, providing a regular monitoring of the surface ocean circulation. Altimetry measurements have an intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio that limits the spatial scales of the currents that can be captured. However, the recent progress made on both altimetry sensors and data processing allows us to observe smaller geophysical signals, offering new perspectives in coastal areas where these structures are important.In this methodological study, we assess the ability of three altimeter missions with three different technologies to capture the Northern Current (northwestern Mediterranean Sea) and its variability, namely Jason-2 (Ku-band low-resolution-mode altimeter, launched in 2008), SARAL/AltiKa (Kaband low-resolution-mode altimeter, launched in 2013) and Sentinel-3A (synthetic aperture radar altimeter, launched in 2016). Therefore, we use a high-resolution regional model as a reference.We focus along the French coast of Provence, where we first show that the model is very close to the observations of high-frequency radars and gliders in terms of surface current estimates.In the model, the Northern Current is observed 15-20 km from the coast on average, with a mean core velocity of 0.39 m s(-1). Its signature in terms of sea level consists of a drop whose mean value at 6.14 degrees E is 6.9 cm, extending over 20 km. These variations show a clear seasonal pattern, but high-frequency signals are also present most of the time. In comparison, in 1 Hz altimetry data, the mean sea level drop associated with the Northern Current is overestimated by 3.0 cm for Jason-2, but this overestimation is significantly less with SARAL/AltiKa and Sentinel-3A (0.3 and 1.4 cm respectively). In terms of corresponding sea level variability, Jason-2 and SARAL altimetry estimates are larger than the model reference (+1.3 and +1 cm respectively), whereas Sentinel-3A shows closer values (-0.4 cm). When we derive geostrophic surface currents from the satellite sea level variations without any data filtering, in comparison to the model, the standard deviations of the velocity values are also very different from one mission to the other (3.7 times too large for Jason-2 but 2.4 and 2.9 times too large for SARAL and Sentinel-3A respectively). When low-pass filtering altimetry sea level data with different cutoff wavelengths, the best agreement between the model and the altimetry distributions of velocity values are obtained with a 60, 30 and 40-50 km cutoff wavelength for Jason-2, SARAL and Sentinel-3A data respectively. This study shows that using a high-resolution model as a reference for altimetry data allows us not only to illustrate how the advances in the performances of altimeters and in the data processing improve the observation of coastal currents but also to quantify the corresponding gain.

TI  - Evaluating ecosystem stability based on the dynamic time warping algorithm: A case study in the Minjiang river Basin, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the ongoing impacts of global climate change, the cumulative stress effects of external disturbances on ecosystems are gradually strengthening. Therefore, it is very important to scientifically evaluate the stability of ecosystems. In the terrestrial ecosystems, vegetation serves as a link between the water, energy, and carbon cycles, and is an important index which allows for the measurement of ecosystem stability. In this study, two vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index and enhanced vegetation index), along with solarinduced chlorophyll fluorescence data from 2001 to 2021, were used to determine the external disturbance events in the Minjiang river basin using a dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm. Analyses of the disturbance characteristics during this period, and quantification of the vegetation resistance, resilience, and vegetation regime shift rate were conducted. The results indicated the following. (1) The disturbance results monitored by the DTW algorithm were highly consistent with typical events, and it was feasible to monitor the disturbance of the Minjiang river basin using the DTW algorithm. (2) Disturbance intensity in the river basin increased slightly, while in urban areas it decreased. (3) The resistance of different types of vegetation varied greatly, with the resistance strongest in forests, next in croplands, and weakest in grasslands. In contrast, resilience was the strongest in croplands, next in grasslands, and weakest in forests. (4) The vegetation growth state of the river basin was more significantly affected by external disturbance in 2001-2021, with 58.75% of forest, 54.37% of grassland, and 37.21% of cropland having regime shift rates < 1. Lastly, (5) the response of vegetation to external disturbance was diverse under different disturbance scenarios, with the vegetation recovery rate under gradual disturbance being greater than the rate under abrupt disturbance.

TI  - The role of irradiation in the management of the axilla in early breast cancer patients
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The need for axillary radiotherapy in patients with invasive breast cancer (IBC) has been a topic of great debate in the last decade. Management of the axilla has evolved significantly over the past four decades with a trend towards de-escalation of surgical interventions and the aim of reducing morbidity and enhancing QOL without compromising long-term oncology outcomes. This review article will address the role of axillary irradiation with a focus on the omission of completion axillary lymph node dissection in selected patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) positive early breast cancer (EBC) with reference to current guidelines based on evidence to date.

TI  - Landscape heterogeneity increases the stability of wild ungulate populations facing climatic variability in Mediterranean ecosystems
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean environments are characterized by strong intra- and inter-annual fluctuations in plant primary production, which are likely to regulate the carrying capacity and density-dependent responses of ungulate populations. These effects may, however, vary across spatial and temporal scales. Habitat heterogeneity, particularly when associated to differentiated phenological responses, may allow wild ungulates to mitigate temporal fluctuations in plant production by using different resources along the year. In this work, we use a 15-years dataset (including remote-sensing data on vegetation distribution, phenology and production, as well as ungulate population counts) to assess how temporal variability in plant primary production and livestock abundance influence the population dynamics of two wild ungulates: native red deer, Cervus elaphus, and introduced fallow deer, Dama dama. Results show that temporal alternation in the phenological cycles of the four different vegetation types increased plant production, thus food availability for ungulates, within each year. Furthermore, complementarity in the responses of different vegetation types to variations in the amount and timing of rainfall increased the predictability of food availability across different years. This complementarity effect was further increased by the contrasting responses of ungulate populations to variation in the production of different vegetation types. Furthermore, domestic ungulates had positive effects on wild ungulate density at low to intermediate abundances, but high livestock densities decreased ungulate density and constrained the stability of the plant-ungulate system in response to the impact of climatic variation, particularly under climate change. Our findings deepen the knowledge on vegetation-ungulate interactions in Mediterranean areas, potentially contributing to develop better management strategies of ungulate populations and adapt them to ongoing climate change.

TI  - Social Worldviews Predict the General Factor of Paranormal and Generic Conspiracist Beliefs
T2  - SPANISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Even though wide access to any warranted information in the modern age, the problem of unfounded belief is still relevant, since these beliefs often lead to negative consequences (e.g., vaccination refusal, homeopathic treatment, etc.). The aim of this study was testing the relationship of social worldviews with paranormal beliefs and conspiracy beliefs. We assumed dimensionality hypothesis based on functional standpoint that there should be a general factor (underlying all the domains of paranormal beliefs and generic conspiracist beliefs), which has associations with the social worldviews as well. Derived our analysis from the survey of 228 participants (M-age = 30.6, SD = 11.7), we found that (a) the structure of paranormal and generic conspiracist beliefs can be described by a bifactor model; (b) the general factor of paranormal and generic conspiracist beliefs in the bifactor model was positively associated with global belief in just world and dangerous worldview; (c) paranormal beliefs were positively associated with global belief in just world and negatively associated with competitive worldview; (d) generic conspiracist beliefs were positively associated with dangerous worldview, competitive worldview, and zero-sum game belief; (e) contrary to our hypotheses, there was no evidence for any negative association of paranormal beliefs with dangerous worldview or zero-sum game belief and for any negative association of generic conspiracist beliefs with global belief in just world. We claim that the unfounded beliefs can be of some functional nature, demonstrating a connection with social worldviews, which opens up new perspectives for considering this problem within the framework of social psychology.

TI  - Medical Student Perceptions of Sociocultural Issues in Healthcare: A Multisite Study of Medical Spanish Education
T2  - TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - TheoryCultural competence and humility are core elements of medical education in a diverse society. Language is inseparable from culture, as language informs, indexes, frames, and encodes both culture and worldview. Spanish is the most common non-English language taught in U.S. medical schools, yet medical Spanish courses tend to artificially separate language from culture. It is unknown to what extent medical Spanish courses advance students' sociocultural knowledge or patient care skills.HypothesesBased on current predominant pedagogy, medical Spanish classes may not adequately integrate sociocultural issues relevant to Hispanic/Latinx health. We hypothesized that students who completed a medical Spanish course would not demonstrate significant gains in sociocultural skills following the educational intervention.MethodAn interprofessional team developed a sociocultural questionnaire, and 15 medical schools invited their students to complete the questionnaire before and after completing a medical Spanish course. Of participating schools, 12 implemented a standardized medical Spanish course and three served as control sites. Survey data were analyzed regarding: (1) perceived sociocultural competence (recognition of common cultural beliefs, recognition of culturally normative non-verbal cues, gestures, and social behaviors, ability to address sociocultural issues in healthcare context, and knowledge of health disparities); (2) application of sociocultural knowledge; and (3) demographic factors and self-rated language proficiency (Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good, or Excellent) on the Interagency Language Roundtable scale for healthcare (ILR-H).ResultsOverall, 610 students participated in sociocultural questionnaire between January 2020 and January 2022. After the course, participants reported an increased understanding of cultural aspects of communication with Spanish-speaking patients and the ability to apply sociocultural knowledge to patient care (all p < 0.001). When analyzed by demographic factors, students who identified as Hispanic/Latinx or as heritage speakers of Spanish tended to report increased sociocultural knowledge/skills following the course. When examined by Spanish proficiency, preliminary trends showed that students at both ILR-H Poor and Excellent levels did not demonstrate gains in sociocultural knowledge or ability to apply sociocultural skills. Students at sites with a standardized course were likely to improve sociocultural skills in mental health conversations (p < 0.001) while students at control sites were not (p = 0.05).ConclusionsMedical Spanish educators may benefit from additional guidance on teaching sociocultural aspects of communication. Our findings support that students at ILR-H levels of Fair, Good, and Very Good are particularly well-suited for gaining sociocultural skills in current medical Spanish courses. Future studies should explore potential metrics to evaluate cultural humility/competence within actual interactions with patients.

TI  - Comparing field-collected versus remotely-sensed variables to model malaria risk in the highlands of western Uganda
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMalaria risk is not uniform across relatively small geographic areas, such as within a village. This heterogeneity in risk is associated with factors including demographic characteristics, individual behaviours, home construction, and environmental conditions, the importance of which varies by setting, making prediction difficult. This study attempted to compare the ability of statistical models to predict malaria risk at the household level using either (i) free easily-obtained remotely-sensed data or (ii) results from a resource-intensive household survey.MethodsThe results of a household malaria survey conducted in 3 villages in western Uganda were combined with remotely-sensed environmental data to develop predictive models of two outcomes of interest (1) a positive ultrasensitive rapid diagnostic test (uRDT) and (2) inpatient admission for malaria within the last year. Generalized additive models were fit to each result using factors from the remotely-sensed data, the household survey, or a combination of both. Using a cross-validation approach, each model's ability to predict malaria risk for out-of-sample households (OOS) and villages (OOV) was evaluated.ResultsModels fit using only environmental variables provided a better fit and higher OOS predictive power for uRDT result (AIC = 362, AUC = 0.736) and inpatient admission (AIC = 623, AUC = 0.672) compared to models using household variables (uRDT AIC = 376, Admission AIC = 644, uRDT AUC = 0.667, Admission AUC = 0.653). Combining the datasets did not result in a better fit or higher OOS predictive power for uRDT results (AIC = 367, AUC = 0.671), but did for inpatient admission (AIC = 615, AUC = 0.683). Household factors performed best when predicting OOV uRDT results (AUC = 0.596) and inpatient admission (AUC = 0.553), but not much better than a random classifier.ConclusionsThese results suggest that residual malaria risk is driven more by the external environment than home construction within the study area, possibly due to transmission regularly occurring outside of the home. Additionally, they suggest that when predicting malaria risk the benefit may not outweigh the high costs of attaining detailed information on household predictors. Instead, using remotely-sensed data provides an equally effective, cost-efficient alternative.

TI  - Comparative study of feature selection methods for wind speed estimation at ungauged locations
T2  - ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind speed estimation at ungauged locations is one of the preliminary steps for wind resource assessment. With the availability of high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and remote sensing data, the number of potential wind speed predictors has grown substantially. The adequate spatial scale of these predictors is unknown a priori, leading to the use of multiple spatial scales of predictors in wind speed estimation models. Implementing a feature selection method as a pre-processing step of the analysis is necessary to avoid overfitting and the resulting potential model underperformance. This paper evaluated six feature selection methods (forward stepwise regression, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Elastic Net, maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR), Genetic algorithm, and recursive feature elimination using support vector regression) for the estimation of different wind speed quantiles across Canada. The selected features were used to fit a regression-kriging model, and the importance of the predictors was evaluated with their associated regression coefficients. The results of the study showed that LASSO and MRMR are the most efficient algorithms with the least number of parameters to tune and good generalization performance. The study found that some predictors were more important for specific exceedance probabilities. The most important predictors were the distance from the coast and surface roughness length, regardless of exceedance probability.

TI  - Scale-dependent and driving relationships between spatial features and carbon storage and sequestration in an urban park of Zhengzhou, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Research indicates that urban ecosystems can store large amounts of carbon. However, few studies have examined how the spatial features of park greenspace affect its carbon-carrying capacity, and how those effects vary with the spatial scale. Lidar point clouds and remote sensing images were extracted for the 196 ha green space in the China Green Expo to study carbon storage and sequestration in parks. Full subset regression, stepwise regression, HP analysis, and structural equation modeling were used to examine the scale dependency and the driving relationship between carbon storage and carbon sequestration in parks. The results show that the optimal statistical sample diameters for carbon density and carbon sequestration density in parks are 100 m. Under the influence of impermeable surfaces and water bodies, the statistical values of carbon density were minimized when the sample plot diameter was 700 m. Biodiversity and forest structure are the main drivers of carbon density, with the influence of water bodies being more prominent on a larger scale. Texture characteristics explain more carbon density than the vegetation index, and RVI could better explain the variation of carbon sequestration than NDVI. This study explores scaled changes in carbon density, carbon sequestration density in parks, and their driving relationships, which can aid in developing carbon sequestration strategies based on parks.

TI  - Monitoring vegetation dynamics (2010-2020) in Shengnongjia Forestry District with cloud-removed MODIS NDVI series by a spatio-temporal reconstruction method
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Shengnongjia Forestry District is the national natural reserve with abundant biological resources in China. Monitoring its variations of vegetation for the intimate connection with eco-environmental changes is of great significance. In this paper, the 16-day composite MODIS normalized difference vege-tation index (NDVI) products (MOD13A1) with 500 m resolution from 2011 to 2020 were selected to investigate the vegetation dynamics in Shengnongjia Forestry District. To alleviate the cloud contamina-tion in NDVI products, a spatio-temporal prefill method with harmonic analysis of time series (ST-HANTS) is proposed. ST-HANTS first prefills the raw NDVI time series using spatio-temporal information to reduce data gaps, which effectively improves the reconstruction performance of the subsequent HANTS algorithm. In the simulation experiments, ST-HANTS shows the highest average correlation coef-ficient and the lowest average root mean square error compared with other mainstream methods, includ-ing HANTS, Savitzky-Golay filter, wavelet transform, and data assimilation. The reconstruction curves are close to the upper envelope of the NDVI time series, which is more consistent with the vegetation phe-nology and can effectively capture the key points in the growth cycle. By analyzing the cloud-free NDVI time series reconstructed with ST-HANTS, results reveal the overall trend of Shennongjia vegetation cov-erage is high in the middle while low at the edge. Except for the population centers and Hongping Airport, the NDVI of most areas is above 0.7 and shows a remarkable increasing tendency. Moreover, the fluctu-ation degree of NDVI in the whole study area is low, indicating that the ecological environment of Shennongjia is relatively stable. The vegetation variations are influenced by land surface temperature and precipitation, and the vegetation growth response to precipitation exhibits an apparent hysteresis. & COPY; 2023 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Comparison of multi-source remote sensing data for estimating and mapping above-ground biomass in the West Usambara tropical montane forests
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation is important to better understand the carbon cy-cle and improve the efficiency of forest policy and management activities. AGB estimation models, using a combination of field data and remote sensing data, can largely replace traditional survey methods for measuring AGB. There are, however, critical steps for map-ping AGB based on satellite data with an acceptable degree of accuracy, such as choice of remote sensing data, the proper statistical modelling method, and remote sensing pre-dictor variables, at known field locations. This study sought to identify the optimal op-tical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing imagery from five sensors (Plan-etScope, Sentinel-2, Landsat 8 OLI, ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, and Sentinel-1) to model 159 field -based AGB values from two montane forests under semiparametric (Generalized Additive Model; GAM) and non-parametric (eXtreme Gradient Boosting; XGB) approaches using in-formation from four groups of predictor variables (spectral bands/polarizations, vegetation indices, textures, and a combination of all). The study's results showed that PlanetScope (rRMSE = 69.19%; R 2 = 0.161) was the most precise optical sensor while ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 (rRMSE = 70.76; R 2 = 0.165) was the most precise amongst the SAR sensors. XGB mod-els generally resulted in those with lower prediction errors as compared to GAMs for the five sensors. Models having textures of vegetation indices and polarization bands achieved greater accuracy than models that incorporated spectral bands/polarizations and vegeta-tion indices only. The study recommends that PlanetScope and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 remote sensing data using the XGB-based technique is an appropriate approach for accurate lo-cal and regional estimation of tropical forest AGB particularly for complex montane forest ecosystems.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - A spatiotemporal monitoring model of TSM and TDS in arid region lakes utilizing Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of lake water quality is crucial for protecting and managing natural resources. Total suspended matter (TSM) and total dissolved solids (TDS) are significant parameters in evaluating lake water quality, and their concentration levels provide useful information about the health of the ecosystem. However, measuring TSM and TDS concentrations in remote arid areas can be challenging, necessitating the development of a simple, efficient, and cost-effective monitoring system. In this study, the aim was to retrieve TDS and TSM concentrations in the arid region using an empirical and physics-based method simultaneously. Measured data and remote sensing images for Chah-Nimeh Reservoirs (CNRs), Iran, were used to establish the TSM and TDS concentration model. Twenty-seven Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) data acquired from 2018 to 2021 were employed to determine the spatiotemporal distribution of TDS and TSM concentrations. The results indicate that Sentinel-2 MSI data is a productive tool for retrieving TSM concentration using the Case-2 Regional/Coastal Color (C2RCC) processor, with a high level of performance in the dry ecosystem of CNRs (R2 = 0.92). Furthermore, the Bayesian regularization artificial neural network (BRANN) algorithm was used to evaluate TDS concentration, and the results demonstrated that the BRANN algorithm outperforms other models, with a high level of performance (R2 = 0.89). It is noteworthy that evaluating TDS concentration is generally more challenging than TSM. The study provides a valuable model for monitoring TSM and TDS concentrations in remote arid areas using Sentinel-2 MSI data. The proposed approach can facilitate effective spatiotemporal monitoring of TSM and TDS concentrations and aid in the evaluation of lake water quality, specifically in regions where in-situ measurements are not feasible. The findings have significant implications for the management and conservation of natural resources in arid and remote regions.

TI  - Delta lobe development in response to changing fluvial sediment supply by the second largest river in Vietnam
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - While the importance of sediment supply to river delta evolution is well recognized, the extent to which sediment from upstream sources contributes to the subaerial and subaqueous components of its delta is not yet fully comprehended. To investigate this issue, the present study analyzed satellite images (Landsat) spanning from 1975 to present and nautical charts in different periods to examine the morphological evolution and its relationship with changes in river sediment loads of the Ba Lat delta lobe, located on the central coast of the second largest river system (Red) in Vietnam. We proposed a hybrid approach to estimate suspended sediment entering the sea via the Ba Lat mouth, based on a combination of one-line theory and long-term observation from a gauging station. The results show a significant reduction (similar to 91.5 %) in annual sediment load over the entire 64year estimation period (1958-2021), which is associated with the operation of large dam-reservoirs upstream. The evolution of the Ba Lat delta lobe was found to be highly correlated with sediment load, with a huge sediment supply from the Red River causing the delta lobe to move seaward at a rate of more than 100 m/yr and the deltaic land area to accrete at a rate of 117 ha/yr between 1975 and 1990. However, since the early 1990s, the annual sediment flux has reduced of 57 %, resulting in more than 50 % of the delta lobe's shoreline experiencing severe erosion. The current amount of sediment load delivered to the sea (1.4 x 106 m(3)/yr) is insufficient to prograde the delta lobe, which could lead to continued land loss in the future. We attribute these erosions mainly to the reduced river sediment supply, generated by the large dam-reservoirs located upstream of the delta. The study suggests that these results and methods can inform coastal management and enhance understanding of delta lobe evolution by providing insights into changes in shoreline position, land area, and subaqueous component.

TI  - Determination of the chemical equator from GEOS-Chem model simulation: a focus on the tropical western Pacific region
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical western Pacific (TWP) plays an important role in global stratosphere-troposphere exchange and is an active region of the interhemispheric transport (IHT). Common indicators for transport between the hemispheres like the tropical rain belt are too broad or lack precision in the TWP. In this paper, we provide a method to determine the atmospheric chemical equator (CE), which is a boundary for air mass transport between the two hemispheres in the tropics. This method used the model output from an artificial passive tracer simulated by the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem in the troposphere. We investigated the movement of the CE in the tropics, which indicates the migration of atmospheric circulation systems and air mass origins. Our results show the CE on different timescales, suggesting that the different features of the IHT in different regions are highly related to the variation in the circulation systems. We compared the CE with the tropical wind fields, indicating that the region of IHT does not coincide with the convergence of the 10m wind fields in the tropical land sectors and the TWP region. We compared the CE with the atmospheric composition such as satellite data of CH4 and model simulation of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). The results show that the CE and north-south gradient of CH4 in the Indian Ocean in January are well consistent with each other, which indicates the CE has good potential to estimate the IHT inferred by observations. We discussed the vertical extent and the meridional extent of the IHT. We find that the vertical structure above 2 km has a slight northern tilt in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter season and a southern tilt in the NH summer, meaning the seasonality of the migration of the CE at the lower altitude is larger than that at the higher altitude. The meridional extent of the CE indicates a narrow transition zone where IHT happens throughout the year. We find that the meridional extent above South America is larger compared to other regions. The distribution of the land-sea contrast plays an important role in the meridional extent of IHT. We focus on the TWP region and further compared the tropical rain belt with the CE. There is a broad region of high precipitation occurring in the TWP region, and it is difficult to determine the IHT by the rain belt. In the NH winter, the CE is not consistent with the tropical rain belt in the TWP but is confined to the southern branch of the peak of the rain belt. For the other seasons, both indicators of IHT agree.

TI  - Analysis of aerosol optical depth and relation to covariates during pre-monsoon season (2002-2019) over Pakistan using ARIMAX model and cross-wavelet analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The pre-monsoon season heavily influences the precipitation amount in Pakistan. When hydrometeorological parameters interact with aerosols from multiple sources, a radiative climatic response is observed. In this study, aerosol optical depth (AOD) space-time dynamics were analyzed in relation to meteorological factors and surface parameters during the pre-monsoon season in the years 2002-2019 over Pakistan. Level-3 (L3) monthly datasets from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) were used. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) derived monthly precipitation, Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) derived air temperature, after moist relative humidity (RH) from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version-2 (MERRA-2), near-surface wind speed, and soil moisture data derived from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) were also used on a monthly time scale. For AOD trend analysis, Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied. Moreover, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory variable (ARIMAX) technique was applied to observe the actual and predicted AOD trend, as well as test the multicollinearity of AOD with covariates. The periodicities of AOD were analyzed using continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) and the cross relationships of AOD with prevailing covariates on a time-frequency scale were analyzed by wavelet coherence analysis. A high variation of aerosols was observed in the spatiotemporal domain. The MK test showed a decreasing trend in AOD which was most significant in Baluchistan and Punjab, and the overall trend differs between MODIS and MISR datasets. ARIMAX model shows the correlation of AOD with varying meteorological and soil parameters. Wavelet analysis provides the abundance of periodicities in the 2-8 months periodic cycles. The coherency nature of the AOD time series along with other covariates manifests leading and lagging effects in the periodicities. Through this, a notable difference was concluded in space-time patterns between MODIS and MISR datasets. These findings may prove useful for shortterm and long-term studies including oscillating features of AOD and covariates.

TI  - Energy aware solution for IRS-aided UAV communication in 6G wireless networks
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid evolution of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is emerging as a promising technology for wireless network applications such as remote sensing, scalable network coverage, security surveillance, real-time monitoring, rescue, and emergency communications. Firstly, this article investigates the integration of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) technology with UAVs for next generation intelligent networks. Furthermore, a framework is proposed for the integration of IRS technology with UAV-aided communication to meet the requirements of sustainable wireless networks. The proposed system aims to achieve maximum energy efficiency for a given power level and phase shift using a power consumption model. Taking into consideration the transmit power and the power consumed by the circuit components at the base station (BS), user equipment (UE), IRS and UAV, the energy efficiency of the proposed system is evaluated for different IRS reflecting elements and different UAV locations. It is shown that a UAV equipped with 150 reflecting elements improves energy efficiency by 7.47% with 100 co-located antennas at the BS. Also, the achieved energy efficiency is maximum when the UAV is close to the BS or the communicating user equipment. The paper concludes with a use case scenario for the IRS-assisted UAVs in the context of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) in smart cities.

TI  - Bi-temporal characterization of terrestrial temperature in relation to urban land use land cover dynamics and policies in Kozhikode Urban Area, India
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The pattern of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) is shifting in an unbalanced manner due to urban growth. When cities flourish, vegetated regions are altered into impervious concrete masses. This along with other factors increases the Land Surface Temperature (LST) in urban areas, leading to the emergence of Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHIs). This study seeks to examine how the evolving patterns of LULC impact the intensity of LST and its correlation with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) in the rapidly expanding Kozhikode Urban Area (KUA). This is studied using a combination of geographic information systems, satellite remote sensing, and statistical analysis. Satellite images of Landsat 5 (TM) and Landsat 8 (OLI & TIRS) of the years 1993 and 2018 were used, respectively. ArcGIS software has been used to map the LULC pattern, LST, NDVI and NDBI. The supervised technique with the maximum likelihood algorithm is used to derive the LULC pattern, while the mono-window algorithm has been used to derive the LST. MS Excel, SPSS, and OrginPro were used for statistical analysis. The results reflect a decrease of 73.88 per cent in total vegetated areas from 1993 to 2018, while the built-up area expanded from 19.95 km2 to 132.96 km2. The mean LST increased by 2.65 degrees C from 1993 to 2018. Pearson correlation revealed LST is negatively correlated with NDVI (r =-0.541, P < 0.5 in 1993, r =-0.616, P < 0.5 in 2018) and positively correlated with NDBI (r = 0.664, P < 0.5 in 1993, r = 0.612, P < 0.5 in 2018). As a result, this paper urges urban planners and policymakers in Kozhikode to urgently address the disproportionate LULC patterns emerging in the city and implement more sustainable development measures and policies like urban greening with proper planning and effective stakeholder engagement to control the rising LST.

TI  - Connecting dryland fine-fuel assessments to wildfire exposure and natural resource values at risk
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWildland fire in arid and semi-arid (dryland) regions can intensify when climatic, biophysical, and land-use factors increase fuel load and continuity. To inform wildland fire management under these conditions, we developed high-resolution (10-m) estimates of fine fuel across the Altar Valley in southern Arizona, USA, which spans dryland, grass-dominated ecosystems that are administered by multiple land managers and owners. We coupled field measurements at the end of the 2021 growing season with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and vegetation indices acquired during and after the growing season to develop predictions of fine fuel across the entire valley. We then assessed how climate, soil, vegetation, and land-use factors influenced the amount and distribution of fine fuels. We connected fine fuels to fire management points, past ignition history, and socio-economic vulnerability to evaluate wildfire exposure and assessed how fuel related to habitat of the endangered masked bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus ridgwayi).ResultsThe high amount of fine fuel (400-3600 kg/ha; mean = 1392 kg/ha) predicted by our remote sensing model (R-2 = 0.63) for 2021 compared to previous years in the valley was stimulated by near-record high growing season precipitation that was 177% of the 1990-2020 mean. Fine fuel increased across the valley if it was contained within the wildlife refuge boundary and had lower temperature and vapor pressure deficit, higher soil organic content, and abundant annual plants and an invasive perennial grass (R-2 = 0.24). The index of potential exposure to wildfire showed a clustering of high exposure centered around roads and low-density housing development distant from fire management points and extending into the upper elevations flanking the valley. Within the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, fine fuel increased with habitat suitability for the masked bobwhite quail within and adjacent to core habitat areas, representing a natural resource value at risk, accompanied with higher overall mean fine fuel (1672 kg/ha) in relation to 2015 (1347 kg/ha) and 2020 (1363 kg/ha) means.ConclusionsBy connecting high-resolution estimates of fine fuel to climatic, biophysical and land-use factors, wildfire exposure, and a natural resource value at risk, we provide a pro-active and adaptive framework for fire risk management within highly variable and rapidly changing dryland landscapes.

TI  - Monitoring and spatial traceability of river water quality using Sentinel-2 satellite images
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to limited monitoring stations along rivers, it is difficult to trace the specific locations of high pollution areas along the whole river by traditionally in situ measurement. High-spatiotemporal-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images make it possible to routinely monitor and trace the spatial distributions of river water quality if reliable retrieval algorithms are available. This study took seven major rivers (Qiantang River (QTR), Cao'e River (CEJ), Yongjiang River (YJ), Jiaojiang River (JJ), Oujiang River (OJ), Feiyun River (FYR), and Aojiang River (AJ)) in Zhejiang Province, China, as examples to illustrate the spatial traceability of river water quality parameters (permanganate index (CODMn), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN)) from Sentinel-2 satellite images. The regional retrieval models established for these parameters (CODMn, TP and TN) provided correlation coefficients (R) of 0.68, 0.82, and 0.7, respectively. Based on these models, time-series CODMn, TP, and TN products were obtained for the seven rivers from 2016 to 2021 from Sentinel-2 satellite images, and the results show that the CODMn, TP and TN were high downstream and low upstream; exceptions the CEJ, which was slightly higher in the middle reach than other reaches, and the TN in YJ, which was higher upstream than downstream. The downstream reaches were the main areas suffering from relatively high values in most seasons. Except for the springtime TN level in CEJ, the high value areas were located along the middle reaches. In summer and autumn, the high TN areas in JJ, OJ, and AJ were located along the middle and lower reaches, and the TN in YJ was highest in the upstream. More importantly, this study revealed that the specific locations of high pollution areas along rivers can be effectively traced using Sentinel-2 satellite images, which would be helpful for precise water quality control of rivers.

TI  - BCDetNet: a deep learning architecture for building change detection from bi-temporal high resolution satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection is becoming more and more popular technology for the analysis of remote sensing data and is very important for an accurate understanding of changes that are happening in the Earth's surface. Different Deep Learning methods proposed till now are mainly focused on simple networks which results in poor detection for small changed areas because they can not differentiate between the bi-temporal image's characteristics. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel Building Change Detection Network (BCDetNet) for building object change detection and its analysis from bi-temporal high resolution satellite image. The proposed BCDetNet model can detect small change areas with the help of multiple feature extraction block. The proposed BCDetNet model executes building change detection using bi-temporal high resolution satellite images. The proposed BCDetNet model is trained on two publicly available datasets namely LEVIR and WHU change detection(CD) datasets. These datasets contain RGB images with dimensions of (1024 x 1024) and (512 x 512), respectively. The BCDetNet model can learn from scratch during training and performs better than the benchmark change detection models with fewer trainable parameters. The BCDetNet model gives Recall-94.06%, Precision-93.00%, Jaccard score-88.40%, Accuracy-98.73%, F1 score-93.52% and Kappa coefficient-87.05% on LEVIR CD dataset and Recall-89.51%, Precision -92.78%, Jaccard score - 84.38%, Accuracy-96.78%, F1 score-91.06% and Kappa coefficient - 82.12% on WHU CD dataset. This work is a step in the direction of achieving best results in building change detection from high resolution satellite images.

TI  - Long term trends at a comprehensive cancer center during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAs the ongoing public health crisis from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic puts strains on current models of cancer care, many health care centers had to adapt to minimize the risk of exposure and infection. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in a comprehensive cancer center were determined. AimsTo measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on care delivery at a comprehensive cancer center. MethodsThe number of on-site and telehealth visits (TH) were obtained from scheduling software. Multiple factors including total visits, telehealth visits, screenings for cancer diagnosis, and cancer treatments were tracked from 2 years before the pandemic onset through 2022. The length of stay (LOS) and Case Mix Index (CMI) were calculated using hospital database. ResultsIn the third quarter of FY 2020, telehealth visits (TH) represented a fifth of total patient encounters. Cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, decreased during the pandemic with number of surgeries being most affected (23% decrease in 2020 compared to the previous fiscal year). The average length of stay (LOS) was also longer with less discharges per given time during the pandemic. The increased LOS was related to increased severity of patient illnesses since CMI was higher. Screening mammograms decreased to a nadir of 58% in 2021 as compared to those screened in pre-pandemic fiscal years. ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic impacted many aspects of care, such as treatment and screenings. Many of these factors had to be postponed due to the fear of acquiring COVID-19 and access to care. The findings presented implicate that the delays and changes in cancer care during the pandemic resulted in less screening and treatment of more advanced disease.

TI  - Distribution and speed of recreational boats in Danish waters based on coastal observations and satellite images: Predicting where boats may affect harbour porpoises
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Danish coastal waters are a hotspot for recreational boating and harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), but as there is little data on the boats' speeds and distributions, it is difficult to determine where porpoises are likely to be affected by boat noise. To gain knowledge on the potential impacts of small boats we 1) used coastal observations to assess how boat speed is related to boat size, type, distance to marinas, and wave height, and 2) used satellite images to assess the spatial distribution of small boats in Kattegat, the Sound, the Belt Sea and the Western Baltic areas (see map in Sveegaard et al., 2015). This made it possible to determine how the probability of observing boats was related to distance to the coast and number of people living within a radius of 5 km from a given area. We found that boat speeds varied among marinas and that speed was positively correlated with distance to the marina. The relationship between boat speed and size depended on boat type, with motorboats being the fastest. The satellite image analysis showed that motorboats were the dominant type in coastal waters, constituting 61.4% of the observed boats. The probability of observing boats on a satellite image covering 0.25 km2 dropped from 0.13 by the shore to 0.04 at a distance of 5 km from shore. The probability of observing boats was >10% in 6.6% of the study area, and the probability of observing boats and porpoises in the same area was >10% in 3.0% of the study area. Coastal waters are important habitats for many aquatic species, e.g., fish, invertebrates and porpoises, that use sound for communication or navigation. Our study uses a combination of observation and satellite data to identity areas where boats overlap with harbour porpoise presence and thus where the animals may be affected by boat noise. The study also illustrates how combining these two methods can yield important information on the potential impacts of boats on wildlife.

TI  - Effects of cropland reclamation on soil organic carbon in China's black soil region over the past 35 years
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The long-term use of cropland and cropland reclamation from natural ecosystems led to soil degradation. This study investigated the effect of the long-term use of cropland and cropland reclamation from natural ecosystems on soil organic carbon (SOC) content and density over the past 35 years. Altogether, 2140 topsoil samples (0-20 cm) were collected across Northeast China. Landsat images were acquired from 1985 to 2020 through Google Earth Engine, and the reflectance of each soil sample was extracted from the Landsat image that its time was consistent with sampling. The hybrid model that included two individual SOC prediction models for two clustering regions was built for accurate estimation after k-means clustering. The probability hybrid model, a combination between the hybrid model and classification probabilities of pixels, was introduced to enhance the accuracy of SOC mapping. Cropland reclamation results were extracted from the land cover time-series dataset at a 5-year interval. Our study indicated that: (1) Long-term use of cropland led to a 3.07 g kg(-1) and 6.71 Mg C ha(-1) decrease in SOC content and density, respectively, and the decrease of SOC stock was 0.32 Pg over the past 35 years; (2) nearly 64% of cropland had a negative change in terms of SOC content from 1985 to 2020; (3) cropland reclamation track changed from high to low SOC content, and almost no cropland was reclaimed on the "Black soils" after 2005; (4) cropland reclamation from wetlands resulted in the highest decrease, and reclamation period of years 31-35 decreased when SOC density and SOC stock were 16.05 Mg C ha(-1) and 0.005 Pg, respectively, while reclamation period of years 26-30 from forest witnessed SOC density and stock decreases of 8.33 Mg C ha(-1) and 0.01 Pg, respectively. Our research results provide a reference for SOC change in the black soil region of Northeast China and can attract more attention to the area of the protection of "Black soils" and natural ecosystems.

TI  - Automatic Monitoring of Water Pollution from Sentinal-2 Satellite Imagery A Case Study of Mediterranean Coast, Egypt
T2  - KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is the most important source among the natural sources on the earth's surface for the health of marine and near-shore ecosystems. Assessing water pollution in coastal areas is an essential process for sustainable development. El Gharbia coast, Egypt is one of the most important coasts of Egypt. The main objective of this work is to predict the future changes of water pollution in this coast using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery of three consequent times. First, three Sentinel-2 satellite imagery of consequent dates were acquired and processed for further classification process. The maximum likelihood classification algorithm was then used to prepare the base maps for: time 1, time 2 and time 3, with ten major classes (pollutants). The classified images of time 1 and time 2 were then used to predict the time 3 water pollution map using a Markov Chain Model. After that, the final predicted water pollution map for time 3 was validated with the classified one of the same time. Finally, and compared with the water pollution map of time 3, the future ratios of all types of pollutants have been predicted. The results showed that the proposed model can simulate water pollution changes with reliable results. Based on the simulated water pollution map and by 2030, the ratios of all pollutants will increase. Accordingly, El Gharbia coast and surrounding activities can be saved from more pollution in the future.

TI  - Mapping global distribution of mangrove forests at 10-m resolution
T2  - SCIENCE BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests deliver incredible ecosystem goods and services and are enormously relevant to sus-tainable living. An accurate assessment of the global status of mangrove forests warrants the necessity of datasets with sufficient information on spatial distributions and patch patterns. However, existing datasets were mostly derived from-30 m resolution satellite imagery and used pixel-based image classification methods, which lacked spatial details and reasonable geo-information. Here, based on Sentinel-2 imagery, we created a global mangrove forest dataset at 10-m resolution, namely, High-resolution Global Mangrove Forests (HGMF_2020), using object-based image analysis and random forest classification. We then analyzed the status of global mangrove forests from the perspectives of conserva-tion, threats, and resistance to ocean disasters. We concluded the following: (1) globally, there were 145,068 km2 mangrove forests in 2020, among which Asia contained the largest coverage (39.2%); at the country level, Indonesia had the largest amount of mangrove forests, followed by Brazil and Australia. (2) Mangrove forests in South Asia were estimated to be in the better status due to the higher proportion of conservation and larger individual patch size; in contrast, mangrove forests in East and Southeast Asia were facing intensive threats. (3) Nearly, 99% of mangrove forest areas had a patch width greater than 100 m, suggesting that nearly all mangrove forests were efficient in reducing coastal wave energy and impacts. This study reports an innovative and up-to-date dataset and comprehensive infor-mation on mangrove forests status to contribute to related research and policy implementation, espe-cially for supporting sustainable development.& COPY; 2023 Science China Press.

TI  - Advances in remote sensing of freshwater fish habitat: A systematic review to identify current approaches, strengths and challenges
T2  - FISH AND FISHERIES
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Remote sensing technology offers the ability to derive information on freshwater fish habitats across broad geographic areas and has the potential to transform approaches to monitoring. However, the numerous platforms, sensors and analytical software that are available may overwhelm those interested in utilizing this important technology and thus limit its broad application and uptake. Our review is intended to shed light on the capacity of this technology to transform freshwater fish habitat monitoring by examining the fundamental characteristics of the major remote sensing technologies that have been used for characterizing freshwater habitats, conducting a systematic literature review of studies that have used remote sensing technologies to characterize freshwater fish habitats and, highlighting some of the key habitat features, fish species and regions, that have been examined. Lastly, we identify the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various remote sensing technologies that can be used, recommend future research that could help improve the use of these technologies, and, provide a series of important considerations for those who are interested in utilizing these technologies for freshwater fish habitat characterization.

TI  - Simulated Inherent Optical Properties of Aquatic Particles using The Equivalent Algal Populations (EAP) model
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Paired measurements of phytoplankton absorption and backscatter, the inherent optical properties central to the interpretation of ocean colour remote sensing data, are notoriously rare. We present a dataset of Chlorophyll a (Chl a) -specific phytoplankton absorption, scatter and backscatter for 17 different phytoplankton groups, derived from first principles using measured in vivo pigment absorption and a well-validated semi-analytical coated sphere model which simulates the full suite of biophysically consistent phytoplankton optical properties. The optical properties of each simulated phytoplankton cell are integrated over an entire size distribution and are provided at high spectral resolution. The model code is additionally included to enable user access to the complete set of wavelength-dependent, angularly resolved volume scattering functions. This optically coherent dataset of hyperspectral optical properties for a set of globally significant phytoplankton groups has potential for use in algorithm development towards the optimal exploitation of the new age of hyperspectral satellite radiometry.

TI  - Impact of satellite thickness data assimilation on bias reduction in Arctic sea ice concentration
T2  - NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of assimilating satellite-retrieved Arctic sea ice thickness (SIT) on simulating sea ice concentration (SIC) climatology in CICE5 is examined using a data assimilation (DA) system based on the ensemble optimal interpolation. The DA of the SIT satellite data of CryoSat-2 and SMOS during 2011-2019 significantly reduces the climatological bias of SIC and SIT in both sea ice melting and growing seasons. Moreover, the response of SIC to SIT change is strongly dependent on the seasons and latitudinal locations. The SIT in the inner ice zone thickens due to the SIT DA during the boreal winter wherein the SIT observation is available; the ice melting throughout the subsequent seasons is attenuated to increase SIC during the boreal summer to reduce the simultaneous SIC bias. In marginal ice zones, the positive SIT bias depicted in the control simulation is significantly reduced by SIT DA, which reduces the positive SIC bias. The idealized experiments of reducing the SIT show that the enhanced ice bottom melting process plays a crucial role in reducing the SIC; the prescribed SIT thinning increases the ice bulk salinity due to the weak gravity drainage of brine and increases the ice bulk temperature due to the decrease of the sea ice albedo. The augmentation of the ice salinity and temperature contributes to the shrinkage of the ice enthalpy, boosting the bottom melting process, which leads to SIC decrease.

TI  - Green Kingfishers as Sentinel Species for Mercury Contamination in Amazon
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mercury is a global contaminant found in the Amazon; it can be biomagnified in the aquatic trophic chain. The use of piscivorous birds for biomonitoring of mercury contamination is increasing, mainly due to the non-mobility of mercury in bird feathers. We examined the concentrations of total mercury and methylmercury in different tissues of the green kingfisher, Chloroceryle americana collected from the Teles Pires and Juruena Rivers in the southern Brazilian Amazon. We also evaluated total mercury in small Characidae fish (potential C. americana food) in the same areas. The results indicate contamination of the birds with high concentrations, on average two-times higher in the green kingfishers from the Teles Pires River compared to the Juruena River; the same results were found for the fish specimens. Fifty-eight per cent of the feather samples from the Juruena River and 90% from the Teles Pires River had total mercury concentrations above 5 & mu;g/g, a level previously associated with adverse effects related to bird breeding. The methylmercury concentration was lowest in the liver, followed by feathers and highest in muscle. Although Juruena River bird feathers had a lower total mercury concentration, > 96% of the total mercury was methylmercury, the highest amount for specimens from both rivers. Although the concentration of Hg in the muscle of the green kingfisher is higher when compared to the feather and liver, the non-invasive monitoring through analysis of samples of feathers is an efficient biomonitoring tool for evaluation of mercury contamination in tropical birds.

TI  - Quantifying stand-level clumping of boreal, hemiboreal and temperate European forest stands using terrestrial laser scanning
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Clumping is critical for quantifying the radiation regime of forest canopies, but challenging to measure. We developed a method to measure clumping index (CI) of forest stands using voxel-based estimates of leaf area density from terrestrial lidar data. Our method uses the principle of the silhouette to total area ratio (STAR), a commonly used shoot clumping correction approach. We adapted the concept to forest stands, and derived that STAR at canopy scale (STARf) is no longer simply a clumping index, but a summary variable for forest structure in general. CI can be calculated from STARf when leaf area index is known.We measured CI and STARf of 38 forest stands in Finland, Estonia, and Czechia to study the natural range of these variables, their relationships to other forest variables, and to Landsat 8 OLI surface reflectance. CI did not include clumping below voxel scale (20 cm), and ranged from 0.6 to 0.9, with the lowest values (i.e., the most clumped canopies) in conifer forests and temperate oak forests, and the highest CI values (i.e., the most random canopies) in boreal broadleaved forests. CI was closely correlated with surface reflectance in conifer forests, which may be explained by contradicting influence of clumping that decreases canopy reflectance, but increases visibility of the forest floor.From the viewpoint of forest reflectance modeling, STAR is a useful variable due to its close relationship with the photon recollision probability, i.e., the probability that a photon will interact with a canopy element after being scattered from another canopy element. The photon recollision probability is used to model the influence of forest structure on reflectance. Our method provides a physically-based means of measuring STARf, and thus the photon recollision probability, hence contributing to the development of new methods for interpreting forest canopy structure from optical remote sensing data.

TI  - An algorithm for retrieving aerosol optical depth from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager in Vietnam
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution aerosol products offer advantages over lower spatial-resolution products for monitoring pollution in urban areas and industrial zones. Therefore, in this study we develop a Landsat 8 algorithm to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) based on the MODIS Dark Target (DT) algorithm. This algorithm uses the direct surface reflectance of Landsat 8 to build a surface reflectance relationship between the visible (BLUE, RED) and short-wave infrared bands (SWIR2). AOD data from AERONET stations in the study area and AOD data from MODIS 3 km were used for validation of the estimated Landsat 8 AOD. The estimated AOD was highly correlated at most AERONET AOD, with R-2=0.98, (RMSE = 0.3), except Bac Lieu, but only had a moderate correlation with MODIS AOD which was attributed to the difference in data retrieval time and associated changes in climate conditions. This is the first high-resolution AOD retrieval in Vietnam, leading to more practical applications for air quality monitoring.

TI  - Remote sensing monitoring of total suspended solids concentration in Jiaozhou Bay based on multi-source data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended solids (TSS) concentration (mg/L) is a significant indicator of coastal water environments monitoring. First, quantitative retrieval models of TSS concentrations in Jiaozhou Bay (JZB) were developed based on Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, and the retrieved TSS concentrations in JZB from 1984 to 2021 were obtained. Then, the reliability of the retrieved TSS from Landsat and MODIS was evaluated, and the temporal and spatial variation in TSS concentration was analyzed. Finally, the main factors influencing the variation in TSS concentration in JZB were analyzed. The results show that both Landsat and MODIS retrieval models proposed in this study have good accuracies (Landsat: R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 2.09 mg/L, MAPD = 33.96%; MODIS: R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 2.54 mg/L, MAPD = 32.81%). The TSS concentration in JZB fluctuated between 1984 and 2021, showing a downward trend. The TSS concentration in JZB exhibited an obvious seasonal variation, with a higher concentration in spring and winter owing to strong winds and a lower concentration in summer and autumn. TSS decreased gradually from northwest to southeast. The average spatial variation scale of TSS monitoring in JZB was 72 m and the optimal observation time window was 10:16-12:16. Although the retrieved TSS of Landsat and MODIS were highly consistent (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 2.09 mg/L), differences were still observed. The exponential function in the retrieval models was the main reason for the large difference between Landsat TSS and MODIS TSS in the nearshore high-value area. The different spatial resolutions, image acquisition times, and signal-to-noise ratios of Landsat and MODIS were also important reasons for the differences. Wind speed was the main factor influencing the annual, seasonal, and monthly variation in TSS concentration in JZB, while the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge only had an effect on the TSS concentration during the construction period.

TI  - A regional map of mangrove extent for Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia shows losses of 44% by 1996
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Southeast Asia is home to some of the planet's most carbon-dense and biodiverse mangrove ecosystems. There is still much uncertainty with regards to the timing and magnitude of changes in mangrove cover over the past 50 years. While there are several regional to global maps of mangrove extent in Southeast Asia over the past two decades, data prior to the mid-1990s is limited due to the scarcity of Earth Observation (EO) data of sufficient quality and the historical limitations to publicly available EO. Due to this literature gap and research demand in Southeast Asia, we conducted a classification of mangrove extent using Landsat 1-2 MSS Tier 2 data from 1972 to 1977 for three Southeast Asian countries: Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia. Mangrove extent land cover maps were generated using a Random Forest machine learning algorithm that effectively mapped a total of 15,420.51 km(2). Accuracy assessments indicated that the classification for the mangrove and non-mangrove class had a producer's accuracy of 80% and 98% user's accuracy of 90% and 96%, and an overall accuracy of 95%. We found a decline of 6,830 km(2) between the 1970s and 2020, showing that 44% of the mangrove area in these countries has been lost in the past 48 years. Most of this loss occurred between the 1970s and 1996; rates of deforestation declined dramatically after 1996. This study also elaborated on the nature of mangrove change within the context of the social and political ecology of each case study country. We urge the remote sensing community to empathetically consider the local need of those who depend on mangrove resources when discussing mangrove loss drivers.

TI  - Wildland-urban interface typologies prone to high severity fires in Spain
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to complex interactions between climate and land use changes, large forest fires have increased in frequency and severity over the last decades, impacting dramatically on biodiversity and society. In southern European countries affected by demographic challenges, fire risk and danger play special relevance at the wildland-urban interfaces (WUIs), where decision-making and land management have strong socio-ecological implications. WUIs have been historically typified according to both fire occurrence probability and settlement vulnerability, but those classifications lack generality regarding fire regime components. We aim to develop an integrated and comprehensive scheme for identifying the WUI typologies most at risk to fire severity across large territories. We selected fourteen large wildfires (over than 500 ha) occurred in Spain (2016-2021) containing different WUI scenarios. First, based on a building cartography and a multi-temporal series of Sentinel-2 imagery, each WUI was delimited and spatially characterized according to building density and pre-fire fuel characteristics (type, amount, and structure). Afterwards, a decision tree regression model was applied to identify the most relevant pre-fire vegetation parameters driving burn severity. The combined effect of the selected pre-fire vegetation drivers and the building density patterns on fire severity was evaluated using linear mixed models. Finally, the WUI typologies most prone to high burn severity were recognized using Tukey post-hoc tests. Results indicated that building density, land cover class and vegetation cover fraction determined fire severity in areas close to human settlements. Specifically, isolated, scattered and sparsely clustered buildings enclosed in a high-cover shrub matrix were the WUI typologies most susceptible to high-severity fires. These findings contribute to the development of appropriate strategies to minimize the risk of severe fires in WUIs and avoid potential losses of multiple ecosystem services valuable for society.

TI  - The surface Guinea Current variability from satellite data
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The advent of satellite measurements over the recent decades has made a great contribution to the understanding of near-surface circulation and particularly to the understanding of the surface Guinea Current (GC) along the northern coast of Gulf of Guinea (GG). This study focuses on the GC variability and its relationship with the coastal upwelling from 19 years (2000-2018) of GEKCO (Geostrophic and Ekman Current Observatory) satellite data. These data reproduce the major patterns of GC along the northern GG. The GC flows eastward with a strong spatial and temporal variability with maximum intensity during boreal summer in the east of both Cape Palmas and Cape Three Points. This study showed that the geostrophic current is the dominant component of surface circulation. The Ekman current being lower component contributes also to the intensification of GC in summer. Our study showed that the intensification of GC in summer results from the concomitant acceleration of the geostrophic and wind-driven Ekman currents. Our work highlights the main patterns of GC and its role in the coastal upwelling as limiting it in the east.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Analysis of SAR-derived products to support emergency management during volcanic crisis: La Palma case study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyses the performance of SAR-based results to support emergency management operations during the volcanic crisis of La Palma island. Tajogaite eruption began on September 19th 2021 affecting a high populated area and the surrounding farmland, used for different agricultural purposes. SAR datasets obtained from Sentinel-1, COSMO-SkyMED, PAZ-TerraSAR-X and Capella satellites, were processed to calculate amplitude, coherence and differential interferograms. These results have permitted to map the morphology of the volcanic cone, the evolution of lava flows and the regional displacements. The comparison of the results obtained with the different satellites has been useful to understand their performance during an emergency scenario triggered by a volcanic eruption. COSMO-SkyMED has provided the most useful information for the analysis of the cone morphology and the lava flows. Sentinel-1 showed the best performance for regional displacements monitoring, whereas PAZ results was the second best option for all the retrieved products.

TI  - Accuracy of dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy for inguinal lymph node staging in cN0 penile cancer
T2  - EJNMMI RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPenile cancer is characterized by an early lymphatic dissemination. In intermediate and high-risk primary tumors without palpable inguinal lymph nodes, there is a 6-30% risk of micro-metastatic disease. Invasive lymph node staging in these patients is performed using dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy (DSNB). In this study, the role of DSNB in cN0 penile cancer was studied, evaluating features of sentinel lymph node (SN) visualization and outcome parameters. Patients with penile cancer without inguinal lymph node metastases who were referred for DSNB at our center between January 2015 and May 2021 and had a follow-up period of at least 18 months, were retrospectively included. After injection of 85 +/- 20 MBq [Tc-99m]Tc-nanocolloid peritumorally, dynamic, static planar and SPECT/CT imaging was performed. Primary endpoints were sensitivity of the diagnostic procedure, disease-free survival and DSNB-related adverse events. Secondary endpoints were SN detection rate, number of SNs and the number of counts of the most active SN.ResultsSeventy-seven penile DSNB procedures in 75 patients (67 +/- 11 years) were included. The detection rate of DSNB was 91% and 96% per procedure and groin, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) were 79%, 100%, 97% and 100%, respectively. More SNs were seen on SPECT/CT than on static planar imaging (1.33 vs. 1.17, p = 0.001). The mean counts per SN on static planar imaging was lower compared to SPECT/CT (1343 vs. 5008; p < 0.0001). There was a positive correlation between the total counts of the SN on the static planar image and the SPECT/CT (r = 0.79, p < 0.0001). Only one out of seventy-five patients (1%) experienced DSNB-related adverse events. After 18 months, 58 patients remained disease free (77%), 13 developed local recurrence (17%), and 4 developed lymphatic or distant metastases (5%).ConclusionDNSB is a safe diagnostic procedure with a good detection rate and in particular high negative predictive value. It can therefore prevent overtreatment of patients with negative inguinal groins on clinical examination and DSNB examination. Finally, DSNB enables an early detection of occult metastases which would not be visualized with standardized imaging modalities.

TI  - Mapping soil salinity using a combination of vegetation index time series and single-temporal remote sensing images in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of soil salinity is of great significance for agricultural safety. However, soil salinity mapping has proven difficult because of its complex causes. The vegetation index (VI) time series has great potential in soil salinity mapping on a larger scale, yet studies on the use of this index are limited. Therefore, two inversion models (Model A and Model B) are established to assess the effects of VI time series on soil salinity mapping in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). Model A is developed by combining VI time series and single-temporal remote sensing (RS) images, while Model B does not consider VI time series. The effects of VI time series are evaluated from several perspectives by comparing the performances of Model A and Model B. The results show that VI time series can improve the accuracy of soil salinity mapping. The accuracy of Model A (R2 = 0.80, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.4 mS cm-1) is better than that of Model B (R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.68 mS cm-1). In addition, the involvement of VI time series alleviates the overestimation of low-salinity soils and the underestimation of highsalinity soils, eliminating the dividing lines caused by different image times in soil salinity mapping. This study provides a large-scale, high spatial resolution (10 m), accurate soil salinity mapping method. It may help to maintain agricultural and ecological security and promote regional sustainable development.

TI  - Assessing the impact of urbanization on groundwater quality of lahore region, Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) dynamics is an important aspect of environmental studies. Lahore is one of the wide-ranging urban cities in the world experiencing rapid development in the form of unplanned urban growth and industrialization, which leads to many adverse consequences. This research focuses on the study of spatio-temporal variability of urbanization and its impact on the water quality index (WQI) in Lahore city using remote sensing (RS) and geographical information systems (GIS). Landsat images (Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI) between 2005 to 2021 were used to observe the changes in urban growth over seventeen years. GIS is used to create the LULC, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) maps, to study the urbanization impact on the WQI. The results of this study indicate that the groundwater quality of metropolitan Lahore city has significantly dropped within 17 years. The extent of the built-up area has been expanded from 22.4% to 953.04% with an increase in the poor WQI area from 1.95% to 37.89%, reveals a general decline in groundwater quality with urbanization. Indeed, the trends observed by the linear regression modelling showed a positive and negative correlation (R-2 = 0.67 and -0.74) of WQI with % of urban and vegetation areas respectively. GIS and RS tools have been found effective in assessing spatio-temporal phenomena of urbanization and its impact on groundwater quality. Furthermore, this research would be very helpful in making decisions for managing groundwater resources and illegal urban expansion in Lahore city.

TI  - Development of a hybrid model to predict air temperature over an urban area: A case study over Ahmedabad, India
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper discusses development of a hybrid model for predicting near surface air temperature (2 m) over the city scale (similar to 100 m). The model is based on the premise that temperature at each place within the city is correlated with its mean temperature. The proposed model estimates the mean temperature of a city, using the forecast generated (5 km x 5 km resolution) by regional weather prediction model viz., Weather and Research Forecast (WRF) and downscale it to city scale, using the correlations estimated from the satellite based highresolution (1 km x 1 km) surface characteristics i.e. Land Surface Temperature (LST). The downscaling coefficients at each grid (1 km x1 km) are generated by formulating the statistical relationship between the LST over the grid to the mean temperature of a city. LST from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) sensor on-board Aqua satellite during the Indian summer season (April-June) of the year 2017-2018 has been employed for this purpose. The relationship between LST and air temperature is established using the collocated satellite estimated LST and monitored air temperature observations. As a case study, the model is demonstrated for the Indian city Ahmedabad, but the same procedure can be extended for any other cities. The existence of strong urban heat island during night hours over Ahmedabad city with a temperature gradient of 45 degrees C has been found in the study. During day hours the different parts of the city depicts different temperature based on their surface characteristics. The results have been validated using the in-situ data based on the ground based observational network temporally installed at different locations of the city for the year 2022. The developed model shows that it has a potential to be used in operational mode for generating location specific extreme temperature or heat wave warning within a city.

TI  - OLCI-A/B tandem phase: evaluation of FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX)-like radiances and estimation of systematic differences between OLCI-A and OLCI-FLEX
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - During the tandem phase of Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B in summer 2018 the Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) mounted on the Sentinel-3B satellite was reprogrammed to mimics ESA's eighth Earth Explorer, the FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX). The OLCI in FLEX configuration (OLCI-FLEX) had 45 spectral bands between 500 and 792 nm. The new data set with high-spectral-resolution measurements (bandwidth: 1.7-3.7 nm) serves as preparation for the FLEX mission. Spatially co-registered measurements of both instruments are used for the atmospheric correction and the retrieval of surface parameters, e.g. the fluorescence or the leaf area index. For such combined products, it is essential that both instruments are radiometrically consistent. We developed a transfer function to compare radiance measurements from different optical sensors and to monitor their consistency.In the presented study, the transfer function shifts information gained from high-resolution "FLEX-mode" settings to information convolved with the spectral response of the normal (lower) spectral resolution of the OLCI sensor. The resulting reconstructed low-resolution radiance is representative of the high-resolution data (OLCI-FLEX), and it can be compared with the measured low-resolution radiance (OLCI-A measurements). This difference is used to quantify systematic differences between the instruments. Applying the transfer function, we could show that OLCI-A is about 2 % brighter than OLCI-FLEX for most bands of the OLCI-FLEX spectral domain. At the longer wavelengths (> 770 nm) OLCI-A is about 5 % darker. Sensitivity studies showed that the parameters affecting the quality of the comparison of OLCI-A and OLCI-FLEX with the transfer function are mainly the surface reflectance and secondarily the aerosol composition. However, the aerosol composition can be simplified as long as it is treated consistently in all steps in the transfer function.Generally, the transfer function enables direct comparison of instruments with different spectral responses even with different observation geometries or different levels of observation. The method is sensitive to measurement biases and errors resulting from the processing. One application could be the quality control of the FLEX mission; presently it is also useful for the quality control of the OLCI-FLEX data.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of cropland carbon sequestration and water loss across China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Croplands play a critical role in regulating terrestrial water and carbon cycles and provide essential social ser-vices for humans. Investigating the characteristics of water and carbon flux in cropland ecosystems offers valuable information for advancing sustainable agriculture management. Combining the up-to-date Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and cropland distribution data, this study quantified the temporal-spatial variations of evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary productivity (GPP), and ecosystem-scale water use effi-ciency (WUE) in paddy (PF) and non-paddy field (NPF) over China from 2000 to 2021. The results showed that annual ET in both PF and NPF presented an increasing trend from northwest to southeast of China, with mean annual ET totaling 625 & PLUSMN; 43 mm yr- 1 and 487 & PLUSMN; 45 mm yr- 1 in PF and NPF, respectively. The Sen's slope showed that annual ET presented significantly increasing trends (p < 0.01), with a rate of 66.7+10.9-12.2 mm yr- 1 decade- 1 in NPF and 59.8+16.6 -14.9 mm yr- 1 decade- 1 in PF. The magnitudes of the increase in annual ET mainly came from the ET increase in summer, with the quantified contribution rates of 38.4 % in PF and 50.74 % in NPF. The spatial variations of cropland annual GPP agreed well with that of annual ET. The mean annual GPP in PF and NPF was estimated at 1029 & PLUSMN; 57 gC m- 2 yr- 1 and 776 & PLUSMN; 67 gC m- 2 yr- 1 from 2000 to 2021, respectively, along with its significantly increasing trend at 84.0+15.9-14.2 gC m- 2 decade -1 and 96.3+14.2-9.7 gC m- 2 decade -1 (p < 0.01) in PF and NPF during this period, respectively. The increase in spring GPP mainly contributed to the increasing annual GPP in PF. In contrast, the rising GPP in spring and summer primarily resulted in the increasing annual GPP in NPF. The mean annual WUE is 1.65 & PLUSMN; 0.05 gC m- 2 kg-1H2O in PF and 1.59 & PLUSMN; 0.03 gC m- 2 kg-1H2O in NPF, respectively. The investigations of the variations of WUE demonstrated that both PF and NPF experienced negative trends in China, but the trends were not uniform, and disparities existed across the sub-agricultural districts. The quantified spatial and temporal patterns of how croplands trade water for carbon will help better manage agricultural water resources and ensure food security.

TI  - Urbanization shifts long-term phenology and severity of phytoplankton blooms in an urban lake through different pathways
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Climate change can induce phytoplankton blooms (PBs) in eutrophic lakes worldwide, and these blooms severely threaten lake ecosystems and human health. However, it is unclear how urbanization and its interaction with climate impact PBs, which has implications for the management of lakes. Here, we used multi-source remote sensing data and integrated the Virtual-Baseline Floating macroAlgae Height (VB-FAH) index and OTSU threshold automatic segmentation algorithm to extract the area of PBs in Lake Dianchi, China, which has been subjected to frequent PBs and rapid urbanization in its vicinity. We further explored long-term (2000-2021) trends in the phenological and severity metrics of PBs and quantified the contributions from urbanization, climate change, and also nutrient levels to these trends. When comparing data from 2011-2021 to 2000-2010, we found significantly advanced initiation of PBs (28.6 days) and noticeably longer duration (51.9 days) but an insignificant trend in time of disappearance. The enhancement of algal nutrient use efficiency, likely induced by increased water temperature and reduced nutrient concentrations, presumably contributed to an earlier initiation and longer duration of PBs, while there was a negative correlation between spring wind speed and the initiation of PBs. Fortunately, we found that both the area of the PBs and the frequency of severe blooms (covering more than 19.8 km(2)) demonstrated downward trends, which could be attributed to increased wind speed and/or reduced nutrient levels. Moreover, the enhanced land surface temperature caused by urbanization altered the thermodynamic characteristics between the land and the lake, which, in turn, possibly caused an increase in local wind speed and water temperature, suggesting that urbanization can differently regulate the phenology and severity of PBs. Our findings have significant implications for the understanding of the impacts of urbanization on PB dynamics and for improving lake management practices to promote sustainable urban development under global change.

TI  - Towards improving the precision agriculture management of the wheat crop using remote sensing: A case study in Central Non-Black Earth region of Russia
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Smart management of the wheat crop requires understanding the various variables affecting crop quality and quantity. The use of remote sensing data contributes to improve the application of precision agriculture (PA).The current paper aims to evaluate the efficiency of remote sensing in monitoring wheat growth and enhance the management practices. Three cultivation technologies for winter wheat were implemented: basic (CT1), intensive (CT2), and highly intensive (CT3) were investigated. Sentinel-2 with a resolution of 10 m was used to monitor the change in wheat growth under different management systems during 2019. The following variables: yield quantity, grain quality (measured protein and gluten), in addition, five vegetation indices: Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI), Green Leaf Index (GLI) were retrieved during the growing season. The results showed that, GCI has the highest performance in predicting crop yield where r was 0.98. In addition, the SAVI and NDVI have the same performance; r was 0.96 for both protein and gluten contents. The yield production of CT3 has increased by 3 t/ ha, in addition, the grain quality was superior compared to the CT1. The economic efficiency results showed that the CT3 was the most profitable for Moscovskaya 40 variety (WV1) with 2,72 Payback. For Nemchinovskaya 17 variety (WV2), the most profitable cultivation technology was the CT1 and CT2 with 2,44 Payback, and for the new variety Nemchinovskaya 85, the CT2 was the most profitable with the Payback of 3,03. Finally, remote sensing shows the spatial variation in crop growth, which enhances crop management to achieve optimal production in terms of quantity and quality.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - The effects of climate change on the timing of peak fall foliage in Acadia National Park
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context In recent decades, most United States' National Parks have experienced extreme temperature and precipitation regimes outside of their historical ranges of variability with unknown effects on fall phenology.Objectives We determine 1) how seasonal climate in Acadia National Park, Maine and the timing of peak fall foliage have changed between 1950 and 2021; 2) how changes in seasonal climate have affected fall foliage; and 3) how we might expect the timing of fall foliage to change given future climate projections.Methods We use ERA5-Land data to analyze changes in climate. We couple remotely sensed data with archival research to determine changes in the timing of peak fall foliage. We use multivariate regressions to understand the relationship between climate and fall foliage. We use CESM2 data to predict the timing of peak fall foliage coloration through 2060.Results Minimum temperatures, maximum temperatures, precipitation, and the number of warm nights, hot nights, warm days, hot days, and downpour days have all significantly increased (p <= 0.05). The timing of peak fall foliage is now occurring almost two weeks later (p <= 0.05). September temperature and precipitation and May precipitation were positively correlated with delayed peak fall foliage. Early October precipitation was negatively correlated. Future climate projections predict the timing of peak fall foliage to occur between October 30 and November 2 by 2060.Conclusion Understanding how climate is affecting leaf senescence both is crucial in a national park where fall tourism brings large gains to the local economy and provides key information to park managers planning for a resilient, sustainable future.

T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols over the oceanic region significantly influence Earth's energy budget and climate change. Therefore, this study examines the spatiotemporal patterns of MODIS retrieved aerosol optical depth, sea surface temperature, Chlorophyll-a, Sea-WiFS retrieved aerosol optical depth, and MERRA-2 model dust mass concentrations over the Arabian Sea (4o N-26o N to 50o E- 78o E) during the period 2002-2020. The effects of dust aerosols on phytoplankton blooms using the Mann-Kendall and Theil Sen-slope are also analyzed in this study. An increase in aerosol optical depth (AOD) was observed within the latitudes of (4o N-26o N). The AOD shows an increasing trend at 13.4% per year over the Arabian Sea (AS). The highest value of Chl-a (-7 mgm 3) was observed along the coast of Pakistan, Iran, and Oman. Moreover, a negative correlation is found between AOD and sea surface temperature (SST) along the coast of Oman and Somalia, while a strong positive correlation (-0.99) is observed between AOD and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) along the coasts of Oman and Somalia.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of marsh vegetation productivity and climatic effects in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is a vital ecological index that reflects the ecological function and carbon sequestration of marsh ecosystem. Inner Mongolia has a large area of marshes, which play a crucial role in the East Asian carbon cycle. Under the influence of climate change, the NPP of Inner Mongolian marsh has changed significantly in the past few decades, but the spatiotemporal variation in marsh vegetation NPP and how climate change affects marsh NPP remain unclear. This study explores, for the first time, the spatiotemporal variation of marsh NPP and its response to climatic change in Inner Mongolia based on the MODIS-NPP and climate datasets. We find that the long-term average annual NPP of marsh is 339.85 g.C/m(2) and the marsh NPP shows a significantly increasing trend (4.44 g.C/m(2)/a; p < 0.01) over Inner Mongolia during 2000-2020. Spatially, the most prominent increase trend of NPP is mainly distributed in the northeast of the region (Greater Khingan Mountains). The partial correlation results show that increasing autumn and summer precipitation can increase the NPP of marsh vegetation over Inner Mongolia. Regarding the temperature effects, we observe a strong asymmetric effect of maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min) temperature on annual NPP. A high spring Tmax can markedly increase marsh NPP in Inner Mongolia, whereas a high Tmin can significantly reduce it. In contrast to spring temperature effects on NPP, a high summer Tmax can decrease NPP, whereas a high T-min can increase it. Our results suggest different effects of seasonal climate conditions on marsh vegetation productivity and highlight the influences of daytime and night-time temperatures. This should be considered in simulating and predicting marsh carbon sequestration in global arid and semi-arid regions.

T2  - Turk patoloji dergisi
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Digital papillary adenocarcinoma (DPA) is a rare malignant eccrine tumor. A 62-year-old female presented with a subcutaneous nodular 1.5cm-mass in the thumb. Macroscopically, a poorly circumscribed mass containing cystic and solid components was observed. Microscopically, epithelial neoplasm consisting of tubular-cystic structures with back-to-back arrangements was observed. The lining epithelium was composed of cuboidal/columnar cells with mild atypia, with micropapillary extensions. Immunohistochemistry revealed double-layered neoplastic epithelium containing two different types of cells: basaloid/myoepithelial and luminal. We recommend two out of vimentin, HMWCK, and D2-40 for myoepithelial/basaloid cells, also CK7 and EMA for luminal/columnar cells. As the tumor had infiltrated the surgical margins, the patient underwent axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection and re-excision with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). Two additional MMS stages were required due to suspicious surgical margin positivity in the frozen sections. The operation was continued despite the risk of loss of function. Upon examination of the permanent sections, we observed no tumors in the suspected positive foci. Additionally, no tumor was found in the surgical margins. No metastasis was detected in the sentinel lymph node. We have reached 300 reported cases of DPA in the literature. We discussed the histopathological and intraoperative diagnostic pitfalls of DPA with a literature review and our experience.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving visible imagery of clouds, especially at night, is of great importance for weather forecasting and warning. This study considered full-disc data obtained by the FengYun-4B satellite with the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) as an example, and adopted a deep neural network model to simulate the full-disc visible image using observed dynamic infrared data and surface background data to compensate for missing visible image data at night. The generated daytime visible image had the same characteristics as a corresponding GeoColor image, with an R-2 value of 0.99. The simulated night-time visible light, especially in the visualization of low cloud, clearly displayed and highlighted the characteristics of low cloud and fog, and could play an important role in application to near real-time weather forecasting at night. The simulation method could also be applied to the FY-3D/MERSI and Himawari-9/AHI satellite systems and to other infrared bands, similar to the FY-4B/AGRI system.

TI  - Quantifying the relationship between urban blue-green landscape spatial pattern and carbon sequestration: A case study of Nanjing's central city
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Against the background of global warming, urban blue-green spaces (UBGS) are important carbon sequestration (CS) carriers that can reduce carbon emissions. However, previous studies on urban CS were mostly limited to urban green or blue spaces separately and lack a comprehensive consideration of the synergistic impact of UBGS on CS. In addition, research on the driving mechanism between urban blue-green spatial patterns (UBGSP) and CS has so far been insufficient. Therefore, in this study, we explored the correlation between UBGSP and CS, identified the affecting UBGSP factors, and proposed suggestions for planning design. We identified the UBGS of the central city of Nanjing based on Landsat-8, calculated the CS using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA), and analyzed the relationship between the UBGSP and CS at both class and landscape levels by establishing sets of UBGSP indicators. At the class level, the percentage of landscape and aggregation index have positive effects on CS, whereas the landscape division and shape indexes have negative effects. Moreover, edge density and area-weighted patch fractal dimension do not correlate with CS. At the landscape level, connectance can promote the CS of UBGS. Finally, we found that the largest patch index, edge density, Shannon's evenness index, patch cohesion index, and contagion have no significant effects. The results of this study contribute to the systematic optimization of UBGSPs, promote the integrated development of UBGSs, and provide references for urban planning practices and resource management.

TI  - Understanding the role of surface runoff in potential flood inundation in the Kashmir valley, Western Himalayas
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, direct runoff and Total runoff were estimated at temporal scales (2000-2018) focusing on flood potential in the catchments of Kashmir valley. The valley is recurrently prone to catastrophic floods with increased Total runoff frequency in recent decades (post-2010 periods). LANDSAT ETM+ satellite image based land use/land cover mapping exhibited the dominance of vegetation cover (46%) primarily in the peripheral hilly regions, in contrast to agricultural land (29%) and built-up (1.6%) in the elongated valley region. The high anomalous rainfall (>500 mm) in most of the catchments during 2014-2018 caused an increased runoff apparently leading to catastrophic floods inundation (as observed in 2014 with accumulated rainfall of 713 mm and cumulative Total Runoff of 55 LCM). A higher contribution towards Total Runoff in northern catchments (>56%) exhibited higher susceptibility to flood inundation as compared to the southern catchments (<42%). The study highlighted a high vulnerability in the large proportion of built-up land (148 km2) within close proximity to Jhelum river and below 1560m elevation range due to the erratic rainfall induced runoff floods. The insignificant proportion of built-up led to less contribution towards the high runoff yet increases the severity of runoff and flood inundation due to high imperviousness. The rapid built-up growth coupled with deterioration of natural wetlands in the urban-rural fringe increased the impact of catastrophic flood manifolds. The study provided a regional and comprehensive runoff assessment that can be utilized to develop adequate flood control measures at the catchment level in the valley.

TI  - Changing characteristics of ecosystem and water storage under the background of warming and humidification in the Qilian Mountains, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qilian Mountains provide an ecological security barrier, and the region is an important river runoff area in China. Water resources play an essential role in the natural environment of Northwest China. This study used daily temperature and precipitation data from meteorological stations in the Qilian Mountains from 2003 to 2019, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data. Additionally, we used the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite's monthly gravity field model data. Furthermore, we analyzed the characteristics of climate warming and humidification in the eastern, central, and western sections of the Qilian Mountains based on spatial precipitation interpolation and linear trend analysis. Finally, we examined the relationship between water storage changes and precipitation and its impact on vegetation ecology. The results revealed a significant warming and humidification trend in the western Qilian Mountains. The temperature increased significantly, and the increased precipitation rate in summer reached 1.5-3.1 mm/10a. Water storage in the Qilian Mountains displayed an increasing trend, with an increase of approximately 14.3 x 108 m3 over the 17 years study period, averaging an increase of 8.4 mm/year. The spatial distribution of water storage in the Qilian Mountains increased from north to south and east to west. There were noticeable seasonal differences, with the largest surplus occurring in the western Qilian Mountains (71.2 mm in summer). The fractional vegetation coverage in 95.2 % of the western Qilian Mountains and net primary productivity in 90.4 % of the area displayed an increasing trend, and vegetation ecology improved significantly. This study aims to investigate the characteristics of ecosystem and water storage changes in the Qilian Mountain area under the background of climate warming and humidification. The results obtained from this study provided an assessment of the vulnerability of alpine ecosystems and helped in making spa-tially explicit decisions for the rational utilization of water resources.

TI  - Fine-scale mapping of<i> Spartina</i><i> alterniflora-invaded</i> mangrove forests with multi-temporal WorldView-Sentinel-2 data fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests, a critical component of blue carbon ecosystems, make a significant contribution to mitigating climate change and maintaining biodiversity. But in China, they have been suffering from severe invasion by Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora). Accurate information on spatial distribution of mangroves and S. alterniflora is a prerequisite to protecting indigenous mangrove ecosystems and managing S. alterniflora invasion. However, the classification performance is often constrained by two major issues: (1) A single-date image, regardless of acquisition time, hardly provides optimal spectral separability among evergreen mangroves, deciduous S. alterniflora and mudflats; (2) Due to the gradual invasion process, the mixtures between land cover classes are prevalent in moderate-resolution images. The use of high-resolution (finer than 2 m) image time series could effectively solve these two issues. However, due to frequent cloud cover in coastal areas and long revisit time of high-resolution satellite sensors, the collection of high-resolution image time series is still a great challenge, let alone substantial expenses. In this study, we proposed a new multi-temporal classification approach to fine-scale mapping of exotic S. alterniflora and native mangroves using synthetic high-resolution image time series derived from spatiotemporal fusion of WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 data. A total of six synthetic WorldView-2-like images in different phenological periods were produced by the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) method. With the combination of the original and synthetic images, both types of image-based multi-temporal features and pixel-based image compositing features were extracted and evaluated in the following Random Forest classifications. Monte Carlo cross-validation was adopted to provide robust accuracy estimates, and a spatially explicit confidence map was generated to show classification uncertainty and potential errors. In order to further demonstrate the necessity of generating synthetic WorldView-2 images, the entire classification process was repeated using Sentinel-2 images at 10-m spatial resolution and the comparison between fine-and moderate resolution classification results was made in terms of classification accuracies, classification maps and fractional abundances. Our results show that the spectral profiles of S. alterniflora and mangroves generated from the synthetic WorldView-2 images were consistent with the ones from the paired Sentinel-2 images. Meanwhile, the spatial details of high landscape heterogeneity, unrecognizable in the Sentinel-2 images, were revealed by the synthetic WorldView-2 images. Compared to the single-date classification with the original WorldView-2 image, most of multi-temporal classifications using both the original and synthetic images provided more accurate results, with the overall accuracy raised by up to 3.9%. Among various temporal features adopted in this study, the use of the image-based, stacked spectral reflectance and vegetation index features of all original and synthetic images produced the best classification performance, increasing the producer's and user's accuracies of mangroves, S. alterniflora and mudflats by 2.5%-7.1%. Finally, the Sentinel-2 classification accuracies were generally lower than the WorldView-2 counterparts across all temporal features, with a 6% difference in the highest overall accuracy between the two. Prediction errors of the moderate-resolution classification were often found in heterogeneous landscapes, where S.alterniflora was mixed with mangroves or mudflats. Considering the availability of moderate-resolution data with high revisit frequencies, such as Sentinel-2A/B and Landsat 8/9, future fine scale mapping exercises might benefit from the multi-temporal classification approach with spatiotemporal fusion of moderate-and high-resolution data, alleviating the problem of the scarcity of high-resolution data in cloudy areas.

TI  - Genome-wide temporal landscaping of DNA methylation in pregnant women delivering at term: a GARBH-InI study
T2  - EPIGENOMICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: We performed an epigenome-wide longitudinal DNA methylation study on an Indian cohort of pregnant women, GARBH-Ini, at three time points during pregnancy and at delivery. Aim & objective: Our aim was to identify temporal DNA methylation changes in maternal peripheral blood during the period of gestation and assess their impact on biological pathways critical for term delivery. Results: Significantly differentially methylated CpGs were identified by linear mixed model analysis (Bonferroni p < 0.01) and classified into two distinct temporal methylation trends: increasing and decreasing during gestation. Genes with upward methylation trend were enriched for T-cell activity, while those with a downward trend were enriched for solute transport and cell structure organization functions. Conclusion: Consistent trends of DNA methylation in maternal peripheral blood point to the sentinel function of T cells in the maintenance of pregnancy, and the importance of coordinated cellular remodeling to facilitate term delivery.Plain language summaryDNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the molecular structure of DNA, which then alters the gene expression. The goal of the study was to find out how DNA methylation patterns change over time during pregnancy and how these changes are related to the biological processes that are important for the delivery of a healthy baby at full term. Using statistical modeling, we identified specific patterns of DNA methylation changes during pregnancy and classified them into two groups based on the direction of the changes. The genes associated with increasing methylation levels were related to the activities of T cells, which are important for the immune system. The genes associated with decreasing methylation levels were related to processes like transporting substances and organizing cell structures. In conclusion, our findings suggest that T cells play an important role in maintaining a healthy pregnancy, and the study highlights the importance of coordinated changes in cells to support a successful delivery of a baby at term.Tweetable abstractStudy on Indian women during pregnancy reveals DNA methylation changes over time.

TI  - An approach to estimating forest biomass while quantifying estimate uncertainty and correcting bias in machine learning maps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Providing forest biomass estimates with desired accuracy and precision for small areas is a key challenge to incorporating forest carbon offsets into commodity trading programs. Enrolled forest carbon projects and verification entities typically rely on probabilistically sampled field data and design-based (DB) estimators to estimate carbon storage and characterize uncertainty. However, this methodology requires a large amount of field data to achieve sufficient precision and collection of these data can be prohibitively expensive. This has spurred interest in developing regional-scale maps of forest biomass that incorporate remote sensing data as an alternative to collecting expensive plot data. These maps are often generated using machine learning (ML) algorithms that combine remote sensing products and field measurements. While these maps can produce estimates across large geographic regions at fine spatial resolutions, the estimates are prone to bias and do not have associated uncertainty estimates. Here, we assess one such map developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Carbon Monitoring System. We consider model-assisted (MA) and geostatistical model-based (GMB) estimators to address map bias and uncertainty quantification. The MA and GMB estimators use a sample of field observations as the response, and the ML-produced map as an auxiliary variable to achieve statistically defensible predictions. We compare MA and GMB estimator performance to DB and direct (DR) estimators. This assessment considers both counties and a small areal extent experimental forest, all within Oregon USA. Results suggest the MA and GMB estimators perform similar to the DB estimator at the state level and in counties containing many field plots. But in counties with moderate to small field sample sizes, the GMB and MA estimators are more precise than the DB estimator. As within-county sample sizes get smaller, the GMB estimator tends to outperform MA. Results also show the DR estimator's state-level estimates are substantially larger than the DB, MA and GMB estimates, indicating that that the DR estimator may be biased. When assessing the GMB estimator for the experimental forest, we find the GMB estimator has sufficient precision for stand-level carbon accounting even when no field observations are available within the stand. Plot-level GMB uncertainty interval coverage probabilities were estimated and showed adequate coverage. This suggests that the GMB estimator is producing statistically rigorous uncertainty estimates.

T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The contribution of this paper is to assess the drought patterns using the Land Surface Temperature (LST) estimation index and examine the correlation between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the LSTV estimation index. The main objective was to evaluate the spatiotemporal variation in agricultural drought patterns and severity in order to estimate and measure climate variability. According to the study's findings, the region experienced mild to severe meteorological drought periods 15-18 times over the study period. The majority of these periods (62.72%) were classified as mild drought (unusual dry circumstances), which usually only showed a slight departure from the distribution of rainfall that is close to normal. According to the findings, cropping seasons from 2013 to 2022 saw an increase in agricultural dryness and a decrease in grain yield, with varying degrees of severity in different geographic locations. Based on the result, the major difficulties and challenges identified were the shortage of drinking water, and impacts on air quality, and food and nutrition. Accordingly, agricultural drought risk mapping can be utilized to mitigate the risk associated with drought on agricultural productivity and guide decision-making processes in drought monitoring.

TI  - Floating Debris in the Northern Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Katrina
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing and spectroscopy are usedto detect and quantifyfloating debris after a category-5 hurricane, paving the way for post-hurricaneenvironmental assessment using remote sensing techniques.Hurricane Katrina(category 5 with maximum wind of 280km/h whenthe eye is in the central Gulf of Mexico) made landfall near New Orleanson August 29, 2005, causing millions of cubic meters of disaster debris,severe flooding, and US$125 billion in damage. Yet, despite numerousreports on its environmental and economic impacts, little is knownabout how much debris has entered the marine environment. Here, usingsatellite images (MODIS, MERIS, and Landsat), airborne photographs,and imaging spectroscopy, we show the distribution, possible types,and amount of Katrina-induced debris in the northern Gulf of Mexico.Satellite images collected between August 30 and September 19 showelongated image features around the Mississippi River Delta in a regionbounded by 92.5 & DEG;W-87.5 & DEG;W and 27.8 & DEG;N-30.25 & DEG;N.Image spectroscopy and color appearance of these image features indicatethat they are likely dominated by driftwood (including constructionlumber) and dead plants (e.g., uprooted marsh) and possibly mixedwith plastics and other materials. The image sequence shows that ifaggregated together to completely cover the water surface, the maximaldebris area reached 21.7 km(2) on August 31 to the east ofthe delta, which drifted to the west following the ocean currents.When measured by area in satellite images, this perhaps representsa historical record of all previously reported floating debris dueto natural disasters such as hurricanes, floodings, and tsunamis.

TI  - Update on advanced interventional neuromodulatory approaches to lower blood pressure
T2  - HEART
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Herein, we review interventional peripheral neuromodulatory approaches to reduce blood pressure (BP), specifically focusing on catheter-based renal denervation (RDN), as well as the latest data from recent clinical trials underpinning its clinical use. Given the apparent failure of established lifestyle measures and pharmacologic BP-lowering approaches to improve hypertension (HTN) control rates, the past decade has seen remarkable scientific efforts to explore the utility of interventional strategies for BP management. Experimental studies and human clinical trials have demonstrated the crucial role of the sympathetic nervous system in the development and mainenance of HTN - consequently, most recent interventional technologies aimed primarily at modulating neural pathways. Advanced approaches that were rigorously tested in human studies include RDN, endovascular baroreflex amplification, baroreflex activation therapy and cardiac neuromodulation stimulation.Amongst these, RDN is by far the most established technology. With recent robust evidence from clinical trials and real-world data showing the safety and efficacy of both ultrasound and radiofrequency-based approaches, a recent clinical consensus statement of the European Society of Cardiology Council on Hypertension and the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions concludes that RDN represents an ancillary therapeutic option in patients with uncontrolled resistant HTN confirmed by ambulatory blood pressure measurement and in spite of attention to lifestyle changes and optimised pharmacological treatment. Furthermore, RDN could alos be considered for patienst unlikley to adhere to or tolerate long-term antihypertensive drug treatment. Very recent data indicate long-term safety and efficacy up to 10 years. Appropriate implementation of RDN into clinical practice is now warranted.For all other interventions additional data from adequately designed human studies are required to establish their safety and clinical utility for potential future use in routine practice.

TI  - Relationship between carbon pool changes and environmental changes in arid and semi-arid steppe-A two decades study in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As the arid and semi-arid grassland with the most extensive distribution area in northern China, the carbon stored in Inner Mongolia (IM) grassland is highly susceptible to environmental changes. With the global warming and drastic climate changes, exploring the relationship between carbon pool changes and environmental changes and their spatiotemporal heterogeneity is necessary. This study estimates the carbon pool distribution of IM grassland during 2003-2020 by combining the measured below ground biomass (BGB) dataset, measured soil organic carbon (SOC) dataset, multi-source satellite remote sensing data products, and random forest regression modeling method. It also discusses the variation trend of BGB/SOC and its correlation with critical environmental factors, vegetation condition factors and drought index. The results show that the BGB/SOC in IM grassland was stable during 2003-2020, with a weak upward trend. The correlation analysis reveals that high temperature and drought environment were unfavorable for developing vegetation roots and would lead to a decrease in BGB. Furthermore, temperature rise, soil moisture decrease, and drought adversely effected grassland biomass and SOC in areas with low altitude, high SOC density, suitable temperature and humidity. However, in areas with relatively poor natural environments and relatively low SOC content, SOC was not significantly affected by environmental deterioration and even showed an accumulation trend. These conclusions provide directions for SOC treatment and protection. In areas where SOC is abundant, it is important to reduce carbon loss caused by environmental changes. However, in areas with poor SOC, due to the high carbon storage potential of grasslands, carbon storage can be improved through scientifically managing grazing and protecting vulnerable grasslands.

TI  - General features of multi-parameter anomalies of six moderate earthquakes occurred near Zhangbei-Bohai fault in China during the past decades
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The great Zhangbei-Bohai fault (ZBF) is an important seismic active zone in Northeastern China, which intersects with another great fault, namely Tancheng-Lujiang fault (TLF), in the Central Bohai Sea. Most of the previous studies only investigated the earthquakes (EQs) happened in the west section of ZBF and anomalies appeared in the land area, but few researchers focused on the EQs happened in the east section of ZBF and studied the anomalies appeared above the Bohai Sea. Recently, we have investigated the disturbances on and above the Bohai Sea associated with the Zhangbei Mb5.6 EQ in 1998, whose epicenter located in the west section of ZBF, and found that there was seismicity induced gas release from submarine TLF. To study further the multiparameter anomalies of EQs near ZBF during past decades and their relationship with ZBF and TLF, a scrutiny strategy for seismic anomaly in the sea area was proposed in this study. After comprehensive screening of EQs occurred near ZBF from 1998 to 2022 using multi-source remote sensing data, potential seismic anomalies including the anomalies of microwave brightness temperature and sea surface roughness on Bohai Sea were found correlated with 6 of the 23 investigated EQs, and there were commonly anomalies of CO and CH4 concentration in the atmosphere. All these seismic anomalies were found developing mainly along the TLF in Bohai Sea, and started usually before shocking, appeared co-seismically and in the next few days. Regional inconsistencies among the distribution of CO and CH4 anomalies could be owning to the specific underwater reservoir in the Bohai Bay Basin. Though analyzing the focal mechanism solutions of the selected EQ cases, we found that the seismic anomaly existed only when the TLF was in a stress state of tensile relaxation.

TI  - A novel framework for combining polarimetric Sentinel-1 InSAR time series in subsidence monitoring-A case study of Sydney
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growth of the city of Sydney, Australia over the last decades, has led to significant development of residential and transportation infrastructure. Land subsidence associated with the urban development can lead to serious issues which should be thoroughly understood and carefully managed. To address this challenge, an enhanced polarisation time-series InSAR (Pol-TS-InSAR) processing framework was developed, using the dual polarisation (DP) Sentinel-1 data to integrate information from different polarimetric channels with different weighting during the TS-InSAR deformation analysis. Ninety DP Sentinel-1 images acquired between 2019 and 2022 are analysed using Pol-TS-InSAR to map the land subsidence in Sydney, with the assistance of the GPS measurements. Improvement of measurement points density from Pol-TS-InSAR is observed compared to the single polarimetric TS-InSAR counterpart for all land use types (ranging between 68% and 208%). The com-parison between the Pol-TS-InSAR measurements and GPS measurements shows an absolute mean difference and RMS difference of 0.75 mm/yr and 0.95 mm/yr, respectively, in vertical direction. The results of the ground subsidence analysis revealed that the main subsidence factors in Sydney are related to groundwater extraction, mining activities, underground tunnel construction and landfill. The latter two factors were less well-known prior to this study. In additional to these factors, land subsidence related to high-rise building construction has also been observed, even though the impact seems to be less significant than other factors.

TI  - Estimation of the Sea State Bias Using the Interpolation Method and Applications to Inter-Mission Calibration
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - An alternative approach to empirical, non-parametric sea state bias (SSB) modeling for satellite altimeter measurements was developed with the intention of providing a simple, transparent, and efficient means to derive both a raw and smoothed SSB solution. This alternative approach, referred to as the interpolation method, maintains the flexibility to generate 2-D or 3-D models using either direct or difference measurements of the sea level anomaly uncorrected for SSB (uSLA). The final, smoothed SSB solution derived using the interpolation method is obtained over three steps, with a supplemental fourth step that consists of estimating a model-dependent dual-frequency ionosphere calibration bias to correct for a relative range + SSB error. A tandem phase analysis for all Topex/Poseidon, Jason 1-3 and Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite altimeter inter-calibration periods reveals that the ionosphere calibration bias removes an ionosphere-related component from intermission bias calculations required to generate the long-term sea level record.

TI  - Eclipse timing variations in the WD plus dM eclipsing binary RR Cae
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the binary model and the eclipse timing variations of the eclipsing binary RR Cae, which consists of a white dwarf eclipsed by an M-type dwarf companion. The multiwavelength optical photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the 0.6-m PROMPT-8 telescope, and the 0.7-m Thai Robotic Telescope at Spring Brook Observatory, combined with archive H & alpha; radial velocities from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) are analysed. From the data, the physical parameters of the system are obtained along with 430 new times of minima. The TESS light curves in 2018 and 2020 show out-of-eclipse variations, which might be caused by a large spot on the secondary component. The light travel time effect models due to the gravitational interaction of one or two circumbinary objects are adopted to fit the cyclic variations in the RR Cae's O-C curve. The fitting solution of the O-C curve with one circumbinary object model shows a periodic variation with a period of 16.6 & PLUSMN; 0.2 yr and an amplitude of 14 & PLUSMN; 1 s, which can be caused by a planet with a minimum mass of 3.4 & PLUSMN; 0.2 M-Jup. When we consider the model with two circumbinary objects, the O-C curve shows cyclic variations with periods of 15.0 & PLUSMN; 0.5 yr and 39 & PLUSMN; 5 yr and amplitudes of 12 & PLUSMN; 1 s and 20 & PLUSMN; 5 s, respectively, corresponding to minimum masses of 3.0 & PLUSMN; 0.3 M-Jup and 2.7 & PLUSMN; 0.7 M-Jup.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring of maize grain quality based on remote sensing data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data have been widely used to monitor crop development, grain yield, and quality, while precise monitoring of quality traits, especially grain starch and oil contents considering meteorological elements, still needs to be improved. In this study, the field experiment with different sowing time, i.e., 8 June, 18 June, 28 June, and 8 July, was conducted in 2018-2020. The scalable annual and inter-annual quality prediction model for summer maize in different growth periods was established using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), which combined hyperspectral and meteorological data. Compared with the multiple linear regression (MLR) using vegetation indices (VIs), the prediction accuracy of HLM was obviously improved with the highest R-2, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.90, 0.10, and 0.08, respectively (grain starch content (GSC)); 0.87, 0.10, and 0.08, respectively (grain protein content (GPC)); and 0.74, 0.13, and 0.10, respectively (grain oil content (GOC)). In addition, the combination of the tasseling, grain-filling, and maturity stages further improved the predictive power for GSC (R-2 = 0.96). The combination of the grain-filling and maturity stages further improved the predictive power for GPC (R-2 = 0.90). The prediction accuracy developed in the combination of the jointing and tasseling stages for GOC (R-2 = 0.85). The results also showed that meteorological factors, especially precipitation, had a great influence on grain quality monitoring. Our study provided a new idea for crop quality monitoring by remote sensing.

TI  - Estimating wheat grain yield by assimilating phenology and LAI with the WheatGrow model based on theoretical uncertainty of remotely sensed observation
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assimilating remotely sensed observation into crop model solves the model parameterization in regional scale by considering the uncertainty of observation and simulation. However, a fixed value of observation uncertainty could not describe the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of observation error. This study developed a method to estimate wheat yield in China by assimilating remotely sensed observation into WheatGrow model. A dynamic background value of WheatGrow and a theoretical uncertainty of remotely sensed observation were proposed, and a strategy assimilating phenology and LAI hierarchically was applied at county and plot scales. At the county scale, phenology was estimated using the time sequence of PlanetScope images, sowing date was estimated using one-class support vector classification, heading and maturity date were estimated using function-fitting method. The revisiting cycle of PlanetScope was used to determine the theoretical uncertainty of remotely sensed observed sowing date (RS-sowing date), while the uncertainty in RS-heading and RS-maturity dates were calculated using field measurements. LAI was estimated using Sentinel-2 images. The theoretical uncertainty of remotely sensed observed LAI (RS-LAI) was developed using a synthetic dataset. At the plot scale, RS-heading date and RS-LAI were estimated using the same method as for the county scale based on images obtained with a RedEdge-MX camera carried by drone. The results indicated that the theoretical uncertainty sufficiently estimated the trend of LAI error with canopy density. The assimilation strategies based on theoretical uncertainty relieved the error propagation caused by poor parameterization of model background value and the RS obser-vation error in dense canopy, outperforming the results based on constant uncertainty. After hierarchical assimilation based on theoretical uncertainty, the root mean square errors of phenology, LAI and yield were 4.3 d, 0.75, and 825 kg/ha at the county scale, and 4.1 d, 0.57 and 969 kg/ha at the plot scale. These results showed that the hierarchical assimilation based on theoretical uncertainty could improve the accuracy of yield estimation.

TI  - Impact of Right Ventricular Surface Area-to-Volume Ratio on Ventricular Remodeling After Pulmonary Valve Replacement
T2  - PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimal reverse remodeling of the right ventricle (RV), a sentinel goal of pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot, is not fully predicted by volume-based pre-PVR parameters. Our objectives were to characterize novel geometric RV parameters in patients receiving PVR and in controls, and to identify associations between these parameters and chamber remodeling post-PVR. Secondary analysis was performed on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) data from 60 patients enrolled in a randomized trial of PVR with and without surgical RV remodeling. 20 healthy age-matched subjects served as controls. The primary outcome was optimal post-PVR RV remodeling (end-diastolic volume index (EDVi) & LE; 114 ml/m(2) and ejection fraction (EF) & GE; 48%) vs. suboptimal remodeling (EDVi & GE; 120 ml/m(2) and EF & LE; 45%). RV geometry was markedly different at baseline in PVR patients compared with controls, with lower systolic surface area-to-volume ratio (SAVR) (1.16 & PLUSMN; 0.26 vs.1.44 & PLUSMN; 0.21 cm(2)/mL, p < 0.001) and lower systolic circumferential curvature (0.87 & PLUSMN; 0.27 vs. 1.07 & PLUSMN; 0.30 cm(- 1), p = 0.007) but similar longitudinal curvature. In the PVR cohort, higher systolic SAVR was associated with higher RVEF both pre- and post-PVR (p < 0.001). Among PVR patients, 15 had optimal and 19 had suboptimal remodeling post-PVR. Multivariable modeling showed that among the geometric parameters, higher systolic SAVR (OR 1.68 per 0.1 cm(2)/mL increase; p = 0.049) and shorter systolic RV long-axis length (OR 0.92 per 0.1 cm increase; p = 0.035) were independently associated with optimal remodeling. Compared with controls, PVR patients have lower SAVR and lower circumferential but not longitudinal curvature. Higher pre-PVR systolic SAVR is associated with optimal remodeling post-PVR.

TI  - Cultivating inequality? Regional rubber dynamics and implications for voluntary sustainability programs in Lao PDR
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southeast Asian rubber boom beginning in the early 20000s shaped a myriad of socioeconomic and environmental consequences, including deforestation, ecosystem impacts, shifts in community livelihoods, and altered local access to land and resources. Although there has been significant research assessing rubber production in this region, there has been less focus on economic inequality and polarization outcomes in rubber producing areas. This analysis explores the extent to which rubber production growth was associated with changes in rural economic inequality and polarization from 2007/08 to 2012/13, using Lao PDR as a case study. We also investigate the implications of these changes for voluntary sustainability programs focused on rubber production. We achieve this through a synthesis of land use change and economic data. First, we estimate rubber plantation extent based on Landsat time series data and supervised classification. We combine this with household expenditures data from the Laos Expenditure and Consumption Survey from 2007/08 to 2012/13, conducting Gini decomposition and Duclos Esteban Ray Index calculations to explore economic inequality and polarization in rubber and non-rubber producing areas. Our results indicate that rubber areas experience greater inequality and polarization compared to non-rubber areas. The Northern, Central, and Southern regions experience different economic inequality and polarization outcomes - inequality-enhancing effects appear to be greatest in the South, where large-scale concessions dominate rubber production. We assess the implications of our findings for voluntary rubber sustainability programs, arguing that these programs should address systemic drivers of inequality and polarization, including dispossession from land and forest resources, insufficient worker protections, livelihood vulnerability, and barriers for smallholders. Overall, our results underscore the importance of strong regulation, multi-stakeholder action, and environmental and social performance criteria in rubber production.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Mid-IR spectral properties of different surfaces of silicate mixtures before and after excimer laser irradiation
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The behaviour of the Christiansen feature (CF) and the Reststrahlen bands (RBs) in mid-infrared (IR) reflectance spectra on various silicate mixtures as pressed pellets and powders was investigated in high-vacuum. In addition, the influence of micrometeorite bombardment simulated with an excimer laser was studied. The mixtures cover a wide range of possible hermean surface compositions and include the minerals olivine, pyroxene (enstatite and diopside), and plagioclase. For the laser experiments, silicates were pressed into pellets and examined by reflectance infrared spectros-copy to identify changes caused by micrometeorite impacts as one tracer of space weathering on airless bodies such as Mercury. For comparison, measurements were also performed on loose powders with the same com-positions under the same conditions. As a result, it can be shown that the RBs of olivine are rather affected by laser irradiation although SEM investigations show the destruction mainly of plagioclase, indicating that the RBs of plagioclase are masked by the "stronger" RBs of olivine and pyroxene. Furthermore, we found that the CF in mixtures with a plagioclase content of >50% does not shift significantly towards the CF of pyroxene or olivine. On the other hand, the CF of a mixture containing 50% olivine shifts significantly to shorter wavelengths when pyroxene or plagioclase are present in the mixture. Therefore, care is required when interpreting remote sensing data using the CF alone. We also found that the CF shifts to longer wavelengths in rough (regolithic) samples. Our work demonstrates large dependencies of the CF and the RBs positions on the composition of the silicates as well as on the nature of the surface, which is important for space missions, e.g., data acquired by the MErcury Radiometer and Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (MERTIS) experiment onboard BepiColombo.

TI  - Cloud type frequency over Poland (2003-2021) revealed by independent satellite-based (MODIS) and surface-based (SYNOP) observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have identified several statistically significant trends in cloud genera frequency over Poland. Notably, there has been an increase in high and convective clouds, along with a decrease in Stratus, Altostratus and Nimbostratus. These earlier studies were, however, only based on traditional, surface data. As the ability to observe mid and high-level clouds from the ground is limited, due to overlapping, we address the question of whether these trends are confirmed by other sources of cloud data, such as satellite records. In this paper, we analyse cloud data from two fully independent sources to characterize the cloud type climatology over Poland for the period 2003-2021: cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud top pressure (CTP) parameters retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and surface (SYNOP) observations of cloud genera from the country's 27 ground-based stations. The International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) COT-CTP classification was used to define MODIS cloud types. We explore the hypothesis that MODIS data, classified using the ISCCP philosophy, confirms the changes in cloud type frequencies found in SYNOP observations. Our analysis is based on the application of the Spearman rank correlation test to mean monthly SYNOP and MODIS cloud type frequencies, and we compare per decade trends for two time series. Our hypothesis was confirmed, but only for Cirrus, Altostratus + Nimbostratus and Cumulus. We therefore conclude that the two analysed data sources are not fully consistent, and cannot substitute for each other in cloud type climatologies. Hence, at least for Poland, they should be treated as independent rather than complementary. We also demonstrate that the increase in high-level cloud frequency over Poland, which has been observed by other authors who based their research on synoptic data, is not due to a decrease in the frequency of low- and mid-level clouds. Our findings are confirmed by satellite records.

TI  - Intercomparison of snow water equivalent products in the Sierra Nevada California using airborne snow observatory data and ground observations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Whereas many independent methods are used to estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) and its spatial distribution and seasonal variability, a need exists for a systematic characterization of inter-model differences at annual, seasonal, and regional scales necessary to quantify the associated uncertainty in these datasets. This study conducts a multi-scale validation and comparison, based on Airborne Snow Observatory data, of five state-of-the-art SWE datasets in the Sierra Nevada, California, including three SWE datasets from retrospective models: an INiTial REConstruction model (REC-INT), an improved REConstruction model based on the ParBal energy balance model (REC-ParBal), and a Sierra Nevada SWE REConstruction with Data Assimilation (REC-DA), and two operational SWE datasets from the U.S. National Weather Service, including the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) and the National Water Model (NWM-SWE). The results show that REC-DA and REC-ParBal provide the two most accurate estimates of SWE in the snowmelt season, both with small positive biases. REC-DA provides the most accurate spatial distribution of SWE (R (2) = 0.87, MAE = 66 mm, PBIAS = 8.3%) at the pixel scale, while REC-ParBal has the least basin-wide PBIAS (R (2) = 0.79, MAE = 73 mm, PBIAS = 4.1%) in the snowmelt season. Moreover, REC-DA underestimates peak SWE by -5.8%, while REC-ParBal overestimates it by 7.5%, when compared with the measured peak SWE at snow pillow stations across the Sierra Nevada. The two operational SWE products-SNODAS and NWM-SWE-are less accurate. Furthermore, the inter-model comparison reveals a certain amount of disagreement in snow water storage across time and space between SWE datasets. This study advances our understanding of regional SWE uncertainties and provides critical insights to support future applications of these SWE data products and therefore has broad implications for water resources management and hydrological process studies.

TI  - Improving lake chlorophyll-a interpreting accuracy by combining spectral and texture features of remote sensing
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms in lakes fueled by increasing eutrophication have garnered global attention, and high-precision remote sensing retrieval of chlorophyll-a (Chla) is essential for monitoring eutrophication. Previous studies have focused on the spectral features extracted from remote sensing images and their relationship with chlorophyll-a concentrations in water bodies, ignoring the texture features in remote sensing images which is beneficial to improve interpreting accuracy. This study explores the texture features in remote-sensing images. It proposes a retrieval method for estimating lake Chla concentration by combining spectral and texture features of remote sensing images. Remote sensing images from Landsat 5 TM and 8 OLI were used to extract spectral bands combination. The gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of remote sensing images was used to obtain a total of 8 texture features; then, three texture indices were calculated using texture features. Finally, a random forest regression was used to establish a retrieval model of in situ Chla concentration from texture and spectral index. Results showed that texture features are significantly correlated with lake Chla concentration, and they can reflect the temporal and spatial distribution change of Chla. The retrieval model combining spectral and texture indices performs better (MAE = 15.22 & mu;g & BULL;L-1, bias = 9.69%, MAPE = 47.09%) than the model without texture features (MAE = 15.76 & mu;g & BULL;L-1, bias = 13.58%, MAPE = 49.44%). The proposed model performance varies in different Chla concentration ranges and is excellent in predicting higher concentrations. This study evaluates the potential of incorporating texture features of remote sensing images in lake water quality estimation and provides a novel remote sensing method to better estimate lake Chla concentration.

TI  - Evaluation of the Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System in Sentinel Sites in Cameroon
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The purpose of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance is to guide clinical decision-making, characterize trends in resistance infections, and provide epidemiological data to study the impact of AMR on health and the effectiveness of control measures in health facilities and the community. To do this, regular and relevant assessments of standardized AMR surveillance systems are essential to prioritize threats and improve their performance and cost-effectiveness. The scarcity of data and the absence of a local and national strategy on the surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Sub-Saharan Africa and even more so in Cameroon do not allow an effective response to be carried out against the scourge. This gap led us to conduct a study on the evaluation of the attributes of the antibiotic resistance surveillance system in Cameroon.Methodology We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study over a period of one year from January to December 2021. The study was conducted in the sentinel sites of surveillance in Cameroon, namely, those of the Centre, South-West, Littoral, and North regions. Using structured questionnaires and a pre-established and pretested interview guide, we collected data that allowed us to assess a surveillance system's quantitative and qualitative attributes according to the CDC guidelines. Scores were assigned based on the different questionnaires to assess the attributes of the AMR surveillance system.Results Of the evaluated attributes, it appears that although the system is useful (88.9%, i.e., a score of 2), and has good completeness of data transmission (98.9%, i.e., a score of 3), it is not simple (64.3%, i.e., a score of 1), not stable (58.6%, i.e., a score of 1), not acceptable (58.6%, i.e., a score of 1), and presents poor data quality (11.05%, a score of 1).Conclusions The AMR surveillance system in Cameroon is useful with good completeness. However, many other attributes have poor performance, indicating the importance of improving the antimicrobial surveillance system.

TI  - Could axillary lymph node dissection be omitted in the mastectomy patient with tumor positive sentinel node?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundRecent data from the ACOSOG Z0011 trial suggest that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) may not be necessary for patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) receiving breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with irradiation. However, consensus statements and guidelines have recommended that patients undergoing mastectomy with tumor-positive sentinel node undergo completion ALND. In this study, we compared the locoregional recurrence rate of patients with tumor-positive sentinel nodes among three groups: mastectomy with SLNB, mastectomy with ALND and BCS with SLNB. MethodWe identified 6,163 women with invasive breast cancer who underwent surgical resection at our institution between January 2000 and December 2011. Clinicopathologic data obtained from the prospectively collected medical database were analyzed retrospectively. Among the patients with sentinel node positive, mastectomy with SLNB was performed in 39 cases, mastectomy with ALND in 181 cases, and BCS with SLNB in 165 cases. The primary end point was the loco-regional recurrence rate. ResultsClinicopathologic characteristics were similar among the groups. There were no cases of loco-regional recurrence in the sentinel groups. At a median follow-up of 61.0 months (last follow-up May 2013), the loco-regional recurrence rate of each group was 0% for BCS with SLNB and mastectomy with SLNB only, and 1.7% for mastectomy with ALND (p=0.182). ConclusionIn our study, there was no significant difference in loco-regional recurrence rates between groups. This result lends weight to the argument that SLNB without ALND may be a reasonable management for selected patients with appropriate surgery and adjuvant systemic therapy.

The current study aimed to detect the spatiotemporal changes of surface urban heat islands (SUHI) in Tehran metropolis during the daytime/nighttime at monthly and seasonal scales and over the warm and cold periods of the year. The consequences of many elements like as daytime/nighttime land surface temperature (LST) extracted by the MODIS/006/MOD11A1 and the NDVI extracted by MODIS/006/MOD13A2 over a 20-year period (2001-2020) were first investigated. Then, the SUHI index was computed for the study area. The correlations between the heat islands and urban land use (traffic, population density, airport, etc.), air pollutants (CO, NO2, SO2, etc.), and NDVI were investigated in the next stage. Finally, Moran's algorithm was used to measure the spatial autocorrelation, and Gi statistic was used to analyze the cold and warm spots. The results indicated that the LST trend was constant during the daytime/nighttime, and the NDVI also had a slight rising trend. The results of the SUHI maps indicated that the zones with heat islands during the daytime over the seasons' warm and cold times are located in the south, southeast, and west of the city. During the nighttime, the central zones of the city as well as some parts in the east and southeast have had higher heat islands. The results of the correlation between the heat islands and land use, vegetation, and air pollutants indicated a direct correlation between the heat islands and the airport and industrial land use over time, while it was inversely correlated with other land uses. During the nighttime, all land uses had a direct correlation with the heat islands. Regarding the air pollutants, PM2.5 and PM10 were most correlated with the heat islands during both daytime/nighttime while other pollutants have been inversely correlated. The heat islands and the NDVI were also inversely correlated during both daytime/nighttime. The OLS (ordinary least-squares) model results also indicated that the R-2 values during the daytime/nighttime were 0.70 and 0.59, respectively, over the cold period of the year, compared to values of 0.69 and 0.68 over the warm period of the year. The results of global Moran's I and G*i statistics also indicated that the heat islands of the Tehran metropolis had a spatial structure distributed in a cluster in which the southern, western, southwestern, and northern parts had warm spots during the daytime and cold spots during the nighttime. Moreover, the northern and northeastern parts had cold spots during the daytime, and the central and eastern parts had warm spots during the nighttime.

TI  - Validation of precipitable water vapor estimates from an inexpensive infrared thermometer
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor is a fundamental component of the Earth's atmosphere with a high spatial and temporal variability. This work studies to what extent low-cost infrared thermometers can infer precipitable water (variable commonly used to characterize atmospheric water vapor). In a calibration process, infrared thermometer readings recorded at Badajoz (Spain) during the 2015-2018 period are compared against precipitable water data measured with reference ground-based Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in order to obtain conversion factors through regression analyses considering two exponential fits. After this calibration, using the equation of the best fit, thermometer readings for the year 2019 are transformed into precipitable water estimates. A validation analysis in which these estimates are compared with GNSS measurements yields rms differences of 19% and 17% when normal and seasonal calibration had been employed, respectively. These results are similar (or even better) to those obtained with satellite data. In addition, we explore if certain factors, such as solar elevation, precipitable water content, precipitable water measurements used as reference and equations to convert temperature readings into precipitable water estimates, can significantly affect the quality of the estimates. In view of our results, low-cost infrared thermometers could be used to create an extensive and dense network for a better characterization of the spatial and temporal variability of water vapor.

TI  - Evaluation of soil moisture estimation techniques based on Sentinel-1 observations over wheat fields
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable in agriculture and its monitoring is essential. SM determines the amount of water available to plants, having a direct impact on the development of crops, on the forecasting of crop yields and on the surveillance of food security. Microwave remote sensing offers a great potential for estimating SM because it is sensitive to the dielectric characteristics of observed surface that depend on surface soil moisture. The objective of this study is the evaluation of three change detection methodologies for SM estimation over wheat at the agricultural field scale based on Sentinel-1 time series: Short Term Change Detection (STCD), TU Wien Change Detection (TUWCD) and Multitemporal Bayesian Change Detection (MTBCD). Different methodological alternatives were proposed for the implementation of these techniques at the agricultural field scale. Soil moisture measurements from eight experimental wheat fields were used for validating the methodologies. All available Sentinel-1 acquisitions were processed and the eventual benefit of correcting for vegetation effects in backscatter time series was evaluated. The results were rather variable, with some experimental fields achieving successful performance metrics (ubRMSE -0.05 m3/m3) and some others rather poor ones (ubRMSE > 0.12 m3/ m3). Evaluating median performance metrics, it was observed that both TUWCD and MTBCD methods obtained better results when run with vegetation corrected backscatter time series (ubRMSE-0.07 m3/m3) whereas STCD produced similar results with and without vegetation correction (ubRMSE-0.08 m3/m3). The soil moisture content had an influence on the accuracy of the different methodologies, with higher errors observed for drier conditions and rain-fed fields, in comparison to wetter conditions and irrigated fields. Taking into account the spatial scale of this case study, results were considered promising for the future application of these techniques in irrigation management.

TI  - Role of Oral Health, Frailty, and Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy in the Risk of Hospitalization: A Prospective Multi-Center Cohort of Outpatients With Cirrhosis
T2  - CLINICAL GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hospitalizations are a sentinel event in cirrhosis; however, the changing demographics in pa-tients with cirrhosis require updated hospitalization prediction models. Periodontitis is a risk factor for liver disease and potentially progression. The aim of this study was to determine factors, including poor oral health, associated with 3-month hospitalizations in a multi-center cohort of outpatients with cirrhosis.METHODS: North American Consortium for Study of End-stage Liver Disease (NACSELD-3), a new study cohort, recruits outpatients with cirrhosis. Cirrhosis details, demographics, minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE), frailty, and comorbid conditions including oral health were collected. All patients were followed for 3 months for nonelective hospitalizations. Multi-variable models were created for this outcome using demographics, cirrhosis details, oral health, MHE, frailty, and comorbid conditions with K-fold internal validation using 25%/75% split.RESULTS: A total of 442 outpatients (70% men; 37% compensated; Model for End-stage Liver Disease-Sodium, 12; 42% ascites; and 33% prior HE) were included. MHE was found in 70%, frailty in 10%; and both in 8%. In terms of oral health, 15% were edentulous and 10% had prior periodontitis. Regarding 3 -month hospitalizations, 14% were admitted for mostly liver-related reasons. These patients were more likely to be decompensated with higher cirrhosis complications, MHE, frailty and periodon-titis history. Multi-variable analysis showed prior periodontitis (P = .026), composite MHE D frailty score (P = .0016), ascites (P = .004), prior HE (P = .008), and hydrothorax (P = .004) were associated with admissions using the training and validation subsets.CONCLUSIONS: In a contemporaneous, prospective, multi-center cohort study in outpatients with cirrhosis, poor oral health is significantly associated with 3-month hospitalizations independent of portal hypertensive complications, MHE, and frailty. Potential strategies to reduce hospitalizations should consider oral evaluation in addition to MHE and frailty assessment in practice pathways.

TI  - Ground-based remote sensing provides alternative to satellites for monitoring cyanobacteria in small lakes
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacteria are the most prevalent bloom-forming harmful algae in freshwater systems around the world. Adequate sampling of affected systems is limited spatially, temporally, and fiscally. Remote sensing using spaceor ground-based systems in large water bodies at spatial and temporal scales that are cost-prohibitive to standard water quality monitoring has proven to be useful in detecting and quantifying cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms. This study aimed to identify a regional 'universal' multispectral reflectance model that could be used for rapid, remote detection and quantification of cyanoHABs in small- to medium-sized productive reservoirs, such as those typical of Oklahoma, USA. We aimed to include these small waterbodies in our study as they are typically overlooked in larger, continental wide studies, yet are widely distributed and used for recreation and drinking water supply. We used Landsat satellite reflectance and in-situ pigment data spanning 16 years from 38 reservoirs in Oklahoma to construct empirical linear models for predicting concentrations of chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin, two key algal pigments commonly used for assessing total and cyanobacterial algal abundances, respectively. We also used ground-based hyperspectral reflectance and in-situ pigment data from seven reservoirs across five years in Oklahoma to build multispectral models predicting algal pigments from newly defined reflectance bands. Our Oklahoma-derived Landsat- and ground-based models outperformed established reflectance-pigment models on Oklahoma reservoirs. Importantly, our results demonstrate that ground-based multispectral models were far superior to Landsat-based models and the Cyanobacteria Index (CI) for detecting cyanoHABs in highly productive, small- to mid-sized reservoirs in Oklahoma, providing a valuable tool for water management and public health. While satellite-based remote sensing approaches have proven effective for relatively large systems, our novel results indicate that ground-based remote sensing may offer better cyanoHAB monitoring for small or highly dendritic turbid lakes, such as those throughout the southern Great Plains, and thus prove beneficial to efforts aimed at minimizing public health risks associated with cyanoHABs in supply and recreational waters.

TI  - Modeling and mapping the spatial-temporal changes in land use and land cover in Lagos: A dynamics for building a sustainable urban city
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lagos is Africa's most populous megacity and one of the world's fastest-growing urban areas. Lagos city's land use and land cover (LU/LC) classes have changed dramatically in recent decades as a result of its continuing population growth and other human and anthropogenic activities. The UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development must be adopted in order to preserve the available land cover classes in Lagos. Goal 11 of the Sustainable Development Goals aims to make cities and human settlements more inclusive, safe, resilient, and long-term. The use of remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) to track the progress of SDG 11 is an essential strategy. Remote sensing and geographic information systems were used to model and analyze the data in this study. To achieve this aim, remotely sensed data, such as Landsat 7 ETM + and 8 OLI, was used to determine the rate of changes in Lagos from 2010 to 2020 by adopting the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and then project the likely changes that may occur by 2025 and 2030. Observed ground truthing information was adopted for validation and for checking the accuracy of the classification. The result shows that from 2010 to 2015 and to 2020, built-up area had increased from 11.73 % to 12.81 % and finally to 29.51 %, while agricultural land declined by 11.84 % to 3.37 % and then to 2.99 %. Water bodies and wetland percentages decreased from 19.00 % and 19.50 % in 2010 to 17.39 % and 8.48 % in 2015, and to 18.37 % and 16.92 % in 2020. Forest land and bare land classes have also changed from 25.4 % and 12.52 % in 2010, to 33.37 % and 24.58 % in 2015, and to 18.10 % and 14.11 % in 2020. The study shows that remote sensing and GIS are excellent tools for monitoring the environment and for the development of a sustainable city. & COPY; 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Victor Pelevin and Eurasianist Geopolitics
T2  - RUSSIAN REVIEW
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The first decades of Victor Pelevin's writing coincided with the burst in popularity of neo-Eurasianist and neo-imperialist ideas. This paper traces the various forms that Pelevin's treatment of civilizational and geopolitically focused ideologies has taken over the course of his career. His preoccupation with these ideas ranges from inconspicuous reflection of the Eurasian phenomenon to Eurasianism's intensifying critique, and, eventually, to a more comprehensive engagement with concepts of classical geopolitics. If early on Pelevin's portrayal of neo-imperialists and their ideas has been largely satirical (Empire V, 2006), in the 2010s his texts began to demonstrate a deeper entanglement in civilizational thought and expression of a geopolitical worldview. "Operation 'Burning Bush'" (2010), S.N.U.F.F. (2012), and Batman Apollo (2013), while maintaining a satirical take on aspects of the neo-imperialist worldview, reveal the author's internalized perception of the world as a stage for the clash of civilizations, and Pelevin's seemingly growing conservatism. Ultimately, as postmodernist tendencies become common in the political sphere, Pelevin again blends the esoteric and the political by bringing Eurasianist noospherism into "The Art of Light Touches" (2019), lending a metaphysical angle to the antagonism between Russia and the West, and demonstrating how fiction can penetrate public discourse and vice versa.

TI  - Role of Sleep Apnea and Long-Term CPAP Treatment in the Prognosis of Patients With Melanoma: A Prospective Multicenter Study of 443 Patients.
T2  - Chest
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: OSA has been associated with increased incidence and aggressiveness of melanoma. However, the long-term impact of OSA and CPAP treatment on the prognosis of melanoma remains unexplored.RESEARCH QUESTION: Are OSA and CPAP treatment associated independently with a poor prognosis for cutaneous melanoma?STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Four hundred forty-three patients with a diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma (2012-2015) underwent a sleep study within 6months of diagnosis. The main 5-year outcome of the study was a composite of melanoma recurrence, metastasis, or mortality. Patients were divided into four groups: baseline apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of fewer than 10 events/h (no OSA; control group), OSA treated with CPAP and good adherence, untreated or poor CPAP adherence in moderate (AHI, 10-29 events/h), and severe OSA (AHI,≥ 30 events/h). Survival analysis was used to determine the independent role of OSA and CPAP treatment on melanoma composite outcome.RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-one patients (88.2%) were available for analysis at 5-year follow-up (mean age, 65.1 ± 15.2 years; 49%male; Breslow index, 1.7 ± 2.5mm). One hundred thirty-nine patients had AHI of fewer than 10 events/h (control group); 78 patients with OSA were adherent to CPAP; and 124 and 50 patients had moderate and severe OSA, respectively, without CPAP treatment. Median follow-up was 60months (interquartile range, 51-74months). During follow-up, 32 relapses, 53 metastases, and 52 deaths occurred (116 patients showed at least one of the main composite outcomes). After adjusting for age, sex, sentinel lymph nodes affected at diagnosis, BMI, diabetes,nighttime with an oxygen saturation below 90%, Breslow index, Epworth sleepiness scale scores, and melanoma treatment, moderate (hazard ratio [HR], 2.45; 95%CI, 1.09-5.49) and severe OSA (HR, 2.96; 95%CI, 1.36-6.42) were associated with poorer prognosis of melanoma compared with the control group. However, good adherence to CPAP avoided this excess risk (HR, 1.66; 95%CI, 0.71-3.90).INTERPRETATION: Moderate to severe untreated OSA is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis of melanoma. Treatment with CPAP is associated with improved melanoma outcomes compared with untreated moderate to severe OSA.

TI  - Cancer cell plasticity and MHC-II-mediated immune tolerance promote breast cancer metastasis to lymph nodes
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lei et al. uncover that a subpopulation of breast cancer cells in the lymph node is marked by MHC-II expression in the absence of costimulatory molecules, which causes the expansion of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells.Tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are important for tumor antigen-specific T cell generation and effective anticancer immune responses. However, TDLNs are often the primary site of metastasis, causing immune suppression and worse outcomes. Through cross-species single-cell RNA-Seq analysis, we identified features defining cancer cell heterogeneity, plasticity, and immune evasion during breast cancer progression and lymph node metastasis (LNM). A subset of cancer cells in the lymph nodes exhibited elevated MHC class II (MHC-II) gene expression in both mice and humans. MHC-II+ cancer cells lacked costimulatory molecule expression, leading to regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion and fewer CD4(+) effector T cells in TDLNs. Genetic knockout of MHC-II reduced LNM and Treg expansion, while overexpression of the MHC-II transactivator, Ciita, worsened LNM and caused excessive Treg expansion. These findings demonstrate that cancer cell MHC-II expression promotes metastasis and immune evasion in TDLNs.

TI  - Dynamic Multiple Reaction Monitoring of amphipod Gammarus fossarum caeca expands molecular information for understanding the impact of contaminants
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode is a powerful technique that can provide highly selective, multiplexed, and reproducible quantification of peptides derived from proteins. Ideal for the application of molecular bio-markers in biomonitoring surveys, MRM tools have been recently developed to quantify sets of pre-selected biomarkers in freshwater sentinel species. Still limited to the validation and application phase of biomarkers, dynamic MRM (dMRM) acquisition mode has increased the multiplexing capacity of mass spectrometers, expanding opportunities to explore pro-teome modulations in sentinel species. This study evaluated the feasibility to propose dMRM tools for investigating senti-nel species proteomes at the organ level and demonstrated its potential for screening contaminant effects and discovering new protein biomarkers. As a proof of concept, a dMRM assay was developed to comprehensively capture the functional proteome of the caeca of Gammarus fossarum, a freshwater crustacean, commonly used as a sentinel species in environmen-tal biomonitoring. The assay was then used to assess the effects of sub-lethal concentrations of cadmium, silver, and zinc on gammarid caeca. Results showed dose-response and specific metal effects on caecal proteomes, with a slight effect of zinc compared to the two non-essential metals. Functional analyses indicated that cadmium affected proteins involved in car-bohydrate metabolism, digestive and immune processes, while silver affected proteins related to oxidative stress response, chaperonin complexes and fatty acid metabolism. Based on these metal-specific signatures, several proteins modulated in a dose-dependent manner were proposed as candidate biomarkers for tracking the level of these metals in freshwater eco-systems. Overall, this study highlights the potential of dMRM to decipher the specific modulations of proteome expression induced by contaminant exposure and pinpoints specific response signatures, offering new perspectives for the de novo identification and development of biomarkers in sentinel species.

TI  - DNA Adductomics for the Biological Effect Assessment of Contaminant Exposure in Marine Sediments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to chemical pollution can induce genetic andepigeneticalterations, developmental changes, and reproductive disorders, leadingto population declines in polluted environments. These effects aretriggered by chemical modifications of DNA nucleobases (DNA adducts)and epigenetic dysregulation. However, linking DNA adducts to thepollution load in situ remains challenging, and thelack of evidence-based DNA adductome response to pollution hampersthe development and application of DNA adducts as biomarkers for environmentalhealth assessment. Here, we provide the first evidence for pollutioneffects on the DNA modifications in wild populations of Baltic sentinelspecies, the amphipod Monoporeia affinis. A workflow based on high-resolution mass spectrometry to screenand characterize genomic DNA modifications was developed, and itsapplicability was demonstrated by profiling DNA modifications in theamphipods collected in areas with varying pollution loads. Then, thecorrelations between adducts and the contaminants level (polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), trace metals, and pollution indices)in the sediments at the collection sites were evaluated. A total of119 putative adducts were detected, and some (5-me-dC, N-6-me-dA, 8-oxo-dG, and dI) were structurally characterized. The DNAadductome profiles, including epigenetic modifications, differed betweenthe animals collected in areas with high and low contaminant levels.Furthermore, the correlations between the adducts and PAHs were similaracross the congeners, indicating possible additive effects. Also,high-mass adducts had significantly more positive correlations withPAHs than low-mass adducts. By contrast, correlations between theDNA adducts and trace metals were stronger and more variable thanfor PAHs, indicating metal-specific effects. These associations betweenDNA adducts and environmental contaminants provide a new venue forcharacterizing genome-wide exposure effects in wild populations andapply DNA modifications in the effect-based assessment of chemicalpollution.DNA adductome analysis identifiesexposure to environmentalcontaminants in a sentinel species in the Baltic Sea.

TI  - Assessing China's Scope 2 CO2 emissions and mitigation pace from space
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - China is committed to CO2 emissions peaking by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. This study aims to explore a method to measure its progressing pace largely independently for providing feedback. With OCO-2 carbon satellite and NPP-VIIRS night-time light data, we develop and apply a satellite-based approach to estimate provincial Scope 2 CO2 emissions, which refers to those emissions stemming from electricity trade, from 2015 to 2020. Our results can reflect the spatial disparity of electricity trade and energy structure across China. Furthermore, a Carbon Mitigation Index (CMI) is defined, through combining information from carbon and night-time light satellites, to measure China's national and provincial CO2 mitigation pace toward carbon neutrality, which indicates the composite progress of various key drivers, including energy transition, electrification, net electricity import, socio-economic development, and energy efficiency. Because the CMI requires only satellite data but not bottom-up statistics in its application, it offers an opportunity for external assessment from space.

TI  - Exploring the use of multi-source high-resolution satellite data for snow water equivalent reconstruction over mountainous catchments
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrological cycle is strongly influenced by the accumulation and melting of seasonal snow. For this reason, mountains are often claimed to be the "water towers" of the world. In this context, a key variable is the snow water equivalent (SWE). However, the complex processes of snow accumulation, redistribution, and ablation make its quantification and prediction very challenging. In this work, we explore the use of multi-source data to reconstruct SWE at a high spatial resolution (HR) of 25 m. To this purpose, we propose a novel approach based on (i) in situ snow depth or SWE observations, temperature data and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to determine the pixel state, i.e., whether it is undergoing an SWE increase (accumulation) or decrease (ablation), (ii) a daily HR time series of snow cover area (SCA) maps derived by high- and low-resolution multispectral optical satellite images to define the days of snow presence, and (iii) a degree-day model driven by in situ temperature to determine the potential melting. Given the typical high spatial heterogeneity of snow in mountainous areas, the use of HR images represents an important novelty that allows us to sample its distribution more adequately, thus resulting in highly detailed spatialized information. The proposed SWE reconstruction approach also foresees a novel SCA time series regularization technique that models impossible transitions based on the pixel state, i.e., the erroneous change in the pixel class from snow to snow-free when it is expected to be in accumulation or equilibrium and, vice versa, from snow-free to snow when it is expected to be in ablation or equilibrium. Furthermore, it reconstructs the SWE for the entire hydrological season, including late snowfall. The approach does not require spatialized precipitation information as input, which is usually affected by uncertainty. The method provided good results in two different test catchments: the South Fork of the San Joaquin River, California, and the Schnals catchment, Italy. It obtained good agreement when evaluated against HR spatialized reference maps (showing an average bias of -22 mm, a root mean square error - RMSE - of 212 mm, and a correlation of 0.74), against a daily dataset at coarser resolution (showing an average bias of -44 mm, an RMSE of 127 mm, and a correlation of 0.66), and against manual measurements (showing an average bias of -5 mm, an RMSE of 191 mm, and a correlation of 0.35). The main sources of error are discussed to provide insights into the main advantages and disadvantages of the method that may be of interest for several hydrological and ecological applications.

TI  - Place-based subsidies and employment growth in rural America: Evidence from the broadband initiatives programme
T2  - PAPERS IN REGIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper studies the labour market effects of the Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP), a programme authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to promote broadband deployment, mainly in rural areas. The BIP is one of the largest USDA broadband programmes implemented to date, providing more than $3.4 billion in grants and loans in FY 2010. We investigate the impacts of BIP investments on employment outcomes in BIP-recipient Census tracts compared to similar tracts outside of BIP project service areas between the inception of the programme in 2010 and 2019. We use a quasi-experimental research design that combines difference-in-difference regression with propensity score matching estimation to identify the causal effect of the BIP investments on employment outcomes. We find that the BIP investments had a positive overall effect on employment growth that increased over time. The subsidized investments had a greater effect on employment in startups than in incumbent businesses, in the goods-producing sector and the information and communications technology sector than other sectors, and a greater effect in micropolitan census tracts than tracts located in metropolitan areas or in small town and remote rural locations.

TI  - Monitoring direct drivers of small-scale tropical forest disturbance in near real-time with Sentinel-1 and-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Advancements in satellite-based forest monitoring increasingly enable the near real-time detection of small-scale tropical forest disturbances. However, there is an urgent need to enhance such monitoring methods with automated direct driver attributions to detected disturbances. This would provide important additional information to make forest disturbance alerts more actionable and useful for uptake by different stakeholders. In this study, we demonstrate spatially explicit and near real-time methods to monitor direct drivers of small-scale tropical forest disturbance across a range of tropical forest conditions in Suriname, the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We trained a convolutional neural network with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to continuously classify newly detected RAdar for Detecting Deforestation (RADD) alerts as smallholder agriculture, road development, selective logging, mining or other. Different monitoring scenarios were evaluated based on varying sensor combinations, post-disturbance time periods and confidence levels. In general, the use of Sentinel-2 data was found to be most accurate for driver classifications, especially with data composited over a period of 4 to 6 months after the disturbance detection. Sentinel-1 data showed to be valuable for more rapid classifications of specific drivers, especially in areas with persistent cloud cover. Throughout all monitoring scenarios, smallholder agriculture was classified most accurately, while road development, selective logging and mining were more challenging to distinguish. An accuracy assessment throughout the full extent of our study regions revealed a Macro-F1 score of 0.861 and an Overall Accuracy of 0.897 for the best performing model, based on the use of 6-month post-disturbance Sentinel-2 composites. Finally, we addressed three specific monitoring use cases that relate to rapid law enforcement against illegal activities, ecological impact assessments and timely carbon emission reporting, by optimizing the trade-off in classification timeliness and confidence to reach required accuracies. Our findings demonstrate the strong capacities of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite data for monitoring direct drivers of small-scale forest disturbance, considering different user interests.

TI  - Temporal expansion of the nighttime light images of SDGSAT-1 satellite in illuminating ground object extraction by joint observation of NPP-VIIRS and sentinel-2A images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Poverty is the leading cause of social instability around the world. Reducing poverty has become a crucial objective for global sustainable development. Timely and consistently monitoring poverty status plays a vital role in evaluating the efficiency of poverty reduction policies. Nighttime light images from satellites allow for frequent monitoring of poverty status by recording lighting intensity. The coarse spatial resolution of the recent, widely used, publicly available nighttime light images hinders research on smaller unit scales, such as county level. The SDGSAT-1 satellite, with a glimmer sensor and a spatial resolution of 10-m, was launched in 2021 to meet the sustainable development goals. This study proposes a model to sharpen the existing nighttime light images with a coarse spatial resolution to expand the available period of nighttime light images with a 10-m spatial resolution in discriminating illuminating ground objects. The expanded nighttime light images with discriminated illuminating ground objects are then utilized to calculate the time-series county-level poverty index for three typical Chinese urban agglomerations with a statistically significant correlation coefficient of 0.675 (p < 0.01). Compared to the poverty statistics derived from the Chinese county statistical yearbook, the estimated poverty index can explore county-level poverty status change more effectively by completing the missing census. The time-series county-level poverty analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of Chinese endeavor in poverty reduction. >90% of the counties experienced a reduction in poverty in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region due to time-series economic development. Statistical analysis of the poverty index of impoverished counties demonstrates a remarkable reduction of poverty in the study areas and the significance of the persistent poverty reduction policy implementation. This study's proposed pipeline compensates for the lack of nighttime light images with a higher spatial resolution prior to 2021 and provides a reliable poverty analysis foundation for sustainable development and policymaking.

T2  - ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoringand tracing of regulated hazardous chemicals is a publicsecurity issue of global concern. However, accurately recording historicalexposure remains challenging. Here, we designed a Biological Sentinel System (BOSS) for in situ and long-term monitoring ofhazardous chemical exposure using a chemical-induced base-editingsystem that activates antibiotic resistance screening, producing anobvious colorimetric signal. Exposure events can be written into aninheritable genomic DNA sequence, which can be read using gene sequencing.As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the accurate detection of cocaineand 2,4-dinitrotoluene using BOSS under simulated application scenarios.In addition, we integrated alternative biosensors to illustrate themodularity and extensibility of this monitoring platform. This workprovides a promising paradigm for developing engineered microorganismsas an alternative to electronic monitors for regulated hazardous chemicals.

T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving our understanding of the mechanism of the carbon cycle in the Tropical Rainforests (TRFs) requires systematic testing of vegetation and ecosystem response to environmental drivers in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) over different time scales. Here, we use reprocessed monthly MODIS LAI products from 2003 to 2019, combined with in-situ data, to determine how well 14 state-of-the-art models (CABLE, CLASSIC, CLM5, DLEM, IBIS, ISAM, ISBA, JULES, LPJ, LPX, OCN, ORCHIDEE, and SDGVM) simulate the long-term trend, interannual variability, seasonality, and El Nin & SIM;o impacts in terms of the greenness in the global TRFs. We find that most DGVMs highly overestimate the long-term trend in the TRFs because of the overestimation of the impact of CO2 fertilization. The multi-model ensemble mean (MME) successfully represents the interannual variability of the TRF LAI in the regional scales; however, failed in the pixeled scales. This inconsistency may be due to DGVMs using Plant Function Type (PFT) to parameterize vegetation dynamics. Finally, most DGVMs poorly modelled both the seasonality and the vegetation conditions during El Nin & SIM;o, likely due to the lack of lagged effects for climate drivers and poor acclimation during drought conditions.

TI  - Assessment of the monsoonal impact of air pollutants and meteorological factors on physicochemical water quality parameters using remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - With the growing urbanization, water contamination has become a problem. The water quality is assessed using physicochemical parameters and requires manual collection. Moreover, physicochemical parameters are insufficient for water quality monitoring as heavy rainfalls and abundance of air pollutants cause water pollution. Thus, considering natural factors as influencing parameters and the latest technology for easy and global coverage for sampling, water quality monitoring is modified. This study investigates Rawal watershed with (a) physicochemical, (b) air pollutants like nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and (c) meteorological variables like wind speed for June 2018 to September 2022. Correlation and regression analysis are performed. The results show negative correlations for NO2 with total dissolved solids (TDS) (ranging, 0.51-0.85), turbidity (range, 0.53-0.65), pH (range, 0.5-0.75), and dissolved oxygen (DO) (range, 0.5-0.82), and positive correlation with electric conductivity (EC) (range, 0.54-0.85). The regression analysis with LightGBM, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM) is applied with air pollutants, and meteorological parameters taken as independent variables giving root-mean-square error (RMSE) (ranging, 0.015-0.18). MLP gave an RMSE of 0.18 and 0.003 for TDS and pH, respectively. SVM performed well for DO, turbidity, and EC with RMSE ranging from 0.015 to 0.027. Moreover, floods on August 2022 are taken as a case study.

TI  - FIGO staging of endometrial cancer: 2023
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionMany advances in the understanding of the pathologic and molecular features of endometrial cancer have occurred since the FIGO staging was last updated in 2009. Substantially more outcome and biological behavior data are now available regarding the several histological types. Molecular and genetic findings have accelerated since the publication of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and provide improved clarity on the diverse biological nature of this collection of endometrial cancers and their differing prognostic outcomes. The goals of the new staging system are to better define these prognostic groups and create substages that indicate more appropriate surgical, radiation, and systemic therapies. MethodsThe FIGO Women's Cancer Committee appointed a Subcommittee on Endometrial Cancer Staging in October 2021, represented by the authors. Since then, the committee members have met frequently and reviewed new and established evidence on the treatment, prognosis, and survival of endometrial cancer. Based on these data, opportunities for improvements in the categorization and stratification of these factors were identified in each of the four stages. Data and analyses from the molecular and histological classifications performed and published in the recently developed ESGO/ESTRO/ESP guidelines were used as a template for adding the new subclassifications to the proposed molecular and histological staging system. ResultsBased on the existing evidence, the substages were defined as follows:Stage I (IA1): non-aggressive histological type of endometrial carcinoma limited to a polyp or confined to the endometrium; (IA2) non-aggressive histological types of endometrium involving less than 50% of the myometrium with no or focal lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) as defined by WHO criteria; (IA3) low-grade endometrioid carcinomas limited to the uterus with simultaneous low-grade endometrioid ovarian involvement; (IB) non-aggressive histological types involving 50% or more of the myometrium with no LVSI or focal LVSI; (IC) aggressive histological types, i.e. serous, high-grade endometrioid, clear cell, carcinosarcomas, undifferentiated, mixed, and other unusual types without any myometrial invasion.Stage II (IIA): non-aggressive histological types that infiltrate the cervical stroma; (IIB) non-aggressive histological types that have substantial LVSI; or (IIC) aggressive histological types with any myometrial invasion.Stage III (IIIA): differentiating between adnexal versus uterine serosa infiltration; (IIIB) infiltration of vagina/parametria and pelvic peritoneal metastasis; and (IIIC) refinements for lymph node metastasis to pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, including micrometastasis and macrometastasis.Stage IV (IVA): locally advanced disease infiltrating the bladder or rectal mucosa; (IVB) extrapelvic peritoneal metastasis; and (IVC) distant metastasis.The performance of complete molecular classification (POLEmut, MMRd, NSMP, p53abn) is encouraged in all endometrial cancers. If the molecular subtype is known, this is recorded in the FIGO stage by the addition of "m" for molecular classification, and a subscript indicating the specific molecular subtype. When molecular classification reveals p53abn or POLEmut status in Stages I and II, this results in upstaging or downstaging of the disease (IICmp53abn or IAmPOLEmut).The updated 2023 staging of endometrial cancer includes the various histological types, tumor patterns, and molecular classification to better reflect the improved understanding of the complex nature of the several types of endometrial carcinoma and their underlying biologic behavior. The changes incorporated in the 2023 staging system should provide a more evidence-based context for treatment recommendations and for the more refined future collection of outcome and survival data.

TI  - 'LandsatTS': an R package to facilitate retrieval, cleaning, cross-calibration, and phenological modeling of Landsat time series data
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat satellites provide decades of near-global surface reflectance measurements that are increasingly used to assess interannual changes in terrestrial ecosystem function. These assessments often rely on spectral indices related to vegetation greenness and productivity (e.g. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI). Nevertheless, multiple factors impede multi-decadal assessments of spectral indices using Landsat satellite data, including ease of data access and cleaning, as well as lingering issues with cross-sensor calibration and challenges with irregular timing of cloud-free acquisitions. To help address these problems, we developed the 'LandsatTS' package for R. This software package facilitates sample-based time series analysis of surface reflectance and spectral indices derived from Landsat sensors. The package includes functions that enable the extraction of the full Landsat 5, 7, and 8 records from Collection 2 for point sample locations or small study regions using Google Earth Engine accessed directly from R. Moreover, the package includes functions for 1) rigorous data cleaning, 2) cross-sensor calibration, 3) phenological modeling, and 4) time series analysis. For an example application, we show how 'LandsatTS' can be used to assess changes in annual maximum vegetation greenness from 2000 to 2022 across the Noatak National Preserve in northern Alaska, USA. Overall, this software provides a suite of functions to enable broader use of Landsat satellite data for assessing and monitoring terrestrial ecosystem function during recent decades across local to global geographic extents.

TI  - The length of hospital stay following bariatric surgery in Australia: the impact of patient, procedure, system and surgeon
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: The length of a patient's stay (LOS) in a hospital is one metric used to compare the quality of care, as a longer LOS may flag higher complication rates or less efficient processes. A meaningful comparison of LOS can only occur if the expected average length of stay (ALOS) is defined first. This study aimed to define the expected ALOS of primary and conversion bariatric surgery in Australia and to quantify the effect of patient, procedure, system, and surgeon factors on ALOS.Methods: This was a retrospective observational study of prospectively maintained data from the Bariatric Surgery Registry of 63 604 bariatric procedures performed in Australia. The primary outcome measure was the expected ALOS for primary and conversion bariatric procedures. The secondary outcome measures quantified the change in ALOS for bariatric surgery resulting from patient, procedure, hospital, and surgeon factors.Results: Uncomplicated primary bariatric surgery had an ALOS (SD) of 2.30 (1.31) days, whereas conversion procedures had an ALOS (SD) of 2.71 (2.75) days yielding a mean difference (SEM) in ALOS of 0.41 (0.05) days, P < 0.001. The occurrence of any defined adverse event extended the ALOS of primary and conversion procedures by 1.14 days (CI 95% 1.04-1.25), P < 0.001 and 2.33 days (CI 95% 1.54-3.11), P < 0.001, respectively. Older age, diabetes, rural home address, surgeon operating volume and hospital case volume increased the ALOS following bariatric surgery.Conclusions: Our findings have defined Australia's expected ALOS following bariatric surgery. Increased patient age, diabetes, rural living, procedural complications and surgeon and hospital case volume exerted a small but significant increase in ALOS.Study type: Retrospective observational study of prospectively collected data.

TI  - To tweet, or not to tweet, that is the question: the Ayrton Senna Institute and education policy movement in Brazil
T2  - GLOBALISATION SOCIETIES AND EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In a context of global educational policy, several actors are emerging in the negotiations around educational policies that promote the policies that they consider appropriate. In this way, many education systems follow globally structured educational agendas, albeit in different ways. These agendas can be seen as comprising three key policy dimensions: education management, educational provision, and curriculum. Taking this into consideration we examine the role of the Ayrton Senna Institute (ASI) in the transnational policy-making landscape in Brazil. We examine whose knowledge, politics, or worldview ASI is advancing in Brazil. This paper is based both on a content analysis of the retrieved tweets from ASI's official Twitter account from May 2013 to December 2020 as well as previous research from the authors on ASI's trajectory and its role in the diffusion and mobility of policies in Brazil. The paper argues that the ASI is facilitating policy movement, particularly the 'economics of education' movement and 'techno-solutionist' strand currently promoted by international organisations. It also shows that ASI uses research for policy and reference societies as a discursive strategic tool to make the arguments more persuasive for their audience.

TI  - Socio-hydrological dynamics and water conflicts in the upper Huasco valley, Chile
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid regions of north-central Chile, mining activities and agricultural land use changes lead to competing water demands, water insecurity, and related conflicts. Different local and external user groups rely on the scarce water resources. This case study investigates socio-hydrological transformations in the upper Huasco valley. It builds on a mixed method approach that combines remote sensing assessments (Corona, Landsat, Sentinel-2) with a set of social science methods including interviews and an analysis of Twitter tweets. Against the backdrop of the recent mega drought, results show that the upper Huasco valley faces adverse environmental impacts and conflicts over mining activities as well as an expansion of export-oriented agriculture. While water availability largely depends on the cryosphere, remote sensing analyses show a drastic glacier decrease in the vicinity of the mining project, where three glaciers completely disappeared since 2000. Furthermore, an expansion of the cultivated area from 2,000 ha in the 1990s to about 3,210 ha occurred in the 2000s. Agricultural expansion has come to a halt and only a slight increase of 100 ha can be detected over the last decade. Interview and social media data show local concerns and discourses on issues of water scarcity and quality related to these land use changes. The study stresses the necessity of integrative assessments for a better understanding of water scarcity and water-related conflicts. Equitable water governance in climate-sensitive areas requires contextualizing land use changes and the precarious drinking water situation from a socio-hydrological perspective.

TI  - Modeling reference evapotranspiration using machine learning and remote sensing techniques for semiarid subtropical climate of Indian Punjab
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - A study was carried out to develop and evaluate the performance of different machine learning (ML) models for predicting reference evapotranspiration (ET0). The models included multiple linear regression (MLR), least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM), artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The daily meteorological data for 50 years (1970-2019) were used to estimate ET0 using FAO-ET calculator. The FAO-ET calculator was compared with ML models to investigate the best-fit ML model for predicting ET. Thereafter, ET predicted by the best-fit ML model was compared with satellite (MOderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer - MODIS) ET, which was finally mapped to a larger landscape (over entire Punjab and Haryana). Modeling of ET0 was best performed through LS-SVM followed by ANN2, ANN1, ANFIS10, ANFIS2, MLR and ANFIS9 models. Among developed models, coefficient of determination (R-2) value varied from 0.800 to 0.998, being highest (0.998) under LS-SVM model. MODIS overestimated ET when compared with LS-SVM having R-2 and root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.73 and 3.95 mm, respectively. After applying the bias correction factor, R-2 and RMSE were 0.74 and 1.19 mm, respectively. The ML and satellite-based ET estimation would be useful for timely water budgeting to manage the water scarcity problems from local to regional levels.

TI  - Remote monitoring support services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLICY AND PRACTICE IN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - While remote monitoring supports have many benefits and the use of remote supports for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) is increasing, they are a relatively new technology for IDD service provision and yet to be widely available. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a rapid uptake in technology in Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) for people with IDD, including the expansion of telehealth and remote supports. The aim of this study was to examine if, and, how, remote monitoring support services were provided to people with IDD in HCBS across the United States in fiscal year (FY) 2021. To do so, we analyzed Medicaid HCBS 1915(c) waivers for people with IDD. In FY 2021, 10 states (22.22%) provided remote support services to people with IDD through 19 HCBS waivers (17.76%); they provided a total of 36 different remote monitoring services. A total of $22.4 million was allocated for remote support services for 3039 people with IDD. We found states often provided remote support services to people with IDD in HCBS to promote independence, health, and welfare, and reduce and/or replace services. States implemented a number of rules and requirements to help keep people with IDD safe while remote support services were being used, including informed consent, encryption, emergency backup plans, and the prohibition of use in private spaces. Further attention to remote supports in HCBS is necessary to ensure that people with IDD who want to utilize these services are able to do so.

TI  - Assessment of past and future land use/cover change over Tordzie watershed in Ghana
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/ land cover (LULC) change has been identified as the main driving force of global change. The study investigated LULC change in Tordzie watershed in Ghana and predicted the future development. The supervised classification procedure was applied to Landsat images of 1987, 2003, and 2017. The cellular automata-Markov model embedded in IDRISI 17 software was employed to model LULC for the years 2030 and 2050. The trend of LULC change was exploited from 1987 to 2003, from 2003 to 2017, and projected to 2030 and 2050. Settlement and crop land, respectively, increased from 2.68% to 16.46% in 1987 to 3.65% and 53.47% in 2003 and finally to 20.61% and 58.52% in 2017. Vegetation cover declined from 23.2% in 1987 to 13.9% in 2003 and finally to 11.3% in 2017. The annual rate of change was determined. In 2030 and 2050, the dominant land use type will be crop land (56%). However, it decreased between 2017 and 2030 by -1.73%. The findings of the study are very relevant to land and water resource planners, policy formulators and implementers, and environmental and climate change advocates. Sustainable land use policy and its implementation are recommended.

TI  - Sentinel node mapping in thyroid cancer: an overview
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we describe the current status of sentinel node mapping (SNM) in thyroid tumors and its potential perspectives. SNM in thyroid cancer has been tested since the end of the twentieth century, mainly in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and in medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). In PTC, it has been employed to find occult lymph node metastases in the central compartment of the neck as an alternative or indication for prophylactic dissection, by several methods. All of them have proven effective in spotting sentinel nodes, but the results have been somewhat diminished by uncertainty about the clinical significance of occult metastases in differentiated thyroid cancer. SNM in MTC has also been used to find occult lymph node metastases in the lateral compartments of the neck, also with excellent results hindered by a similar doubt about the real clinical significance of MTC micrometastases. Well designed, adequately sized randomized controlled trials are lacking, so SNM in thyroid tumors remains an interesting yet experimental methodology. New technology is emerging that could facilitate such studies, which could add solid information about the clinical significance of occult neck metastases in thyroid cancer.

TI  - Multi-annual grassland mowing dynamics in Germany: spatio-temporal patterns and the influence of climate, topographic and socio-political conditions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Grasslands cover one third of the agricultural area in Germany and are mainly used for fodder production. However, grasslands fulfill many other ecosystem functions, like carbon storage, water filtration and the provision of habitats. In Germany, grasslands are mown and/or grazed multiple times during the year. The type and timing of management activities and the use intensity vary strongly, however co-determine grassland functions. Large-scale spatial information on grassland activities and use intensity in Germany is limited and not openly provided. In addition, the cause for patterns of varying mowing intensity are usually not known on a spatial scale as data on the incentives of farmers behind grassland management decisions is not available.Methods: We applied an algorithm based on a thresholding approach utilizing Sentinel-2 time series to detect grassland mowing events to investigate mowing dynamics in Germany in 2018-2021. The detected mowing events were validated with an independent dataset based on the examination of public webcam images. We analyzed spatial and temporal patterns of the mowing dynamics and relationships to climatic, topographic, soil or socio-political conditions.Results: We found that most intensively used grasslands can be found in southern/south-eastern Germany, followed by areas in northern Germany. This pattern stays the same among the investigated years, but we found variations on smaller scales. The mowing event detection shows higher accuracies in 2019 and 2020 (F1 = 0.64 and 0.63) compared to 2018 and 2021 (F1 = 0.52 and 0.50). We found a significant but weak (R (2) of 0-0.13) relationship for a spatial correlation of mowing frequency and climate as well as topographic variables for the grassland areas in Germany. Further results indicate a clear value range of topographic and climatic conditions, characteristic for intensive grassland use. Extensive grassland use takes place everywhere in Germany and on the entire spectrum of topographic and climatic conditions in Germany. Natura 2000 grasslands are used less intensive but this pattern is not consistent among all sites.Discussion: Our findings on mowing dynamics and relationships to abiotic and socio-political conditions in Germany reveal important aspects of grassland management, including incentives of farmers.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the hybrid model based on artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to investigate the seasonal and spatial variability of chlorophyll a (Chla) concentration using MODIS data in the coastal water of the Sinpho Bay, DPR Korea. The GA has been used to optimize the ANN parameters such as the initial weights and biases. The four spectral bands (488, 547, 667 and 678 nm) of MODIS data were used for estimating Chla concentration in this study. The study results have shown that the GA-optimized ANN (GA-ANN) model has higher accuracy (RMSE of 2.98 mg m(-3), R-2 of 0.85, MB of 2.67 mg m(-3) and MRD of 14.24%) in retrieving Chla concentrations compared to the OCI algorithm and the ANN without GA optimization. In the Sinpho Bay, the highest Chla concentrations (> 30 mg m(-3)) occurred near the Namdae and Tonggol River estuaries and along the coast. Furthermore, the Chla concentrations were highest (> 27 mg m(-3)) during the spring season (May and early June) and were lowest (< 5 mg m(-3)) during the winter season (January and February). The present results have shown that the proposed GA-ANN model can significantly improve the remote estimation of the Chla concentration in optically complex case 2 waters, which will be of great value to natural resource managers and scientists involved in managing the inland and coastal aquatic environments.

TI  - Row selection in remote sensing from four-row plots of maize and sorghum based on repeatability and predictive modeling
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing enables the rapid assessment of many traits that provide valuable information to plant breeders throughout the growing season to improve genetic gain. These traits are often extracted from remote sensing data on a row segment (rows within a plot) basis enabling the quantitative assessment of any row-wise subset of plants in a plot, rather than a few individual representative plants, as is commonly done in field-based phenotyping. Nevertheless, which rows to include in analysis is still a matter of debate. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate row selection and plot trimming in field trials conducted using four-row plots with remote sensing traits extracted from RGB (red-green-blue), LiDAR (light detection and ranging), and VNIR (visible near infrared) hyperspectral data. Uncrewed aerial vehicle flights were conducted throughout the growing seasons of 2018 to 2021 with data collected on three years of a sorghum experiment and two years of a maize experiment. Traits were extracted from each plot based on all four row segments (RS) (RS1234), inner rows (RS23), outer rows (RS14), and individual rows (RS1, RS2, RS3, and RS4). Plot end trimming of 40 cm was an additional factor tested. Repeatability and predictive modeling of end-season yield were used to evaluate performance of these methodologies. Plot trimming was never shown to result in significantly different outcomes from non-trimmed plots. Significant differences were often observed based on differences in row selection. Plots with more row segments were often favorable for increasing repeatability, and excluding outer rows improved predictive modeling. These results support long-standing principles of experimental design in agronomy and should be considered in breeding programs that incorporate remote sensing.

TI  - The Moral Reasoning of Ideology: The Mediating Role of Moral Foundations, Moral Absolutism, and Consistency Norm
T2  - SPANISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Focusing on the ideological and worldview premises of moral reasoning, our study (N = 313) has as a starting point the well-known relationship between morality and distributive justice norms. We examined the serially mediating role of progressiveness on morality, moral absolutism, and consistency norm on the relationship between ideological/worldview perspectives and distributional criteria. Three groups of respondents were formed based on participants' ideological and worldview perceptions and then serial mediation analysis was conducted. The present findings suggest that morality is predicted by ideology and worldview and predicts attitudes toward the norms of equity and welfare chauvinism, through moral absolutism and interpretations of consistency norm, thus confirming our hypothesis. Moderate Passive Individualists emerged as the group who adopts the most progressive and inclusive attitude towards moral evaluations and practices, while Demobilized Collectivists and Neoliberals maintain a more conservative attitude towards issues that are subjected to moral framing. Our findings shed light on the crucial role of consistency norm, which has not received enough attention until now.

TI  - Do Conspiracy Theories Shape or Rationalize Vaccination Hesitancy Over Time?
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PERSONALITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Conspiracy beliefs are associated with vaccination hesitancy, which is commonly interpreted as evidence that conspiracy theories contribute to a worldview that damages public health. An alternative, and often ignored, explanation for this relationship is that people may rationalize their existing vaccination hesitancy through conspiracy theories. In two panel studies conducted at multiple time points during the vaccination campaign of 2021, we tested the temporal relationships between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and vaccination intentions. Study 1 (three waves in a Dutch sample) provided evidence for temporal effects of conspiracy beliefs on vaccination hesitancy and of vaccination hesitancy on conspiracy beliefs. Study 2 (two waves in a U.S. sample), however, only supported an effect of vaccination hesitancy on conspiracy beliefs over time. Although these findings provide some support for the idea that conspiracy beliefs shape increased vaccination hesitancy, they more consistently support the alternative idea that vaccination hesitancy shapes increased conspiracy beliefs.

TI  - Evaluating GEDI data fusions for continuous characterizations of forest wildlife habitat
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous characterizations of forest structure are critical for modeling wildlife habitat as well as for assessing trade-offs with additional ecosystem services. To overcome the spatial and temporal limitations of airborne lidar data for studying wide-ranging animals and for monitoring wildlife habitat through time, novel sampling data sources, including the space-borne Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar instrument, may be incorporated within data fusion frameworks to scale up satellite-based estimates of forest structure across continuous spatial extents. The objectives of this study were to: 1) investigate the value and limitations of satellite data sources for generating GEDI-fusion models and 30 m resolution predictive maps of eight forest structure measures across six western U.S. states (Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and Montana); 2) evaluate the suitability of GEDI as a reference data source and assess any spatiotemporal biases of GEDI-fusion maps using samples of airborne lidar data; and 3) examine differences in GEDI-fusion products for inclusion within wildlife habitat models for three keystone woodpecker species with varying forest structure needs. We focused on two fusion models, one that combined Landsat, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar, disturbance, topographic, and bioclimatic predictor information (combined model), and one that was restricted to Landsat, topographic, and bioclimatic predictors (Landsat/topo/bio model). Model performance varied across the eight GEDI structure measures although all representing moderate to high predictive performance (model testing R2 values ranging from 0.36 to 0.76). Results were similar between fusion models, as well as for map validations for years of model creation (2019-2020) and hindcasted years (2016-2018). Within our wildlife case studies, modeling encounter rates of the three woodpecker species using GEDI-fusion inputs yielded AUC values ranging from 0.76-0.87 with observed relationships that followed our ecological understanding of the species. While our results show promise for the use of remote sensing data fusions for scaling up GEDI structure metrics of value for habitat modeling and other applications across broad continuous extents, further assessments are needed to test their performance within habitat modeling for additional species of conservation interest as well as biodiversity assessments.

TI  - Non-Invasive Detection, Precise Localization, and Perioperative Navigation of In Vivo Deep Lesions Using Transmission Raman Spectroscopy
T2  - ADVANCED SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Non-invasive detection and precise localization of deep lesions have attracted significant attention for both fundamental and clinical studies. Optical modality techniques are promising with high sensitivity and molecular specificity, but are limited by shallow tissue penetration and the failure to accurately determine lesion depth. Here the authors report in vivo ratiometric surface-enhanced transmission Raman spectroscopy (SETRS) for non-invasive localization and perioperative surgery navigation of deep sentinel lymph nodes in live rats. The SETRS system uses ultrabright surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) nanoparticles with a low detection limit of 10 pM and a home-built photosafe transmission Raman spectroscopy setup. The ratiometric SETRS strategy is proposed based on the ratio of multiple Raman spectral peaks for obtaining lesion depth. Via this strategy, the depth of the phantom lesions in ex vivo rat tissues is precisely determined with a mean-absolute-percentage-error of 11.8%, and the accurate localization of a 6-mm-deep rat popliteal lymph node is achieved. The feasibility of ratiometric SETRS allows the successful perioperative navigation of in vivo lymph node biopsy surgery in live rats under clinically safe laser irradiance. This study represents a significant step toward the clinical translation of TRS techniques, providing new insights for the design and implementation of in vivo SERS applications.

TI  - Diurnal carbon monoxide observed from a geostationary infrared hyperspectral sounder: first result from GIIRS on board FengYun-4B
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) on board FengYun-4 series satellites is the world's first geostationary hyperspectral infrared sounder. With hyperspectral measurement collected from a geostationary orbit covering the carbon monoxide (CO) absorption window around 2150 cm-1, GIIRS provides a unique opportunity for monitoring the diurnal variabilities of atmospheric CO over eastern Asia. In this study, we develop the FengYun Geostationary satellite Atmospheric Infrared Retrieval (FY-GeoAIR) algorithm to retrieve the CO profiles using observations from GIIRS on board FY-4B, which was launched in June 2021, and provide CO maps at a spatial resolution of 12 km and a temporal resolution of 2 h. The performance of the algorithm is first evaluated by conducting retrieval experiments using simulated synthetic spectra. The result shows that the GIIRS data provide significant information for constraining CO profiles. The degree of freedom for signal (DOFS) and retrieval error are both highly correlated with thermal contrast (TC), the temperature difference between the surface and the lower atmosphere. Retrieval results from 1 month of GIIRS spectra in July 2022 show that the DOFS for the majority is between 0.8 and 1.5 for the CO total column and between 0 and 0.8 for the bottom three layers ranging from the surface to 3 km a.s.l. Consistent with CO retrievals from low-Earth-orbit (LEO) infrared sounders, the largest observation sensitivity, as quantified by the averaging kernel (AK), is in the free troposphere at around 3-6 km. The diurnal changes in DOFS and vertical sensitivity of observation are primarily driven by the diurnal TC variabilities. Finally, we compare the CO total columns between GIIRS and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and find that the two datasets show good consistency in capturing the spatial and temporal variabilities. This study demonstrates that the GIIRS retrievals are able to reproduce the temporal variability of CO total columns over eastern Asia in the daytime in July. Nevertheless, the retrievals have low detectivity in the nighttime due to their weak sensitivity to the ground level CO changes limited by low information content. Model assimilation that takes into account the retrieved diurnal CO profiles and the associated vertical sensitivity will have potential in improving local and global air quality and climate research over eastern Asia.

TI  - A coastal band spectral combination for water body extraction using Landsat 8 images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The explosive rate of population growth demands a revision of existing protective measures to address water scarcity that urges water body monitoring models to be developed using satellite image-based change detection approaches. And the main objective of this proposed work was to investigate the spectral indices for spatial object extraction in satellite images with respect to water body extraction. The Landsat 8 coastal/aerosol band (0.433-0.453 & mu;m) is still an unexplored band with spectral signatures that favor water extraction, and it has been used in the proposed deep blue normalized difference water index (DBNDWI). The multi-temporal Landsat 8 data products of three lakes with distinct geographical importance from India and Iran are chosen for assessment. Widely used spectral indices for water body extraction such as the normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index, and automated water extraction index are the benchmark results used for comparative assessment. Along with these conventional water indices, the most recent water indices weighted normalized difference water index (WNDWI) and Wavelet-based normalized difference water index (WAWI) are also compared for extended validation. The use of standard image quality analysis and statistical histogram distance measures justifies the significance of coastal band in extracting water bodies. The experimental results tabulated show that proposed DBNDWI outperforms the most recent WNDWI and WAWI with higher accuracy, even in moderate-resolution images.

T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction > Intracystic papillary carcinoma is defined as papillary carcinoma located in a dilated or cystic duct. There is no consensus regarding the management of this lesion. The aim of our study is to evaluate the frequency of associated invasive lesions and the need to perform an axillary staging during surgery. Material and methods > This is a retrospective study concerning intracystic papillary carcinomas diagnosed at the Georges-Francois Leclerc Cancer Center between January 2010 and December 2021. Inclusion criteria were an age superior to 18 years and a histologic diagnosis confirmed at biopsy. Results > Fifty-nine patients were included in this study. All but one patient underwent surgery: 39 patients (67.2%) underwent lumpectomy, and 18 patients (31.1%) underwent total mastec-tomy. An axillary staging was performed in 51 patients (86.4%). On final histologic analysis, 31 patients (52.5%) had pure intracystic papillary carcinoma and/or associated with in situ and 27 patients (45.8%) had invasive and/or microinvasive lesions. After univariate analysis, the only variable significantly associated with the presence of invasive lesions on final histologic analysis was the palpation of the lesion with a P-value of 0.09. Discussion > Through this study, it appears necessary to discuss the realization of an axillary staging by conducting an axillary sentinel node procedure because of the high frequency of invasive lesions associated with intracystic papillary carcinoma.

TI  - Stability mechanisms and air temperature advection on the marine atmospheric boundary layer modulation at the southwestern Atlantic Ocean
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrostatic adjustment and vertical mixing are the two main mechanisms used to describe the stability of the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) in oceanic regions with intense horizontal temperature gradients. To analyze the occurrence of these mechanisms, we performed simulations using an active coupled regional ocean-atmosphere numerical model in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean (SWA) region in October 2014 in the presence of an atmospheric frontal system. A novel in-situ dataset was sampled by radiosondes in the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence (BMC) region and used with the model dataset. The vertical mixing mechanism and a prefrontal warm-air temperature advection were identified, which modulated the shallower and more stable MABL. The hydrostatic adjustment mechanism was not evident because of the near-surface wind convergence field modification caused by the large-scale atmospheric system observed in our experiment. The coupled model simulation presented good agreement compared to in-situ and satellite data. This contribution to the knowledge of the ocean-atmosphere interaction processes at the SWA reinforced that coupled models can be a helpful tool to investigate the air-sea interactions and physical mechanisms that explain MABL stability.

TI  - Phytoplankton pigment <i>in situ</i> measurements uncertainty evaluation: an HPLC interlaboratory comparison with a European-scale dataset
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton pigment data play a crucial role in ecological studies, enabling the identification of algal groups and estimation of primary production rates. Accurate measurements of chlorophyll a (TChl a) and other marine pigments are essential for the development of bio-optical algorithms and the validation of satellite data products. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is the gold standard method for quantifying multiple pigments in a single water sample. This study aims to investigate the uncertainties associated with phytoplankton pigment quantification by comparing duplicate sample analyses conducted by two laboratories, the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (J) and the DHI Group, Denmark (D). The analyses were performed using the same HPLC method. The dataset comprised 957 natural samples collected between 2012 and 2017 from various European seas, representing different trophic conditions with TChl a concentrations ranging from 0.083 to 27.35 mg/m(3). The study compared the results of the two independent analyses for TChl a and primary phytoplankton pigments, including chlorophyll b, chlorophyll c, carotens, fucoxanthin, 19 & PRIME;-butanoyloxyfucoxanthin, diadinoxanthin, diatoxanthin, 19 & PRIME;-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin, peridin, and zeaxanthin. The percent difference between the two analyses was calculated to assess the uncertainties associated with pigment quantification. The mean percent difference observed between the two independent analyses of TChl a was 10.8%. For the primary phytoplankton pigments, the associated mean percent difference was 16.9%. These results meet the requirements of 15% and 25% uncertainties, respectively, which are applicable for the validation of satellite data products. The comparative analysis between the two laboratories demonstrates that the uncertainties associated with phytoplankton pigment quantification are within acceptable ranges for the validation of satellite data products. Moreover, the study investigates the propagation of uncertainties in diagnostic pigment values to phytoplankton indexes, which are derived using pigment-based algorithms to characterize phytoplankton populations according to functional types.

TI  - Improving filtering methods based on the Fast Fourier Transform to delineate objective relief domains: An application to Mare Ingenii lunar area
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A recent study has proven that high-pass filtering (HPF) based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a rapid and efficient computational method for the semi-automated detection of geomorphic features from high-resolution digital elevation models (DEM). Although this new approach shows great potential for cartographic purposes using remote sensing data, some methodological improvements are still required in the following areas: (i) to develop a robust criteria for filter radius selection; (ii) to test the relationship between filter vectors and landscape form, and explore how DEM artefacts (vegetation, anthropic structures, etc.) can interfere with landform detection; and (iii) to explore filter response regarding generalisation and blurring effects when working with landscapes composed of landforms of different scales that are superimposed on one another. These topics are addressed here through two experiments (Experiment_1 and Experiment_2) with synthetic digital relief models inspired in the lunar landscape. Finally, the improved methodology was applied on the Mare Ingenii lunar relief (Experiment_3) using the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter DEM and the results were tested against ground truths (GTs) developed using the extensive database available at Astropedia website and an ad hoc crater map. The analysis of existing frequencies in a 2D DEM signal through the true magnitude-true frequency plot provides an objective method for filter radius selection, and the use of a Butterworth transference function enables a more versatile filtering. Experiment_1 demonstrates a close correspondence between vectors obtained by filtering called Filtered Geomorphic References (FGRs) and the synthetic landform selected. The accuracy indicators from Experiment_1 and 2 show the good results obtained in the correspondence between FGRs and crater depressions, either from flat-bottomed to bowl shapes. Experiments 2 and 3 confirm that in landscapes generated by superimposed geomorphic features of different sizes, the smaller the crater, the better the filters detect its boundaries. Moreover, the spatial repeatability of FGRs can be used as a cartographic criterion in the identification of crater shape depressions or hills. Besides, the criterion is useful to assess true reality mapped in the GT employed. Finally, the objective geomorphic units obtained by combining the FGRs demonstrate their usefulness for the objective characterisation of the moonscape. Using the synthetic landscapes, the FGRs identify those relief domains composed of depressions and hills.

TI  - Evaluating the D4Science virtual research environment platform for agro-climatic research
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: From its early beginnings the Internet has been used by scientists to collaborate and share information about their research. Increasing connectivity and networking capabilities have resulted in improved collabora-tion functionalities ultimately combined in complete virtual research environments (VRE) as a type of virtual laboratories. These aim at providing collaborative online workplaces with access to all needed tools, data, and computing resources, and supporting data sharing. Since each research domain has its own characteristics, re-quirements, and preferred tooling, VRE providers must make trade-offs between the specificity of components and the functionality provided. The D4Science VRE adopts a modular approach based on open standards for constructing VREs for interested communities. The agro-climatic science domain develops diverse analytical tools that it connects to heterogenous data sources (i.e. climate data, experimental fields, satellite data, soil samples) originating from other domains, which is often poorly standardised and sparsely interlinked at best. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to test and evaluate the usefulness of the D4Science based VREs for this agro-climatic science domain, using crop growth simulation and crop phenology estimation as characteristic use cases, with specific attention to Open Science. METHODS: Based on the needs of the use cases a VRE has been composed and further developed in an iterative approach and evaluated at the end of each implementation cycle. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Both the development work and the evaluation results point at the foreseen po-tential benefits of adequate VREs and the current existence of sufficient opportunities and capabilities for constructing them. The focus when developing VREs should be on supporting research with proven and stable tools, instead of striving to include the latest and greatest. SIGNIFICANCE: The agro-climatic research domain has ambitious requirements concerning the availability and integration of data and models, which proved to be particularly challenging for incorporating in a VRE. Yet, a clear but gradual adoption of digital techniques to further the science itself is happening and VREs represent an ultimate possible end-state of Open Science. To conclude, this paper provides a few recommendations that we think can help this ongoing transition.

TI  - Which immigrants are welcome: The role of worldview conflict and immigrants' social status
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Worldview conflict has been shown to determine prejudice toward members of groups holding opposite views. In two experimental studies, we aimed at generalizing the consequences of worldview conflict to the reception of immigrants by a host population. We hypothesized that members of a host population have a more favorable attitude toward immigrants when they share the same worldviews. In Study 1 (N = 181), we took the example of same-sex marriage and showed that participants rated immigrants who held worldviews congruent with their own more favorably. In Study 2 (N = 467), we found that members of the host population were more favorable to a naturalization request by a high-social-status immigrant when s/he agreed with them concerning the Black Lives Matter movement. However, that worldviews congruency effect was not found for a low-social-status immigrant. Consequences of worldview conflict on the reception of immigrants are discussed.

TI  - Satellite-based, top-down approach for the adjustment of aerosol precursoremissions over East Asia: the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) NO<sub>2</sub> product and the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) data fusion product and its proxy
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to the need for an up-to-date emissions inventory and the recent achievement of geostationary observations afforded by the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) and its sister instruments, this study aims to establish a top-down approach for adjusting aerosol precursor emissions over East Asia. This study involves a series of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) NO2 product, the GEMS aerosol optical depth (AOD) data fusion product and its proxy product, and chemical transport model (CTM)-based inverse modeling techniques. We begin by sequentially adjusting bottom-up estimates of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and primary particulate matter (PM) emissions, both of which significantly contribute to aerosol loadings over East Asia to reduce model biases in AOD simulations during the year 2019. While the model initially underestimates AOD by 50.73 % on average, the sequential emissions adjustments that led to overall increases in the amounts of NOx emissions by 122.79 % and of primary PM emissions by 76.68 % and 114.63 % (single- and multiple-instrument-derived emissions adjustments, respectively) reduce the extents of AOD underestimation to 33.84 % and 19.60 %, respectively. We consider the outperformance of the model using the emissions constrained by the data fusion product to be the result of the improvement in the quantity of available data. Taking advantage of the data fusion product, we perform sequential emissions adjustments during the spring of 2022, the period during which the substantial reductions in anthropogenic emissions took place accompanied by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns over highly industrialized and urbanized regions in China. While the model initially overestimates surface PM2.5 concentrations by 47.58 % and 20.60 % in the North China Plain (NCP) region and South Korea (hereafter referred to as Korea), the sequential emissions adjustments that led to overall decreases in NOx and primary PM emissions by 7.84 % and 9.03 %, respectively, substantially reduce the extents of PM2.5 underestimation to 19.58 % and 6.81 %, respectively. These findings indicate that the series of emissions adjustments, supported by the TROPOMI and GEMS-involved data fusion products, performed in this study are generally effective at reducing model biases in simulations of aerosol loading over East Asia; in particular, the model performance tends to improve to a greater extent on the condition that spatiotemporally more continuous and frequent observational references are used to capture variations in bottom-up estimates of emissions. In addition to reconfirming the close association between aerosol precursor emissions and AOD as well as surface PM2.5 concentrations, the findings of this study could provide a useful basis for how to most effectively exploit multisource top-down information for capturing highly varying anthropogenic emissions.

TI  - Sentinel-1 time series data for sunflower<i> (Helianthus</i><i> annuus)</i> phenology monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of time series of Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for monitoring crops and their phenological stages has long been recognized. However, sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is one of the crops whose interaction with microwave signal is still not fully understood. Here, we aim to analyze and interpret time series of S1 data for sunflower phenology monitoring. The SAR backscattering coefficients in VH (vertical-horizontal) and VV (vertical-vertical) polarizations as well as their ratio (VH/VV) in both ascending and descending orbits were retrieved for three sites located in three different agro-ecological regions in Ukraine. We observed that sunflower backscattering response differs for the ascending and descending orbits for the VV polarization and VH/VV polarization ratio due to the directional behavior of the flower head. Our analysis did not find major change in VH polarization for the two orbits. We also compared the S1-based sunflower phenology with that of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from optical data acquired by Sentinel-2 (S2). Our analysis revealed a considerable correlation r2 > 0.4 between S1 and NDVI for VH and VV polarizations in both ascending and descending orbits; however, we observed lower correlation (r2 < 0.20) for the VH/VV polarization ratio in descending orbit (VH/VVdes). Based on the characteristics of sunflower phenology, we identified two sunflower phenological stages: beginning of flowering (BoF) and end of flowering (EoF). The difference between S1-based dates using VH/VVdes and reference dates was 4.1 and 4.4 days for the BoF and EoF stages, respectively; the use of VH/VVdes+asc yielded weaker results: 7.4 and 6.1 days. These results suggest that the VH/VVdes is a preferable parameter for identifying sunflower phenological stages such as BoF and EoF.

TI  - Changes and response mechanisms of leaf area index and evapotranspiration in the typical natural landscapes of the Loess Plateau in northern Shaanxi of China under the human intervention
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the relationship between human activity, vegetation leaf area index (LAI), and land surface evapotranspiration (ET) on the Loess Plateau in northern Shaanxi is crucial for maintaining regional ecosystem functions and optimally allocating water resources. This study investigated the driving mechanism of LAI on ET under the intervention of the human activity intensity (HAIS) by analyzing seasonal and interannual variability characteristics and processes using remote sensing data of land use, LAI, and ET in typical natural landscapes (forest, grassland, and desert) in northern Shaanxi from 2000 to 2020. The primary findings were: (1) In the previous two decades, grassland HAIS was the largest, mainly distributed in central districts and counties, and gradually decreasing. The LAI and ET were ranked as follows: forest > grassland > desert, with an interannually increasing tendency, and the yearly mean LAI and ET of forest reached 2.18 and 16.47 mm, respectively. (2) The LAI and ET of the three typical natural landscapes changed substantially during the growing season (AprilOctober) of vegetation, which increased and then decreased, reaching a maximum in June-August. The LAI and ET displayed noticeable numerical clustering among the months, with higher and concentrated values in JuneAugust and lower values in April, May, and October. (3) Forest and grassland HAIS negatively affected LAI, and detrimentally regulated ET by primarily influencing LAI4-LAI7 (LAI from April to July). Desert HAIS had a significant positive link with the LAI and primarily regulated ET by positively influencing LAI6-LAI10. Compared to forest and grassland, the coregulatory effect of LAI on ET in the desert lagged relatively in the month. Our study recommends accelerating the conversion of the desert to forest and grassland on the Loess Plateau in northern Shaanxi for stabilizing landscape ecosystem function and the reciprocal feedback between vegetation and water resources faster.

TI  - Modelling growing season carbon fluxes at a low-center polygon ecosystem in the Mackenzie River Delta
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A temporal upscaling study was conducted to estimate net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide and net methane exchange (NME) for a low-center polygon (LCP) ecosystem in the Mackenzie River Delta, for each of the 11 growing seasons (2009-2019). We used regression models to create a time series of flux drivers from in situ weather observations (2009-2019) combined with ERA5 reanalysis and satellite data. We then used neural networks that were trained and validated on a single growing season (2017) of eddy covariance data to model NEE and NME over each growing season. The study indicates growing season NEE was negative (net uptake) and NME was positive (net emission) in this LCP ecosystem. Cumulative carbon (C) uptake was estimated to be -46.7 g C m-2 (CI95% & PLUSMN; 45.3) per growing season, with methane emissions offsetting an average 5.6% of carbon dioxide uptake (in g C m-2) per growing season. High air temperatures (>15 degrees C) reduced daily CO2 uptake and cumulative NEE was positively correlated with mean air growing season temperatures. Cumulative NME was positively correlated with the length of the growing season. Our analysis suggests warmer climate conditions may reduce carbon uptake in this LCP ecosystem.

TI  - Sustainable management of sweet potatoes: A review on practices, strategies, and opportunities in nutrition-sensitive agriculture, energy security, and quality of life
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Review
AB  - CONTEXT: Sweet potatoes are sources of staple food for human nutrition and welfare. Hence, they can assist in developing food security in vulnerable communities. Equally significant, they offer industries suitable feedstocks to fabricate biofuels.OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the literature to establish practices, strategies, and opportunities in producing them for nutrition-sensitive agriculture, energy security, and quality of life.METHODS: We defined Web of ScienceTM and Science Direct & REG; as databases to select scholarly items to develop our driving bibliographic collection. We combined keywords and Boolean operators into search-engining strings, such as ALL = ["sweet potato" AND ("fertilization" OR "irrigation" OR "pest control" OR "breeding")], to strike them. We limited our search to peer-reviewed papers to address a methodologically sound approach. We assessed them for consistency and eligibility by reviewing titles, highlights, abstracts, keywords, methods, conclusions, and declarations (i.e., financial support and acknowledgment). We conducted our review independently. Nevertheless, we discussed them collectively to handle divergent opinions and intellectual conflicts.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We obtained sufficient and significant bibliometric data to elaborate on trending topics, such as nutrition-sensitive agriculture, food-fuel divide, and remote sensing for site-specific monitoring and intervention. Genotypes containing higher quantities of carotenoids and anthocyanins can contribute to human nutrition and welfare. They assist individuals in producing vitamin A and antioxidants, preventing xerophthalmia and malignant tumors. Some others are multi-objective, offering resources for consumption and processing into bioethanol. Hence, they can decrease conflicts in selecting edible tubers for bioenergy produc-tion. Genetic breeding can allow their cultivation in challenging environments, such as drylands, as it improves their response to fertilization and irrigation. Exploiting locally available fertilizers, controlling economically relevant pests biologically and culturally, and selecting healthy propagative material (i.e., vines) can further contribute to their cost-effectiveness, environmental footprint, and longevity. Equally significant, producers can benefit from high-resolution remote sensing data to monitor, map, and intervene in their fields early and pre-cisely, avoiding risky seasons. SIGNIFICANCE: Our review stresses the sustainable production of sweet potatoes as specialty crops for sus-tainable development. Hence, its ramifications offer stakeholders, such as producers, researchers, and policy -makers, catalytic, actionable knowledge to address pressing economic, environmental, and social issues. They can consider them in elaborating on physically and financially accessible diets and equitable, responsive rural arrangements for people in vulnerable regions. It can assist in mitigating hunger and malnutrition while creating opportunities and possibilities for farmers and consumers to produce and afford health-promoting, nutrient -dense tuberous roots.

TI  - Tree species identification in ex situ conservation areas using WorldView-2 Satellite Data and Machine Learning Methods: a case study in the Bogor Botanic Garden
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Spatially-explicit data on the species composition of forest plants can be an important tool for forest management and conservation. One specific application of these data is for identifying tropical tree species through machine learning techniques to classify satellite remote sensing images. This study aims to examine the ability to use Worldview-2 high-resolution data with various machine learning methods to identify tree species in the Bogor Botanic Garden. Eighteen species from 11 families were selected as samples representing an ecologically and taxonomically diverse data set. Using aggregated image variables, each tree species was found to have different reflectance, texture, and spectral vegetation index variable values. Cluster analysis showed that the 18 tree species could be separated into three clusters that partly reflected taxonomic relationships. Four machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Bayesian) were used to predict the species identity of pixels in the image data. A multicollinearity test using a Variance Inflation Factor method reduced the predictor variables from 54 to 9. The highest accuracy (0.96) was observed using SVM, followed by RF (0.91), KNN (0.86), and Bayesian (0.74). The implementation of high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning for species identification in tropical ex situ plant conservation areas, such as botanic gardens is reported here for the first time.

TI  - A large-scale disturbance mapping ensemble through data-driven regionalization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and monitoring disturbances in vegetation over large areas demand reliable approaches and accurate end-user maps. Methods and algorithms have been developed to meet satisfactory disturbance map accuracies, and the combination of multiple approaches has shown promise as a reliable alternative to any single method. However, extracting meaningful disturbance information from these combined methods is still challenging. Data variance from environmental conditions and disturbance drivers leads to spatial-temporal heterogeneity in land surfaces over large areas, which results in mapping errors. We evaluated the effectiveness of ensemble classification and data-driven regionalization for mapping vegetation disturbances at a broad scale. Using Google's Earth Engine cloud computing platform, our ensemble approach combines multispectral LandTrendr outputs reflecting preliminary disturbance information in a Random Forest model to map disturbances in Minas Gerais, Brazil. We then applied an unsupervised clustering technique to perform data-driven regionalization of our study area using several sources of environmental and anthropogenic information and analysed gains and losses in map accuracies. Our results indicated gains in accuracy by the ensemble method compared to non-ensemble methods of disturbance mapping, which ranged from 7.3 to 29.9% in overall accuracy at the 5% significance level. Data-driven regionalization addressed complexities arising from variability in vegetation types, local climate, and topography across our study area, identifying climate and seasonal metrics as important variables for reducing uncertainties in vegetation disturbance maps. The integration of these techniques has revealed significant potential for increasing map accuracy and has provided important insights into the development of disturbance mapping methods in heterogeneous environments.

TI  - Evaluation of advanced time series similarity measures for object-based cropland mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With more and more high-resolution remote-sensing data becoming available, satellite image time series (SITS) analysis is often used to map crops at the pixel level. Although the object-based image analysis paradigm has proven superior to pixel-based image analysis for overcoming salt-and-pepper effects, object-based time series crop classification is still rare. Except for time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW), other time series similarity measuring algorithms popular in the signal processing domain, such as shape-based distance (SBD) and global alignment kernel (GAK), remain poorly explored at the object level. Accordingly, this study aimed to explore better object-based time series classification frameworks by investigating similarity measures, including SBD, GAK and TWDTW, and thus experiments were designed to analyse the response of these methods to various parameters, including crop types, time series density, processing efficiency and so on. The results show that GAK is superior to SBD and TWDTW in general. Specifically, GAK performs better than TWDTW with the limited available images, e.g. in cloudy and rainy climate regions. Also, GAK outperforms SBD in identifying crops with a complex phenological pattern, such as alfalfa. Furthermore, TWDTW has the lowest processing efficiency. This study addresses the scarcity of similarity measurement methods in the object-based time series paradigm, and it is expected that this study could provide some guidance for the selection of cropland mapping methods.

TI  - MIRACLE: multi-satellite Island image registration using anisotropic coherence locality enhanced nonlinear diffusion and Mahalanobis distance guided marginalization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature in an image plays a crucial role for geometric image registration. The geo-registration problem becomes difficult for scanty feature islands' images captured by high and medium spatial resolution remote sensing satellites over deep ocean water. The article presents an automatic multi-satellite image registration methodology for scanty feature island scenes, termed as MIRACLE. In data pre-processing stage, the multi-spectral and reference image are enhanced using anisotropic coherence for better localized feature demarking of island regions. The input multi-spectral images are transformed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to maximize the variance information for improved feature matching with reference image. Enhanced features are detected and described using nonlinear diffusion filtering, and the matched control points are pruned using Mahalanobis distance guided marginalization optimization technique. The estimated affine parameters are applied to generate multi-satellite co-registered data products. MIRACLE is evaluated with multi-temporal Indian Resourcesat multi-spectral images and NASA-USGS Landsat-8 OLI panchromatic images that span from 5.0-metre spatial resolution to 15.0-metre spatial resolution and cover the Lakshadweep islands in deep ocean. The visual quality assessment indicates that different island regions are aligned at sub-pixel level registration accuracy. The matching accuracy of MIRACLE is quantified for multi-resolution images and is found to have 2.6% improvement in Correct Matching Ratio (CMR) as compared to the state-of-the-art feature based image registration techniques. The average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of island regions after precise geometric correction is found to be 0.45 pixel.

TI  - Impacts of Assimilating FY-4A AGRI Clear-Sky Water Vapor Radiance on Short-Range Weather Prediction during Indian Summer Monsoon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess the impacts of assimilating the clear-sky radiances from the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite on 72-h forecasts. First, we compare the water vapour (WV) brightness temperature (T-B) in July 2018 from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) analyses and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) forecasts with the clear-sky AGRI WV channel observations. The results suggest that the NCEP GDAS analyses are more consistent with the AGRI observations than the WRF forecasts, and the AGRI observations can be utilized to improve the initial conditions of the WRF model by data assimilation, especially in water vapour and surface temperature. After the preliminary verification, two identical cycling assimilation experiments are performed with and without the AGRI WV T-B assimilation for a month. The results reveal that the WRF forecasts with AGRI T-B assimilation are closer to satellite observations than the first guess in both WV channels. The validation with WV channel data of the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) and SAPHIR sensors indicates that after the AGRI data assimilation, the errors are smaller than in the control experiment (without AGRI assimilation). The assimilation of the T-B observed by AGRI WV channels shows a remarkable positive impact on moisture forecasts at middle and upper levels. Comparison of the T-B from the WRF forecasts with the MHS observations suggests that the AGRI WV channel assimilation can improve the predictions. Overall, assimilating AGRI WV observations can positively influence the WRF analyses and forecasts.

TI  - Permafrost thaw induces short-term increase in vegetation productivity in northwestern Canada
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Over the past several decades, various trends in vegetation productivity, from increases to decreases, have been observed throughout Arctic-Boreal ecosystems. While some of this variation can be explained by recent climate warming and increased disturbance, very little is known about the impacts of permafrost thaw on productivity across diverse vegetation communities. Active layer thickness data from 135 permafrost monitoring sites along a 10 degrees latitudinal transect of the Northwest Territories, Canada, paired with a Landsat time series of normalized difference vegetation index from 1984 to 2019, were used to quantify the impacts of changing permafrost conditions on vegetation productivity. We found that active layer thickness contributed to the observed variation in vegetation productivity in recent decades in the northwestern Arctic-Boreal, with the highest rates of greening occurring at sites where the near--surface permafrost recently had thawed. However, the greening associated with permafrost thaw was not sustained after prolonged periods of thaw and appeared to diminish after the thaw front extended outside the plants' rooting zone. Highest rates of greening were found at the mid-transect sites, between 62.4 degrees N and 65.2 degrees N, suggesting that more southernly sites may have already surpassed the period of beneficial permafrost thaw, while more northern sites may have yet to reach a level of thaw that supports enhanced vegetation productivity. These results indicate that the response of vegetation productivity to permafrost thaw is highly dependent on the extent of active

AB  - ObjectiveTo compare single-photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. MethodsThis hospital-based, single-center, retrospective study included 128 patients with cervical cancer (aged >18 years) treated between 2014 and 2022. Injection of 99 m Technetium-labeled phytate into the uterine cervix was used to detect pelvic SLNs. SNL identification rates and locations were analyzed for preoperative LSG and SPECT/CT. ResultsMedian age and body mass index of patients were 40 years (range, 20-78 years) and 21.7 kg/m(2) (range, 16-40 kg/m(2)), respectively. There was no significant difference in overall identification rates (identification of at least one SLN) of SLNs between SPECT/CT (91%) and LSG (88%). There was no significant difference in bilateral SLN identification rates between SPECT/CT (66%) and LSG (65%). A total of 219 pelvic SLNs (110 right and 109 left hemipelvis) were identified by SPECT/CT; the most frequent locations were the obturator (122 SLNs, 56%) and external iliac (67 SLNs, 30%). ConclusionSPECT/CT and LSG showed high SLN identification rates in patients with cervical cancer, and there was no significant difference in overall or bilateral SLN identification rates between the two techniques.

TI  - Tropical cyclones and depressions over the South Pacific Ocean since the late 19th century: Assessing synergistic relationship between the El Nino Southern Oscillation and Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclones (TCs) and tropical depressions (TDs), hereafter collectively referred to as tropical storms, often exhibit large year-to-year variability in the South Pacific Ocean basin. Many past studies have examined this variability in relation to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, particularly using observational data from the post-satellite era (i.e., after the 1970s when TC observations became more consistent). However, less emphasis is placed on how tropical storms are modulated at interdecadal and decadal time scales such as due to Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). This is because post-satellite data are available for relatively short time period (i.e., post-1970s), limiting our understanding of the IPO-TC relationship in the South Pacific. Here, using NOAA-CIRES 20th Century Reanalysis (20CR) dataset, we reconstruct historical records (1871-2014) of TC and depression proxies for the South Pacific Ocean basin, and then utilize these reconstructed proxies to first understand the connections between TC-ENSO and TC-IPO over the 20th century, and then investigate the combined effects of ENSO-IPO effects on TCs and depressions. Results show that La Nina (El Nino) is more dominant on TC activity than El Nino (La Nina) over the western subregion 140-170 degrees E (eastern sub-region, 170-220 degrees E) as expected. We also show that TC numbers are strongly modulated by the IPO phenomenon with, on average, more TCs occurring during the positive phase than during the negative phase of the IPO in both western and eastern sub-regions. We show for the first time (using a long-term reconstructed TC dataset) that the combined phases of El Nino and + IPO account for increased TC activity, as opposed to the combined phase of La Nina and -IPO, in the eastern sub-region. Similarly, the combined phase of La Nina and + IPO, as opposed to the combined phase of El Nino and -IPO, account for increased TC activity in the western sub-region. However, unlike TCs, the patterns of ENSO variability seem to be reversed for TDs. Changes in large-scale environmental conditions, such as environmental vertical wind shear, low-level cyclonic relative vorticity, mid-tropospheric relative humidity and sea surface temperature are linked to the various modes of variability patterns and their synergistic relationships.

TI  - Ensemble surface soil moisture estimates at farm-scale combining satellite-based optical-thermal-microwave remote sensing observations
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing presents great potential for soil moisture mapping, although a lack of high-resolution, all-season suitable data and model-based complications hinders continuous mapping at the farm scale. The current study attempts to access optical (Sentinel-2) and microwave (Sentinel-1) based Water Cloud Model (WCM), optical and/or thermal-based Thermal-Optical TRApezoid Model (TOTRAM), and Optical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) utilizing Landsat-8 data, and an ensemble of these three models synergistically using microwave, optical and thermal remote sensing data for fourteen dates spanning two post-monsoon periods over a semi-arid irrigated agricultural farm. The ensemble model developed with Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) offered a superior SSM estimate for the entire crop growth season. The ensemble model had the lowest RMSE (0.053 m3 m-3), followed by OPTRAM (SWIR2) (0.06 m3 m-3), while TOTRAM recorded the highest RMSE (0.092 m3 m-3), even though the model performances varied throughout crop growth cycles. For SSM mapping in the early phases of crop growth, WCM or TOTRAM were found superior, while during the latter growth stages, the performance of OPTRAM was better. In contrast to TOTRAM, which needs local calibration as the land surface temperature is sensitive to atmospheric conditions, the study emphasizes the shortcomings of WCM in terms of calibration requirements for changing vegetation structure utilizing in situ data. OPTRAM is suitable for generating SSM maps in semi-arid environments with a predominance of clear skies throughout the post-monsoon season. It is straightforward, low data, and resource intensive with universal surface reflectance-soil moisture association. The ensemble technique can be recommended for farm-level irrigation mapping over a post-monsoon period.

Machine learning is an important method in artificial intelligence. It can solve some complex problems through algorithms. This research uses linear regression algorithm in machine learning to construct the Fengyun Satellite NDVI correction method. By constructing a linear regression model, the NDVI value of Fengyun Satellite VIRR is corrected to a level that is basically the same as NDVIm. The corrected correlation coefficients (R-2) were significantly improved, and the corrected correlation coefficients were significantly improved, and the confidence levels were all significant correlations less than 0.01. It is proved that the corrected normalized vegetation index of Fengyun Satellite has significantly improved accuracy and product quality compared with the normalized vegetation index of MODIS.

TI  - The human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka: history and present status
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is a severe conservation, socio-economic and environmental issue of forests and ecosystems in elephant inhabiting countries, including Sri Lanka. Due to the rapid growth of human and elephant populations, both struggles to share limited land resources. The major causes and contexts of HEC in Sri Lanka include land use change, habitat loss due to human population growth, crop raiding behavior, problem elephants, and changes in agriculture practices. Since 2019, 125 people and 370 elephants have killed annually on average due to the conflict. Also, Sri Lanka has recorded the highest annual elephant deaths and second-highest human deaths due to HEC. The human death rate has increased by approximately 42% over previous three decades. The Sri Lankan government provides compensation for death and disability of the human caused by elephants and for elephant-damaged houses or properties. The Sri Lankan elephant (Elephas maximus maximus) is an endangered subspecies. It's home range is restricted to 50-150 km(2) and depends on the availability of food, water, and shelter of the habitat in which they live. Various management strategies have been developed by the government and villagers to prevent and mitigate HEC. Today, Sri Lankan elephants are protected under Sri Lankan law, with punishment by fines and jail terms. This article reviews the history, present status, and traditional conflict management of HEC in Sri Lanka. We suggest a satellite data fusion approach with GIS modeling to identify risk zones of HEC to develop further protective measures for humans and elephants.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of Imja Lake to estimate the downstream flood hazard using the SHIVEK approach
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is causing glaciers in the Himalayas to recede and shrink. The changing climate is the primary trigger of the expansion of glacial lakes that increases the possibilities of outburst floods (GLOFs) and leads to quantifiable losses such as mortality and damage to populations and infrastructure downstream. Therefore, determining the hazard related to the glacier lakes of the Himalayan region is essential. We have developed an approach named SHIVEK, consisting of the SWIR band thresholding technique and hazard analysis to estimate the possible downstream risk along the GLOF flow path. We examined the spatiotemporal expansion of Imja Lake from 1997 to 2020 using Landsat 5, 7, and 8 data. We employed an automated form of the previously described method based on SWIR band thresholding. The study creates yearly composites from June to September using pre-processed Landsat imageries using a cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine. Our results show a continuous expansion in the geographical area of Imja Lake from 0.81 to 1.56 km(2) in 23 years between 1997 and 2020, averaging nearly 0.032 km(2) per year. Also, the lake's area between 2012 and 2020 expanded by 0.26 km(2). The overall accuracy of 88.96 +/- 6.93% has been achieved for spatiotemporal maps of Imja Lake and intensified confidence in the approach. This study estimates a total of 645 buildings and four bridges that can be impacted due to the outburst of Imja Lake.

TI  - Retrieval of cloudy land surface temperature from AMSR2 brightness temperature, precipitable water vapour and cloud liquid water
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in many studies including hydrology, meteorology, and ecology. In addition to thermal infrared remote sensing, passive microwave remote sensing is an effective alternative for LST retrieval, particularly under cloudy conditions. In this study, we analysed the impact of cloud on the transfer of microwave radiation in simulated database and presented a parameterization method to compensate the impact. On this basis, we put forward an improved method for LST retrieval from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) brightness temperature at the 18.7 and 23.8 GHz channels with precipitable water vapour (PWV) and cloud liquid water (CLW) as supplementary input. The method is built on the basis of microwave radiative transfer equation and the assumption that 1) surface emissivity at two adjacent channels is linear and 2) the main factor causing brightness temperature difference at two channels is the absorption difference of PWV and CLW. The LST retrieval method was tested in simulated database, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.1 K. The method was then applied to AMSR2 brightness temperature and GFS reanalysis data to estimate global LST in 2019-2020, and the accuracy was validated using in situ LST measurements collected from 52 sites. The RMSE is approximately 4.7 K and 3.7 K for daytime and night-time, respectively. The improved LST retrieval method is promising in long-temporal and large-area applications.

TI  - Efficient Segmentation Algorithm for Estimation of Revised Reservoir Capacities in Google Earth Engine
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The periodic assessment of the revised capacity is essential and conventional techniques through bathymetric surveys and inflow-outflow techniques are time and resource intensive. The application of optical remote sensing data is practiced for a long time to compute the revised capacity of the reservoir but has the limitation of selecting threshold values and inefficacy of the method during the cloudy season. This research proposed the application of the Otsu segmentation technique in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to determine revised water spread using microwave remote sensing data. The Otsu technique is efficient in classifying the image into two distinct classes using within and between-class variances. An application has been developed using Sentinel data in GEE, which has the capacity of cloud-based computing and applied to the four reservoirs of Mahanadi Reservoir Project (MRP) namely Ravishankar Sagar, Murumsilli, Dudhawa, and Sondur reservoir in the Chhattisgarh state of India. The original capacities of these reservoirs vary from 910.51 MCM of Ravishankar (RS) Sagar to 165.89 MCM of Murumsilli reservoir. The revised water spreads computed in the GEE were further used to compute revised volume and in turn the revised cumulative capacities at different levels. The analysis suggested that 17.65% of dead storage (118.26 MCM from 143.00 MCM) and 9.25% of gross storage (85.26 MCM from 910.52 MCM) of RS Sagar has been lost in 42 years (1978 to 2020). Similarly, 10.33% gross capacity of Murumsilli, 13.12% of Sondur, and 12.37% of Dudhawa reservoirs have been lost due to the deposit of sediments from the catchments, and results were found comparable with bathymetric survey results of three reservoirs. The proposed application has been developed in GEE so it can be used in any part of the world in cloudy weather with no human interference.

TI  - Contribution of climate change and vegetation restoration to interannual variability of evapotranspiration in the agro-pastoral ecotone in northern China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a vital variable in the water and energy cycles and significantly influenced by changing environmental conditions. However, in the data-lacking agro-pastoral ecotone in northern China (APENC) that has undergone warming and wetting climate trend and implemented a series of ecological restoration projects (ERP), the effects of climate change and vegetation greening on the magnitude, drivers, and mechanism of ET variations are not fully understood yet. In this study, we evaluated nine commonly used ET products to determine the most applicable one in the APENC based on the in-situ observations and water balance method. Subsequently, the ET variation was examined and the contribution of each factor to the ET change from 1982 to 2017 was quantified. Results show that the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) performed best and meets the accuracy requirements for research in the APENC. Based on the GLEAM data, our analysis reveals a notable increase in ET at a rate of 1.11 mm/y (p < 0.05). Regions with a significant increase in ET are mainly concentrated in the middle and southwest parts of the APENC, while a decreasing trend in ET is observed in the northeast region. Contributory analysis showed that precipitation (PRE) and leaf area index (LAI) were the dominant factors that controlled the ET variation, whereas air temperature indirectly affected ET variation by promoting LAI growth during 1982-2017. PRE dominated the variation of ET before the implementation of ERP (1982-1999), while the positive contribution of LAI exceeded PRE since 2000 to become the dominant factor. Our findings bridge the gap in ET research in the study region and provide important information for water resource management and ecological rehabilitation.

TI  - Modeling and predicting spatio-temporal land use land cover changes and urban sprawling in Kalaburagi City Corporation, Karnataka, India: a geospatial analysis
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The spatio-temporal dynamics and regional land use driving factors are fundamental considerations in achieving suitable and sustainable urban development. These aspects play a significant role in shaping cities' physical, social, and environmental dimensions. This article aims to document and analyze the detection of LULC changes and their concentration, along with urban sprawl and prediction for the future. The study utilized multi-temporal satellite imageries of 2001, 2011, and 2021 to analyze the historical land cover, urban expansion, land transformation, growth direction, and urban sprawl in the study area. Subsequently, to predict and simulate future land use/land cover scenarios, the study employed an integrated cellular automata (CA)-Markov model using the theTerrSet software. The change detection results revealed that the built-up area had drastically increased from 17.90 to 40.64% from 2001 to 2021, and the barren land and agricultural land had significantly decreased. The transition matrix shows that the maximum barren land was converted into a built-up area and fallow land; at the same time, agriculture lost its maximum area, and built-up gained maximum area. The predicted LULC map of 2031 indicates specific patterns of change, including converting barren land into built-up areas and expanding vegetation cover due to reforestation and agricultural activities. The built-up area is projected to experience a significant increase and is estimated to expand by 62.29 km2, representing 50.46% of the total land-use area. Further, the study predicts a decrease in barren land over the ten years; the estimated change in barren land is 14.33%. The findings demonstrate that the model performed well in projecting the LULC of 2021, achieving an AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 78%. Additionally, the kappa coefficient of 0.8 further supports the model's capability as a feasible representation of the study area. The study's findings contribute to understanding LULC dynamics, urban sprawl, and future projections, and it provides crucial data for planning and decision-making processes, supporting sustainable land use management and informing strategies for suitable urban development in the study area.

TI  - Decadal shoreline changes and effectiveness of coastal protection measures post-tsunami on 26 December 2004
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline changing position along the coast is an immediate and long-term indicator determined by the interplaying driving forces across the dry and wet parts of coastal areas. Extreme waves, such as tsunamis, may result in a remarkable shift of shoreline position and a change of sediment transport regime, thus potentially inducing coastal hazards. This work investigates the multi-temporal changes and development of shorelines at the tsunami-affected coast nearly two decades after the Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December 2004. Additionally, the dynamic responses of the coast to the man-made coastal structures as a means of protection measures during the observed period are also evaluated. This study uses the US Army's Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) extension in the ArcGIS to calculate the multi-temporal shoreline changes and erosion/accretion rates. Multi-temporal shoreline vectors delineated from the LANDSAT satellite images are utilized to calculate the Net Shoreline Movement (NSM), End Point Rate (EPR), and Linear Regression Rate (LRR) for the respective short-term and decadal-term shoreline change analysis. The shoreline change rates are examined at the three shoreline segments at Aceh coast, the north tip of Sumatra Island of Indonesia. The results show that Segment A has the highest erosion rate due to the 2004 tsunami (- 395.19 m/year) compared to Segment B (- 26.46 m/year) and Segment C (- 74.26 m/year). The 2004 tsunami has changed the coastal states from erosional coast prior to the tsunami to accretional coast in Segment A and C, and the eastern side of Segment B in almost two decades since the tsunami. Consequently, ignoring such phenomena in designing coastal protection measures may lead to structural failures such the ones identified in the investigated coast. Thus, a thorough investigation of shoreline change is fundamental for coastal managers, particularly in determining appropriate coastal protection measures.

TI  - Evolving relationship of Nares Strait ice arches on sea ice along the Strait and the North Water, the Arctic's most productive polynya
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nares Strait, the waterway that separates northwest Greenland from Ellesmere Island, is a major pathway along which sea ice leaves the Arctic, including the planet's oldest and thickest sea ice that is experiencing an accelerated loss. Ice arches that develop during the winter at the Strait's northern or southern terminus can remain stable for months at a time during which the transport of sea ice ceases. The Arctic's most productive polynya, the North Water (NOW) or Pikialasorsuaq (West Greenlandic for 'great upwelling') forms at the Strait's southern end. There is evidence that a warming climate and the concomitant thinning of Arctic sea ice is weakening the arches and it has been proposed that this may impact the stability of NOW and the complex ecosystem that it sustains. Here we employ a categorization of recent winters with respect to the presence or absence of ice arches to explore their impact on sea ice along the Strait and over the NOW. We find that winters during which a southern ice arch is absent are associated with a reduced and thinner ice cover along the Strait with ice conditions over the NOW similar to that during winters with a southern arch. In winters, without a southern arch, there is also an acceleration of the winds along the Strait that contributes to the presence of reduced ice cover. Ocean color remote sensing data suggests that current levels of primary productivity over the NOW are independent of the presence or absence of an ice arch. The results suggest more research is needed to assess the stability of the NOW, with respect to reduced ice cover and primary productivity, in a future where ice arches cease to form along Nares Strait.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In order to ensure food security, it is crucial to collect agricultural information efficiently and accurately. Remote sensing has become increasingly important in obtaining crop distribution information on a large scale. However, current research based on satellite platforms struggles to meet the requirements of high-precision and large-scale crop monitoring simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose a method for achieving fine-scale crop classification by integrating remote-sensing data from various satellite platforms by constructing temporal-scale crop features within the parcels using Sentinel-2A, Landsat-8, and Gaofen-6. We adopt a feature-matching method to fill in missing values in the time-series feature construction process, to avoid issues with unidentifiable crops. The classification results of the Yellow River basin of the Ningxia region show that our method can achieve a wide range of crop discrimination on a fine scale, with an overall accuracy of 80%. Our proposed method demonstrates the potential of integrating multi-platform remote-sensing data to achieve fine-scale crop classification, which can aid decision-making for farmers, government agencies, and other stakeholders involved in the agricultural sector.

AB  - This article aims to understand the personal worldviews of Finnish youths. The fluidity of young people's personal worldviews has been highlighted in a number of previous studies, and this study presents more information by focusing on possible spiritual and religious elements in the personal worldviews of young people and on the influences that affect their personal worldviews. The data of this study consist of a quantitative questionnaire acquired from Finnish upper secondary school students (N = 973). The results show that young people's personal worldviews are not fixed but are fluid and that nominal membership in a religious community does not explain their worldviews. Young people do not see religion as important to them, and they see religion more as a part of culture and their environment than as a part of their personal worldview. The most important sources of information for the construction of their personal worldview are school and the Internet.

TI  - Cerebral embolic protection during transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis of propensity score matched and randomized controlled trials using the Sentinel cerebral embolic protection device
T2  - BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundThe Sentinel cerebral embolic protection device (CEP) aims to reduce the risk of stroke during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of propensity score matched (PSM) and randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigating the effect of the Sentinel CEP to prevent strokes during TAVR.MethodsEligible trials were searched through PubMed, ISI Web of science databases, Cochrane database, and proceedings of major congresses. Primary outcome was stroke. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, major or life-threatening bleeding, major vascular complications and acute kidney injury at discharge. Fixed and random effect models were used to calculate the pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and absolute risk difference (ARD).ResultsA total of 4066 patients from 4 RCTs (3 ' 506 patients) and 1 PSM study (560 patients) were included. Use of Sentinel CEP was successful in 92% of patients and was associated with a significantly lower risk of stroke (RR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.48-0.95, p = 0.02. ARD: -1.3%, 95% CI: -2.3 - -0.2, p = 0.02, number needed to treat (NNT) = 77), and a reduced risk of disabling stroke (RR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.17-0.65. ARD: -0.9%, 95% CI: -1.5 - -0.3, p = 0.004, NNT = 111). Use of Sentinel CEP was associated with a lower risk of major or life-threatening bleeding (RR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16-0.87, p = 0.02). Risk for nondisabling stroke (RR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.62-1.40, p = 0.73), all-cause mortality (RR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.35-1.40, p = 0.31), major vascular complications (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.33-1.67, p = 0.47) and acute kidney injury (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.37-1.50, p = 0.40) were similar.ConclusionsThe use of CEP during TAVR was associated with lower risks of any stroke and disabling stroke with an NNT of 77 and 111, respectively.

TI  - Forest management practices and policies exert strong impacts on the spatio-temporal variations of forest disturbance in Hunan Province, China over the last three decades
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbance has a profound impact on the ecological function of forests. Although there are already global forest disturbance products, how accurate and whether they can be further improved remains to be seen. Moreover, due to the scarcity of disturbance characteristics (location, size, severity) data, the uncertainty of carbon estimation and the bottleneck of sustainable forest management are formed. In this study, Hunan was used as the research area to explore the most suitable detection methods for subtropical forest disturbance. We used the LandTrendr algorithm to generate a forest disturbance dataset from 1991 to 2021 and analyzed their spatio-temporal variation and disturbance characteristics. The overall accuracy of forest disturbance monitoring in Hunan Province was 86.39%, which was higher than that of Global Forest Change (GFC) products (82.89%). A total of 11103.25 km2 of forest has been disturbed in Hunan Province over the past 30 years, which represents 10.54% of the total forest area. Over the period 1991-2021, the disturbance area generally increased first and then decreased but varies greatly across regions. The maximum disturbance rate of Changsha city occurred in the period from 2006 to 2010 at 0.95%, while that of Zhangjiajie City is only 0.15%, appeared in the period from 2011 to 2015. Both patch size and severity of forest disturbances have shown a gradual upward trend, and the proportion of disturbance events with large areas and high severity is increasing. This study explored suitable spectral index combination for change detection, and then revealed the spatio-temporal characteristics of forest disturbance in the study area, providing important spatio-temporal information of disturbance regime change that is critical for near-real-time adaptive forest management.

TI  - Spatial-temporal variations of groundwater storage in China: A multiscale analysis based on GRACE data
T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater storage (GWS) plays a key role in the freshwater supply in China. Revealing the changes in GWS in China is critical for realizing sustainable utilization of groundwater resources. We used Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data as well as HydroSHEDS datasets to quantify the variation of GWS in China from 2003 to 2020 at multiple scales. We found that GWS was decreasing at a rate of -2.09 mm/a in China. Three hot-spot areas with dramatic GWS decrease, located in Northwest, Southwest and North China, accounted for 55.52% of the total GWS decrease in China, and the reduction in GWS in these areas was driven primarily by human activities. Additionally, more than half of the urban agglomerations in China potentially impacted by the declining GWS. Therefore, it is suggested that targeted measures should be taken according to local conditions to strengthen the scientific management of groundwater.

T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are the most common types of geological and environmental conditions, as well as long-term and short-term geological processes. Various extreme events, such as earthquakes, heavy precipitation, flooding, and anthropogenic actions, among others, cause landslides. InSAR is (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) technique is widely used for detecting and monitoring land surface deformation, including landslides. This technique measures the changes in the surface elevation by analyzing the phase differences of radar signals between two or more satellite images acquired at different times. In this research study, the main aim is to show how effective InSAR is until it can detect landslides using SNAP software. The data used is sentinel-1(S-1), obtained from Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Program and the area selected is Hulu Langat district. It processed by SNAP software using S-1 data are free and openly accessible via various sources. Next, the final product from the SNAP software will be Georeferenced in ArcGIS.The InSAR method utilised in the field of study is due to a suitable study area for this technique which is hilly with a mix of urban and rural divided. Most of the landslides in Malaysia, specifically at Hulu Langat, are on a small scale, which is the InSAR technique that can detect it. The coherence image showed that black represents water and vegetation areas while white represents buildings, rocks, and roads. This research showed that InSAR can help detect natural events which are landslides significantly using the SNAP software. The result showed a phase and coherence map.

AB  - This research aims at determining and analysing the causes and consequences of desertification in the middle zone of Wadi Fatimah using satellite images, climatic data, and topographic maps. The climatic parameters such as temperature, rainfall, and global reference evapotranspiration (ET0) indicated com-mon severe arid conditions in the study area. The CORONA images acquired in 1967 and 1979 along with the topographic map of 1971 helped define the initial morphologic features and anthropogenic regimes. Analysing the various spatial datasets implied that the inappropriate management of water resources has resulted in changes in the anthropogenic regimes in the middle zone of Wadi Fatimah. These changes have triggered a chain of desertification processes such as degradation of the vegetation biomass and wind activities. These processes have transformed 15.3 km2 of agricultural farms into abandoned lands. Nineteen km2 of bushes have disappeared as well. The degradation of both agricultural and natural veg-etation has exposed soils to intense wind erosion that detaches, transports and deposits sand in areas of low elevations. Accordingly, sand accumulations have massively expanded from 16.4 km2, as monitored by 1967 CORONA images, to 40.8 km2, as monitored by SPOT in 2013. This research emphasises that the middle zone of Wadi Fatimah has been experiencing remarkable changes in its morphologic and environ-mental characteristics in response to serious desertification processes. These processes are strongly linked to many anthropogenic interventions. It became a necessity, then, to redefine, study and assess the various anthropogenic parameters and their relative roles in desertification processes to combat desertification hazards and enhance sustainable environmental context in the middle zone of Wadi Fatimah.& COPY; 2023 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Performance Assessment of DEM Vertical Sensitivity on Two-Dimensional Hydrodynamic Simulation in an Alluvial Tributary Floodplain of the Brahmaputra Lower Basin in India
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The application of geospatial and hydraulic approaches for understanding the genesis of downstream flooding are standard practices around the globe. Digital elevation models (DEM) are widely used in hydrodynamic simulations and provide the flooding extent information, magnitude, and distribution of the flow parameters in the main channel as well as in floodplains. However, the precision and accuracy of these DEMs are major concerns during their usage in the hydrodynamic simulations. In this work, a comparative assessment is carried out between the CARTOSAT DEM and Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) DEM with the observed elevation data and then incorporated into a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The two-dimensional geometry and radiometry are analyzed using ERDAS Imagine software. Results indicate that CARTOSAT-I DEM shows an R-2 of 0.66 with the ground data, and an R-2 of 0.281 is found with ASTER DEM. However, from the standpoint of two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.86 is found for simulations with CARTOSAT-I DEM, and 0.65 is found for ASTER DEM.

TI  - <i>Gaia</i> Data Release 3 Processing and validation of BP/RP low-resolution spectral data
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Blue (BP) and Red (RP) Photometer low-resolution spectral data are one of the exciting new products in Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3). These data have also been used to derive astrometry and integrated photometry in Gaia Early Data Release 3 and astrophysical parameters and Solar System object reflectance spectra in Gaia DR3. Aims. In this paper, we give an overview of the processing techniques that allow raw satellite data of multiple transits per source to be converted into combined spectra calibrated to an internal reference system, resulting in low-resolution BP and RP mean spectra. We describe how we overcome challenges due to the complexity of the on-board instruments and to the various observation strategies. Furthermore, we show highlights from our scientific validation of the results. This work covers the internal calibration of BP /RP spectra to a self-consistent mean instrument, while the calibration of the BP /RP spectra to the absolute reference system of physical flux and wavelength is covered by one of the accompanying Gaia DR3 papers. Methods. We calibrate about 65 billion individual transit spectra onto the same mean BP /RP instrument through a series of calibration steps, including background subtraction, calibration of the CCD geometry, and an iterative procedure for the calibration of CCD efficiency as well as variations of the line-spread function and dispersion across the focal plane and in time. The calibrated transit spectra are then combined for each source in terms of an expansion into continuous basis functions. We discuss the configuration of these basis functions. Results. Time-averaged mean spectra covering the optical to near-infrared wavelength range [330; 1050] nm are published for approximately 220 million objects. Most of these are brighter than G = 17:65 but some BP /RP spectra are published for sources down to G = 21:43. Their signal tonoise ratio (S /N) varies significantly over the wavelength range covered, and with magnitude and colour of the observed objects, with sources around G = 15 having a S /N above 100 in some wavelength ranges. The top-quality BP /RP spectra are achieved for sources with magnitudes 9 < G < 12, with S /N reaching 1000 in the central part of the RP wavelength range. Scientific validation suggests that the internal calibration was generally successful. However, there is some evidence for imperfect calibrations at the bright end G < 11, where calibrated BP /RP spectra can exhibit systematic flux variations that exceed their estimated flux uncertainties. We also report that, due to long-range noise correlations, BP /RP spectra can exhibit wiggles when sampled in pseudo-wavelength. Conclusions. The Gaia DR3 data products are the expansion coefficients and corresponding covariance matrices for BP and RP separately. Users are encouraged to work with the data in this format, with full covariance information showing that correlations between coe fficients are typically very low. Documentation and instructions on how to access and use BP /RP spectral data from the archive are also provided.

TI  - Ship-Based Observations and Climate Model Simulations of Cloud Phase Over the Southern Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Ocean (SO) clouds exert a significant influence on the Earth's radiation budget. We analyzed ship-based remote sensing observations of SO clouds over a 5-month long Department of Energy (DOE) ARM Measurements of Aerosols, Radiation and Clouds over the Southern Oceans (MARCUS) field campaign to better understand cloud phase variability. We developed a method to classify eight categories of hydrometeors (ice, liquid, mixed phase, rain, drizzle, snow, aerosols, and clear sky) based on measurements of lidar, radar and radiosondes. Cloud thermodynamic phases (liquid, ice and mixed phase) at coarser scales were further derived to compare with the DOE Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1 (E3SMv1) simulation and the Earth Model Column Collaboratory (EMC2) instrument simulator. For a scale-aware comparison with climate model simulations, we found that spatially averaging the raw remote sensing data (e.g., backscatter and reflectivity) results in increased cloud cover and cloud liquid, whereas, directly averaging cloud phase from higher to lower resolution maintains clear air regions and is thus recommended for in-cloud frequency comparisons. For cloud thermodynamic phases in stratiform clouds, the E3SMv1 underestimates cloud ice and overestimates cloud liquid at temperatures between -40 degrees C and 0 degrees C. When latitudes increase, both observations and simulations show a transition of dominant phase from liquid to ice for cloud tops as well as for the entire cloud columns, but the model underestimation of ice phase is more severe at higher latitudes. Such model bias is unlikely caused by spatial scale differences or lack of heterogeneity in cloud vertical structure in the simulation.Plain Language Summary The Southern Ocean region of Earth consists of vast open waters with extensive cloud cover throughout the year. This cloud cover prevents the ocean water below it from absorbing solar heat and maintains global ocean and atmospheric circulation patterns. Thus, it is important to improve our understanding and our ability to model this cloud cover to better predict future changes in the Earth's climate. Here, we analyzed atmospheric data obtained by a ship traversing the open waters between Australia and Antarctica for nearly 5 months. We examined observed cloud properties such as cloud ice and liquid proportions and compared them with global climate model results. We found that the model simulates more liquid and less ice at lower temperatures when compared with observations. Such model bias becomes larger at higher latitudes, indicating that Earth's surface may absorb more solar radiation than the model estimates, especially around Antarctica. Both the observations and the model show that ice clouds are common at higher latitudes whereas liquid clouds are common at lower latitudes.

TI  - Per-pixel accuracy as a weighting criterion for combining ensemble of extreme learning machine classifiers for satellite image classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable classification of satellite images is essential for various applications, including land cover and crop (LCC) mapping. In recent years, ensemble classifiers have shown remarkable success in satellite image classification as they provide solutions to combine and integrate multiple classifiers. This research presented a novel satellite image classification method called PAELM. The PAELM algorithm builds a diverse set of extreme learning machine (ELM) classifiers and combines them using the pixel-based LCC accuracy values in such a way that, for a given pixel, the most highly accurate ELM classifier among the ensemble of ELMs assigns the LCC class of that pixel. We validated PAELM on six experimental sites with varying geographical environments in the United States and compared it with three advanced machine learning classifiers, namely support vector machine, conventional ELM, and extreme gradient boosting and one advanced ensemble classifier. Our results showed that PAELM improved the accuracy of LCC mapping in comparison to the benchmark classifiers. The LCC maps generated by PAELM had an averaged overall accuracy and aggregated F1 score of 0.811 and 0.804, respectively, while these values for the most accurate benchmark classifier were 0.787 and 0.781, respectively. The results also implied that all the classifiers were sensitive to scene heterogeneity and LCC class composition, with PAELM being the least sensitive classifier to these factors. Overall, our findings suggested that PAELM was a promising approach for accurate LCC mapping, demonstrating the practicality of spatial accuracy as a weighting factor in the integration of ensemble of classifiers.

TI  - Estimating the canopy chlorophyll content of winter wheat under nitrogen deficiency and powdery mildew stress using machine learning
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important indicator of the photosynthetic capacity of crops, the canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) is nondestructively estimated by reflectance using various spectrometers. Crop growth is often severely affected by Nitrogen (N) deficiency and diseases, and the compatibility of the data collected for different stressors needs further clarification to develop unified estimation models. In this field experimental study, hyperspectral data of the wheat canopy were collected, along with canopy chlorophyll content, to assess nitrogen deficiency and powdery mildew stress. Comparative analysis of hyperspectral remote sensing data input features (original reflectance (OR), spectral index (SI) and wavelet features (WF)) was conducted. A combination of feature selection and machine learning was used to determine the best estimation mode for the accurate inversion of CCC under these two stressors. The results showed that the canopy spectra under nitrogen deficiency and powdery mildew stress had the same change trend. Under nitrogen deficiency, the sensitive wavelengths to CCC mainly reflected canopy structure characteristics, followed by pigments. Under powdery mildew stress, the sensitive wavelengths mainly reflected pigment characteristics, followed by canopy structure. Eight input features (two reflectance wavelengths, two spectral indices and four wavelet features) were selected using competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) and variance inflation factor (VIF) methods. Machine learning (ML) produced better estimates for both stressors. For CCC estimation under nitrogen stress, random forest regression (RFR) was more suitable (R2 = 0.828; RMSE = 0.363 g/m2) and showed a higher accuracy for both the calibration and validation sets. For CCC estimation under powdery mildew stress, support vector machine regression (SVR) was more suitable (R2 = 0.787; RMSE = 0.126 g/m2), especially when OR and WF data were used as input features. For the unified estimation of CCC under both stressors, WF is most effective as an input feature and good accuracy is achieved for both SVR (R2 = 0.846; RMSE = 0.296 g/m2) and RFR (R2 = 0.844; RMSE = 0.297 g/m2), and their differences are very small. The results demonstrated that the CWT-CARS-VIF-ML mode was appropriate for CCC estimation under two different stressors, which provides an ideal reference and technical guidance for the evaluation of photosynthetic potential and improved crop management.

TI  - Extreme Smog Challenge of India Intensified by Increasing Lower Tropospheric Stability
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme smog in India widely impacts air quality in late autumn and winter months. While the links between emissions, air quality and health impacts are well-recognized, the association of smog and its intensification with climatic trends in the lower troposphere, where aerosol pollution and its radiative effects manifest, are not understood well. Here we use long-term satellite data to show a significant increase in aerosol exceedances over northern India, resulting in sustained atmospheric warming and surface cooling trends over the last two decades. We find several lines of evidence suggesting these aerosol radiative effects have induced a multidecadal (1980-2019) strengthening of lower tropospheric stability and increase in relative humidity, leading to over fivefold increase in poor visibility days. Given this crucial aerosol-radiation-meteorological feedback driving the smog intensification, results from this study would help inform mitigation strategies supporting stronger region-wide measures, which are critical for solving the smog challenge in India.

TI  - A sustainable solution to manage ecosystem health of wetlands in urban and peri-urban areas of Lucknow district, India using geospatial techniques and community based pragmatic approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are multi-functional landscapes between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems that provide habitat for wildlife, support groundwater recharge, moderate climate, control flood and fulfil the livelihood of the com-munities. Rapid population growth, urban expansion, and industrialization have caused the degradation of wetlands over the last few decades. The wetlands located in the urban and peri-urban areas are generally the most threatened ecosystems globally. The present study assessed the ecosystem health of urban and peri-urban wetlands of Lucknow district in India and recommended a sustainable solution for their management. Remote sensing data derived from the normalized difference vegetation index, modified normalized difference water index, and land use/land cover change were utilized for analyzing the spatiotemporal change in areas under wetlands, from 1989 to 2018. Site-specific indicators on pressure, state and response were integrated in FRAGSTATS-based assessment to construct a Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model. A qualitative field survey has been conducted through focus group discussion and expert opinion to validate the result from the PSR model. The results revealed that the overall health of the wetlands has deteriorated drastically in these peri-urban areas owing to anthropogenic activities. The wetland ecosystem's health is significantly correlated with land trans-formation. The study recommended community participation, and involvement of local authorities in storing rainwater, constructing culverts and channels, and interlinking them with wetlands for sustainable conservation and effective management of the wetland ecosystem.

TI  - De-implementation of Axillary Dissection in Women Undergoing Mastectomy for Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) was standard treatment for breast cancer with positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) until 2011, when data from the Z11 and AMAROS trials challenged its survival benefit in early stage breast cancer. We assessed the contribution of patient, tumor, and facility factors on cALND use in patients undergoing mastectomy and SLN biopsy.Patients and Methods. Using the National Cancer Database, patients diagnosed from 2012 to 2017 who underwent upfront mastectomy and SLN biopsy with at least one positive SLN were included. A multivariable mixed effects logistic regression model was used to determine the effect of patient, tumor, and facility variables on cALND use. Reference effect measures (REM) were used to compare the contribution of general contextual effects (GCE) to variation in cALND use.Results. From 2012 to 2017, the overall use of cALND decreased from 81.3% to 68.0%. Overall, younger patients, larger tumors, higher grade tumors, and tumors with lymphovascular invasion were more likely to undergo cALND. Facility variables, including higher surgical volume and facility location in the Midwest, were associated with increased use of cALND. However, REM results showed that the contribution of GCE to the variation in cALND use exceeded that of the measured patient, tumor, facility, and time variables.Conclusions. There was a decrease in cALND use during the study period. However, cALND was frequently performed in women after mastectomy found to have a positive SLN. There is high variability in cALND use, mainly driven by interfacility practice variation rather than specific high-risk patient and/or tumor characteristics.

TI  - InSAR-based method for monitoring the long-time evolutions and spatial-temporal distributions of unstable slopes with the impact of water-level fluctuation: A case study in the Xiluodu reservoir
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Slope instability in reservoir areas is one of the greatest concerns for public and governments worldwide. The long-time evolution of the unstable slopes in reservoir areas after the impoundments remain poorly understood. Among the technologies applied to detecting and monitoring unstable slopes, interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology is one of the most effective. However, owing to the slopes in a reservoir suffering from periodic water-level fluctuations, InSAR technology has shortcomings for monitoring unstable slopes with large displacement for a long time. In this study, a post-processing method of InSAR and a practical strategy were proposed to monitor the long-time evolution of the unstable slopes in reservoir areas both spatially and temporally. The strategy can capture the evolution trends of the unstable slopes based on the variations in their deformation areas with reservoir water-level fluctuations for a long time. The case study was carried out in the Xiluodu reservoir area of China. The monitoring data of the unstable slopes before and after reservoir impoundment were extracted from multi-source SAR data, including those from ALOS-1, ENVISAT ASAR, and Sentinel-1. It was found that there were 40 unstable slopes before the reservoir impoundment and 152 unstable slopes after the reservoir impoundment. Of the 152 slopes, 142 slopes (94%) began deforming in the first 3 years after reservoir impoundment, 15 slopes have been experiencing continuous deformation, and 137 slopes underwent intermittent deformation. The areas of 79 slopes (52%) increased during the water-level drawdown periods and decreased during the rising periods. The areas of 22 slopes (14%) demonstrated the opposite trend, and the areas of 51 slopes (34%) increased independently of the water-level fluctuations. In terms of evolution trends in the deformation area, 30% of slopes experienced a decreasing trend, 15% were under a constant deformation trend, and 55% showed an increasing trend. The distribution of the unstable slopes varied from the dam site to the end of the reservoir, and most of them favorited the areas where slope angle and height were 20-35 degrees and 30-300 m, respectively. The soil slopes composed of the previous landslide deposits were prone to deformation, followed by the dip to overdip layered rock slopes.

TI  - Black-odorous water bodies annual dynamics in the context of climate change adaptation in Guangzhou City, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Black-odorous water (BOW) in urban areas has brought detrimental ecological effects and posed a threat to the health of surrounding residents. Identifying BOWs in urban areas is difficult because they are usually small in area, and discontinuous in spatial distribution. The efforts to adapt to climate change in cities have a direct connection to urban environment and may affect the dynamics of BOWs, but their relationship has seldom been addressed in previous research. This research builds a new urban BOW detection model using Gaofen (GF) images and ground-level in-situ water quality data to detect the spatiotemporal dynamics of BOWs in Guangzhou City's main urban area from 2016 to 2020, when comprehensive climate adaptation strategy has been implemented as a pilot metropolitan area in China. Spatial analysis in the study area with a total of 97 focused rivers revealed a decreasing trend in BOW occurrence (from 85.57% in 2016 to 21.65% in 2020) in the context of climate change adaptation efforts. Redundancy analysis between BOWs occurrence and environmental factors showed that across the entire study area, the contributions of anthropogenic factors (highest proportion at 14.3% for the area percentage of built-ups) to BOW, such as population density, agricultural water use, domestic water use, and so on, distinctly stronger than climatic drivers (largest contribution of 4.4% for temperature). The results suggested that climate change adaptation efforts help to decrease BOW occurrence in the study area, while exploring the response mechanism between climate change adaptation measures and the changes of BOWs is necessary in the future research. The findings were conducive to the development of targeted measures to decrease the occurrence of urban BOWs while improving adaptability of the city to climate change.

TI  - Dynamics of sewage outfall plumes based on Landsat-8-derived sea surface salinity and tidal characteristics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In the face of growing marine pollution, assessment of the sewage outfall discharges is essential as it affects the seawater quality. The study demonstrates sea surface salinity (SSS) variations caused by sewage discharges and links it with tidal characteristics to hypothesize the dynamics of sewage outfall plumes. SSS is estimated using a multilinear regression model based on Landsat-8 (L8) OLI reflectance and in situ SSS data of 2013-2014. Using the validated model, the SSS of the 2018 image is predicted and evidenced by its relationship with colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The preliminary results of the hypothesis are encouraging and found that the dispersion patterns of outfall plumes exhibit distinct characteristics depending on the intra-tidal range and hour. The findings indicate a lower SSS in the outfall plume zone than in ambient seawater due to dilution caused by partially treated sewage discharges from diffusers. The plumes observed during the macro tidal range are long and narrowly spread alongshore. In contrast, during the meso and microtidal ranges, the plumes are shorter and are primarily dispersed offshore rather than alongshore. During slack times, low salinity levels are visibly concentrated around outfalls as there is no water movement to disperse the accumulated sewage discharges from diffusers. These observations suggest that slack periods and low-tidal conditions could be significant factors contributing to the accumulation of pollutants in coastal waters. The study further suggests more datasets such as wind speed, wind direction, and density variations are needed to understand the processes influencing the outfall plume dynamics and variation in SSS. The study recommends increasing the treatment capabilities of existing treatment facilities from primary to tertiary treatment levels. Furthermore, it is important to warn and educate the public about the health risks associated with exposure to partially treated sewage that is discharged from outfalls.

TI  - Genetically programmed retinoic acid deficiency during gastrulation phenocopies most known developmental defects due to acute prenatal alcohol exposure in FASD
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) arises from maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy affecting 2%-5% of the Western population. In Xenopus laevis studies, we showed that alcohol exposure during early gastrulation reduces retinoic acid (RA) levels at this critical embryonic stage inducing craniofacial malformations associated with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. A genetic mouse model that induces a transient RA deficiency in the node during gastrulation is described. These mice recapitulate the phenotypes characteristic of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) suggesting a molecular etiology for the craniofacial malformations seen in children with FASD. Gsc ( +/Cyp26A1 ) mouse embryos have a reduced RA domain and expression in the developing frontonasal prominence region and delayed HoxA1 and HoxB1 expression at E8.5. These embryos also show aberrant neurofilament expression during cranial nerve formation at E10.5 and have significant FASD sentinel-like craniofacial phenotypes at E18.5. Gsc ( +/Cyp26A1 ) mice develop severe maxillary malocclusions in adulthood. Phenocopying the PAE-induced developmental malformations with a genetic model inducing RA deficiency during early gastrulation strongly supports the alcohol/vitamin A competition model as a major molecular etiology for the neurodevelopmental defects and craniofacial malformations seen in children with FASD.

TI  - Downwind Ozone Changes of the 2019 Williams Flats Wildfire: Insights From WRF-Chem/DART Assimilation of OMI NO<sub>2</sub>, HCHO, and MODIS AOD Retrievals
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the impacts of the Williams Flats wildfire (August 3-9, 2019) on ozone conccentrations and chemistry in the downwind region using an assimilation framework with satellite retrievals and meterological measurements. By assimilating satellite-retrieved nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO) columns, we improve surface ozone simulations (index of agreement of 0.94 compared to station measurements) and utilize aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals to simulate spatial dynamics of wildfire plumes better. Comparing simulated ozone with the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality aircraft measurements reveals a fair simulation of ozone in smoke and non-smoke plumes within the lower troposphere (7.00 ppbv mean absolute error). Comparing near-distance and far-distance locations, the study observed higher-than-average concentrations of nitrogen oxides, peroxyacetyl nitrate, nitric acid, and oxygenated volatile organic compounds due to wildfire emissions, which increased ozone concentrations by 3-5 ppbv during the wildfire in near-distance locations and 2-3 ppbv in far-distance locations. During more intense wildfire days, above 120 ppbv carbon monoxide plumes transported over the Rocky Mountains to the east. Ozone regime indicators showed a clear transition area downwind of the wildfire region that exacerbated the formation of ozone downwind. Our findings suggest that a joint assimilation of NO2 column, HCHO column, and AOD can enhance our understanding of wildfire-associated ozone chemistry and dynamics.

TI  - New techniques versus standard mapping for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - UPDATES IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - New tracers for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), as indocyanine green (ICG), superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) and micro bubbles, have been recently introduced in clinical practice showing promising but variable results. We reviewed the available evidence comparing these new techniques with the standard tracers to evaluate their safety. To identify all available studies, a systematic search was performed in all electronic databases. Data regarding sample size, mean number of SLN harvested for patient, number of metastatic SLN and SLN identification rate of all studies were extracted. No significant differences were found in terms of SLNs identification rates between SPIO, RI and BD but with a higher identification rate with the use of ICG. No significant differences were also found for the number of metastatic lymph nodes identified between SPIO, RI and BD and the mean number of SLNs identified between SPIO and ICG versus conventional tracers. A statistically significant differences in favor of ICG was reported for the comparison between ICG and conventional tracers for the number of metastatic lymph nodes identified. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that the use of both ICG and SPIO for the pre-operative mapping of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer treatment is adequately effective.

TI  - The Atlanticity of the Macaronesian islands during the Iberian Union
T2  - JOURNAL OF IBERIAN AND LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The search for the definition of the Macaronesian islands world (Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands and Cape Verde) has been a subject of constant reflection for the interpretation of these societies, both to understand their origin and their worldview, and to define the parameters that unite the island spaces with the Atlantic and, consequently, with that which is foreign. This research is focused on the analysis the characteristics which define the island phenomenon with the goal of understanding the peculiar significance of the composition of modern Macaronesian society during the consolidation of the Atlantic world at the time of the Iberian Union. In this regard, the islands of Macaronesia formed an essential terrain to feed and boost transatlantic circulation. The attraction of certain islands is their ability to cross distant paths, redistribute products and promote migratory flows in the Atlantic. In this way, the fluid contacts between islands of Macaronesia, which are complementary, promoted between the Castilian and Portuguese islanders not only a feeling of belonging to a supranational Iberian monarchy, but also a sensitivity of belonging to the same island region formed by a Portuguese and Spanish population of extrapeninsular origin with its nexus being it's the Atlantic insularity.

TI  - A generalized land surface reflectance reconstruction method for aerosol retrieval: Application to the Particulate Observing Scanning Polarimeter (POSP) onboard GaoFen-5 (02) satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Newly launched sensors often face challenges in obtaining sufficient observations in a short time to support the development of land surface reflectance (LSR) constraint for high-precision aerosol retrieval. To address this problem, we proposed a generalized spectral LSR reconstruction method. First, short-term overlapping observation of the target sensor and a reference sensor currently in operation is utilized to generate a representative spectral LSR comparison dataset. Then, the differences in spectral LSR caused by spectral response functions (SRF) are explored to construct a spectral LSR reconstruction model, which can convert the reference sensor's spectral LSR to match the spectral LSR of the target sensor. Finally, long-term spectral LSR data of the reference sensor can be reconstructed for the target sensor to support the surface constraint for aerosol retrieval. We applied this method to the newly launched Particulate Observing Scanning Polarimeter (POSP) instrument onboard GaoFen-5 (02) satellite, using MODIS as the reference sensor. We used one-month concurrently overlapping observation of POSP and MODIS to quantify the differences in spectral LSR and built the spectral LSR reconstruction model. Four years of MODIS LSR data were then reconstructed to develop the multispectral surface constraint scheme (B2RE) for POSP, which enables POSP data for high-precision AOD retrieval. We retrieved the global AOD at 550 nm over land for December 2021 to February 2022. Validation results of POSP AOD against AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD show that the POSP AOD derived from 490 nm observation is the most accurate with the correlation coefficient (R) of 0.914, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.080, mean relative error (MRE) of 1.60% and 82.5% of the values falling into the expected error (EE) envelope of & PLUSMN; (0.05 + 0.15AODAERONET). The spatial distribution of monthly POSP AOD also has good agreement with MODIS Deep Blue AOD product.

TI  - The impact of climate change and wildfire on decadal alpine vegetation dynamics
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Climate-induced changes of alpine vegetation diversity, cover and composition have been recorded globally, but most insights have been gleaned from field studies over small spatiotemporal scales. Aims. We assess dynamics in climate and vegetation of Australia's highest and most biologically diverse alpine area that surrounds Mount Kosciuszko (similar to 455 km(2)), as well as recovery following the 2003 wildfires. Methods. Climatic changes were analysed using gridded climate data for mean annual temperature (1910-2019) and seasonal precipitation (1900-2019), and changes in snow cover were assessed from snow course records (1954-2021). A vegetation cover time series (1990, 2000, 2010, 2020) was modelled with an optimised random forest classification using recursive feature selection, and the LandTrendr algorithm was used to detect areas burnt during wildfires. Key results. Over time, temperatures and summer precipitation increased, whereas snow cover and winter precipitation decreased. Subsequently, vegetation dynamics were dominated by the densification of subalpine woodlands at lower elevations, replacing dry and wet heathlands. There was treeline stasis but upslope advancement of dry and wet shrublines but grassland vegetation types were relatively stable. However, in burnt areas there was suppressed upslope advancement of shrublines, treeline recession and relatively less expansion of subalpine woodlands. Conclusions. Alpine vegetation may be impacted by climate change incrementally through relatively gradual changes in climatic conditions, and transformatively through landscape-level disturbance from wildfires. Implications. Higher temperatures and altered precipitation regimes increase the frequency and severity of wildfires, which may be amplified by increasing fuel loads and dryness from the proliferation and advance of woody vegetation in alpine areas.

TI  - Lymph node staging after primary systemic therapy in women with breast cancer and lymph node involvement at diagnosis
T2  - CIRUGIA ESPANOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The main objective of this study is to analyze the efficacy of combined axillary marking (lymph node clipping and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)) for axillary staging in patients with primary systemic treatment (PST) and pathologically confirmed node-positive breast cancer at diagnosis. The secondary objective is to determine the impact of lymph node marking in the suppression of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in the study group.Methods: We conducted a prospective study in which lymph node staging was performed using wire localization of positive lymph nodes and a SLNB with dual tracer. All patients who presented no metastatic involvement of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) or clip/wire-marked lymph node were spared an ALND. The multidisciplinary committee agreed on axillary treatment for patients with lymph node involvement.Results: Eighty one patients met the inclusion criteria. We identified and extirpated the clip/wire-marked node in 80 of 81 patients (98.8%), with SLNB performed successfully in 88,9% of patients. The SLN and wire-marked node matched in 78.9% of patients; 76.2% of patients did not undergo ALND.Conclusions: The combined axillary marking (clip and SLNB) in patients with metastatic lymph node at diagnosis and PST offers a high identification rate (98.8%%) and a high correlation between the wire-marked lymph node and the SLN (78.9%%). This procedure has enabled the suppression of ALND in 76.2% of patients. (c) 2022 AEC. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

TI  - Qualitative evaluation of the health insurance program in Nepal: Expectations beyond limitations
T2  - WORLD MEDICAL & HEALTH POLICY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The government of Nepal introduced a national health insurance program in 2016 to comply with the constitution and international commitments to ensure universal health coverage by 2030. This qualitative study explores public perceptions and satisfaction concerning the new health insurance program. The study is guided by an interpretive worldview using both in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs). Altogether, 34 (28 IDIs and 6 FGDs) events were conducted covering both self- and government-sponsored health insurance enrollees in the new health insurance program. The study found that insurees had larger expectations as well as both favorable and negative perceptions of the program. Positive perceptions included that the program helped to lower the gap between the wealthy and the poor, increase coverage with fewer financial contributions, and make it easier to receive health services financially. Negative perceptions included long waiting times for registration, consultations, laboratory test results, and pharmacy visits, as well as the lack of drugs, inadequate coverage (a low ceiling), low-quality services, and strict procedures, which combined to make insurees dissatisfied. We noticed that insurees had expectations that went beyond the program's guidelines, such as the expectation that services would be provided without queues and long waits, that additional services and coverage would be provided, and that preference would be shown for patients who lived far from hospitals. Adequate information, education, and communication- and process-related interventions that address these issues may help minimize the insurees' unrealistic expectations and areas of dissatisfaction.

TI  - Satellite-based drought monitoring using optimal indices for diverse climates and land types
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is considered one of the most destructive natural disasters, and many areas are experiencing water scarcity. Expanding knowledge of this phenomenon is a prerequisite for developing drought monitoring and forecasting tools. To this end, various indices are available for studying drought in different environments using field and remote sensing data. This study applies satellite-based indices for monitoring drought in different land cover, landforms, and climate classes. The in-situ standardized precipitation index (SPI) with a three-month time scale was applied to evaluate the performance of 13 remote sensing indices and parameters. The results indicated that the indices based on actual evapotranspiration, precipitation, and soil moisture, respectively, performed best in different parts of the basin. After additional analysis, the evapotranspiration condition index (ETCI), derived from actual evapotranspiration data, was deemed the optimal metric. The accuracy assessment results indicated that the correlation between the ETCI and the three-month SPI was 0.655, which was slightly higher than the actual evapotranspiration (0.637), and that the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) decreased from 0.71 to 0.65, indicating the best performance among the indices evaluated in the study area. Moreover, the drought map of the region was developed using the optimal indices, including the ETCI, the precipitation condition index (PCI), and the random forest (RF) algorithm. According to the results of the accuracy evaluation, the correlation between the estimated model and the observed three-month SPI values in 2017 was 0.72, with an RMSE of 0.60.

TI  - Vertical information of CO from TROPOMI total column measurements in context of the CAMS-IFS data assimilation scheme
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2017 the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board ESA's Copernicus Sentinel-5 satellite (S5-P) has provided the operational carbon monoxide (CO) data product with daily global coverage on a spatial resolution of 5.5x7 km(2). The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) plans to assimilate the retrieved total columns and the corresponding vertical sensitivities in the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Integrated Forecasting System (CAMS-IFS) to improve forecasts of the atmospheric chemical composition. The TROPOMI data will primarily constrain the vertical integrated CO field of CAMS-IFS but to a lesser extent also its vertical CO distribution. For clear-sky conditions, the vertical sensitivity of the TROPOMI CO data product is useful throughout the atmosphere, but for cloudy scenes it varies due to cloud shielding and light scattering. To assess the profile information, we deploy an a posteriori profile retrieval that combines an ensemble of TROPOMI CO column retrievals with different vertical sensitivities to obtain a vertical CO profile that is then a representative average for the chosen spatial and temporal domain. We demonstrate the approach on three CO pollution cases. For the so-called "Rabbit Foot Fire" in Idaho on 12 August 2018, we estimate a CO profile showing the pollution at an altitude of about 5 km in good agreement with airborne in situ measurements of the Biomass Burning Flux Measurements of Trace Gases and Aerosol (BB-FLUX) field campaign. The distinct CO enhancement in a plume aloft (length =212 km, width =34 km), decoupled from the ground, is sensed by TROPOMI but is not present in the CAMS-IFS model. For a large-scale event, we analyzed the CO pollution from Siberian wildfires that took place from 14 to 17 August 2018. The TROPOMI data estimate the height of the pollution plume over Canada at 7 km in agreement with CAMS-IFS. However, CAMS-IFS underestimates the enhanced CO vertical column densities sensed by TROPOMI within the plume by more than 100 ppb. Finally, we study the seasonal biomass burning in the Amazon. During the burning season the CO profile retrieved from the TROPOMI measurements (1-15 August 2019) agrees well with the one of CAMS-IFS with a similar vertical shape between ground and 14 km altitude. Hence, our results indicate that assimilating TROPOMI CO retrieval with different vertical sensitivities (e.g., under clear-sky and cloudy conditions) provides information about the vertical distribution of CO.

TI  - Relationships between summertime surface albedo and melt pond fraction in the central Arctic Ocean: The aggregate scale of albedo obtained on the MOSAiC floe
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC), the HELiX uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) was deployed over the sea ice in the central Arctic Ocean during summer 2020. Albedo measurements were obtained with stabilized pyranometers, and melt pond fraction was calculated from orthomosaic imagery from a surface-imaging multispectral camera. This study analyzed HELiX flight data to provide insights on the temporal and spatial evolution of albedo and melt pond fraction of the MOSAiC floe during the melt season as it drifted south through Fram Strait. The surface albedo distributions showed peak values changing from high albedo (0.55-0.6) to lower values (0.3) as the season advanced. Inspired by methods developed for satellite data, an algorithm was established to retrieve melt pond fraction from the orthomosaic images. We demonstrate that the near-surface observations of melt pond fraction were highly dependent on sample area, offering insight into the influence of subgrid scale features and spatial heterogeneity in satellite observations. Vertical observations conducted with the HELiX were used to quantify the influence of melt pond scales on observed surface albedo as a function of sensor footprint. These scaling results were used to link surface-based measurements collected during MOSAiC to broader-scale satellite data to investigate the influence of surface features on observed albedo. Albedo values blend underlying features within the sensor footprint, as determined by the melt pond size and concentration. This study framed the downscaling (upscaling) problem related to the airborne (surface) observations of surface albedo across a variety of spatial scales.

AB  - Background: There are unique opportunities related to the design and conduct of pragmatic trials embedded in health insurance plans, which have longitudinal data on member/patient demographics, dates of coverage, and reimbursed medical care, including prescription drug dispensings, vaccine administrations, behavioral healthcare encounters, and some laboratory results. Such trials can be large and efficient, using these data to identify trial-eligible patients and to ascertain outcomes. Methods: We use our experience primarily with the National Institutes of Health Pragmatic Trials Collaboratory Distributed Research Network, which comprises health plans that participate in the US Food & Drug Administration's Sentinel System, to describe lessons learned from the conduct and planning of embedded pragmatic trials. Results: Information is available for research on more than 75 million people with commercial or Medicare Advantage health plans. We describe three studies that have used or plan to use the Network, as well as a single health plan study, from which we glean our lessons learned. Conclusions: Studies that are conducted in health plans provide much-needed evidence to drive clinically meaningful changes in care. However, there are many unique aspects of these trials that must be considered in the planning, implementation, and analytic phases. The type of trial best suited for studies embedded in health plans will be those that require large sample sizes, simple interventions that could be disseminated through health plans, and where data available to the health plan can be leveraged. These trials hold potential for substantial long-term impact on our ability to generate evidence to improve care and population health.

TI  - Targeted axillary dissection using Radioguided Occult Lesion Localization technique in the clinically negative marked lymph node after neoadjuvant treatment in breast cancer patients
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To be aware of the feasibility of targeted axillary dissection (TAD) injecting 99mTechnetiumlabeled macroaggregated albumin (99mTc-MAA) preoperatively into the clipped lymph node of patients with axillary complete clinical response (ycN0), after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for breast cancer.Patients and methods: A retrospective observational study was performed on N1 patients with a clipped positive node and a clinically negative axilla (ycN0) after NAC in one center. The pretreatment positive lymph node was injected with 99mTc-MAA the day before surgery and identified intraoperatively with a radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) technique. Patients were subjected to a TAD with the intent of identifying the clipped node and other/s sentinel nodes through a standard sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).Results: 54 patients and 55 axillary clipped nodes were included. The clip was intraoperatively encountered in every patient, accomplishing a 100% detection rate, although in one case no lymphatic tissue could be found in the intraoperative frozen section. An axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was avoided in 62.9% of the cases (34/54).Conclusion: The use of the ROLL technique is a highly valuable tool since it allows a 100% success rate in retrieving the marker (and a 98.1% rate in detecting the clipped lymph node) in ycN0 breast cancer patients.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd, BASO - The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - Assessing surface water pollution in Hanoi, Vietnam, using remote sensing and machine learning algorithms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Rapid urbanization led to significant land-use changes and posed threats to surface water bodies worldwide, especially in the Global South. Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam, has been facing chronic surface water pollution for more than a decade. Developing a methodology to better track and analyze pollutants using available technologies to manage the problem has been imperative. Advancement of machine learning and earth observation systems offers opportunities for tracking water quality indicators, especially the increasing pollutants in the surface water bodies. This study introduces machine learning with the cubist model (ML-CB), which combines optical and RADAR data, and a machine learning algorithm to estimate surface water pollutants including total suspended sediments (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and biological oxygen demand (BOD). The model was trained using optical (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-1A) and RADAR satellite images. Results were compared with field survey data using regression models. Results show that the predictive estimates of pollutants based on ML-CB provide significant results. The study offers an alternative water quality monitoring method for managers and urban planners, which could be instrumental in protecting and sustaining the use of surface water resources in Hanoi and other cities of the Global South.

TI  - Evaluating the effects of columnar NO<sub>2</sub> on the accuracy of aerosoloptical properties retrievals
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We aim to evaluate the NO2 absorption effect in aerosol columnar properties, namely the aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (AE), and single scattering albedo (SSA), derived from sun-sky radiometers in addition to the possible retrieval algorithm improvements by usingmore accurate characterization of NO2 optical depth from co-located or satellite-based real-time measurements. For this purpose, we employ multiannual (2017-2022) records of AOD, AE, and SSA collected by sun photometers at an urban and a suburban site in the Rome area (Italy) in the framework of both the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and SKYNET networks. The uncertainties introduced in the aerosol retrievals by the NO2 absorption are investigated using high-frequency observations of total NO2 derived from co-located Pandora spectroradiometer systems in addition to spaceborne NO2 products from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). For both AERONET and SKYNET, the standard network products were found to systematically overestimate AOD and AE. The average AOD bias found for Rome is relatively low for AERONET (similar to 0.002 at 440 nm and similar to 0.003 at 380 nm) compared to the retrieval uncertainties but quite a bit higher for SKYNET (similar to 0.007). On average, an AE bias of similar to 0.02 and similar to 0.05 was estimated for AERONET and SKYNET, respectively. In general, the correction seems to be low for areas with low columnar NO2 concentrations, but it is still useful for low AODs (< 0.3), where the majority of observations are found, especially under high NO2 pollution events. For the cases of relatively high NO2 levels (> 0.7 DU), the mean AOD bias was found within the range 0.009-0.012 for AERONET, depending on wavelength and location, and about 0.018 for SKYNET. The analysis does not reveal any significant impact of the NO2 correction on the derived aerosol temporal trends for the very limited data sets used in this study. However, the effect is expected to become more evident for trends derived from larger data sets and in the case of an important NO2 trend. In addition, the comparisons of the NO2-modified ground-based AOD data with satellite retrievals from the Deep Blue (DB) algorithm of the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) resulted in a slight improvement in the agreement of about 0.003 and 0.006 for AERONET and SKYNET, respectively. Finally, the uncertainty in assumptions on NO2 seems to have a non-negligible impact on the retrieved values of SSA at 440 nm leading to an average positive bias of about 0.02 (2 %) in both locations for high NO2 loadings (> 0.7 DU).

TI  - Remotely sensed habitat quality index reliably predicts an umbrella species presence but not demographic performance: A case study with open pine forests and red-cockaded woodpeckers
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data can be a powerful and cost-effective method for determining the extent, composition, and structure of ecosystems across large areas. To use this tool for effective conservation of individual species, we need to test the assumption that remotely sensed habitat indices correspond to both patch suitability (i.e., presence) and value (i.e., demographic rates) for the species reliant on those habitats. We built an open pine habitat quality index (HQI) from remotely sensed spectral data to identify the condition of pine stands. We correlated the HQI with presence, group size, and fledgling production of an avian species (red-cockaded woodpecker, Dryobates (=Picoides) borealis, RCW) associated with longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) using Bayesian logistic regressions and structural equation models. The HQI was correlated with RCW cavity tree and foraging area presence, with 10.8 and 16.0 increased odds of RCW presence with each unit increase in the HQI, respectively. However, the HQI was not correlated with RCW demographic performance. Given that RCWs are an umbrella species and are currently limited by habitat, that the HQI successfully identifies areas of higher quality habitat for RCW is useful for conservation planning. Improving the specificity of the remotely sensed index could improve the link between the HQI and RCW demographic performance, but might limit its application to RCW, instead of the entire open pine endemic community. Our study suggests that linking generalized habitat indices to species habitat suitability is possible and strengthens the justification for their use in cost-effective, large-scale conservation of imperiled ecosystems.

TI  - Towards monitoring stem growth phenology from space with high resolution satellite data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Radial stem growth is a key ecosystem process resulting in long-term carbon sequestration. Despite recognition of its importance to global carbon cycling, high uncertainties remain regarding how radial growth phenology (e.g., the onset, mid, and cessation of radial growth) will be affected by climate change. In this study, we evaluated to what extent high spatially (3 x 3 m) and temporally (up to daily) resolved satellite imagery from PlanetScope can be used to monitor stem growth phenology. For this, we made use of detailed stem growth phenological ob-servations of six common European tree species measured by automated point dendrometers at 14 distinct sites across Switzerland between 2017 and 2021. These growth phenological observations were then linked through multiple regression modeling with metrics extracted from spectral index time series. Our results show that the remote sensing-based models enable monitoring the onset (root mean squared deviation (RMSD) ranges from 5.96 to 27.04 days) and mid-stages of stem growth (RMSD ranges from 10.20 to 36.34 days) with reasonable accuracy as opposed to the cessation of stem growth that showed low accuracy (RMSD ranges from 16.02 to 153.63 days). The accuracy of the remote sensing-based prediction models and their optimal suite of predictors varied across species. The latter has important implications for the remote sensing of stem growth phenology in mixed forests, suggesting that it is important for satellite sensors to resolve individual tree crowns. Overall, our results suggest the need for novel spectral indices that capture the spectral components of mechanistic linkages between stem growth and canopy properties that go beyond the mere detection of leaf phenology. When employing such spectral indices, remote sensing could make it possible to detect not only shifts in leaf phenology caused by climate change but also those in stem growth on a broad spatial scale.

TI  - The application of contrast-enhanced ultrasound for sentinel lymph node evaluation and mapping in breast cancer patients
T2  - QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: To retrospectively investigate the application of contrast-enhanced ultrasound on sentinel lymph node (SLN-CEUS) for SLN evaluation and mapping in breast cancer patients.Methods: Patients diagnosed with breast cancer at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from June 2019 to March 2021 were conveniently evaluated by SLN-CEUS. The results of SLN-CEUS and B mode-ultrasound (BUS) were collected and compared. For patients who only underwent SLN-CEUS, we conducted a 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM). The diagnostic parameters, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), false negative rate (FNR), false positive rate (FPR), and proportion of undetermined diagnoses were compared between the SLN-CEUS and BUS cohorts. The identification rate and FNR of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) were also assessed.Results: There were 327 patients in each of the SLN-CEUS and BUS cohorts. Among the entire cohort, both NPV [90.2% (95% CI, 85.4-93.5%) vs. 83.5% (95% CI, 77.8-88.0%), P=0.048] and accuracy [80.7% (95% CI, 76.5-85.0%) vs. 73.7% (95% CI, 68.9-78.5%), P<0.001] of SLN-CEUS were significantly higher than those of BUS. In non-neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) patients, the NPV [94.7% (95% CI, 89.9-97.4%) vs. 85.5% (95% CI, 79.1-90.2%), P=0.007] and accuracy [87.6% (95% CI, 83.2-92.0%) vs. 76.0% (95% CI, 70.4-81.5%), P<0.001] of SLN-CEUS were significantly higher than those of BUS. In NAT patients, no difference in diagnostic efficacy was found. The proportion of undetermined diagnoses of SLN-CEUS was significantly lower than that of BUS (5.8% vs. 15.3%, P<0.001). The identification rate of SLN-CEUS in overall patients, non-NAT patients, and NAT patients was 94.2%, 96.3%, and 89.9%, respectively. The FNR of SLNB with the blue-dye tracer in combination with SLN-CEUS in overall patients, non-NAT patients, and NAT patients was 7.3%, 4.0%, and 12.5%, respectively.Conclusions: Compared to BUS, SLN-CEUS is a better technique for diagnosing SLNs in early breast cancer patients, showing superiority in multiple diagnostic parameters. However, the diagnostic value of SLN-CEUS in NAT patients is still undetermined. SLN-CEUS is a promising mapping method in SLNB, with a high identification rate and a low FNR when used in combination with a blue-dye tracer.

TI  - Optimal feature selection and crop extraction using random forest based on GF-6 WFV data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - For precision agriculture, agricultural development planning, and regional food security, accurate crop mapping is essential. The GF-6 satellite offers novel approaches for crop identification. As Jinzhou, Hebei province, China, comprises a mix of grain and fruit trees, this research has selected the area for a case study. First, spectral, index, and texture features are combined in various classification feature schemes. Second, the random forest algorithm is employed to ascertain the significance of these features. Optimal features are then chosen to accurately identify winter wheat, summer maize, and pear orchards. Concurrently, land cover for wheat and maize seasons is mapped. The results demonstrate that: (1) multisource features considerably enhanced the accuracy of crop classification based on GF-6 WFV data. Among these, index features have the greatest contribution, followed by spectral features, while the contribution of texture features, is almost negligible. (2) The classification effect utilizing random forest feature optimization is superior, with an overall accuracy of 94% and a kappa coefficient of 0.91. The extracted land area for each scheme exhibits an accuracy of over 70% when compared to the statistical area. (3) The critical time phases for extracting winter wheat, summer maize, and pear orchards are identified as, in sequence, the leaf-out and jointing stage, the tasselling stage, the leaf-fall stage, fruit development, and the first flowering/full flowering stages. Based on GF-6 WFV data, these research findings will offer a technical reference for the identification of grain crops and the extraction of pear orchards.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation analysis of global XCO<sub>2</sub> concentration during 2010-2020 based on DINEOF-BME framework and wavelet function
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining with Carbon dioxide column concentration (XCO2) remote sensing data, it is of great scientific significance to obtain XCO2 long time series data with high precision and high spatio-temporal coverage. In this study, the combination framework of DINEOF and BME were employed to integrate the XCO2 data of GOSAT, OCO-2 and OCO-3 satellites for generating global XCO2 data from January 2010 to December 2020, with the average monthly space coverage rate of more than 96 %. Through cross-validation and comparison of The Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) XCO2 data and DINEOF-BME interpolation XCO2 products, it is verified that DINEOF-BME method has better interpolation accuracy, and the coefficient of determination of interpolated XCO2 products and TCCON data is 0.920. The long time series of global XCO2 products showed a wave rising trend, with a total increase of similar to 23 ppm; obviously seasonal characteristics were also detected with the highest XCO2 value in spring and the lowest in autumn. According to the zonal integration analysis, the values of XCO2 in the northern hemisphere is higher than the southern hemisphere during January-May and October-December, while the values of XCO2 in the southern hemisphere is higher than the northern hemisphere during June-September, which accords with the seasonal law. Through EOF mapping, the first mode accounted for 88.93 % of the total variability, and its variation trend is consistent with that of XCO2 concentration, which verifies the variation rule of XCO2 from the time and space pattern. Through wavelet analysis, the time scale corresponding to the first main cycle of XCO2 change is 59-month, which has obvious regularity on the time scale. DINEOF-BME technology framework has good generality, while XCO2 long time series data products and the spatio-temporal variation of XCO2 revealed by the research provide a solid theoretical basis and data support for related research.

TI  - Monitoring the Mauna Loa (Hawaii) eruption of November-December 2022 from space: Results from GOES-R, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8/9 observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mauna Loa, one of the most actives volcanoes on Earth, is a shield volcano, located on the Island of Hawaii (USA). On 27 November 2022, after about 38 years of quiescence, a new eruptive activity took place at the Moku'a over bar weoweo caldera, continuing in the following days (i.e. until 10 December) from the fissure vents opening on the Northeast Rift Zone. In this work, we investigate the Mauna Loa November - December 2022 eruption from space, integrating the information from different satellite sensors. The analysis of short-wave infrared (SWIR) data, at 10 min temporal resolution, from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), aboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites - R series (GOES-R), performed through the Normalised Hotspot Indices (NHI), indicates that the Mauna Loa eruption started on 27 November in between 23:10-23:20 LT (28 November at 09:10-09:20 UTC). The same analysis shows the increase of thermal activity and its progressive reduction from the early morning of 28 November, in agreement with the eruption migration from the summit caldera to the Northeast Rift Zone. By analysing the second phase of eruption through SWIR data from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and Operational Land Imager (OLI), respectively aboard Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 satellites, we estimated a maximum lava flow length of 17 km. Moreover, we retrieved values of the volcanic radiative power (VRP) up to 65 GW, and a time-averaged discharge rate (TADR) of similar to 1000 (+/- 500) m(3)/s. These results show that SWIR observations, at different spatial and temporal resolution, may give an important contribution to the monitoring, mapping and characterisation of intense lava effusions.

TI  - Area-based scenario development in land-use change modeling: A system dynamics-assisted approach for mixed agricultural-residential landscapes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to enhance land use and land cover (LULC) change models by addressing their main limitations, which include the lack of accountability and temporal stability of driving forces. Additionally, the study aimed to create area-based scenarios to forecast future LULCs, rather than solely relying on distribution-based scenarios. To accomplish this goal, the study developed a coupled System Dynamics (SD) and Cellular Automata (CA) modeling system to simulate possible LULC changes in the Gavkhooni Basin, central Iran. The study utilized LULC maps from Landsat images in 2001, 2011, and 2021 to analyze spatio-temporal land use changes in the region. Agricultural and residential transition suitability layers were produced using a spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation procedure and applied to inform the CA model in the proper allocation of LULC changes. Three interconnected water supply, agricultural, and residential area projection subsystems were developed using system dynamics method to determine land requirements for LULC conversions from 2020 to 2041, taking into account factors such as water availability, land suitability, agricultural labor force, and economic development. Ten scenarios were developed based on changes in the key variables affecting the limiting factors, such as climatic conditions and water management policies, to project agricultural and residential areas in the future. The CA's spatial allocation informed by transition suitability layers was found to be satisfactory with a Kappalocation value of 0.85. The subsystems were competent in projecting water supply with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values of 6.57% and the dynamics of agricultural and residential areas with MAE values of 2.94%, whereas those of the Markovian Chain model were found to be 23.02% and 7.5% for agricultural and residential areas, respectively. The study found that available agricultural areas varied significantly between 86.53 and 1480 sq.km under different climatic conditions, irrigation efficiency, and agricultural water assignment coefficients between 2024 and 2033. Residential area demand was found to be increasing with different rates under the scenarios between 47.40 and 73.01 sq.km. The SD-CA coupled framework presented in this research can be viewed as a decision support system to develop compensatory strategies for better management and planning of agricultural and residential lands.

TI  - Malignant peritoneal cytologic contamination with robotic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Malignant peritoneal cytology in endometrial cancer (EC) is not considered an independent ad-verse prognostic factor for uterine-confined disease and is not a determinant factor in the International Federa-tion of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system. NCCN Guidelines still recommend obtaining cytologies. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of peritoneal cytologic contamination following robotic hysterectomy for EC. Methods. Peritoneal cytology from the pelvis and diaphragm were obtained at the initiation of surgery, and from the pelvis only at the completion of robotic hysterectomy with sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM). Cy-tology specimens were evaluated for the presence of malignant cells. Pre-and post-hysterectomy cytology re-sults were compared, and pelvic contamination was defined as conversion from negative to positive cytology following surgery. Results. 244 patients underwent robotic hysterectomy with SLNM for EC. Pelvic contamination was identified in 32 (13.1%) cases. In multivariate analysis, pelvic contamination was associated with >50% myometrial inva-sion, tumor size >2 cm, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and lymph node metastasis. There was no asso-ciation with FIGO stage or histology subtypes. Conclusions. Malignant peritoneal contamination occurred during robotic surgery for EC. Large lesions (>2 cm), deep invasion (>50%), LVSI, and lymph node metastasis were each independently associated with peri-toneal contamination. Whether or not peritoneal contamination increases risk for disease recurrence should be studied in larger series, including an evaluation of patterns of recurrence and the potential impact of adjuvant therapies. Until the clinical impact of peritoneal contamination during hysterectomy for EC is better understood, methods to reduce peritoneal contamination are warranted. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Effectiveness of fluorides in root caries prevention, Department of Veterans Affairs (2009-2018)
T2  - SPECIAL CARE IN DENTISTRY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - AimsThe aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of topical fluorides in prevention of root caries-related treatment in high caries risk Veterans. MethodsThis retrospective analysis of longitudinal data examined the effectiveness of professionally applied or prescription (Rx) fluoride treatment, in VHA clinics from FY 2009-2018. Professional fluoride treatments included 5% Sodium Fluoride (NaF) varnish (22 600 ppm fluoride), 2% NaF gel/rinse (9050 ppm fluoride), and 1.23% APF gel (12 300 ppm fluoride). The Rx for daily home use was 1.1% NaF paste/gel (5000 ppm fluoride). Outcomes studied were new root caries restorations or extractions and percent of patients with treatment over 1 year. Logistic regressions were adjusted for age, gender, race, ethnicity, chronic medical or psychiatric conditions, number of medication classes, anticholinergic drugs, smoking, baseline root caries treatment, preventive care, and time between first-last restoration in the index year. ResultsRoot caries at baseline was associated with a high risk for new root caries. Veterans without root caries during the index year who received a fluoride gel/rinse intervention were 32-40% less likely to receive caries-related treatment for root caries during the follow-up period. Once Veterans had root caries, fluorides did not exhibit a positive effect. ConclusionIn older adults with high caries risk, early fluoride prevention is key, before root caries requires treatment.

TI  - Integration of remote sensing and geochemical data to characterize mineralized A-type granites, Egypt: implications for origin and concentration of rare metals
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Neoproterozoic mineralized granites from the Umm Naggat and Homrit Waggat areas in the Central Eastern Desert (CED) of Egypt, are parts of the Neoproterozoic Nubian Shield. On the basis of textural and chemical characteristics, they resemble highly fractionated ferroan peraluminous A-type granites. Decorrelation stretch (DS) and band ratio (BR) techniques of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-9 data were used for the spectral identification of lithological units, alteration and mineralized zones in A-type granites. Spatial and spectral extent of the hydrothermal mineralized alteration zones (e.g., sericitization, carbonatization, kaolinitization, ferrous silicates and hydroxyl) related to the rare metal-bearing granitic plutons can be discriminated by processed ASTER data. Some structural features have been identified by Sentinel-1enhanced Soble directional filter images. The NW-SE Najd fault system is conjugated with N-S and NE-SW faults, which structurally control the distribution of both mineralized alteration zones and rare metal-bearing granites in the CED of Egypt. The studied mineralized granites comprise syenogranite and alkali feldspar granite. Essential minerals are quartz, K-feldspar (Or(94-99)), plagioclase (An(0-7)) and biotite, with subordinate amounts of chlorite, muscovite and fluorite. Zircon, Fe-Ti oxides, rutile, apatite, epidote, titanite, columbite and thorite are main accessory phases. Average zircon saturation temperature (T-Zr) of the studied granites ranges from 780 degrees C to 880 degrees C at pressures of 0.7-3.0 kbars and depth < 8 km. These granites are highly evolved (SiO2 = 73-78 wt. %), and show characteristics of high-K calc-alkaline peraluminous rocks (A/CNK = 1-1.13). They are enriched in Rb, Nb, Y, Ta, Hf, Ga, Zr and rare-earth elements (sigma REEs: up to 558 ppm) and show pronounced negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.01-0.29), similar to post-collisional rare metal-bearing A-type granites either in Egypt or elsewhere in the world. These A-type granites more likely crystallized from highly fractionated I-type tonalite-granodiorite magmas, followed by extensive fractional crystallization in the upper crust during and just after lithospheric delamination. Rare-metal minerals such as zircon, rutile, xenotime, thorite, cerite-(Ce), apatite, parisite, uranothorite, columbite, ishikawaite and bastnaesite crystallized under both magmatic and hydrothermal conditions. Remote sensing and geochemical data enabled us to characterize mineralized zones in A-type granites and indicated that albitization is accompanied by higher concentrations of REEs (544 ppm), Zr (up to 378 ppm), Y (142 ppm), Nb (127 ppm) and Th (26 ppm) than other alteration types, suggesting stabilization of these elements by Na-, F- and Cl-rich fluids during Na-metasomatism.

TI  - Shoreline change dynamics along the Augusta coast, eastern Sicily, South Italy
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal region of Augusta, eastern Sicily, Italy, is a densely populated zone, where human pressures profoundly shaped the coastal and land dynamics. So far, understanding the interaction between natural and human processes in modelling coastal geomorphology is still quite challenging. However, coastal and environmental monitoring poses the bases for managing coastal areas properly. Therefore, the aim of this research was first to understand the medium-term shoreline changes along Augusta Bay between 1972 and 2021, and then assess the main local coastal modifications determined by the increasing coastal armouring. To do so, the shorelines dataset was extracted from Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite imageries using the NDWI and mNDWI methods and then statistical parameters were computed using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). Results show that this coastal fringe experienced significant shoreline recession over the studied time interval. Negative shoreline shifts are higher in correspondence with torrent deltas, as a result of the increasing human and natural forces insisting on the land and coastal environments. Since 1970s, Augusta Bay registered a significant increase in artificial coastal length and a coastal armouring index of Maximal level was reached today.

TI  - Automatic building height estimation with shadow correction over heterogeneous compact cities using stereo Gaofen-7 data at sub-meter resolution
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-grained building heights are indispensable in various aspects of urban energy consumption, environment, and climate. The highly accurate and refined building height product is expected to be produced by high-resolution remote sensing images in this paper. To obtain this product painlessly, we aim to design a framework that automatically extracts building heights within cities. Specifically, high-resolution remote sensing images are shadow corrected, on which the algorithm is applied to generate the digital surface model. Then the model is masked using OSM's building data. Finally, the height of each building is obtained by zonal statistics. The abovementioned data in Hong Kong are collected. The experimental results show that the highest accuracy is achieved in the medium building density area, outperforming the low and high-density areas by 1.42 and 4.06 m in RMSE. At the same time, the extracted building heights with shadow correction are closer to the reference heights. It can be concluded that extracting building heights using high-resolution remote sensing satellite imagery is feasible; the accuracy varies for buildings of different heights and densities; and correcting the shadows can significantly improve the accuracy of building height extraction. The innovations are the automatic process and the shadow correction. It allows for dynamic building height monitoring when long time series of remote sensing images are available and proves that shadow may harm height estimation performance. Our research sheds light on the design of building height estimation algorithms and provides height validation data in developed cities and height estimation solutions for developing cities.

TI  - Assessing the feasibility of applying remote sensing technique in calculating water consumption
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques are currently used in different fields including irrigation and water management fields. One of the important fields is the calculation of water consumption (WC). Remote sensing techniques can be used to estimate actual evapotranspiration and it can also be used to estimate crop coefficients based on spectral reflectance of vegetation indices (VIs), and from a relation with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is an indicator for the absorption and the reflection ratios by the green plant. The current study used remote sensing data to calculate WC for El-Bostan irrigation district. Crop coefficient values were calculated from NDVI and reference evapotranspiration values were calculated using CROPWAT program. The obtained results were verified by comparing them with field measurements. There was a strong linear correlation between the measured and calculated values with r(2) of 0.90, while the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0.68. The results were also verified by comparing irrigation efficiencies obtained from remote sensing and from field measurements. The results were very close to each other. The study illustrated the importance and the reliability of using remote sensing techniques in calculating WC values, and which could improve water management and water use efficiency.

TI  - Mass Balances of the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets Monitored from Space
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data have revealed that the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets are changing rapidly due to warming air and ocean temperatures. Crucially, Earth Observations can now be used to measure ice sheet mass balance at the continental scale, which can help reduce uncertainties in the ice sheets' past, present, and future contributions to global mean sea level. The launch of satellite missions dedicated to the polar regions led to great progress towards a better assessment of the state of the ice sheets, which, in combination with ice sheet models, have furthered our understanding of the physical processes leading to changes in the ice sheets' properties. There is now a three-decade-long satellite record of Antarctica and Greenland mass changes, and new satellite missions are planned to both continue this record and further develop our observational capabilities, which is critical as the ice sheets remain the most uncertain component of future sea-level rise. In this paper, we review the mechanisms leading to ice sheets' mass changes and describe the state of the art of the satellite techniques used to monitor Greenland's and Antarctica's mass balance, providing an overview of the contributions of Earth Observations to our knowledge of these vast and remote regions.

TI  - Machine learning models to predict daily actual evapotranspiration of citrus orchards under regulated deficit irrigation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise estimations of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) are essential for various environmental issues, including those related to agricultural ecosystem sustainability and water management. Indeed, the increasing demands of agricultural production, coupled with increasingly frequent drought events in many parts of the world, necessitate a more careful evaluation of crop water requirements.Artificial Intelligence-based models represent a promising alternative to the most common measurement techniques, e.g. using expensive Eddy Covariance (EC) towers. In this context, the main challenges are choosing the best possible model and selecting the most representative features. The objective of this research is to evaluate two different machine learning algorithms, namely Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF), to predict daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in a citrus orchard typical of the Mediterranean ecosystem using different feature combinations. With many features available coming from various infield sensors, a thorough analysis was performed to measure feature importance, scatter matrix observations, and Pearson's correlation coefficient calculation, which resulted in the selection of 12 promising feature combinations. The models were calibrated under regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) conditions to estimate ETa and save irrigation water. On average up to 38.5% water savings were obtained, compared to full irrigation. Moreover, among the different input variables adopted, the soil water content (SWC) feature appears to have a prominent role in the prediction of ETa. Indeed, the presented results show that by choosing the appropriate input features, the accuracy of the proposed machine learning models remains acceptable even when the number of features is reduced to only 4. The best performance was achieved by the Random Forest method, with seven input features, obtaining a root mean square error (RMSE) and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.39 mm/day and 0.84, respectively. Finally, the results show that the joint use of SWC, weather and satellite data significantly improves the performance of evapotranspiration forecasts compared to models using only meteorological variables.

TI  - Abdul Hadi's translations of Ahmad Raza: An internal logics approach
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article employs an internal logics approach, developed in a recent work by Sher Ali Tareen, to the study of the Barelwi school in South Africa. This approach ties metaphysics to practice. Specifically, the article addresses some works of the school's founder, Ahmad Raza Khan, as translated by South African Islamic scholar Abdul Hadi Qadiri, in the light of this approach. It then extrapolates the insights of this approach to a recent article by Sepetla Molapo, which highlights the importance of appreciating the metaphysical role of ancestors in any academic approach to understanding traditional African worldviews and African self-concept. Taken together, the article suggests that the internal logics approach is helpful in bringing to the surface the crucial, but often obscured, metaphysical presuppositions concerning the nature of time-presuppositions that inform not only the worldview of the object being studied, but, equally, the often different ones that shape the perspective of the researcher.Contribution: This article wishes to underscore the importance of metaphysical considerations in the study of religion, advocating an approach that highlights such considerations and examining some of its broader academic implications. While it specifically focuses on a theological contestation in Islam, it extends the implications of this contestation to the academic study of traditional African worldviews and to world religions more generally.

TI  - Orthobiologics: Current Status in 2023 and Future Outlook
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGEONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Orthobiologic agents, including platelet-rich plasma, connective tissue progenitor cells derived from bone marrow, adipose, and other tissues, and purified cytokines and small peptides, have tremendous potential to target deficiencies in soft-tissue healing. The principal limitation currently is the variability in the composition and biologic activity of orthobiologic formulations, making it difficult to choose the optimal treatment for a specific tissue or pathology. Current data suggest that orthobiologics are "symptom-modifying," but there is little evidence that they can lead to true tissue regeneration ("structure-modifying"). A critically important need at this time is to identify sentinel markers of potency and biologic activity for different orthobiologic formulations so that we can match the treatment to the desired biologic effect for a specific tissue or pathology. Improved understanding of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of tissue degeneration and repair will allow a precision medicine approach where we can choose the optimal orthobiologic treatment of specific orthopaedic problems. It is important for the clinician to be aware of the evolving regulatory status of orthobiologic treatments. Emerging therapies such as the use of exosomes and gene therapy approaches hold great promise as improved methods to both treat symptoms and affect tissue regeneration.

TI  - Assessing land elevation in the Ayeyarwady Delta (Myanmar) and its relevance for studying sea level rise and delta flooding
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - With their low lying, flat topography, river deltas and coastal plains are extremely prone to relative sea level rise and other water-related hazards. This calls for accurate elevation data for flood risk assessments, especially in the densely populated Southeast Asian deltas. However, in data-poor countries such as Myanmar, where high accuracy elevation data are not accessible, often only global satellite-based digital elevation models (DEMs), suffering from low vertical accuracy and remote sensing artefacts, can be used by the public and scientific community. As the lack of accurate elevation data hampers the assessment of flood risk, studying available information on land elevation and its reliability is essential, particularly in the context of sea level rise impact. Here, we assess the performance of 10 global DEMs in the Ayeyarwady Delta (Myanmar) against the new, local, so-called AD-DEM, which was generated based on topographical map elevation data. To enable comparison, all DEMs were converted to a common vertical datum tied to local sea level. While both CoastalDEM v2.1 (Kulp and Strauss, 2021) and FABDEM (Hawker et al., 2022) perform comparably well, showing the highest correspondence in comparison with AD-DEM and low-elevation spot heights, FABDEM outperforms CoastalDEM v2.1 by the absence of remote sensing artefacts. The AD-DEM provides a high-accuracy, open and freely available, and independent elevation dataset suitable for evaluating land elevation data in the Ayeyarwady Delta and studying topography and flood risk at large scale, while small-scale investigations may benefit from a FABDEM locally improved with data from the AD-DEM.Based on the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections of sea level rise, the consequences of DEM selection for assessing the impact of sea level rise in the Ayeyarwady Delta are shown. We highlight the need for addressing particularly low-lying populated areas within the most seaward districts with risk mitigation and adaptation strategies while also the more inland delta population should be made aware of facing a higher risk of flooding due to relative sea level rise in the next similar to 100 years.

TI  - A new hotspot of macro-litter in the Rutland Island, South Andaman, India: menace from IORC
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Supralittoral zones of 13 sandy beaches of remote Rutland Island were divided into three zones to identify the litter contamination, its source, pathway of plastic transport to determine the level of macro-litter contamination, and its impact on coastal biota. Owing to the floral and faunal diversity, apart of the study area is protected under Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park (MGMNP). The supralittoral zones of each sandy beach (between low-tide and high-tide line) were individually calculated from 2021 Landsat-8 satellite imagery before conducting the field survey. The total area of the surveyed beaches was 0.52 km(2) (5,20,020.79 m(2)), and 317,565 litters representing 27 distinct litter types were enumerated. Two beaches in Zone-II and six in Zone-III were clean; however, all five in Zone-I were very dirty. The highest litter density (1.03 items/m(2)) was observed in Photo Nallah 1 and Photo Nallah 2, whereas the lowest (0.09 items/m(2)) was observed in Jahaji Beach. According to the Clean Coast Index (CCI), Jahaji Beach (Zone-III) is the very cleanest beach (1.74) while other beaches of Zone-II and Zone-III are clean. The findings of the Plastic Abundance Index (PAI) indicate that Zone-II and Zone-III beaches have a low abundance of plastics (< 1), while two beaches of Zone-I, viz., Katla Dera and Dhani Nallah, exhibited a moderate abundance of plastics (< 4) while a high abundance of plastics (< 8) was observed in the rest of three beaches of the same zone. The primary contributor of litter on Rutland's beaches was plastic polymers (60-99%), which were presumed to originate from the Indian Ocean Rim Countries (IORC). A collective litter management initiative by the IORC is essential in preventing littering on remote islands.

TI  - Self-reported lower extremity lymphedema and quality of life after surgical staging of endometrial carcinoma: A population based cross-sectional study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLN) has replaced lymphadenectomy in staging of endometrial carcinoma. The aims of the study were to explore the prevalence of self-reported lymphedema (LEL), identify factors associated with LEL, compare quality of life (QoL) scores using thresholds of clinical importance, and assess correlation between different questionnaires.Methods. Women who underwent staging for endometrial carcinoma from 2006 to 2021 were invited to complete the Lower Extremity Lymphedema Screening Questionnaire (LELSQ), EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-EN24 and EQ-5D-5L.Results. Of 2156 invited survivors, 61% participated in the study, whereof 1127 were evaluable by LELSQ. The LEL prevalence was 51%, 36% and 40% after lymphadenectomy, SLN and hysterectomy, respectively (p < 0.001). Higher BMI, undergoing lymphadenectomy and receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were associated with LEL; odds ratios 1.07 (95% CI 1.05-1.09), 1.42 (95% CI 1.03-1.97) and 1.43 (95% CI 1.08-1.89) respectively. QoL was lower for women with LEL compared to those without. In women with musculoskeletal complaints the preva-lence of LEL was 59%, 50% and 53% after lymphadenectomy, SLN and hysterectomy (p = 0.115), respectively, compared to 39%, 17% and 18% (p < 0.001) in women without musculoskeletal complaints. Spearman's correla-tion was moderate to strong between the questionnaires.Conclusion. SLN implementation is not associated with increased LEL prevalence compared to hysterectomy alone, but is associated with a significantly lower prevalence compared to lymphadenectomy. LEL is associated with lower QoL. Our study demonstrates moderate to strong correlation between self-reported LEL and QoL scores. Available questionnaires may not distinguish between symptoms caused by LEL and musculoskeletal disease.

TI  - Spatiotemporal forest cover change and its implication for environmental sustainability in Dedo district of Jimma zone, southwest Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest is one of the key precious resources that support human well-being by providing ecosystem services. Unfortunately, the forest cover has decreased over time due to natural and anthropogenic factors. The present study aims to assess the spatiotemporal forest cover changes and its implication on environmental sustainability in Dedo district in southwestern parts of Ethiopia. We used three Landsat images from 1985, 2002 and 2019. The results show that forest cover areas declined from 64,872 ha in 1985 to 53,805 ha in the year 2019. The study area lost about 11,067 ha (7.7%) of forest over the past 34 years. In contrast, the farmland was increased from 38,801 ha (27.06%) in 1985 to 54,917 ha (38.3%) in 2019. The increasing trend of cultivated land is associated with the increment of human population. Forest cover has been declined in the study area for a variety of reasons, including fire wood collection, charcoal and timber extraction, semi-forest and khat investments, and settlements. Loss of forest cover can have significant implications for environmental sustainability, as forests have played an important role in ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, clean air, flood control, carbon sequestration, soil protection against soil erosion, and increased environmental resilience to the impacts of climate change. The existence of forest resources can contribute to sustainable development of local communities, as the majority of agricultural communities are directly or indirectly dependent on forest products. The findings of this study can be used to improve forest conservation and protection at different scales.

TI  - The 21 July 2020 Shaziba landslide in China: Results from multi-source satellite remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A catastrophic landslide occurred on 21 July 2020, 30 km from Enshi city, in Mazhe County of Hubei province, China. In this paper, we aimed to investigate the kinematic evolution and volumetric change related to this landslide using multi-source remote sensing measurements from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data. C-band Sentinel-1 and X-band TerraSAR-X SAR data are analyzed using several multi-temporal interferometry (MTI) time-series techniques including Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI), Small Baseline subset (SBAS), and Combined eigenvalue maximum likelihood Phase Linking (CPL). The spatial pattern of surface deformation resulting from the interferometric analysis is then statistically analyzed to retrieve the pre-failure and post-failure displacements. Co-failure motions are analyzed using an image correlation technique applied to both the Planetscope and Sentinel-2 images. Moreover, 4 pairs of bistatic TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (TDX) data are utilized to generate high-precision digital elevation models (DEMs) and estimate the volumetric change related to the main slope failure.The pre-failure ground deformation analysis results suggest that the landslide was already active before the July 2020 failure, with the seasonality and hydraulic diffusivity being characteristics of a slow-moving landslide. Among the three different MTI methods applied, the CPL method results in a greater measurement points (MPs) density than the PSI and SBAS method when estimating the pre-failure movement of the Shaziba landslide. The July 2020 Shaziba disaster is divided into three main parts: (1) slightly horizontal deformation of 0.5-1.5 m within the northern part with ground and house cracks, (2) less collapse in the eastern part with horizontal motions reaching 30 m and (3) a highly eroded western part where vegetation was wholly lost in the main event, resulting in an collapse volume of approximately 4.98 million m3, out of which approximately around 3.4 million m3 was deposited and approximately 1.58 million m3 was washed away into the Qing River. After the failure, the marginal scrap of the main failure body, above crown of landslide and eastern part showed instability with rates of 20-30 mm/yr, suggesting that the failure zone may continue to expand.

TI  - Meerkat optimization algorithm: A new meta-heuristic optimization algorithm for solving constrained engineering problems
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we proposed a meerkat optimization algorithm(MOA) by simulating the behavior pattern of meerkats in nature. MOA is mainly inspired by the survival strategies of meerkat populations, whose sentinel mechanism controls meerkats to switch between different behavior patterns. Some mathematical properties of meerkat optimization algorithm are proved, and the advantages of MOA are verified with classical optimization test functions. MOA is applied to solve real-world engineering problems with constraints, which proves the effectiveness and superiority of MOA in solving such problems.

TI  - Analysis of the Sedimentary Characteristics of a Modern Distributive Fluvial System: A Case Study of the Great Halten River in the Sugan Lake Basin, Qinghai, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding controls on river planform changes can help to build predictive models for distributive fluvial systems, and then guide the oil and gas exploration. To do this we have undertaken a detailed investigation of the modern Great Halten River distributive fluvial system from the Sugan Lake Basin, Qinghai, China. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography, satellite remote sensing data and elemental analysis were used to determine differences in the sedimentary characteristics of the distributive fluvial system. From the apex to the toe, the changes in the slope, river morphology, sedimentary characteristics and element content in different regions were determined and three facies belts: "proximal", "medial" and "distal" were identified. We found that the sedimentary structure and elemental content characteristics of each facies differ greatly. We compare the large-scale evolution of rivers from braided to meandering rivers, and the fine description of sedimentary characteristics in combination with each observation, we strengthen our overall understanding of the modern DFS from macro to micro scale. At the same time, we summarize the sedimentation model of the Great Halten River DFS, and our study provides a reference for establishing the sedimentary model in continental petroliferous basins.

TI  - Cross-city Landuse classification of remote sensing images via deep transfer learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a deep transfer model which consists of multiple sub-networks which are independently optimized by a supervised task-oriented loss and an unsupervised consistency loss. The former loss function utilizes annotations to accomplish the designed goal. The latter loss prompts the network to learn the target domain data distribution and encourages multiple sub-networks to share learned knowledge. We utilize the proposed model to work with a global local climate zone classification. For the dataset, the source domain includes 352,366 training samples from 42 cities, and the target domain has 48,307 samples from 10 other cities. According to our experiments, the proposed model improves 3.46% overall accuracy and 2.97% average accuracy when compared with other state-of-the-art domain adaptation methodologies. Besides, the classification maps also visualize the outstanding performance of the proposed deep transfer network.

TI  - Monitoring Strategy of Geological Hazards Using Integrated Three-dimensional InSAR and GNSS Technologies with Case Study
T2  - PERIODICA POLYTECHNICA-CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Geodetic/geodynamic benchmarks, equipped with both ascending and descending radar corner reflectors, and a method for integrated InSAR and GNSS/GPS network observation were developed and applied as the continuation of the former geodetic monitoring at the Dunaszekcso landslide, Hungary. The attempts to apply InSAR technologies using archive and Sentinel-1 data practically failed on the most intensive landside areas ("Var" and "Szent Janos" hills), where proper persistent or distributed scatterers were not found. Our concept solved this problem, where the Simple Look Complex (SLC) images are used to interpolate the movements between two GNSS network observations using the integrated benchmarks and the method of Kalman-filtering. Since the InSAR line-of-sight (LOS) changes are barely sensitive to the north movements, this information is essentially provided by GNSS measurement alone, moreover, the GNSS measurements are used to: a) identify the benchmarks, b) detect the unwrapping errors and missing cycles and c) provide the boundary values of Kalman-filtering. After the installation of benchmarks three GPS observations were carried out and 69 ascending and 61 descending Sentinel-1 A and B images were processed. The data processing properly indicated the general movement history, which fit the curves of former geodetic observations, as well.The dense data points of the East and Up (vertical) components made possible more detailed geomorphologic interpretations of the ongoing process between two GPS observations. During the investigated periods the deceleration of movements was experienced, however, the deceleration of the dormant state needs the continuation of the monitoring.

TI  - Narratives to revert overconsumption: human-nature interdependence and Circular Economy
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD ECONOMICS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Policy and practitioners' initiatives to stimulate sustainable consumption have so far failed to have notable impact on individuals' behaviors. The current commentary is a plea to social and sustainability scientists, particularly to economists dealing with sustainable agri-food systems, to dig deeper into the notion of narratives to trigger societal dynamics that stir consumers toward more sufficient lifestyles. As dominant cultural narratives have a critical role in shaping shared meanings and acceptable behaviors, in the future they could guide dramatic changes in individuals' conduct, triggering drastic modifications of current consumption patterns. Based on the power that concepts as the Circular Economy and the Anthropocene have had in the recent past, a future step to develop an ecological worldview across society, and nourish individual identities deeply committed with the preservation of natural ecosystems, is working on narratives based on the notion of human-nature interdependence.

TI  - Recognition of suitable small watersheds for check dam construction on the Loess Plateau
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Check dams are used for soil and water conservation worldwide, especially on the Chinese Loess Plateau, which has suffered from severe soil and water loss. To promote ecological conservation and high-quality development in the Yellow River basin, considerable effort should be devoted to building check dams in the small watersheds where the conditions permit on the Loess Plateau. Therefore, suitable small watersheds must be identified for constructing new check dams. In this study, the weighted overlay method (WOM) of the multi-criteria decision-making analysis method, the random forest (RF), and the support vector machine (SVM) of machine learning methods were first applied to simulate the suitability of small watersheds for check dam construction in the Ganguyi upstream area of the Yanhe River basin on the Loess Plateau. Accuracy assessment showed that the accuracy of the three models was almost perfect and RF had the highest accuracy of 0.95, followed by SVM (0.87), and WOM (0.83). Meanwhile, the impacts of topographic factors and soil erodibility were found to be generally higher than those of the other factors, and 56% of small watersheds had high and very high suitability for check dam construction, 67% of these small watersheds have already been built as check dams. Finally, a total of 108 small watersheds were found to be suitable in the study area when considering their environmental characteristics. The methodology developed in the study can be used as a preliminary planning step for check dam construction and as a foundation for detailed field investigations in the future, which help to realize the sustainable use of soil and water resources.

TI  - Hydrological regime of Sahelian small waterbodies from combined Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter data
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Sahelian semi-arid region, water resources, especially small waterbodies such as ponds, small lakes, and reservoirs in rural areas are of vital importance. However, because of their high number and the scarce in situ monitoring networks, these resources and their spatiotemporal variability are not well known at the regional scale. This study investigates the hydrological regime of 37 small waterbodies, located in Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso in central Sahel. We propose a method based on remote sensing data only, which consists of combining water height data from Sentinel3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter (SRAL) with water area data obtained with the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) to create a dense water height time series. Water height variations are then compared to the evaporation estimated by the Penman-Monteith method, using ERA5 reanalysis by the European Centre for Medium-RangeWeather Forecasts (ECMWF) to infer water regimes during the dry season. Three main regimes stand out, namely a net water loss, mainly resulting from anthropogenic withdrawals, a net water supply occurring after the end of the rainy season through river network or water table exchange, and a balanced behaviour, where water losses during the dry season closely correspond to evaporation rates. Spatial patterns have been identified; in central Burkina Faso, most of the reservoirs show a net dry season water loss, which is explained by frequent irrigation, while reservoirs in northern Burkina Faso, generally show little water loss, indicating that water withdrawal is not significant in this area. Lakes located in the Inner Niger Delta in Mali and connected to the Niger River network generally show an important water supply, particularly at the beginning of the dry season. Lakes in Niger tend to show a weak signal toward water inflow that could be explained by exchange processes with the groundwater. These results show that satellite data are effective at estimating hydrological regimes and the anthropogenic impact on water resources at the large scale, including resources found in small waterbodies.

TI  - A group of three miRNAs can act as candidate circulating biomarkers in liquid biopsies from melanoma patients
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundStaging of melanoma and follow up after melanoma diagnosis aims at predicting risk and detecting progression or recurrence at early stage, respectively in order to timely start and/or change treatment. Tumor thickness according to Breslow, status of the sentinel node and value of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are well-established prognostic markers for metastatic risk, but reliable biomarkers identifying early recurrence or candidates who may benefit best from medical treatment are still warranted. Liquid biopsy has emerged to be a suitable method for identifying biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutic response prediction, and patient follow-up. Liquid biopsy is a blood-based non-invasive procedure that allows analyzing circulating analytes, including extracellular vesicles. MethodsIn this study we have explored the use of 7 miRNAs, namely hsa-miR-149-3p, hsa-miR-150-5p, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-200c-3p, hsa-miR-134-5p, hsa-miR-144-3p and hsa-miR-221-3p in plasma exosomes to discriminate melanoma patients from controls without melanoma in a cohort of 92 individuals. Results and discussionOur results showed that three out seven miRNAs, namely hsa-miR-200c-3p, hsa-miR-144-3p and hsa-miR-221-3p were differentially expressed in plasma-derived exosomes from melanoma patients and controls. Furthermore, the expression of the three miRNAs may be a promising ancillary tool as a melanoma biomarker, even for discriminating between nevi and melanoma.

TI  - Fuzzy-based global water quality assessment and water quality cells identification using satellite data
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The water environmental impact assessment and management programs increasingly rely on accurate and quantitative estimates of water quality parameters through remote sensing, owing to the limitation of the timeconsuming field-based approaches. Numerous studies have utilised the remote-derived water-quality products and existing water quality index (WQI) models, but they are typically site-specific and yield significant errors for the accurate assessment and monitoring of coastal and inland water bodies. This study presents a generalized WQI model that incorporates a flexible number of parameters, simplifying them to produce comprehensive water quality index values with the fuzzy logic approach. To derive these index values, three major water quality parameters such as Chl, TSS and aCDOM(443) were estimated using new remote-sensing models, and the corresponding indices Trophic State Index (TSI), Total Suspended Solids Index (TSSI) and CDOM Index (CI) were produced by a generalized index model. Finally, WQI products were derived based on the Mamdani-based Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) and individual contribution of the water quality parameters to WQI was analysed to establish 'Water Quality Cells' (WQ cells), which are represented by the dominant WQ parameter. The new models were tested on MODIS-Aqua and Sentinel-3 OLCI data in different regional and global oceanic waters. Further, a time series analysis was performed in regional coastal oceanic waters (along the Indian coast) to study the seasonal variations of individual water quality parameters and WQI over the period from 2011 to 2020. The results demonstrated that the FIS is efficient in handling the parameters with varying units and their relative importance. The water quality cells were identified in the bloom-dominated (Arabian Sea), TSS-dominated (Point Calimere, India and Yangtze River estuary, China) and CDOM-dominated (South Carolina coast, USA) regions. The time series analysis revealed that the water quality of the Indian coast exhibits cyclic seasonal variations due to the annual occurrence of the south-west and north-east monsoons. These results are critical for monitoring and assessing the quality of surface waters in coastal and inland environments and enabling water resources managers to formulate and implement management plans for a variety of water bodies cost-effectively.

TI  - Evaluating the saturation effect of vegetation indices in forests using 3D radiative transfer simulations and satellite observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices (VIs) have been used extensively for qualitative and quantitative remote sensing monitoring of vegetation vigor and growth dynamics. However, the saturation phenomenon of VIs (i.e., insignificant change at moderate to high vegetation densities) poses a known limitation to their ability to characterize surface vegetation over the dense canopy. Although the mechanisms underlying saturation are relatively straightforward and several VIs have been proposed to mitigate the saturation effect, the assessment of the saturation effect of VIs remains insufficient. Notably, no unified metric has been proposed to quantify the VI saturation phenomenon, limiting VI selection in practical applications. In this study, we proposed two indicators to describe the saturation phenomenon and utilized a well-validated three-dimensional (3D) canopy radiative transfer (RT) model largescale remote sensing data and image simulation framework (LESS) to simulate the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) of six forests scenes and assessed the variations in VIs in relation to leaf area index (LAI) values over different backgrounds, sun-sensor geometries, and spatial distribution types. The saturation characteristics of 36 VIs were evaluated in combination with simulation results and satellite observations from multiple sensors. The ranking of VI saturation from simulated and satellite results revealed a good agreement. Our results indicated that the simple ratio vegetation index (SR) performed best with the highest saturation point and can well characterize the surface vegetation condition until LAI reaches 4. Besides, we found that the saturation effect of VIs was influenced by soil brightness, sun-sensor geometry, and canopy structure. SR, modified simple ratio (MSR) and normalized green red difference index (NGRDI) were the most susceptible to these disturbing factors, although they had higher resistance to saturation. Modified triangular vegetation index 1 (MTVI1), modified non-linear vegetation index (MNLI), triangular greenness index (TGI), and triangular vegetation index (TriVI) performed well overall, combining the ability to resist saturation and disturbance factors. Appropriate application of VIs can help better understand vegetation responses to climate change and accurately assess ecosystem status. Our results contribute to the understanding of the VI saturation effect and provide a combined model and satellite data experimental workflow in appropriate VI selection to accurately characterize vegetation.

TI  - High-resolution mapping of forest structure from integrated SAR and optical images using an enhanced U-net method
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest structure is an essential part of biodiversity and ecological analysis and provides crucial insights to address challenges in these areas. Modern sensor technologies unlock new possibilities for more advanced vegetation monitoring. This study examines the potential of single high resolution X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images for pixel-wise mapping of four forest structure attributes (height, average height, fractional cover, and density) at a striking 0.5 m resolution. The study site is situated in Western Norway, hosting trees from flatlands to elevated mountainous areas and in-between. The proposed model architecture, called PSE-UNet, is a modified UNet incorporating key components from state-of-the-art deep learning from the field of forest structure monitoring. A comparative analysis involving state-of-the-art models shows promising results with MAE% between 21.5 and 24.7, depending on the variable.

TI  - Fine classification of rice paddy using multitemporal compact polarimetric SAR C band data based on machine learning methods
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Rice is an important food crop for human beings. Accurately distinguishing different varieties and sowing methods of rice on a large scale can provide more accurate information for rice growth monitoring, yield estimation, and phenological monitoring, which has significance for the development of modern agriculture. Compact polarimetric (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides multichannel information and shows great potential for rice monitoring and mapping. Currently, the use of machine learning methods to build classification models is a controversial topic. In this paper, the advantages of CP SAR data, the powerful learning ability of machine learning, and the important factors of the rice growth cycle were taken into account to achieve high-precision and fine classification of rice paddies. First, CP SAR data were simulated by using the seven temporal RADARSAT-2 C-band data sets. Second, 20-two CP SAR parameters were extracted from each of the seven temporal CP SAR data sets. In addition, we fully considered the change degree of CP SAR parameters on a time scale (Delta CPDoY). Six machine learning methods were employed to carry out the fine classification of rice paddies. The results show that the classification methods of machine learning based on multitemporal CP SAR data can obtain better results in the fine classification of rice paddies by considering the parameters of Delta CPDoY. The overall accuracy is greater than 95.05%, and the Kappa coefficient is greater than 0.937. Among them, the random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) achieve the best results, with an overall accuracy reaching 97.32% and 97.37%, respectively, and Kappa coefficient values reaching 0.965 and 0.966, respectively. For the two types of rice paddies, the average accuracy of the transplant hybrid (T-H) rice paddy is greater than 90.64%, and the highest accuracy is 95.95%. The average accuracy of direct-sown japonica (D-J) rice paddy is greater than 92.57%, and the highest accuracy is 96.13%.

TI  - How exotic<i> Sonneratia</i> species affect the spatiotemporal dynamics of mangroves in Shenzhen Bay, China: A remote sensing perspective
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are essential forest communities in tropical and subtropical coastal zones, providing unique ecological functions and significant social and economic value. Accurate and efficient monitoring of mangroves is crucial for their protection and management. The impact of exotic species on native species is still debated, especially for mangroves, the spatiotemporal dynamics of introduced species and native mangrove species need to be closely monitored. This study aimed to investigate how exotic mangrove species affects the spatial dy-namics of mangroves in Shenzhen Bay, China. Yearly Landsat images from 2000 to 2011 and Chinese high spatial resolution images during 2012-2022 were obtained and the pixel-based and multiscale object-based methods were used to obtain mangrove distribution. The results showed that: (1) Overall, mangroves in the study area increased from 281.51 ha to 526.43 ha from 2000 to 2022, with different spatiotemporal patterns in Shenzhen (+5.14%) and Hong Kong (+2.38%); (2) rapid spread of Sonneratia species was one of the main contributions to the growth of mangrove hotspots, and growth hotspots were mainly concentrated in the estuary delta; and (3) Sonneratia mangrove species was dominant in interspecific competition, not only invading the habitat of local mangroves, but also preventing the expansion of native mangrove growth. The results provide a reference for fine-scale and accurate mangrove mapping with high spatial and temporal resolutions, and highlight the need to pay more attentions to the spread and invasive potential of exotic mangrove species in the study area, as well as cooperation in adjacent reserves.

TI  - Cloud-based data mapper (CDM): application for monitoring dry deposition of reactive nitrogen
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal monitoring of reactive nitrogen atmospheric deposition is essential for understanding its impact on sensitive ecosystems and quantifying cumulative effects. However, the sparsity of direct surface flux measurements combined with barriers in dissemination are major limiting factors in providing this information to decision makers and non-experts in a timely manner. This work addresses both aspects of this information gap by, 1) utilizing satellite-derived reactive nitrogen dry deposition data products that can be used by decision-makers to supplement the sparse direct surface flux measurements and 2) fill in measurement gaps. Therefore, we have developed a Reactive Nitrogen Flux Mapper (RNFM) component of the interactive Cloud-based Data Mapper (CDM) for providing easy access of satellite-derived reactive nitrogen (defined here as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ammonia (NH3)) dry deposition flux spatial maps/data to decision-makers/stakeholders over North America. The RNFM component of CDM has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to specify the geographical regions and time periods for computing the average fluxes on the fly using an integrated cloud-based computing platform. The CDM architecture is flexible and can be upgraded in the future to take advantage of upstream satellite data directly on cloud platforms to provide results in near real-time.

TI  - EI Eridani: A star under the influence The effect of magnetic activity in the short and long term
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Homogeneous photometric time series spanning decades provide a unique opportunity to study the long-term cyclic behavior of active spotted stars such as our target EI Eridani. In addition, with ultraprecise space photometry data, it is possible to investigate the accompanying flare activity in detail. However, the rotation period of approximate to 2 days for EI Eri makes it impossible to achieve time-resolved surface images from a single ground-based observing site. Therefore, for this purpose, spectroscopic data from a multi-site observing campaign are needed.Aims. We use our photometric time series of more than 40 yr to analyze the long-term behavior of EI Eri. We investigate flare activity using photometric data obtained with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The MUlti-SIte COntinuous Spectroscopy (MUSICOS) campaign in 1998 was designed to achieve high-resolution, multi-wavelength spectroscopic observations from many sites around the globe, which meant that uninterrupted phase coverage of EI Eri became available. We use these data to reconstruct successive surface-temperature maps of the star in order to study the changes of starspots on a very short timescale.Methods. We used long-term seasonal period analysis of our photometric time series to study changes in the rotational period. We also applied short-term Fourier-transform to look for activity cycle-like changes. We also studied the phase and frequency distribution of hand-selected flares. We applied our multi-line Doppler imaging code to reconstruct four consecutive Doppler images. These images were also used to measure surface differential rotation with our cross-correlation technique. In addition, we carried out tests to demonstrate how Doppler imaging is affected by the fact that the data came from several different instruments with different spectral resolutions.Results. Seasonal period analysis of the light curve reveals a smooth, significant change in period, possibly indicating the evolution of active latitudes. Temperature curves from B - V and V - I show slight differences, indicating the activity of EI Eri is spot dominated. Short-term Fourier transform reveals smoothly changing cycles of between 4.5 and 5.5 yr and of between 8.9 and 11.6 yr. The time-resolved spotted surface of EI Eri from Doppler imaging enabled us to follow the evolution of the different surface features. Cross-correlating the consecutive Doppler maps reveals surface shear of alpha = 0.036 +/- 0.007. Our tests validate our approach and show that the surface-temperature distribution is adequately reconstructed by our method. The tests also indicate how accurately the cross-correlation method can reproduce the surface shear as a function of the spectral resolution.

TI  - Crisis, what's a crisis? Some methodological reflections on evaluating the impact of Covid-19 on Australian arts and culture
T2  - JOURNAL FOR CULTURAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay discusses a 2021 interview-based pilot project on the impact of COVID-19 on a cross-section of Southeast Queensland artists and cultural organisations. Though it engages with empirical data, it addresses conceptual concerns. Our interviews aimed at capturing the emotional as well as the objective costs of the pandemic on cultural practitioners. The essay considers the phrase 'crisis of value' and asks whether it should be used to describe the state of the Australian cultural sector during this time. Following the arguments of Will Davies in respect of the intellectual resources needed to justify a 'neoliberal realist' worldview, it explores the impact of COVID-19 on the cultural sector by reflecting on its evaluative methods. Digital analysis of the themes, sentiments, and keywords of 14 interview transcripts are presented and ten inferences drawn about practitioners' underlying attitudes. Under what circumstances do performances of neoliberal calculations of benefit cease to be convincing and/or delivered in a convincing way? What factors constitute 'a crisis of value' in arts and culture? The conclusion argues that the methodic dimension of neoliberal evaluation is only one component of its social acceptability, and therefore only one factor in the perception of a state of crisis.

TI  - Ultra-Low Dose of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles for Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Patients with Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node (SLN) status is pivotal for treatment decision-making in patients with breast cancer. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) have been shown to be equivalent to the dual technique with technetium(99m) (Tc-99) and blue dye (BD) for SLN detection. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of detecting SLNs using an ultra-low dose of SPIO.MethodPatients planned for breast conserving surgery and SLN biopsy were included. An intradermal injection of 0.1 mL SPIO was administered at the areolar border up to 7 days before surgery. Tc-99/BD was administered according to clinical routine. SLNs were detected during surgery using a handheld magnetometer. All nodes with a magnetic and/or radioactive signal, as well as blue or clinically suspicious nodes, were harvested and analyzed.ResultsIn 50 patients, SPIO was injected a median of 4 days before surgery. At least one SLN was found in all patients with both methods. A total of 98 SLNs were removed; 90 were detected using SPIO and 88 using Tc-99/BD. Of the 90 SLNs detected by SPIO, 80 were Tc-99/BD positive (concordance 89%). Histopathological analysis classified 16 patients with tumor cells deposit and 9 with macro-metastasis > 2mm, where one SLN was identified only by the radioactive technique and one only by the magnetic technique.DiscussionSLN detection using 0.1 mL ultra-low dose SPIO injected intradermally was successful in all patients. A future analysis will determine whether the approach using an ultra-low dose of SPIO injected intradermally will minimize skin staining and MRI artefacts.

TI  - Digital soil mapping of lithium in Australia
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - With a higher demand for lithium (Li), a better understanding of its concentration and spatial distribution is important to delineate potential anomalous areas. This study uses a digital soil mapping framework to combine data from recent geochemical surveys and environmental covariates that affect soil formation to predict and map aqua-regia-extractable Li content across the 7.6x10(6) km(2) area of Australia. Catchment outlet sediment samples (i.e. soils formed on alluvial parent material) were collected by the National Geochemical Survey of Australia at 1315 sites, with both top (0-10 cm depth) and bottom (on average similar to 60-80 cm depth) catchment outlet sediments sampled. We developed 50 bootstrap models using a cubist regression tree algorithm for each depth. The spatial prediction models were validated on an independent Northern Australia Geochemical Survey dataset, showing a good prediction with a root mean square error of 3.32 mgkg(-1) (which is 44.2 % of the interquartile range) for the top depth. The model for the bottom depth has yet to be validated. The variables of importance for the models indicated that the first three Landsat 30+ Barest Earth bands (red, green, blue) and gamma radiometric dose have a strong impact on the development of regression-based Li prediction. The bootstrapped models were then used to generate digital soil Li prediction maps for both depths, which could identify and delineate areas with anomalously high Li concentrations in the regolith. The predicted maps show high Li concentration around existing mines and other potentially anomalous Li areas that have yet to be verified. The same mapping principles can potentially be applied to other elements. The Li geochemical data for calibration and validation are available from de Caritat and Cooper (2011b; ) and Main et al. (2019; ), respectively. The covariate data used for this study were sourced from the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) infrastructure, which is enabled by the Australian Government's National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS; https://esoil.io/TERNLandscapes/Public/Products/TERN/Covariates/Mosaics/90m/, last access: 6 December 2022; TERN, 2019). The final predictive map is available at (Ng et al., 2023).

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This paper describes a new global dataset of cloud properties observed by MODIS relying on the current (collection 6.1) processing of MODIS data and produced to facilitate comparison with results from the MODIS observational proxy used in climate models. The dataset merges observations from the two MODIS instruments into a single netCDF file. Statistics (mean, standard deviation, and number of observations) are ac-cumulated over daily and monthly timescales on an equal-angle grid for viewing and illumination geometry, cloud detection, cloud-top pressure, and cloud properties (optical thickness, effective particle size, and water path) partitioned by thermodynamic phase and an assessment as to whether the underlying observations come from fully or partly cloudy pixels. Similarly partitioned joint histograms are available for (1) optical thickness and cloud-top pressure, (2) optical thickness and particle size, and (3) cloud water path and particle size. Differences with standard data products, caveats for data use, and guidelines for comparison to the MODIS simulator are described.

TI  - Fish and crustaceans provide early indicators of success in wetland restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Early indicators of restoration success can inform adaptive management strategies and maintain community interest and financial investment. Coastal wetland restoration projects prioritize monitoring the succession of habitat forming communities. However, these communities often expand slowly. In contrast, fish and crustaceans can quickly occupy newly available habitats and therefore, may be early indicators of restoration success. Here, we compared the short-term responses of fish and crustacean communities and landcover area to restoration actions at a restoring wetland and three reference wetlands in the Maroochy River in eastern Australia. Fish and crustacean communities and landcover area were surveyed every 6 months between Spring 2017 and Spring 2019 (n = 5), with two sampling events conducted before restoration actions commenced in May 2018 and three after. Fish and crustaceans were surveyed using baited underwater video stations and fyke nets. Landcover was remotely sensed using a combination of Worldview-2 satellite imagery, object-based image analysis, and random forest classification. Fish and crustaceans make viable indicators for early restoration success, as our findings show the composition, diversity, and abundance of species targeted in fisheries of these communities can resemble assemblages at reference sites within 1 year of restoration actions. The area of tidal inundation significantly increased overtime, but the recovery of mangroves and saltmarsh communities did not. These findings support the notion that coastal wetland restoration can promote immediate recruitment by fish and crustacean communities, thus making these taxa useful indicators for communicating early success of restoration projects.

TI  - Occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of <i>Salmonella</i> species and potentially pathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> in free-living seals of Canadian Atlantic and eastern Arctic waters
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Seal populations in Canadian waters provide sustenance to coastal communities. There is potential for pathogenic and/or antimicrobial-resistant bacteria to transfer to humans through inadvertent faecal contamination of seal products. The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence and potential antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes in faecal samples collected from grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and from ringed seals (Pusa hispida) in Frobisher Bay and Eclipse Sound, Nunavut, Canada. Grey seals were harvested during commercial hunts or during scientific sampling; ringed seals were collected by Inuit hunters during subsistence harvests. Virulence genes defining pathogenic E. coli were identified by PCR, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on recovered isolates. In grey seals, E. coli was detected in 34/44 (77%) samples, and pathogenic E. coli (extraintestinal E. coli [ExPEC], enteropathogenic E. coli [EPEC] or ExPEC/EPEC) was detected in 13/44 (29%) samples. Non-susceptibility to beta-lactams and quinolones was observed in isolates from 18 grey seals. In ringed seals from Frobisher Bay, E. coli was detected in 4/45 (9%) samples; neither virulence genes nor antimicrobial resistance was detected in these isolates. In ringed seals from Eclipse Sound, E. coli was detected in 8/50 (16%) samples and pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC and ExPEC/EPEC) in 5/50 (10%) samples. One seal from Eclipse Sound had an E. coli isolate resistant to beta-lactams. A monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium was recovered from 8/50 (16%) seals from Eclipse Sound. All Salmonella isolates were resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole and tetracycline. L. monocytogenes was not detected in any sample. These findings suggest that seals may act as important sentinel species and as reservoirs or vectors for antimicrobial-resistant and virulent E. coli and Salmonella species. Further characterization of these isolates would provide additional insights into the source and spread of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes in these populations of free-living seals.

TI  - Comparing leaf area index estimates in a Mediterranean forest using field measurements, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundLeaf area index (LAI) is a key indicator for the assessment of the canopy's processes such as net primary production and evapotranspiration. For this reason, the LAI is often used as a key input parameter in ecosystem services' modeling, which is emerging as a critical tool for steering upcoming urban reforestation strategies. However, LAI field measures are extremely time-consuming and require remarkable economic and human resources. In this context, spectral indices computed using high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery like Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8, may represent a feasible and economic solution for estimating the LAI at the city scale. Nonetheless, as far as we know, only a few studies have assessed the potential of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data doing so in Mediterranean forest ecosystems. To fill such a gap, we assessed the performance of 10 spectral indices derived from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data in estimating the LAI, using field measurements collected with the LI-COR LAI 2200c as a reference. We hypothesized that Sentinel-2 data, owing to their finer spatial and spectral resolution, perform better in estimating vegetation's structural parameters compared to Landsat 8.ResultsWe found that Landsat 8-derived models have, on average, a slightly better performance, with the best model (the one based on NDVI) showing an R-2 of 0.55 and NRMSE of 14.74%, compared to R-2 of 0.52 and NRMSE of 15.15% showed by the best Sentinel-2 model, which is based on the NBR. All models were affected by spectrum saturation for high LAI values (e.g., above 5).ConclusionIn Mediterranean ecosystems, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data produce moderately accurate LAI estimates during the peak of the growing season. Therefore, the uncertainty introduced using satellite-derived LAI in ecosystem services' assessments should be systematically accounted for.

AB  - The bacterial origin of mitochondria has been a widely accepted as an event that occurred about 1.45 billion years ago and endowed cells with internal energy producing organelle. Thus, mitochondria have traditionally been viewed as subcellular organelle as any other - fully functionally dependent on the cell it is a part of. However, recent studies have given us evidence that mitochondria are more functionally independent than other organelles, as they can function outside the cells, engage in complex "social" interactions, and communicate with each other as well as other cellular components, bacteria and viruses. Furthermore, mitochondria move, assemble and organize upon sensing different environmental cues, using a process akin to bacterial quorum sensing. Therefore, taking all these lines of evidence into account we hypothesize that mitochondria need to be viewed and studied from a perspective of a more functionally independent entity. This view of mitochondria may lead to new insights into their biological function, and inform new strategies for treatment of disease associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.

TI  - Evaluation of three different 99mTc-based mock-venom agents for lymphoscintigraphy studies in preclinical models of peripheral snakebite envenomation
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Snakebite envenomation is one of the major public health concerns across many countries; with the WHO designating it as a 'priority neglected tropical disease' and stressing for a need to develop novel therapeutic strategies to reduce death and disability rate by end of 2030. Since a major component of venom; the high molecular weight (HMw) toxins enter the bloodstream through lymphatic system, research is focusing on modulating the lymphatic flow rate after topical application of suitable drug candidates. Present study compared the suitability of three radiopharmaceutical agents, namely 99mTc-Sulfur colloid (SC), 99mTc-Phytate (Phy) and 99mTc-Human serum albumin (HSA), to be used as mock-venom agent in studying modulation in lymphatic flow rate in preclinical models of peripheral snakebite envenomation using lymphoscintigraphy studies. The study was performed in 72 Sprague Dawley rats; divided into six groups of 12 rats each. Control groups were given intradermal injection (1.29-1.48 MBq in 100 & mu;l normal saline) of either 99mTc-Phy/ 99mTc-SC/ 99mTc-HSA into the tail as 'mock-venom'. In respective test groups, commercially available topical formulation (Anobliss & REG; Cream) containing Nifedipine (Nif; 0.3% w/w) and Lidocaine (Lid; 1.5% w/w) was applied topically over the animals' lower body (tail and hind limbs) immediately within 20s of administering intradermal injection of the radiopharmaceutical. Any modulation in lymph transit time from periphery to systemic circulation was assessed using lymphoscintigraphy by taking dynamic gamma-scintigraphy images of 60s each till 1 h post-injection of the test radiopharmaceuticals. Significant difference in movement of the three radiopharmaceuticals was noted in terms of their lymphatic movement. 99mTc-Phy did not show significant travel through the lymphatics and the liver was faintly visualized in control as well as test intervention groups. In case of 99mTc-SC, significant changes in movement of the radiotracer after topical application of Nif/Lid in the test intervention groups were clearly noted in comparison to control (P < 0.05). Multiple numbers of lymph nodes (LNs) could be clearly visualized in control (5 & PLUSMN; 1 LNs) and test intervention groups (3 & PLUSMN; 1 LNs). Liver uptake was more prominent in control an-imals and it reduced significantly in test intervention groups. On the other hand, 99mTc-HSA showed lesser number of lymph nodes and higher accumulation in liver as compared to 99mTc-SC, suggesting very fast movement of this radiopharmaceutical. Results indicates that 99mTc-SC could be used as a suitable agent to mimic lymphatic transit behavior of HMw toxin components of snake venom and could therefore be used as a model in studying the effect of any test pharmacological intervention in modulating lymphatic transit rate. Additional advantage could be a significant reduction in the need for sacrificing large number of animals, particularly during initial screening phase of drug development cycle.

TI  - Southwestern Atlantic ocean fronts detected from the fusion of multi-source remote sensing data by a deep learning model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Southwestern Atlantic, the Falkland Current intrudes onto the South American shelf, resulting in the meeting of two water masses which are completely different in temperature and dynamic characteristics, thus generating the Southwestern Atlantic Front (SAF). Therefore, the SAF has prominent characteristics of thermal and dynamics. The current ocean front detection is mainly by performing gradient operations on sea surface temperature (SST) data, where regions with large temperature gradients are considered as ocean fronts. The thermal gradient method largely ignores the dynamical features, leading to inaccurate manifestation of SAF. This study develops a deep learning model, SAFNet, to detect the SAF through the synergy of 10-year (2010-2019) satellite-derived SST and sea surface height (SSH) observations to achieve high accuracy detection of SAF with fused thermal and dynamic characteristics. The comparative experimental results show that the detection accuracy of SAFNet reaches 99.45%, which is significantly better than other models. By comparing the frontal probability (FP) obtained by SST, SSH and SST-SSH fusion data respectively, it is proved that the necessity of fusion multi-source remote sensing data for SAF detection. The detection results of fusion data can reflect the spatial distribution of SAF more comprehensively and accurately. According to the meridional variation of FP, the main reason for the seasonal variation of the SAF is the change in its thermal characteristics, and the SAF has stable dynamic characteristics.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations in sea surface <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> and air-sea flux of CO<sub>2</sub> in the Bering Sea revealed by satellite-based data during 2003-2019
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The understanding of long-time-series variations in air-sea CO2 flux in the Bering Sea is critical, as it is the passage area from the North Pacific Ocean water to the Arctic. Here, a data-driven remote sensing retrieval method is constructed based on a large amount of underway partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) data in the Bering Sea. After several experiments, a Gaussian process regression model with input parameters of sea surface temperature, sea surface height, mixed-layer depth, chlorophyll a concentration, dry air mole fractions of CO2, and bathymetry was selected. After validation with independent data, the root mean square error of pCO(2) was< 24 & mu;atm (R-2 = 0.94) with satisfactory performance. Then, we reconstructed the sea surface pCO(2) in the Bering Sea from 2003 to 2019 and estimated the corresponding air-sea CO2 fluxes. Significant seasonal variations were identified, with higher sea surface pCO(2) in winter/spring than in summer/autumn in both the basin and shelf area. Semiquantitative analysis reveals that the Bering Sea is a non-temperature-dominated area with a mean temperature effect on pCO(2) of 12.7 & mu;atm and a mean non-temperature effect of -51.8 & mu;atm. From 2003 to 2019, atmospheric pCO(2) increased at a rate of 2.1 & mu;atm yr(-1), while sea surface pCO(2) in the basin increased rapidly (2.8 & mu;atm yr(-1)); thus, the CO2 emissions from the basin increased. However, the carbon sink in the continental shelf still continuously increased. The whole Bering Sea exhibited an increasing carbon sink with the area integral of air-sea CO2 fluxes increasing from 6 to 19 TgC over 17 years. Meanwhile, the seasonal amplitudes in pCO(2) in the shelf area also increased, approaching 14 & mu;atm per decade. The reaction of the continuously added CO2 in continental seawater reduced the ocean CO2 system capacity. This is the first study to present long-time-series satellite data with high resolution in the Bering Sea, which is beneficial for studying the changes in ocean ecosystems and carbon sink capacity.

TI  - Toward a better understanding of coastal salt marsh mapping: A case from China using dual-temporal images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes suffering from anthropogenic coastal development and sea level rise have attracted much attention because of their capacity for carbon sequestration and global climate change mitigation. Accurate mapping of coastal salt marshes is always the first step for their protection, management, and restoration. The inherent complexities of vegetation, dynamics of tides, and anthropogenic disturbances pose challenges for remote sensing-based approaches. Existing studies have utilized phenology information and various black-box algorithms to reduce misclassifications. However, the approaches with dual-temporal images containing phenology information have suffered from inefficiency; the misclassifications have been objectively postprocessed rather than considered in the method design, and the tacit knowledge of the trained black-box models has not been revealed. To address the above issues, we proposed a new approach with solid improvements in dual-temporal image construction, misclassification processing, and tacit knowledge analysis, including an efficient method to synthesize dual-temporal images based on the common divisor of the green-up season or senescence season resulting from latitudinal gradients in narrow coastal areas of China, a detailed classification scheme by interpretation of iteratively collected samples, and a key decision rule approximating the trained model. We applied the approach to Sentinel-1/2 images and DEM data, thus deriving a 10-m resolution coastal salt marsh map of China with an overall accuracy of 92.5%. A qualitative comparison showed that the map produced in this study was fitted well with actual salt marsh distributions, resulting in improved accuracy when compared to recently generated maps. The most important contribution is that the overall nature of the trained model observed from the training samples was approximated by a four-feature decision rule following the principle of explainable artificial intelligence, i.e., B8senescence/B4senescence < 2.06 & B4green/B8green < 0.78 & B12green/B11green < 0.72 & elevation < 2.13, and thus established a new potential classification mechanism for dual-temporal black-box algorithms, i.e., the water signal was covered up by flourishing vegetation, but the situation changed when vegetation withered. This study not only generates an accurate coastal salt marsh map at a national scale but also provides a classification mechanism for dual-temporal image-based coastal salt marsh identification and mapping.

TI  - Nighttime light remote sensing for urban applications: Progress, challenges, and prospects
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing data offer unique capabilities to characterize both the extent and intensity of human activities and have been extensively used to understand urbanization since 1992. The recent proliferation of NTL sensors, algorithms, and products creates new opportunities to understand contemporary urbanization and the associated socioeconomic and environmental changes. We conducted a comprehensive literature review of 688 peer-reviewed papers published between 1992 and 2022 to understand the trends in how NTL data have been used to study urbanization (e.g., with which data products, during which time span, and in which geographies) and to synthesize the progress and challenges of key urban application topics. Based on our review, we identified four research directions for future NTL-based urban applications: (1) a better understanding of scale effects and sources of variations in NTL data; (2) integrating multi-source NTL data and synergizing NTL data with other types of geospatial data for improved NTL utilization; (3) more research on the Global South; and (4) developing new urban applications with new NTL data products. Addressing research gaps in these areas will generate new insights into the urbanization process under different geographical and socioeconomic settings.

T2  - SOFTWARE IMPACTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a fully automated framework for algal bloom forecasting in inland water by combining remote sensing data series and unsupervised machine learning concepts. In contrast to other methods in the specialized literature that usually employ pre-labeled data, the proposed approach was designed to be fully autonomous concerning pre-requisites, assuming as input only a time series of remotely sensed products to forecast algal proliferation. In more technical terms, the designed machine-intelligent methodology comprises the steps of pre-processing, feature extraction and modeling, and it learns unsupervised from past events to predict future scenarios of algal blooms, outputting algal insurgence maps.

TI  - Evaluating MODIS snow products using an extensive wildlife camera network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow covers a maximum of 47 million km2 of Earth's northern hemisphere each winter and is an important component of the planet's energy balance, hydrology cycles, and ecosystems. Monitoring regional and global snow cover has increased in urgency in recent years due to warming temperatures and declines in snow cover extent. Optical satellite instruments provide large-scale observations of snow cover, but cloud cover and dense forest canopy can reduce accuracy in mapping snow cover. Remote camera networks deployed for wildlife monitoring operate below cloud cover and in forests, representing a virtually untapped source of snow cover observations to supplement satellite observations. Using images from 1181 wildlife cameras deployed by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), we compared snow cover extracted from camera images to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products during winter months of 2018-2020. Ordinal snow classifications (scale = 0-4) from cameras were closely related to normalized difference snow index (NDSI) values from the MODIS Terra Snow Cover Daily L3 Global 500 m (MOD10A1) Collection 6 product (R2 = 0.70). Tree canopy cover, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and image color mode influenced agreement between camera images and MOD10A1 NDSI values. For MOD10A1F, MOD10A1's corresponding cloud-gap filled product, agreement with cloud-gap filled values decreased from 78.5% to 56.4% in the first three days of cloudy periods and stabilized thereafter. Using our camera data as validation, we derived a threshold to create daily binary maps of snow cover from the MOD10A1 product. The threshold corresponding to snow presence was an NDSI value of 40.50, which closely matched a previously defined global binary threshold of 40 using the MOD10A2 8-day product. These analyses demonstrate the utility of camera trap networks for validation of snow cover products from satellite remote sensing, as well as their potential to identify sources of inaccuracy.

TI  - A novel Greenness and Water Content Composite Index (GWCCI) for soybean mapping from single remotely sensed multispectral images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As a critical source of food and one of the most economically significant crops in the world, soybean plays an important role in achieving food security. Large area accurate mapping of soybean has long been a vital, but challenging issue in remote sensing, relying heavily on large-volume and representative training samples, whose collection is time-consuming and inefficient, especially for large areas (e.g., national scale). Thus, methods are needed that can map soybean automatically and accurately from single-date remotely sensed imagery. In this research, a novel Greenness and Water Content Composite Index (GWCCI) was proposed to map soybean from just a single Sentinel-2 multispectral image in an end-to-end manner without employing training samples. By capitalizing on the product of the NDVI (related to greenness) and the short-wave infrared (SWIR) band (related to canopy water content), the GWCCI provides the required information with which to discriminate between soybean and other land cover types. The effectiveness of the proposed GWCCI was investigated in seven typical soybean planting regions within four major soybean-producing countries across the world (i.e., China, the United States, Brazil and Argentina), with diverse climates, cropping systems and agricultural landscapes. In the experiments, an optimal threshold of 0.17 was estimated and adopted by the GWCCI in the first study site (S1) in 2021, and then generalised to the other study sites over multiple years for soybean mapping. The GWCCI method achieved a consistently higher accuracy in 2021 compared to two conventional comparative classifiers (support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)), with an average overall accuracy (OA) of 88.30% and a Kappa coefficient (k) of 0.77; significantly greater than those of RF (OA: 80.92%, k: 0.62) and SVM (OA: 80.29%, k: 0.60). Furthermore, the OA of the extended years was highly consistent with that of 2021 for study sites S2 to S7, demonstrating the great generalisation capability and robustness of the proposed approach over multiple years. The proposed GWCCI method is straightforward, reliable and robust, and represents an important step forward for mapping soybean, one of the most significant crops grown globally.

TI  - Drainage Network Analysis and Tectonics Interference of the Reth River, Central Ganga Plain (India) Using Geospatial Technology
T2  - GEOTECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Reth River is a ground water fed river of Central Ganga Plain, similar to 107 km long and drains similar to 391.71 km(2). It flows through an incised valley until confluences with the Gomati River. Incision of the river valley has been investigated by using a longitudinal profile, escarpment height and morphology of the valley. The study was executed using Toposheet of scale 1 : 50 000 of Survey of India (SOI) and decadal satellite imageries, with GIS techniques to estimate the properties of basins. The mean bifurcation ratio of the basin is 5.49, but variation between the successive stream orders suggests that the study area is tectonically controlled. The drainage density (0.66), stream frequency (0.46), constant of channel maintenance (1.51) and length of overland flows (0.80) indicate of the high surface rock permeability, low surface runoff, high infiltration rate, and least erodible properties respectively. The drainage texture (0.30) suggests a very coarse texture and smooth topography. RHO coefficient value (0.13) indicates the low capacity of water. The elongation ratio (0.45), circulatory ratio (0.28) and form factor (0.16) indicate that the basin is highly elongated due to shallow relief. The downstream variation of escarpment heights indicates an increasing downstream trend of escarpment heights. According to aerial views of 46 years, oxbow lakes are formed through several processes, such as (i) a flow separation zone at the entrance of the channel creating a sediment plug, (ii) sediment sorting by flow gradients and decantation in the ponded areas. The drainage basin shape (3.02) indicates the basin is tectonically active. River longitudinal profile ranges are from 124 to 102 m amsl. This indicates the 4(th)-order river with dendritic pattern.

TI  - Integrating UAV and Freely Available Space-Borne Data to Describe Tree Decline Across Semi-arid Mountainous Forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Tree decline is a highly complex process and is inherently a function of manifold climatic, physiologic, and anthropogenic factors. Monitoring decline processes and their underlying dynamics primarily entails identifying their location and intensity across different ecosystems, for which airborne and satellite remote sensing approaches offer cost-effective and spatially explicit alternatives to field methods. Consumer-grade unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can barely be used as standalone means for large-area monitoring due to their constrains in spatial and spectral domains. However, they could effectively be integrated alongside satellite data to unlock their information for subsequent upscaling on landscape level. We designed a novel two-step workflow to describe the severity of tree decline by linking UAV-RGB information to space-borne multispectral and digital elevation model (DEM) data over 15 forest sites dominated by Persian oak across the latitudinal gradient of Zagros Forests in western Iran. We display how to 1) leverage UAV as reference data across multiple structurally different Persian oak-dominated sites in semi-arid Zagros mountains of Iran; 2) link UAV, Copernicus DEM, and Sentinel-2 data to retrieve decline information within a model-driven context; and 3) analyze the sensitivity of models by means of a global variance-based sensitivity analysis. Results suggested a high association between UAV and field data on the intensity of decline, which enabled using sampled UAV data as reference to estimate the decline severity using space-borne data by means of semi-parametric generalized additive model (GAM) and non-parametric random forest (RF) approaches. Conclusively, this study provided a baseline for multi-scale analysis of tree decline using budget and partially free data sources, which can be of high scientific and practical assets for monitoring in remote, sparse, mountainous, and continuously degrading forest areas.

TI  - A survey of machine learning and deep learning in remote sensing of geological environment: Challenges, advances, and opportunities
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to limited resources and environmental pollution, monitoring the geological environment has become essential for many countries' sustainable development. As various high-resolution remote-sensing (RS) imaging platforms are continuously available, the remote sensing of the geological environment (GERS) provides a finegrain, all-weather, and low-cost method for identifying geological elements. Mainstream machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods can extract high-level high-dimensional semantic information and thus supply an efficient tool for high-precision classification and recognition in many fields. Therefore, the integration of advanced methods and multi-source RS images for GERS interpretation has achieved remarkable breakthroughs during the past decades. However, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic survey of the advances of GERS interpretation regarding ML and DL methods is still lacking. Through the collection of extensive published research in this area, this survey outlines and analyzes the challenges, progress, and promising directions of GERS interpretation. Specifically, the main challenges and difficulties in identifying GERS elements are first summarized in four aspects: sufficient element characteristics and variations, complex context disturbance, RS image quality and types, and other limitations in GERS interpretation. Second, we systematically introduce various RS imaging platforms and advanced ML and DL methods for GERS interpretation. Third, the research status and trends of several GERS applications, including their use for lithology, soil, water, rock glacier, and geological disaster, are ultimately collected and compared. Finally, potential opportunities for future research are discussed. After the systematic and comprehensive review, the conclusive findings suggest that longtime large-scale GERS interpretation and corresponding change pattern analysis will be a significant future direction to meet the needs of environment improvement and sustainable development. To complete the above goals, a fusion of satellite, airplane, environmental monitoring, geological survey, and other types of data will provide enough discriminative information, and expert knowledge, GIS, and high-performance computing techniques will be helpful to improve the efficiency and generalizability of ML and DL methods for processing the multi-platform RS data.

TI  - Analysis of Irrigated Salt-Affected Soils in the Central Fergana Valley, Uzbekistan, Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Satellite Images, Laboratory Studies, and Spectral Index-Based Approaches
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is a fundamental barrier to soil fertility, particularly in dry climates, and is a limiting factor for agricultural output and subterranean water utilization. Soil salinity significantly restricts agricultural soils in Uzbekistan. Remote sensing and satellite images were used to evaluate soil salinity in the Mingbulak District of Uzbekistan. In October 2019, soil samples were taken from various locations and analyzed, and soil salinity indices were calculated. The region's soil salinity was then mapped and modeled. The results revealed that SI 12 and the NDSI from Landsat 8 were superior to the others. The accuracy of the single band B2 and that of salinity indices SI1 and SI8 of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A were higher in the deeper layers than in the upper. NDSI was used to model the relationship between soil salinity (electrical conductivity) and the prominent salt ion The model was validated successfully, and a soil salinity map was created. According to the findings, the NDSI provided more accurate information on soil salinity than the other salinity indices, and the blue band was successful in depicting sublayers and the overall salinity of the region.

AB  - In order to improve people's quality of life, it is necessary to establish a complete environmental monitoring system outdoors. In the organizational structure of the environmental monitoring system, monitoring nodes are placed according to actual monitoring requirements to meet the needs of environmental monitoring and data information collection in the area. It mainly analyzes ZigBee technology and 4G technology in detail. In order to overcome the short-distance transmission shortcomings of ZigBee technology, the system combines short-distance ZigBee technology and long-distance 4G technology to achieve short-distance data collection and long-distance transmission. This paper selects the tin mining area as a representative research field and processes the images through professional remote sensing image processing software to extract land and plant pollution caused by tailings and mining areas. Then, enter the sample point to be tested to select typical main vegetation mining areas, complete the reflectance spectrum detection on the spot, and then conduct a comprehensive analysis of the spectral characteristics of some test data, and then check the plant reflectance and pollution status based on image processing. Through studying the polluted materials extracted by spectroscopy, the tailings ecological restoration plan was finally developed.

TI  - What is value in the New Space Economy? The end-users' perspective on satellite data and solutions
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - New industrial dynamics are disrupting the space sector. New stakeholders bringing in capital, technologies, and knowledge from other industries are developing next-generation space infrastructures and services. Both commercial and institutional space projects have to be valuable for a wider set of end-users, asking not only for economic returns but also social and environmental benefits. Space organizations urge understanding and fostering value in the New Space Economy ecosystem. Indeed, end-users are still struggling to enact the expected value of satellite data and solutions for their business. This paper aims to investigate the expected value and the level of adoption (enacted value) of satellite data and satellite-based solutions in the New Space Economy ecosystem from end-users' perspective. We interviewed 21 managers from end-user organizations in different sectors (i.e., Insurance & Finance, Energy & Utility, Transportation & Logistics). Value is deeply discussed in general management literature, and we identify Value Theory as the theoretical lens with the most explanatory power for the phenomenon under examination. From the end-users' perspective, we frame the expected value and the enacted value in taking strategic and tactical decisions regarding their activities, services and products, laying the foundations for further studies of value mechanisms in the New Space ecosystem. Our research set a theoretical and conceptual foundation on value in the New Space ecosystem. It also delineates the blurred boundaries of the New Space ecosystem, the main stakeholders involved, and their perception of value. Insights and implications for strategic and innovation management are also provided. Practitioners may exploit our research results and leverage the end-users-oriented framework to develop next-generation space projects in the New Space ecosystem. We also discuss the limitations and further developments of this research.

TI  - Long-term evolution of winter habitats in Poyang Lake derived from satellite imagery using machine learning methods
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Poyang Lake is a freshwater lake in China which is a vital winter habitat for many kinds of wildlife and a critical component of the regional ecology. Here, we use Landsat satellite imagery to systematically assess habitat characteristic changes from 1990 to 2021. Four machine learning methods including random forest (RF), gradient boosting tree (GBT), support vector machine (SVM) and classification and regression trees (CART) are analyzed by comparing the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients. The results show that the accuracy of random forest is higher than that of the other three machine learning methods. The long-term characteristics of Poyang Lake winter habitat types are extracted from Landsat satellite images using the RF method. These results show that the mudflat area was larger than water surface and sand. After 2012, more mudflat area had been converted into grassland, which is related to the early onset of the winter dry season in the Poyang Lake area. The habitats were scattered and fragmented from 1990 to 1998; after 1997-1998, however, the degree of landscape patch density and interference decreased, indicating a decreased impact of human-related interference and natural factors on the evolution of habitats in and around Poyang Lake.

TI  - <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-Tilmanocept performance for sentinel node mapping in breast cancer, melanoma, and head and neck cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis from a European expert panel
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeAlthough multiple radiopharmaceuticals are currently available for sentinel node (SN) biopsy, Tc-99m-tilmanocept is of particular interest due to its low molecular weight and specific binding capability for the mannose receptors of lymphatic reticuloendothelial cells. In the current systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to provide an update from a European expert panel on the performance of Tc-99m-tilmanocept for SN biopsy.MethodsA systematic literature search of the PubMed/Medline and Embase databases was performed to identify studies on the use of Tc-99m-tilmanocept for SN identification in oncological patients. The articles' methodological quality was assessed before inclusion. The pooled estimates of the pre-/intraoperative detection rates (DR; proportion of patients with >= 1 SN identified) and/or pN + sensitivity (SN + /pN + patients ratio), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated for breast cancer, melanoma, and head and neck cancer.ResultsTwenty-four articles were included in the systematic review, and twenty-one provided data for the meta-analysis. According to data availability, the Tc-99m-tilmanocept-estimated pooled preoperative and intraoperative DRs were 0.94 (95%CI, 0.88-1.01) and 0.99 (0.98-1.00) for breast cancer, 0.98 (0.96-0.99) and 1.00 (0.99-1.00) for melanoma, and 0.97 (0.93-1.02) and 0.99 (0.96-1.01) for head and neck carcinoma. Finally, the pooled sensitivity for nodal metastasis in melanoma was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.92-1.03).Conclusion(99m)Tc-tilmanocept is a promising radiotracer for SN mapping in patients with breast cancer, melanoma, or head and neck cancer. We strongly believe that multicenter trials are still needed to assess if Tc-99m-tilmanocept is superior to other radiotracers used in clinical routine.

TI  - Validation of the Cloud_CCI (Cloud Climate Change Initiative) cloud products in the Arctic
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of clouds in the Arctic radiation budget is not well understood. Ground-based and airborne measurements provide valuable data to test and improve our understanding. However, the ground-based measurements are intrinsically sparse, and the airborne observations are snapshots in time and space. Passive remote sensing measurements from satellite sensors offer high spatial coverage and an evolving time series, having lengths potentially of decades. However, detecting clouds by passive satellite remote sensing sensors is challenging over the Arctic because of the brightness of snow and ice in the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions and because of the small brightness temperature contrast to the surface. Consequently, the quality of the resulting cloud data products needs to be assessed quantitatively. In this study, we validate the cloud data products retrieved from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) post meridiem (PM) data from the polar-orbiting NOAA-19 satellite and compare them with those derived from the ground-based instruments during the sun-lit months. The AVHRR cloud data products by the European Space Agency (ESA) Cloud Climate Change Initiative (Cloud_CCI) project uses the observations in the visible and IR bands to determine cloud properties. The ground-based measurements from four high-latitude sites have been selected for this investigation: Hyytiala (61.84 degrees N, 24.29 degrees E), North Slope of Alaska (NSA; 71.32 degrees N, 156.61 degrees W), Ny-Alesund (Ny-A; 78.92 degrees N, 11.93 degrees E), and Summit (72.59 degrees N, 38.42 degrees W). The liquid water path (LWP) ground-based data are retrieved from microwave radiometers, while the cloud top height (CTH) has been determined from the integrated lidar-radar measurements. The quality of the satellite products, cloud mask and cloud optical depth (COD), has been assessed using data from NSA, whereas LWP and CTH have been investigated over Hyytiala, NSA, Ny-A, and Summit.The Cloud_CCI COD results for liquid water clouds are in better agreement with the NSA radiometer data than those for ice clouds. For liquid water clouds, the Cloud_CCI COD is underestimated roughly by 3 optical depth (OD) units. When ice clouds are included, the underestimation increases to about 5OD units. The Cloud_CCI LWP is overestimated over Hyytiala by approximate to 7 gm(-2), over NSA by approximate to 16 gm(-2), and over Ny-A by approximate to 24 gm(-2). Over Summit, CCI LWP is overestimated for values <= 20 gm(-2) and underestimated for values > 20 gm(-2). Overall the results of the CCI LWP retrievals are within the ground-based instrument uncertainties. To understand the effects of multi-layer clouds on the CTH retrievals, the statistics are compared between the single-layer clouds and all types (single-layer C multi-layer). For CTH retrievals, the Cloud_CCI product overestimates the CTH for single-layer clouds. When the multi-layer clouds are included (i.e., all types), the observed CTH overestimation becomes an underestimation of about 360-420 m. The CTH results over Summit station showed the highest biases compared to the other three sites. To understand the scale-dependent differences between the satellite and ground-based data, the Bland-Altman method is applied. This method does not identify any scale-dependent differences for all the selected cloud parameters except for the retrievals over the Summit station. In summary, the Cloud_CCI cloud data products investigated agree reasonably well with those retrieved from ground-based measurements made at the four high-latitude sites.

TI  - Spatial and temporal analyses of the influences of meteorological and environmental factors on Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) population dynamics during the peak abundance period at a city scale
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) is a major vector of multiple diseases. While vaccines have been developed, preventing these Aedes-borne diseases continues to primarily depend on monitoring and controlling the vector population. Despite increasing research on the impacts of various factors on Ae. albopictus population dynamics, there is still no consensus on how meteorological or environmental factors affect vector distribution. In this study, the relationships between mosquito abundance and meteorological and environmental indicators were examined at the town level based on data collected from July to September, the peak abundance period of 2019 in Shanghai. In addition to performing Poisson regression, we employed the geographically weighted Poisson regression model to account for spatial dependency and heterogeneity. The result showed that the environmental factors (notably human population density, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), socioeconomic deprivation, and road density) had more significant impacts than the meteorological variables in accounting for the spatial variation of mosquito abundance at a city scale. The dominant environmental variable differed in urban and rural places. Furthermore, our findings indicated that deprived townships are more susceptible to higher vector densities compared to non-deprived townships. Therefore, it is crucial not only to allocate more resources but also to increase attention towards controlling the vectors responsible for their transmission in these townships.

TI  - Hashing-based remote sensing image tamper detection system
T2  - DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the large scale of remote sensing images in practical application scenarios, this paper proposes an image detection system by extracting feature hashing of remote sensing images. The feature hashing is generated from different perspectives such as spatial and frequency domain, local and global. For the edge features, an optimized Canny operator based on four pairs of threshold (OCO-4) is employed to calculate the spatial coordinates of rich edge blocks and low edge blocks. In the frequency domain, compression sensing (CS) is exploited to compress and sample Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) blocks coefficients. For the global texture features, contrast, correlation, energy and homogeneity are extracted by gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Furthermore, in order to enhance the security during cloud transmission, pseudo-random numbers are used as secret keys to construct the secure hashes. Consequently, the feature hashes are obtained in both the frequency domain and the space domain, which ensures the effectiveness and uniqueness of feature hashing. Simulation experiments are carried out on four different remote sensing data sets. The results show that the proposed detection system has high sensitivity and a desirable balance between robustness and discrimination, and the average detection accuracy can reach 99.96%.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A nomogram for intraoperatively predicting non-sentinel lymph node metastases in early breast cancer patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Individualized decisions are required in early-stage breast cancer patients. We aimed to establish a novel model for predicting non-sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases in patients with positive SLNs, using preoperative and intraoperative characteristics and inflammatory indicators.Methods: The data of 489 patients with invasive breast cancer were retrospectively collected from Xuanwu Hospital between 2014 and 2021. Among them, 96 patients with at least one positive SLN were used to build the predictive model. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors of non-SLN metastases. A nomogram was developed using these risk factors and was validated by calibration curves. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and decision curve analyses (DCA) were used to compare our novel nomogram with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram. Cross-validation was performed for further internal validation of the predictive model. External validation was conducted using another treatment group (n=46 patients) in Xuanwu Hospital.Results: Non-SLN metastases occurred in 42 of the 83 patients with positive SLNs (50.6%). Multivariate stepwise logistic regression indicated that the risk factors were age (P=0.032), number of positive SLNs (P=0.020), number of negative SLNs (P=0.011), resected tumor size (P=0.038), and monocyte count (P=0.012). A predictive model was developed and virtualized by nomogram using these five risk factors. The AUC of our nomogram was 0.867, which was significantly higher than that of the MSKCC model. DCA also showed a superior clinical value for our novel nomogram. After 10-fold cross-validation with 400 times repetitions, the AUC of our model was still 0.830. External validation of our model showed an AUC of 0.727. The model was well-calibrated in the internal and external validation series. Conclusions: A five-factor nomogram was developed for predicting non-SLN metastases in early-stage breast cancer patients. This novel tool exhibited good accuracy and could assist clinicians with intraoperative decisions in breast cancer patients with positive SLNs.

TI  - Evolution of environmental quality and its response to human disturbances of the urban agglomeration in the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased human disturbances have disturbed the global ecosystem at various scales. A growing need exists for effective techniques that can be used to quantify human disturbances and detect the resulting spatial and temporal variations in ecological status. Remote sensing can be used as an effective means to detect changes in environmental quality. Consequently, this study employed multi-source remote sensing data and principal component analysis (PCA) to create a remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) and a human footprint index used to clarify the human disturbances intensity (HDI). Then, unary linear regression was used to evaluate the change trends of HDI and the RSEI; spatial autocorrelation analysis and correlation analysis were used to reveal the evolution characteristics of environmental quality and its response to human disturbances of the Urban Agglomeration in the Northern Slope of the Tianshan Mountains (UANST) from 2000 to 2020. The results show the following: (1) An RSEI is applicable to both medium- and large-scale regions and can be used to effectively quantify and reveal the environmental quality of the UANST. (2) From 2000 to 2020, the annual average RSEI of UANST was 0.29, with the environmental quality graded as poor for more than 40% of the region. Although high proportions of the UANST were ranked as having poor and fair environmental quality, the overall trend was toward increasing the areas with good and excellent grades. The spatial characteristics of environmental quality showed that the environment was generally better in the central area and poorer in the northern and southern areas. (3) From 2000 to 2020, the HDI in the majority of the UANST was low but showed an increase over time and gradually attenuated from the city center to the edge of each county. (4) A significant positive correlation was found between environmental quality and human disturbances in the cropland area in the central part of the UANST, while a significant negative correlation was found in the surrounding urban areas of cities, in counties or rural residential areas, and some areas of scattered grasslands.

TI  - Retrieval of oceanic chlorophyll concentration from GOES-R Advanced Baseline Imager using deep learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Data of chlorophyll (Chl-a) concentration obtained from polar-orbiting ocean color satellite sensors are subject to major spatial and temporal gaps in data coverage owing to the intrinsically low sampling frequency that coincides with adverse conditions such as cloud obstruction. Such gaps can be minimized with geostationary satellites owing to their higher scanning frequency over a given region, allowing more sampling opportunities as clouds move. However, geostationary ocean color missions have not been available for most regions of the globe. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) aboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R series (GOES-R) is a potential alternative for the U.S. owing to improved signal-to-noise ratio compared with its predecessors. Nonetheless, retrieving [Chl-a] from ABI measurements is challenging; the number, placement, and width of its spectral bands are suboptimal and an "ocean-grade"atmospheric correction scheme is lacking. Here we describe the construction of a deep learning-based algorithm to derive [Chl-a] from GOES-16 ABI L1B radiance and ancillary data without an explicit atmospheric correction algorithm. A large (& SIM;22 million examples) training dataset of paired ABI observations and [Chl-a] estimates derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) were used to train, test and validate a 10-layer deep neural network model to retrieve [Chl-a] from ABI data. Preliminary results show that without atmospheric correction but with the aid of deep learning, it is possible to detect open ocean features with strong contrast such as across eddies and fronts, but there are still significant issues in coastal waters and occasionally in the open oceans. In general, the ABI-derived [Chl-a] agrees reasonably well with VIIRS-derived values in the open ocean during 3-5 h of the day. The location of oceanographic features such as fronts and eddies in the ABI-derived [Chl-a] maps are also coincident with those obtained from traditional ocean color and sea surface temperature retrievals. The findings of this study demonstrate that deep learning is a powerful tool for capturing intricate patterns that are too subtle for traditional algorithms developed by humans, Furthermore, the utilization of GOES-R ABI has the potential to complement polar-orbiting satellite data and mitigate data gaps.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing accurate models of sugarcane yield mapping at fine-scale is of paramount importance and will benefit many aspects of managing growth and harvest of sugarcane crops. Here, we combined high-spatial-resolution multi-sensor (optical and microwave) remote sensing data to estimate sugarcane yield using two approaches. First, we retrieved the 10 m resolution vegetation optical depth (VOD) using C-band Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data via the water cloud model, then derived a combined VOD and Sentinel-2 derived green-red vegetation index (GRVI, a traditional vegetation index) time series. Second, we adopted the eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm to estimate total sugarcane production based on the aggregated mean monthly VOD and GRVI time series at the county scale. County-scale sugarcane yield data from 81 counties across Guangxi, China (2018-2020) were used for model training and testing. We then kept the trained bestperformance model unchanged to re-predict pixel-scale (10-m resolution) yield using VOD and GRVI images. A SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach was employed to test XGBoost knowledge regarding the mechanisms affecting yield. The main outcomes from this study were as follows. (1) The XGBoost model and VOD and GRVI time series unequivocally provided reliable and precise estimates of sugarcane yield, with a low relative error both at the county scale and at the pixel scale. (2) Predictions of sugarcane yield in the growing season using combined VOD and GRVI data yields high accuracy (R2 = 0.815) with specific spatial patterns of sugarcane yields for Guangxi province, and were feasible up to two months prior to harvest. (3) The SHAP model revealed that Sentinel-1 derived VOD data are important for predicting yield. This research portrays the benefits of combining VOD and GRVI data in automatic machine learning models for estimating sugarcane yield at high spatial and temporal resolutions.

TI  - Distribution and concentration pathway of particulate pollution during pandemic-induced lockdown in metropolitan cities in India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - To characterize the pollutant dispersal across major metropolitan cities in India, daily particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) data for the study areas were collected from the National Air Quality Monitoring stations database provided by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India. The data were analysed for three temporal ranges, i.e. before the pandemic-induced lockdown, during the lockdown, and after the upliftment of lockdown restrictions. For the purpose, the time scale ranged from 1st April to 31st May for the years 2019 (pre), 2020, and 2021 (post). Statistical distributions (lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma), aerosol optical thickness, and back trajectories were assessed for all three time periods. Most cities followed the lognormal distribution for PM2.5 during the lockdown period except Mumbai and Hyderabad. For PM10, all the regions followed the lognormal distribution. Delhi and Kolkata observed a maximum decline in particulate pollution of 41% and 52% for PM2.5 and 49% and 53% for PM10, respectively. Air mass back trajectory suggests local transmission of air mass during the lockdown period, and an undeniable decline in aerosol optical thickness was observed from the MODIS sensor. It can be concluded that statistical distribution analysis coupled with pollution models can be a counterpart in studying the dispersal and developing pollution abatement policies for specific sites. Moreover, incorporating remote sensing in pollution study can enhance the knowledge about the origin and movement of air parcels and can be helpful in taking decisions beforehand.

TI  - Comparison of long-term quality of life outcomes between endoscopic vacuum therapy and other treatments for upper gastrointestinal leaks
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background While endoscopic vacuum assisted closure (EVAC) therapy is a validated treatment for gastrointestinal leaks, its impact on long-term quality of life (QoL) is uncertain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of successful EVAC management on long-term QoL outcomes.Methods An institutional review board approved prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients undergoing treatment for gastrointestinal leaks between June 2012 and July 2022. The Short-Form 36 (SF-36) survey was used to assess QoL. Patients were contacted by telephone and sent the survey electronically. QoL outcomes between patients who underwent successful EVAC therapy and those who required conventional treatment (CT) were analyzed and compared.Results A total of 44 patients (17 EVAC; 27 CT) completed the survey and were included in our analysis. All included patients had foregut leaks with sleeve gastrectomy being the most common sentinel operation (n = 20). The mean time from the sentinel operation was 3.8 years and 4.8 years for the EVAC and CT groups, respectively. When evaluating long-term QoL, the EVAC group scored higher in all QoL domains when compared to the CT group with physical functioning (87.3 vs 69.3, p = 0.04), role limitations due to physical health (84.1 vs 45.7, p = 0.02), energy/fatigue (60.0 vs 40.9, p = 0.04), and social functioning (86.2 vs 64.1, p = 0.04) reaching statistical significance. Overall, patients who achieved organ preservation via successful EVAC therapy scored higher in all domains with role limitations due to physical health (p = 0.04) being statistically significant. In a multivariable regression analysis, increased age and a history of prior abdominal surgery at the time of the sentinel operation were patient characteristics that negatively impacted QoL outcomes.Conclusion Patients with gastrointestinal leaks successfully managed by EVAC therapy have better long-term QoL outcomes when compared to patients undergoing other treatments.[GRAPHICS]

TI  - The reflectance spectroscopy of ultramafic rocks from the Nagaland Ophiolite Complex, NE India: Convergence of spectroscopic and petrological analyses
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The mafic-ultramafic cumulate rocks and mantle peridotites of an ophiolite are excellent recorders of the geodynamic evolution of a fossil subduction zone. The spectro-radiometric absorption features of olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and serpentine, which are the dominant constituents of these ultramafic rocks, have emerged as essential tools for their identification. This study uses six different kinds of ultramafic rock samples - spinel lherzolite, spinel harzburgite, wehrlite, orthopyroxenite, olivine websterite, and dunite compositions from the Nagaland Ophiolite Complex, NE India. These are investigated with integrated petrographic, mineral and bulk rock compositional and reflectance spectroscopic studies to identify the constituent minerals. The study indicates that the most dominant olivine absorption features vary from 1038 to 1049 nm in Ni-poor ultramafic cumulates of wehrlite (Mg-# = 89, Ni = 355 ppm) and olivine websterite (Mg-# = 90.5, Ni = 361 ppm) to 1066-1097 nm in nickeliferous mantle peridotites of dunite (Mg-# = 87, Ni = 3658 ppm) and spinel lherzolite (Mg-# = 87, Ni = 2708 ppm) compositions. Reversal of the 625 nm reflectance maximum in olivine occurs for Ni concentrations in the mineral between 2200 and 2955 ppm. The low-Ca pyroxene (cf. orthopyroxene) species show characteristic absorption features at 902-926 nm in lherzolite and harzburgite samples and 918 nm in monomineralic orthopyroxenite. High-Ca pyroxene (cf. clinopyroxene) in most rocks records absorption features at 643-666 and 709-811 nm. The study also recognises major absorption bands at 1382-1400, 1913-1948, and 2304-2326 nm as indicative of secondary hydrous minerals as a product of alteration in the investigated rocks. The significance of major (Mg-Fe) and minor (Mn, Ni and Cr) element compositions of these ultramafic rocks to explain specific spectral signatures in olivine, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene is discussed. The findings are expected to aid the interpretation of remotely sensed data from terrestrial and extra-terrestrial bodies, mapping ultramafic cumulate and mantle peridotite rocks in remote, covered, and unmapped terranes of ophiolitic origin, and in the process, identification of fossil oceanic subduction systems.

TI  - The tone from the top: Editorials within the <i>Journal of Accountancy</i>
T2  - ACCOUNTING HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the tone of editorials published in the Journal of Accountancy. Drawing upon prior historical accounting and linguistic-anthropological research, the study proposes that editorials in practitioner journals like the Journal of Accountancy communicate an expressive tone to internal audiences. This tone from the top is important because it communicates a professional worldview to a geographically dispersed and somewhat heterogeneous readership. The study utilises computerised methods to identify the tone expressed about key topics in 46,189 sentence-level editorial utterances published in the Journal between 1916 and 1973. The analysis illustrates that topics involving external social actors, institutions and events were more likely to use a negative tone compared to the topics speaking about internal aspects of the profession. The study contributes to our understanding of professional accounting narratives by enumerating the topics that Journal of Accountancy editorials speak about, by illustrating how sentence tone varies depending on the sentence topic and by documenting how the prevalence of certain topics changes over time.

TI  - Prospecting and Mapping Iron Ore within the Niger-Benue Confluence Using Landsat 8
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) to map iron ore deposits around the Niger-Benue River Confluence in Nigeria. Radiometric calibration was used to improve the quality of the remotely sensed image. Band ratioing and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to identify the iron ore mineral deposits. While a geological map was used to validate remote sensing techniques, a geomorphological map was used to analyze the occurrence of iron ore spread over the landscape. The band ratio 4/2 result revealed that ferric iron oxides cover 35.03% of the study area specifically within Agbaja, Idibo, and Ayede communities. Band ratio 5/6 showed that ferrous iron oxides cover 31.56% of the study area, notably in Koroko and Kakun. Ratio 6/7 revealed that hydroxyls cover 14.53% of the study area specifically within Itakpe Hills. PC bands 2,4,5, and 6 show that 42.77% of the study is covered by iron oxide, while bands 2,5,6 and 7 reveal 48.58% area coverage by hydroxyl. Spectral reflectance signatures indicated that illinite, goethite, hematite, pyrite, and limonite as dominant iron ores. The relationship of the final alteration map superimposed over geological and geomorphological maps corresponds with existing mineralogical literature. While the study approach can be replicated, the study further recommends that iron ore prospecting activities should concentrate on the undulating plains, ridges, hills, and outcrops.

TI  - Application of fluorescence endoscopy with methylene blue dye and indocyanine green dual-tracer method in sentinel lymph node biopsy for women with breast cancer
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Indocyanine green (ICG) allows for the real-time visualization of lymphatic drainage and provides favorable performance for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. However, the limited ability of tissue penetration of the near-infrared fluorescence of ICG may lead to the failure of lymph node detection in the traditional open approach of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for breast cancer, especially in overweight or obese patients. To accurately and quickly detect SLNs, we applied fluorescence endoscopy with a dual-tracer method using ICG and methylene blue dye (MBD) in SLNB for breast cancer. We conducted this study to assess the feasibility and application value of this method in minimally invasive surgery. Methods: A total of 117 patients who received dual-tracer injection of ICG and MBD prior to endoscopic SLNB from November 2020 to September 2021 were examined in this study. The number of SLNs identified, the SLN identification rate, the time to identify the first SLN, the procedure duration, and the postoperative morbidity were analyzed. Results: Biopsied SLNs could be identified in 116 patients (99.15%) with an average number of 5.12 +/- 1.87 per patient. Blue-stained SLNs were found in 99 patients (84.62%) and fluorescent SLNs in 112 patients (95.73%). A total of 34 patients (29.06%) had positive SLNs. In 6 cases (5.13%), the positive SLNs were only stained with ICG fluorescence. In 1 case (0.85%), the positive SLNs were only blue-stained with no fluorescence staining. The mean durations for the identification of the first SLN and endoscopic SLNB were 7.14 +/- 6.31 and 37.75 +/- 16.94 min, respectively. Upper-limb lymphoedema was observed 5 cases (4.27%) during a median follow-up period of 10 months. Conclusions: The fluorescence endoscopy method assisted by dual tracer facilitates SLN detection with a comparatively short procedure duration and low complication rate. This approach could serve as a new method for SLNB for patients with breast cancer.

TI  - First evaluation of fire severity retrieval from PRISMA hyperspectral data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The unprecedented availability of spaceborne hyperspectral data has great potential to provide fire severity estimates that align with post-fire management needs, overcoming complex logistics and data acquisition costs of airborne hyperspectral sensors, and the suboptimal sensitivity of broadband data to several post-fire ground components. We analyzed the feasibility of the PRISMA mission -one of the first spaceborne spectrometers operationally active- to assess fire severity by leveraging hyperspectral data dimensionality through the retrieval of sub-pixel components directly related to fire severity in the field. Multispectral data provided by Sentinel-2, commonly used in fire severity quantitative assessments, were used as a benchmark method. Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) was used to retrieve fractional cover of char, photosynthetic vegetation (PV), as well as non-photosynthetic vegetation and soil (NPVS) from post-fire PRISMA Level 2D and Sentinel-2 Level 2A scenes in one of the largest wildfires ever recorded in the western Mediterranean Basin. Ground-truth data were obtained using the Composite Burn Index (CBI) to procure three field-measured severity metrics: vegetation, soil and site. The relationship between the CBI data on a continuum scale and the cover of char, PV and NPVS image fractions retrieved from PRISMA and Sentinel-2 was assessed through Random Forest regression (RFR). Likewise, Ordinal Forests (OF) algorithm was used to classify categorized CBI data (low, moderate and high fire severity). PRISMA-based RFR fire severity estimates at vegetation, soil and site levels (R2 = 0.64-0.79 and RMSE = 0.33-0.41) outperformed those of Sentinel-2 (R2 = 0.27-0.53 and RMSE = 0.54-0.60), and were in line with previous studies using airborne hyperspectral sensors at higher spatial resolution. Fire severity underestimation for high field CBI values was almost unnoticeable in the PRISMA estimates. Categorical fire severity, not currently estimated using hyperspectral data but with high interest in post-fire management, were accurately predicted by PRISMA-based OF classification, with consistent user's and producer's accuracy for each fire severity category. The high confusion between moderate and low/high fire severity categories, typical when unmixing broadband multispectral data, was overcome by the PRISMA-based classification scheme. Our results suggest that new spaceborne spectrometer missions can support reliable fire severity assessments equivalent to airborne spectrometers, but readily applicable to large-scale assessments of extreme wildfire events.

TI  - Strategies for regional modeling of surface mass balance at the Monte Sarmiento Massif, Tierra del Fuego
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates strategies for calibration of surface mass balance (SMB) models in the Monte Sarmiento Massif (MSM), Tierra del Fuego, with the goal of achieving realistic simulations of the regional SMB. Applied calibration strategies range from a local single-glacier calibration to a regional calibration with the inclusion of a snowdrift parameterization. We apply four SMB models of different complexity. In this way, we examine the model transferability in space, the benefit of regional mass change observations and the advantage of increasing the complexity level regarding included processes. Measurements include ablation and ice thickness observations at Schiaparelli Glacier as well as elevation changes and flow velocity from satellite data for the entire study site. Performance of simulated SMB is validated against geodetic mass changes and stake observations of surface melting. Results show that transferring SMB models in space is a challenge, and common practices can produce distinctly biased estimates. Model performance can be significantly improved by the use of remotely sensed regional observations. Furthermore, we have shown that snowdrift does play an important role in the SMB in the Cordillera Darwin, where strong and consistent winds prevail. The massif-wide average annual SMB between 2000 and 2022 falls between -0.28 and -0.07 m w.e. yr(-1), depending on the applied model. The SMB is mainly controlled by surface melting and snowfall. The model intercomparison does not indicate one obviously best-suited model for SMB simulations in the MSM.

TI  - Differential analysis of landscape patterns of land cover products in tropical marine climate zones - A case study in Malaysia
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover in tropical marine climate zones is important for global climate change. The existing analysis of land cover product consistency mainly focuses on a continental or national scale and rarely takes different geographical zones (such as tropical marine climate zones) as examples to carry out micro-interpretation from the perspective of ecology from the grid scale. In fact, some types of land cover under different zones have poor accuracy due to the standard of cognition and the complexity of the spatial pattern of ground objects. In addition, land cover and its change in tropical Marine climate zones will affect the greenhouse effect, energy balance, water transport, and so on, thus affecting climate change on a regional or even global scale. Therefore, this article presents an evaluation based on GLOBCOVER, CCI LC, and MCD12Q1 data using Malaysia as a case study, through area composition similarity, field sample point validation, and landscape indices. The results showed that (1) the area correlation coefficient between GLOBCOVER and CCI LC is the highest at 0.998. (2) The CCI LC had the highest OA and kappa coefficient of 59.01% and 0.4957, while the GLOBCOVER product had the lowest OA and kappa coefficient of 49.24% and 0.3614, respectively. (3) The consistency of the water landscape index is high between the CCI LC and GLOBCOVE data, the consistency of the artificial surfaces landscape index is high between the CCI LC and MCD12Q1 products, and the consistency of the grassland/shrubland landscape index is high between the GLOBCOVE and MCD12Q1 products. The results of microscopic landscape patterns show that the three product landscape patterns are generally more consistent in East Malaysia than in West Malaysia. The low accuracy of grassland, bareland, and shrubland is the key reason for the wide variation in landscape patterns between the three products.

T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CHILDHOOD EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - To date, no measure of perceptions reflecting the view of childhood as a social construction exists within the fields of developmental psychology or education. The aim of this small-scale study was to develop items to assess beliefs about children along a spectrum - at one end of the spectrum conceptualizing children as human beings and at the other end of the spectrum conceptualizing children as human becomings-and to determine if factor analysis could be used to identify underlying constructs to develop a scale suitable for research and practitioner use. Factor analysis identified three subscales, defined as Present-Future Emphasis, Response to Child's Worldview, and Value in Society. The study presents a promising tool. Further research with a larger sample of participants can verify if the factor solution can be replicated to demonstrate generalizability.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study introduces an automated approach for extracting water bodies from satellite images using the Faster R-CNN algorithm. The approach was tested on two datasets consisting of water body images collected from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 (OLI) satellite images, totaling over 3500 images. The results showed that the proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 98.7% and 96.1% for the two datasets, respectively. This is significantly higher than the accuracy achieved by the convolutional neural network (CNN) approach, which achieved 96% and 80% for the two datasets, respectively. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately mapping water bodies from satellite imagery. Additionally, the Sentinel-2 dataset performed better than the Landsat dataset in both the Faster R-CNN and CNN approaches for water body extraction.

TI  - A common framework to model recovery in disturbed tropical forests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Despite their exceptional biodiversity and carbon stocks, more than 80% of tropical forests are disturbed. However, a lot of interrogations remain around the ability of vegetation attributes in tropical forests to recover from the various anthropogenic disturbances coexisting in many tropical landscapes. While these different disturbances are usually studied separately, this work provides, for the first time, a common modelling framework of vegetation attribute recovery in differently disturbed forests.2. We develop an original Bayesian hierarchical model of recovery trajectories, considering disturbed forests in a common framework, through a disturbance intensity gradient. As a case study, we test our modelling approach on data from two long-term experiments, Tirimbina (Costa Rica) and Paracou (French Guiana), where forest permanent sample plots have been set up following selective logging (63.25 ha), agriculture (4 ha), and clearcutting+fire (6.25 ha).3. We build a modelling framework that stands out by: (i) its interpretability, with model parameters having a clear ecological meaning; (ii) its robustness, allowing to compare parameter values amongst ecological systems to ensure that predictions are ecologically sound; (iii) its versatility to consider disturbance intensity through postdisturbance changes in a structural variable, either as input data, or as a transformed parameter without requiring pre-disturbance monitoring; (iv) its flexibility to explicitly consider, and test, the effects on forest recovery of various disturbance types, along an intensity gradient, in a single integrative model.4. First conclusions drawn from our common framework underline the strongest above-ground biomass and diversity recovery rate offered by selective logging, compared to agriculture and clearcutting+fire, as well as the strong effect of disturbance intensity on taxonomic composition recovery.5. Considering disturbed forests in a common framework might help managers to know which disturbance types need to be firmly avoided, which intensity range makes human activities sustainable in forested environments, and where inexpensive natural regeneration should be favoured over active restoration, such as tree planting. Testing this framework with various monitoring tools to estimate disturbance intensity and model vegetation attribute recovery, i.e., with forest monitoring or remote sensing data, will be the next step to make it widely applicable.

TI  - Tris-homoleptic cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes based on oligothiophene-derived ligands as electron donors for organic solar cells
T2  - MATERIALS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Herein, two octahedral homoleptic tris-Ir(III) complexes namely Py3T3Ir and Py5T3Ir are designed from pyridine/oligothiophene hybridized cyclometalated ligands with different conjugation lengths. Py5T3Ir with enlarged conjugation shows bathochromic absorption, strengthened absorptivity in longer-wavelength region and lower-lying energy levels compared to Py3T3Ir. Moreover, Py3T3Ir bearing small-sized backbones presents stronger triplet characteristic with boosted phosphorescence and prolonged exciton lifetimes. Blending ZY-4Cl acceptor to construct all-small-molecule organic solar cells, Py5T3Ir performs evidently increased power conversion efficiency of 8.62% than 3.04% of Py3T3Ir. The pronounced improvement in photovoltaic performance is originated from the advantageous carrier dynamics and superior blend morphology. Our results indicate coordinated Ir complexes are expected as potential photovoltaic materials by judicious molecular design.

TI  - Evaluating established deep learning methods in constructing integrated remote sensing drought index: A case study in China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought seriously threatens the food and ecological security of most of the world's developing countries. Data-driven integrated agricultural drought index with remote sensing provides an effective tool to monitor, evaluate, and predict the agricultural drought. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive analytical work on taking the most effective machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods to construct such integrated drought index. In other words, it is still unclear whether the recent DL methods can improve inte-grated drought monitoring as compared with the currently widely used ML methods. Therefore, we critically evaluated the performances of four representative DL methods (represents the four currently popular DL network types) i.e., Entity Embedding Deep Neural Network (EEDNN), One-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Self-Attention Mechanism (SAM) and three widely used tree-based ML methods i.e., Cubist, Random Forest (RF), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), through con-structing a QuickDRI like integrated drought index (abbreviated as QuickDRI-China). About 30 years of mete-orological data, 14 years of remote sensing data, and various biophysical variables in China such as land use/land cover, available water capacity, irrigated agriculture, elevation, and ecoregion were employed in this study. Results showed that the EEDNN performed best, followed by the RF and LGBM, and then the other methods including the currently wide used Cubist, according to the station accuracy evaluations, spatial description evaluations, and responses to specific drought event. The tree-based ML methods such as RF and LGBM are still competitive in constructing the integrated agricultural drought index at the current stage. However, the higher accuracy, the smoother spatial description, and the more responsive ability of the EEDNN demonstrate great potential of DL methods. The future integrated agricultural drought monitoring with remote sensing should develop a specialized DL network for heterogeneous agricultural drought features.

TI  - Understanding indigenous people's traditional Chinese medicinal plants harvesting preferences to guide sustainable management
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - 1. Surging demand for medicinal plant products may lead to unsustainable harvesting practices, which could put pressure on wild populations. Yet little is known about indigenous harvesters' preferences on key traditional Chinese medicinal plant resources, and how these might affect sustainable use and management.2. We conducted a discrete choice experiment with over 900 native Tibetan harvesters in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan plateau in China, under a range of complex alternative livelihood, climate and environmental change, and land tenure and customs scenarios.3. We used random parameter logit model with broad heterogeneity to estimate local Tibetan harvesters' preferences and their willingness to harvest, and latent class logit model to explore distinct within-population groupings based on shared preferences, for designing possible interventions.4. We uncovered three key findings with important management implications for medicinal plants. When given a choice, the local harvesters preferred not to harvest any herbs. However, if they opted to harvest, they preferred to harvest flowers and seeds, as compared to roots, and tended to use wooden tool (over the use of bare hands and iron tool).5. Notably, the degree of compliance with village rules and customs, and ecological worldview interact with targeted plant parts and potential income from harvest to influence their harvesting preferences. Their choices were sensitive to scenario-based changes to livelihood options.6. Finally, our study revealed three distinct harvester groups with substantial heterogeneity. Specifically, two groups consisted of over 60% of the interviewed harvesters who appeared to have a strong preference for sustainable practices, while the remaining group lacks this tendency.7. Overall, our results shed light on the importance of understanding the drivers of harvesting preferences and the heterogeneity of harvesting practices among indigenous people and their cultural and sustainability leanings, providing crucial insights for future sustainable use and management of wild and economically important medicinal plants in the grasslands of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and other regions.

TI  - Spatial and risk factor analyses of vector-borne pathogens among shelter dogs in the Eastern United States
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Vector-borne infections pose significant health risks to humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. Domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) in the United States may be infected with and serve as sentinel hosts for several zoonotic vector-borne pathogens. In this study, we analyzed the geographical distribution, risk factors, and co-infections associated with infection with Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., Borrelia burgdorferi, and Dirofilaria immitis in shelter dogs in the Eastern United States.Methods From 2016 to 2020, blood samples from 3750 shelter dogs from 19 states were examined with IDEXX SNAP((R)) 4Dx((R)) Plus tests to determine the seroprevalence of infection with tick-borne pathogens and infection with D. immitis. We assessed the impact of factors including age, sex, intact status, breed group, and location on infection using logistic regression.Results The overall seroprevalence of D. immitis was 11.2% (n = 419/3750), the seroprevalence of Anaplasma spp. was 2.4% (n = 90/3750), the seroprevalence of Ehrlichia spp. was 8.0% (n = 299/3750), and the seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi was 8.9% (n = 332/3750). Regional variation in seroprevalence was noted: D. immitis (17.4%, n = 355/2036) and Ehrlichia spp. (10.7%, n = 217/2036) were highest in the Southeast while seroprevalence for B. burgdorferi (19.3%, n = 143/740) and Anaplasma spp. (5.7%, n = 42/740) were highest in the Northeast. Overall, 4.8% (n = 179/3750) of dogs had co-infections, the most common of which were D. immitis/Ehrlichia spp. (1.6%, n = 59/3750), B. burgdorferi/Anaplasma spp. (1.5%, n = 55/3750), and B. burgdorferi/Ehrlichia spp. (1.2%, n = 46/3750). Risk factors significantly influenced infection across the evaluated pathogens were location and breed group. All evaluated risk factors were significant for the seroprevalence of D. immitis antigens.Conclusions Our results demonstrate a regionally variable risk of infection with vector-borne pathogens in shelter dogs throughout the Eastern United States, likely due to varying distributions of vectors. However, as many vectors are undergoing range expansions or other changes in distribution associated with climate and landscape change, continued vector-borne pathogen surveillance is important for maintaining reliable risk assessment.

TI  - Characterization of elastoplastic behavior and retrieval of active zone depth for expansive soil slopes in the middle-route channel head of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, China, using InSAR time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Expansive soil is very destructive for light infrastructures, while the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), one of the most critical projects in China, has a considerable section constructed by it. The significant displacements by the expansive soil slope (ESS) lead to severe damage to the slope prevention in the SNWDP, possibly resulting in slope failure with no timely and appropriate preventive measures. In this study, taking the channel head of the middle route of the SNWDP (Henan, China) as a case, we employed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of 134 Sentinel-1 scenes spanning 2017-2021 to characterize the ground displacement on the ESS and, after that, retrieve the active zone depth (AZD) that is a significant parameter to determine the treatment depth. An elastoplastic deformation model under wetting and heating effects (EDWHE) is proposed to accurately interpret ESS's nonlinear deformation, considering the soil lags responding to wetting and heating. The results show that the excavated canal generally has positive LOS displacements, maximum to 18 mm/year, while the filled canal with negative, minimum to -25 mm/year. The InSAR results of our model show a significant improvement compared to traditional models and have a good agreement with GNSS observations. Besides, we find the movement pattern of the ESS sliding toward the slope toe, manifesting the potential risk of progressive landslide. Then, we derive the soil's elastic deformation by the EDWHE and observe that the elastic swelling and shrinkage become frequent and drastic in the monsoon season, which is the principal reason for the expansive soil geohazard. Moreover, we employ a time lag approach to retrieve the AZDs with high spatial resolution and clear distribution patterns. Our works provide a methodology to study ESS's behavior and give the possibility for detecting extensive expansive-soil geohazard and helping subsequent preventive measures.

AB  - PurposeTo describe the characteristics of National Institutes of Health (NIH) cancer survivorship grants funded over the past 5 years and identify gap areas for future efforts and initiatives.MethodsResearch project grants (RPG) funded during Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 to 2021 focused on cancer survivorship were identified using a text mining algorithm of words from the NIH Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization (RCDC) thesaurus with survivorship-relevant terms. The title, abstract, specific aims, and public health relevance section of each grant were reviewed for eligibility. Grants meeting the eligibility criteria were double coded to extract study characteristics (e.g., grant mechanism, study design, study population).ResultsA total of 586 grants were funded by 14 NIH Institutes from FY2017 to FY2021, and the number of newly funded grants increased each FY, from 68 in 2017 to 105 in 2021. Approximately 60% of all grants included an intervention study, and interventions most often focused on psychosocial or supportive care (32.0%). The most common primary focus of the grants was late- and long-term effects of cancer treatment (46.6%), and least often financial hardship.ConclusionsThe results of this portfolio analysis indicate overall growth in the number and breadth of grants over the last five years, although notable gaps persist.Implications for Cancer SurvivorsThis review of current NIH grants suggests a need for expanded research to understand and address survivor needs to ensure that the over 18 million cancer survivors in the United States have optimal quality of life and health outcomes.

AB  - BackgroundThis article presents the results of a long-term study of the impact of rotavirus vaccination in Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan is the first country in the Central Asian region to introduce rotavirus vaccination into the national compulsory vaccination calendar. The study aimed to evaluate the impact of rotavirus vaccination on hospitalizations due to all-cause AGE and RVGE in children < 5 years of age in Uzbekistan.MethodsDetection of rotavirus antigen was performed using Rotavirus-Antigen-IFA-BEST "Vector Best" kit (Novosibirsk, Russia).ResultsThe total of 20,128 children under 5 years of age were hospitalized in sentinel hospitals with a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis during the study period (2019-2020). Of this number of children, 4481 children (22.2%) were included in the study. Of 4481 children, 367 (8.2%) children tested positive for rotavirus. In our study, decrease in the rotavirus rate was noted in all age groups. The peak of rotavirus positivity occurred in the months of January and February.ConclusionThe average rotavirus-positive rate in the period (2019-2020) was 8.2% and the absolute percentage decrease was 18.1% compared to the pre-vaccination period (2005-2009) where the rotavirus-positive rate was 26.3%. The percentage of prevented cases averaged 68.8%.

TI  - School Leaders' Perspectives Implementing Whole School Restorative Practices Across Grade Levels: A Case Study of a School-Based Pilot Project
T2  - SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Whole school restorative practice (WSRP) calls for creating supportive, equitable schools, requiring broad systems change. This case study explores the journeys of three schools piloting WSRP in one Midwestern district and examines how school leaders designed and implemented within their school contexts. Schools were purposefully selected from within a three-year pilot project; data sources included annual interviews and focus groups with school leaders, and annual school reports. Each school developed a leadership team comprised of administrators and other staff who were knowledgeable of and committed to restorative justice principles. While grounded in common restorative principles, language, and approaches as part of their district's pilot project, school WSRP leaders simultaneously developed contextually-specific practices, including tailoring to learners' developmental stages. Overall, this study highlights the influential role of school leaders in navigating complexities that arise when working from a worldview that values human relationality and interconnection.Impact StatementIn this case study, school leaders' design and implementation of whole-school restorative practices (WSRP) reflected school-level contexts, including students' developmental stages, in alignment with restorative principles and values. Overall, this study highlights the influential role of school leaders in navigating whole-school change toward a worldview that values human relationality and interconnection. This study may inform how school psychologists, who often play a critical role in leading systems change initiatives in schools, can leverage their skills, knowledge, and experiences as part of WSRP leadership and implementation efforts.

TI  - Traditional ecological knowledge-based calendar system for sustainable seasonal grazing in the Pamir Mountains
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous mountain communities are on the cutting edge of environmental threats, their responses, and the preservation of traditional knowledge that ensures the harmony between the environment and sustainable resource use. In the context of seasonal grazing, a key livelihood activity in the eastern Pamir Mountains, this study aimed to document a traditional ecological calendar-like management system and scientifically validate its effectiveness. Through an ethno-ecological survey comprising focus group discussions and semi-structured in-terviews, we examined the variations in seasonal grazing practices based on ecological calendars. The study quantified and evaluated the indicators' efficacy in guiding these seasonal activities by analyzing time series satellite data of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Additionally, the research assessed the potential alterations required in the future under anticipated climatic scenarios (SSP126 and SSP585) using the random forest algorithm. The findings underscored the alignment between seasonal migration patterns, grazing as the primary seasonal activity, and spatiotemporal variations in vegetation phenology. Our analysis revealed that in the future local herders may need to spend more or shorter time in pastures at different elevation compared to present because of possible change in the phenology. Our findings demonstrate the high validity of this calendar system in local resource management, and with modification it would be equally important in the future under new climatic scenarios.

TI  - Survival impact of immediate complete lymph node dissection for Chinese acral and cutaneous melanoma with micrometastasis in sentinel nodes: a retrospective study
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) has become a critical part of standard surgical treatment for melanoma with no clinical metastatic evidence. However, for patients with a positive sentinel node, the MSLT-II and DeCOG-SLT trials have shown that immediate complete lymph node dissection (CLND) does not bring further survival benefits. There is still an argument among the Chinese population dominated by acral subtypes on whether CLND can be omitted. Thus, this study aims to investigate the impact of immediate CLND on relapse-free survival (RFS) in Chinese melanoma patients with a positive sentinel node. Patients with acral or cutaneous melanoma of clinical Stages I-II who received SNB procedure and were detected with nodal micrometastasis were retrospectively collected at Fudan University Cancer Center (FUSCC) from January 2017 to December 2021. The clinicopathologic features and prognostic factors for RFS were analyzed. Out of 381 patients who received SNB in the past 5 years, 130 (34%) cases with SN micrometastasis detected were included in this study. Ninety-nine patients underwent immediate CLND while the other 31 patients received observation alone. Among patients who received CLND, the non-SN(NSN)-positive rate was 22.2%. Most of the clinicopathologic factors were balanced well between the CLND and non-CLND groups. However, more patients in the CLND group were detected with BRAF and NRAS mutation (P = 0.006) and received adjuvant PD-1 monotherapy (P = 0.042) as well. There were slightly fewer N1 patients in the CLND group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.075). The study found no significant difference in RFS between the two groups (P = 0.184). Even for patients with the acral subtype (P = 0.925), primary T4 lesion (P = 0.769), or presence of ulceration (P = 0.249), immediate CLND did not bring more survival benefits. Immediate CLND did not bring further RFS benefit for Chinese melanoma patients with SN micrometastasis in real-world clinical practice, even for patients with acral subtype or more tumor burden such as thick Breslow invasion and ulceration.

AB  - Penetration depth of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signals over a desert is a key parameter to understand the internal properties of the desert. Existing approaches for obtaining the penetration depth require good quality interferometric SAR (InSAR) data of very short temporal and long spatial baselines. Such data are often difficult to obtain in a highly dynamic desert. We propose a new machine learning (ML) based approach for inverting penetration depth of SAR signals over large desert areas by jointly using InSAR, polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) and optical remote sensing data. First, SAR scattering parameters and terrain properties are determined based on PolSAR and Landsat 5 TM multispectral data and a DEM. The penetration depth of SAR signals over a small desert area is obtained based on methods such as using a scattering model. A random forest model is then used to establish the relationship between the SAR scattering parameters and site features, and the penetration depth, and then is used to derive the penetration depth over a large desert area. The approach is applied to calculate the penetration depth of ALOS-1 PALSAR L-band signals for a large part of the Kufra Basin, an area of about 60, 000 km2. The penetration depths of four types of typical landforms in area (i.e., sandy plains, paleochannels, rocks and man-made features) are discussed in relation to the geological and climatic conditions. The average signal penetration depths over the paleochannels, sandy plains, and rocks and man-made features are 2.84 m, 1.97 m, 1.21 m, respectively. It is found that the backscattering coefficient, dielectric constant, surface roughness and mineral composition are the most important parameters in determining the signal penetration depths. An interesting point is that the existence of hematite in the sand can increase the dielectric dissipation of the sand medium and shorten the signal penetration depth.

TI  - "AIST-2D": Results of flight tests and application of earth remote sensing data for solving thematic problems
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The idea of creating small spacecraft and constellations based on them, placed in low and medium earth orbits, has been formulated and widely used in the field of space systems development over the last two decades. To date, there are a large number of small satellites designed for remote sensing of the Earth.This paper describes the purpose and main technical characteristics of the small earth remote sensing satellite "AIST-2D". It also describes the progress of the flight tests and the results obtained with the few payloads. In addition, examples of the use of the received Earth remote sensing data to solve various problems are presented. Finally, conclusions are drawn on the interim results of the spacecraft's opera-tion and the prospects for the development of the "AIST-2" platform are described.The small spacecraft "AIST-2D" created in the shortest possible time (less than three years) is an exam-ple of successful implementation of a project to create a modern multifunctional spacecraft for remote sensing of the Earth. The experience gained in the development, construction, experimental testing and operation of the "AIST-2D" spacecraft opens up opportunities for the creation of a series of spacecraft based on the "AIST-2" platform with minimal costs and short production times, which will allow us to count on the creation of highly efficient space monitoring systems in the foreseeable future.& COPY; 2023 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

T2  - IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Range-Doppler model is a transformation that relates ground and Single-Look Complex SAR image spaces by knowing the instantaneous position and velocity of the sensor in its trajectory. Its instantaneous position and velocities are determined with the help of vectorial functions, which their precisions directly influence the accuracy of the range-Doppler model. Ephemeris data is one of the sources used for the estimation of temporal functions. Some reasons can cause uncertainty in the temporal function directly derived from the satellite navigation data. Ground control points are other alternatives for calibration of the range-Doppler model whose visual measurements are difficult in the mountainous areas of Sentinel-1 Single-Look Complex images due to their resolutions and distortions. The temporal functions of the range-Doppler model are refined through numerous control points extracted from the automatic matching between Single-Look Complex images and Digital Elevation Model. For this purpose, the radiometric and geometric similarities of the Single-Look Complex images and Digital Elevation Model in mountainous areas are first increased based on the initial range-Doppler model, and then their geometric discrepancies are compensated with the least-squares image matching method. The results indicated that the proposed method in mountainous areas could automatically compensate for up to 30 pixels errors and reach sub-pixel accuracies.

TI  - Predictive value of risk factors for prognosis of patients with sepsis in intensive care unit
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sepsis has emerged as a major global public health concern due to its elevated mortality and high cost of care. This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors associated with the mortality of sepsis patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and to intervene in the early stages of sepsis in order to improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality. From January 1st, 2021 to December 31st, 2021, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Huashan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, and The Seventh People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine were designated as sentinel hospitals, and sepsis patients in their respective ICU and Emergency ICU were selected as research subjects, and divided into survivors and non-survivors according to their discharge outcomes. The mortality risk of sepsis patients was subsequently analyzed by logistic regression. A total of 176 patients with sepsis were included, of which 130 (73.9%) were survivors and 46 (26.1%) were non-survivors. Factors identified as having an impact on death among sepsis patients included female [Odds Ratio (OR) = 5.135, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.709, 15.427, P = .004)], cardiovascular disease (OR = 6.272, 95% CI: 1.828, 21.518, P = .004), cerebrovascular disease (OR = 3.133, 95% CI: 1.093, 8.981, P = .034), pulmonary infections (OR = 6.700, 95% CI: 1.744, 25.748, P = .006), use of vasopressors (OR = 34.085, 95% CI: 10.452, 111.155, P < .001), WBC < 3.5 x 10(9)/L (OR = 9.752, 95% CI: 1.386, 68.620, P = .022), ALT < 7 U/L (OR = 7.672, 95% CI: 1.263, 46.594, P = .027), ALT > 40 U/L (OR = 3.343, 95% CI: 1.097, 10.185, P = .034). Gender, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary infections, the use of vasopressors, WBC, and ALT are important factors in evaluating the prognostic outcome of sepsis patients in the ICU. This suggests that medical professionals should recognize them expeditiously and implement aggressive treatment tactics to diminish the mortality rate and improve outcomes.

TI  - Multitemporal modeling and simulation of the complex dynamics in urban wetlands: the case of Bogota, Colombia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban wetlands are essential to the longstanding health and well-being of cities. Acknowledged as rich in biodiversity and highly productive ecosystems, they provide ecosystem services represented in aspects such as air purification, urban climate regulation, physical and mental health, recreation, and contemplation, among a wide variety of other goods and services on which the quality of life of the inhabitants of large cities such as Bogota depends largely. We used cellular automata to model and simulate urban wetland changes in Bogota, Colombia. The study applied the coupled Markov-Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model to simulate and analyze land use/land cover (LULC) change over 20 years. First, we used an orthomosaic (1998) and two WorldView-2 satellite images (2004 and 2010), to detect land cover changes. Then, using the artificial neural network FLUS module, we calculated the relationships between land classes and associated drivers and estimated the probability of occurrence of each land class. Finally, we applied Intensity Analysis to examine the observed and projected LULC change (1998-2034). Results indicate that gains in areas of crops and pastures are at the expense of wetlands. In addition, simulation outputs show that wetlands will likely represent less than 2% of the total study area in 2034, representing a 14% decrease in 24 years. The importance of this project lies in its potential contribution to the decision-making process within the city and as an instrument of natural resource management. Additionally, the results of this study could contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6, "Clean water and sanitation," and climate change mitigation.

TI  - Super-resolution reconstruction of sea surface pollutant diffusion images based on deep learning models: a case study of thermal discharge from a coastal power plant
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - While remote sensing images could convey essential information of surface water environment, the low spatial resolution limits their application. This study carried out a series of experiment tests of thermal discharge from a coastal power plant and constructed an image dataset HY_IRS, representing the transport and diffusion of discharged heated water in tidal waters. Two image super-resolution (SR) reconstruction models based on deep learning (DL), ESPCN and ESRGAN, were trained based on this dataset and then used to reconstruct high-resolution remote sensing images. It shows that the two DL models can markedly improve the spatial resolution of the surface diffusion image of thermal discharging, with the PSNR improved by 8.3% on average. The trained two models were successfully used to improve the spatial resolution of thermal infrared remote sensing SST images from Landsat8 TIRS, indicating that the SR model based on DL has a good effect and a crucial application prospect in the field of improving the resolution of pollutant diffusion remote sensing images.

TI  - Analytical framework based on thermodynamics to estimate spatially distributed surface energy fluxes from remotely sensed radiations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Limited surface observations of turbulent heat fluxes result in incomplete knowledge about the surface energy balance that drives the climate system. The highly parameterized surface energy balance models suffer from significant uncertainties. Remote sensing information of incoming and outgoing radiation fluxes are important input variables for turbulent heat flux models, though analytical solutions of surface energy budget from these variables are yet to be derived. Here, we developed a novel, purely physics-based analytical method grounded on the thermodynamic principle of maximum power. The approach derives the total turbulent heat flux only from the four inputs of incoming and outgoing longwave and shortwave radiations at the land surface, which are available from remotely sensed satellite data. The proposed approach does not use any parameteri-zation, unlike the existing surface energy balance models, and hence does not suffer from uncertainty due to the same. We validated our methodology with 102 eddy covariance observation stations around the globe with different land use land covers from FLUXNET2015 and available urban datasets. Based on monthly averages of the total turbulent flux estimates for the eddy covariance sites, we observed root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 23.2 & PLUSMN; 10.9 Wm-2, a mean bias error (MBE) of 11.9 & PLUSMN; 13.1 Wm-2 and R2 value of 0.86 & PLUSMN; 0.15. Using the satellite observations of radiation fluxes from CERES at a spatial resolution of 10, we obtained the global flux field of total turbulent flux (QJ) and land surface heat storage (& UDelta;Qs) fluxes. On validation of QJ with FLUXNET sites for six grids for different land use land cover, we found RMSE of 20.1 & PLUSMN; 7 Wm-2, MBE of 14.4 & PLUSMN; 9 Wm-2 and R2 value of 0.96 & PLUSMN; 0.02. Further, from the evaporative stress factor of GLEAM, which is based on microwave remotely sensed vegetation optical depth and root zone soil moisture, we have obtained spatially distributed global estimates of Sensible(H) and latent heat (LE). In addition, our analytical estimates address the distribution of residual energy associated with the surface energy balance closure problem driven by the land use land cover. The theoretical estimates of all surface energy balance components from remote sensing based observations will improve our understanding of surface warming for different land use land covers across the globe.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The detection of Urban Thermal Field Variance Index and Ecological condition was generally conducted based on the thermal remote sensing. This study aims to model the Land Surface Temperature (LST), Urban Heat Island (UHI), Urban Heat Hotspot (UHS), Normalized Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI), Enhanced Built-Up and Bareness Index (EBBI), Ecological Evaluation Index (EEI), Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) of Mekelle city, Tigray-Northern Ethiopia. The Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal InfraRed sensor (TIRS-1) bands were used. The results indicated that the mean LST was highest (38.69 degrees C) in the Semen sub-city. A total area of 33.4 Km(2) (30.56%) was classified as UHI dominantly located in the Semen sub-city. Moreover, about 38 Km(2) (34.61%) was characterized with the worst EEI. The UHS zones were covering a total area of 3.03 Km(2) (2.8%) and it is mainly concentrated in the Semen sub-city. In addition, the statistical relationship between LST and NDBI is negative and moderately strong (r = - 0.51, p < 0.001) due to the fact that most of the built-up area in the city is mixed with vegetation cover that cools the environment. We also found that an R-2 of 0.997 (p < 0.001) in all UTFVI indices. The multiple regression model result indicated that Pv, NDBI, and EBBI control LST negatively, whereas the LST, UTFVI, EEI and NDVI influences LST positively.

TI  - The (mis)identification of high-latitude dust events using remote sensing methods in the Yukon, Canada: a sub-daily variability analysis
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The observation and quantification of mineral dust fluxes from high-latitude sources remains difficult due to a known paucity of year-round in situ observations and known limitations of satellite remote sensing data (e.g. cloud cover and dust detection). Here we explore the chronology of dust emissions at a known and instrumented high-latitude dust source: Lhu'aan Man (Kluane Lake) in Yukon, Canada. At this location we use oblique time-lapse (RC) cameras as a baseline for analysis of aerosol retrievals from in situ metrological data, AERONET, and co-incident MODIS MAIAC to (i) investigate the daily to annual chronology of dust emissions recorded by these instrumental and remote sensing methods (at timescales ranging from minutes to years) and (ii) use data intercomparisons to comment on the principal factors that control the detection of dust in each case.Lhu'aan Man is a prolific mineral dust source; on 24 May 2018 the RC captured dust in motion throughout the entire day, with the longest dust-free period lasting only 30 min. When compared with time series of RC data, optimized AERONET data only manage an overall 26 % detection rate for events (sub-day) but 100 % detection rate for dust event days (DEDs) when dust was within the field of view. In this instance, RC and remote sensing data were able to suggest that the low event detection rate was attributed to fundamental variations in dust advection trajectory, dust plume height, and inherent restrictions in sun angle at high latitudes. Working with a time series of optimized aerosol optical depth (AOD) data (covering 2018/2019), we were able to investigate the gross impacts of data quality (DQ) choice on DED detection at the month or year scale. Relative to ground observations, AERONET's DQ2.0 cloud-screening algorithm may remove as much as 97 % of known dust events (3 % detection). Finally, when undertaking an AOD comparison for DED and non-DED retrievals, we find that cloud screening of MODIS/AERONET lead to a combined low sample of co-incident dust events and weak correlations between retrievals. Our results quantify and explain the extent of under-representation of dust in both ground and space remote sensing methods; this is a factor that impacts on the effective calibration and validation of global climate and dust models.

TI  - The Death of Vernacular Cosmopolitanism
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL FORUM
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The paper offers a mutliscalar appreciation of vernacular cosmopolitanism as changing across space, time, and networks of relations. Drawing on observations from the UK and Greece, I argue for an expanded understanding of vernacular cosmopolitanism to incorporate everyday appreciations of multiculturalism, tolerance, and social liberalism that are produced within specific socio-historical contexts. Proposing a theory of 'timespace' where epochs are structured by networks of potential relations, affects, bureaucracies, and prevailing ideologies that guide individual and collective actions, I argue that vernacular cosmopolitanism is no longer a prominent worldview in Western democracies. Freedoms to fully realise cosmopolitan ideals are intimately entwined with the structures and affects of a timespace, which gives momentum to, provides guidance, and inherently opens and closes doors to the types of life that can be pursued. In the UK and Greece, current affective structures present people with vastly different projects, recommended paths, and futures to aspire to. With the sharp turn to the right in the post-truth age, vernacular cosmopolitanism has receded at the grassroots level. I thus propose that vernacular cosmopolitanism is under attack as epochal change offers alternate prevailing worldviews.

TI  - Selective sentinel lymph node biopsy as a prognostic method in cutaneous malignant melanoma: a decade of experience
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - AimTo analyze the prognostic role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM).MethodsA retrospective study was conducted including patients with histologically proven and surgically resected MM with subsequent SLNB and clinical follow-up for at least 18 months. A survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method and univariate and multivariate Cox regression.ResultsTwo hundred and twenty-three consecutive patients (one hundred and one women) undergoing SLNB after MM diagnosis between 2011 and 2020 were included, ranging from 20 to 87 years (mean = 57.34 +/- 15.03 years). SLNB was positive for malignancy in 50/223 patients and post-SBLN staging was: Ia = 65; Ib = 40; IIa = 31; IIb = 27; IIc = 10; IIIa = 11; IIIb = 9 and IIIc = 30. Breslow (p < 0.001), Clark level (p = 0.001), mitosis rate (p = 0.001) and histologic type (p = 0.038) were associated significantly with the presence of lymph node metastases. SLNB result was a significant factor in overall survival (OS) (p < 0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (p < 0.001) showing a lower OS in patients with positive SLNB compared to those with negative. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that positive SLNB, lymphovascular invasion, and age were independents risk factor for OS and PFS.ConclusionIn our experience, and in accordance with the literature, detection of lymph node metastases by SLNB is a marker of tumor aggressiveness being associated with patient outcome.

TI  - Assessing the potential of Sentinel-2 imagery and spectroscopy for determining the origin of ancient artifacts in Khuzestan, Iran
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the spectral behavior of objects using remote sensing and spectroscopy can be used to identify the source of the raw materials. Therefore, this research first studied the spectral behavior and composi-tion of the ancient artifacts of the Ziggurat temple located in the Khuzestan province, southwest Iran, us-ing FieldSpec3 spectro-radiometer, The Spectral Geologist (TSG), the Prism software, and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis. A Comparison of the spectral curves and absorption features of the samples shows that the spectral behavior of brick and pottery samples differs mostly from that of soil samples. The next step was to examine the potential of Sentinel-2 images to classify the area using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier for detecting the origin of the raw materials utilized in the construction of the Ziggurat's brick and pottery samples. The SAM results showed that the raw materials originated mostly from outside the area, which are confirmed by the results of TSG and Prism software. Comparison of the XRD results with the SAM and TSG validated that XRD results confirmed the SAM re-sults. However, only some of the TSG similarity results were consistent with the XRD.

TI  - Effects of the built-up index and land surface temperature on the mangrove area change along the southern Sumatra coast
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove trees have a crucial role in providing habitat and breeding for various aquatic species and averting coastal erosion caused by strong waves, tidal surges, and storm surges. Currently, the mangrove area along the Sungsang coast in South Sumatra, Indonesia, has been degraded by human activities like agriculture, fish ponds, and other infrastructure developments. In this study, we used the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land surface temperature (LST) analysis for observing urban development and vegetation cover in the Sungsang mangrove area. This study aimed to analyze the effects of NDBI and NDVI on the LST change in the Sungsang mangrove area. Results revealed that the mangrove vegetation significantly reduced (by 23%) during 2013-2022 years, in contrast to the built-up development and the LST gradually increased. The area with a temperature value greater than 20 degrees C was characterized by mangrove degradation, expanding around the peripheral area. There was a strong positive correlation between LST and NDBI (r = 0.90, p < 0.01), and a moderate correlation between LST and NDVI (r = 0.74, p < 0.05). Thus, the built-up index greatly influenced the vegetation area within the study site. This study assists the authority in comprehending their recent mangrove status and promoting sustainable actions for mangrove vegetation and urban management.

TI  - The use of bands ratio derived from Sentinel-2 imagery to detect built-up area in the dry period (North-East Algeria)
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, the band rationing technique was used to expect accurate detection of built-up in a dry period over El-Eulma city (North-East Algeria). In this context, the VNIR Sentinel-2 bands were examined statistically over the study area. Consequently, two bands ratio (BR) which are mainly the blue-near-infrared (B2/B8) and the green-near-infrared (B3/B8), were selected to be used singly as input data, for the binarization process via the use of Otsu method. To evaluate the approach and find the optimal bands ratio for built-up detection in the dry period, the accuracy assessment was done, using the high-resolution Google Earth images as a reference map. Also, the results obtained were compared to the both built-up mapping resulting from the support vector machine (SVM) classification and built-up area index (BAI). The findings showed that the BR (B2/B8) works approximately similar to the SVM classification result. In contrast, the BR (B2/B8) works better than the BR (B3/B8) and BAI index; the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient of the first BR (B2/B8) are about 92,33% and 80,81%, respectively. In contrast, the (OA) and kappa coefficient of the second BR (B3/B8) are about 90,97% and 76,72% respectively, Meanwhile, the (OA) of the BAI index is about 89.33% and its kappa coefficient is about 74,80%. Therefore, the results present BR (B2/B8) as a simple automatic technique that could be suitable for mapping cities accurately in a dry climate, for better land use planning.

TI  - Multidimensional hydrological modeling of a forested catchment in a German low mountain range using a modular runoff and water balance model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sufficient plant-available water is one of the most important requirements for vital, stable, and well-growing forest stands. In the face of climate change, there are various approaches to derive recommendations considering tree species selection based on plant-available water provided by measurements or simulations. Owing to the small-parcel management of Central European forests as well as small-spatial variation of soil and stand properties, in situ data collection for individual forest stands of large areas is not feasible, considering time and cost effort. This problem can be addressed using physically based modeling, aiming to numerically simulate the water balance. In this study, we parameterized, calibrated, and verified the hydrological multidimensional WaSiM-ETH model to assess the water balance at a spatial resolution of 30 m in a German forested catchment area (136.4 km(2)) for the period 2000-2021 using selected in situ data, remote sensing products, and total runoff. Based on the model output, drought-sensitive parameters, such as the difference between potential and effective stand transpiration (T-diff) and the water balance, were deduced from the model, analyzed, and evaluated. Results show that the modeled evapotranspiration (ET) correlated significantly (R-2 = 0.80) with the estimated ET using MODIS data (MOD16A2GFv006). Compared with observed daily, monthly, and annual runoff data, the model shows a good performance (R-2: 0.70|0.77|0.73; Kling-Gupta efficiency: 0.59|0.62|0.83; volumetric efficiency: 0.52|0.60|0.83). The comparison with in situ data from a forest monitoring plot, established at the end of 2020, indicated good agreement between observed and simulated interception and soil water content. According to our results, WaSiM-ETH is a potential supplement for forest management, owing to its multidimensionality and the ability to model soil water balance for large areas at comparable high spatial resolution. The outputs offer, compared to non-distributed models (like LWF-Brook90), spatial differentiability, which is important for small-scale parceled forests, regarding stand structure and soil properties. Due to the spatial component offered, additional verification possibilities are feasible allowing a reliable and profound verification of the model and its parameterization.

TI  - A Comparison of Ankle Fractures Relative to Other Fragility Fractures: A Review and Analysis of the American Orthopaedic Association's <i>Own the Bone</i> Database
T2  - FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Ankle fragility fractures (AFX) continue to increase in the elderly population. There is limited knowledge of AFX characteristics compared to nonankle fragility fractures (NAFX). The American Orthopaedic Association's Own the Bone (OTB) is a fragility fracture initiative. This robust data set was used to examine and compare characteristics of patients presenting with AFX to those with NAFX. Methods: The OTB database contained 72,617 fragility fractures between January 2009 and March of 2022 and were reviewed in our secondary cohort comparative analysis. After exclusions, AFX accounted for 3229 patients and 54,772 patients were in the NAFX cohort. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression compared the AFX and NAFX groups concerning demographics, bone health factors, medication use, and prior fragility fracture. Results: AFX patients were found to have a higher likelihood to be younger (67.6 years old), female (81.4%), non-Caucasian (11.7%) and have a higher BMI (30.6) compared to NAFX. Prior AFX predicted the risk of a future AFX. The probability of an AFX increased with increased age and BMI. Conclusion: A prior AFX is independently predictive of subsequent AFX. Therefore, these fractures should be considered a sentinel event. These patients are more likely to have higher BMI, to be of female gender, non-Caucasian race, and are younger compared to patients with NAFX.

TI  - Mapping winter rapeseed in South China using Sentinel-2 data based on a novel separability index
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale crop mapping using remote sensing data is of great significance for agricultural production, food security and the sustainable development of human societies. Winter rapeseed is an important oil crop in China that is mainly distributed in the Yangtze River Valley. Traditional winter rapeseed mapping practices are insufficient since they only use the spectral characteristics during the critical phenological period of winter rapeseed, which are usually limited to a small region and cannot meet the needs of large-scale applications. In this study, a novel phenology-based winter rapeseed index (PWRI) was proposed to map winter rapeseed in the Yangtze River Valley. PWRI expands the date window for distinguishing winter rapeseed and winter wheat, and it has good separability throughout the flowering period of winter rapeseed. PWRI also improves the separability of winter rapeseed and winter wheat, which traditionally have been two easily confused winter crops. A PWRI-based method was applied to the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River Valley to map winter rapeseed on the Google Earth Engine platform. Time series composited Sentinel-2 data were used to map winter rapeseed with 10 m resolution. The mapping achieved a good result with overall accuracy and kappa coefficients exceeding 92% and 0.85, respectively. The PWRI-based method provides a new solution for high spatial resolution winter rapeseed mapping at a large scale.

TI  - Turbulent fluxes at kilometer scale determined by optical-microwave scintillometry in a heterogeneous oasis cropland of the Heihe River Basin
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations of kilometer-scale turbulent fluxes of sensible (H) and latent heat (LE) are required for the validation of flux estimate algorithms from satellite remote-sensing data and the development of parameterization schemes in the hydro-meteorological models. Since 2019, two sets of Optical and Microwave scintillometer (OMS) systems have been operated in the Heihe River Basin of northwestern China, one on an alpine grassland of upper reaches, another on an oasis cropland of middle reaches, to measure both the areal H and LE. Combined with the observations of eddy-covariance (EC) and meteorological tower systems in both sites, an improved procedure for OMS data processing is proposed. The newly proposed procedure especially improves the preprocessing of raw scintillation data, properly uses the current probably better Ludi et al. (2005) method in deriving meteorological structure parameters, and chooses the coefficients of similarity functions by Kooijmans and Hartogensis (2016) in calculating fluxes. Evaluated with the results of rather homogeneous grassland, the area-averaged H and LE over the heterogeneous oasis are then determined. Estimates of H and LE agree reasonably well with those obtained from EC in most cases. However, the most interesting is that LE over the oasis during the early crop growing stages is clearly larger than that of EC; while both agree well during the longer crop grown periods. Footprint analysis shows that, compared with EC, the OMS has clearly larger source area that contains a slight area of orchard and shelterbelts distributed near the light path, leading to larger LE during the early stages of crop growth. The area-averaged evapotranspiration (ET) over the oasis is then analyzed more acceptably, which varies from 3 to 5 mm day-1 depending on meteorological conditions during the 39 days of the crop growing period. These results are used to validate the Penman-Monteith-Leuning Version 2 (PML-V2) scheme.

TI  - MCHA-Net: A multi-end composite higher-order attention network guided with hierarchical supervised signal for high-resolution remote sensing image change detection
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection (CD) is the main way to detect changes in the Earth's surface features in a timely and accurate manner and to understand the interactions between humans and nature, CD is also an important scientific tool for supporting decision-making. Many convolution-based methods and Transformer-based methods have gained remarkable success in the field of CD with high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs) due to their powerful feature extraction capability and global information modeling capability, respectively. However, the diversity and complexity of HRSIs render CD methods constantly challenging, e.g., off-nadir angle imaging, seasonal turnover, and simultaneous changes in multiple feature types. Common convolution-based or Transformer-based encoding-decoding networks have a single way of data modeling and a low degree of feature fusion, resulting in poor applicability to different remote sensing data, poor recognition of different semantic targets, and limited accuracy. To improve the generalizability and detection accuracy of the network, we developed a composite higher-order attention network with multiple encoding paths named MCHA-Net. MCHA-Net has four encoding backbones, namely, the Siamese-learning path, Residual-learning path, and Transformer-learning path. Different encoding ways are equivalent to different thinking ends, and the integration can make the network have a stronger feature representation capability, forming a local-global-cross domain data modeling approach and making the network have powerful data sensing and mining capability. The decoding end aggregates the se-mantic information of each layer and integrates them into a unified linearized feature mapping module to achieve full modeling of the separability of information in the target domain. In addition, we propose a new higher-order attention mechanism to perform adaptive feature refinement for each layer of each encoding end, to guide the network in focusing on the targeted region and to guarantee the boundary integrity and internal compactness of the detection results. Moreover, we design a hierarchical network supervision schema that adds supervision signals at different feature abstraction levels to impose differentiated soft constraints on each layer of the network, ensuring high semantic consistency of features across layers and facilitating fast network fitting. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets (S2Looking, SVCD, and SYSU-CD) and one transfer application dataset (Google Dataset) show that MCHA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual interpretation and quantitative evaluation, and exhibits strong generalization and robustness against few-shot learning.

TI  - Characterization of thermal infrared medium- and short-term anomaly information from block to fault in mainland China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between satellite thermal infrared anomalies and earthquakes or fault activity has been studied for more than 30 years. In this study, five strong earthquakes (the M (S)6.1 earthquake in Biru, Tibet; the M (S)7.4 earthquake in Madoi, Qinghai; the M (S)6.0 earthquake in Delingha, Qinghai; the M (S)6.1 earthquake in Lushan, Sichuan; and the M (S)6.8 earthquake in Luding, Sichuan) that occurred on the western mainland of China over the past 2 years were studied. Based on monthly MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data and daily NOAA satellite longwave radiation data, the departure algorithm and the Robust Satellite Techniques (RST) algorithm were used to extract and analyze the characteristics of thermal infrared anomaly information for blocks and faults around the earthquake from different temporal and spatial scales. The results showed the following: 1) In the medium-term scale study based on monthly data, blocks near the epicenters of five earthquakes showed temperature increase anomalies of 1-6 months before the earthquakes; the areas of temperature increase anomalies were clearly controlled by the spatial distribution of the blocks, and earthquakes mostly occurred within blocks with frequent temperature increase anomalies. 2) In the short-term, thermal infrared anomaly feature tracking based on daily data meant that obvious thermal anomalies were also found. The thermal anomalies before the five seismic events all appeared within a period of 3 months before the earthquake, and there were multiple consecutive days of anomalies. The significant temperature increases generally occurred a month before the earthquake, and the distribution of the anomalies was mostly in the form of strips, which is basically consistent with the trend of the fault zone. The use of thermal infrared remote sensing data to summarize the dynamic evolution of thermal infrared anomalies of blocks and faults before strong earthquakes can provide a basis for the long-term monitoring of fault activity and seismic monitoring by satellite thermal infrared technology.

TI  - Diversified responses of vegetation carbon uptake to urbanization: a national-scale analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionUrbanization converts vegetated lands into impervious surfaces and often degrades vegetation carbon sequestration in urban ecosystems. At the same time, the impact on urban vegetation growth from urban expansion could be spatially diverse given different natural environments and urban management practices. MethodsHere we applied time-series remotely sensed images and analyzed the urban growth for all the prefecture-level cities across China during 2001-2019, and compared the impact of urbanization on vegetation carbon uptake proxied by MODIS (MOD17A2H) net primary productivity (NPP) on Google Earth Engine platform. ResultsThe result indicated that at the national scale, the carbon uptake flux in urban areas was only 19% compared to that in the nonurban vegetated counterparts. The total urban area expanded by 22% and the vegetation carbon uptake in the newly urbanized zones was averagely reduced by 16% during the period, but with high spatio-temporal heterogeneity among cities and with exceptions demonstrating even improved NPP, highlighting diversified responses of vegetation carbon sequestration to urban sprawl. The changes of vegetation carbon sequestration in response to urbanization were found to be spatially clustered. DiscussionWe conclude that urban land management strategies unique to cities may attribute to the diversified responses of vegetation carbon capture to urbanization.

TI  - Assessment of Spatiotemporal Variation of Agricultural and Meteorological Drought in Gujarat (India) Using Remote Sensing and GIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural and meteorological droughts are prominent natural hazards, and the risk associated with them has adversely affected rainfed agriculture with a more prominent impact in arid and semiarid regions. In the present study, two drought indices, namely vegetation condition index (VCI) for spatial and temporal monitoring of agricultural droughts and standardized precipitation index (SPI) for spatial and temporal monitoring of meteorological droughts, were utilized derived considering the 30 years of dataset between 1986 and 2015. The current study aims to use geospatial techniques to classify the onset and spatial extent of the VCI used in this study to monitor agricultural drought and assess the suitability of NOAA-AVHRR, derived VCI to monitor an agricultural drought at the regional scale. The SPI drought index has gained momentum in assessing drought severity, magnitude, and its geographical extent. One of the major advantages of using the SPI is that it can identify and monitor various types of dryness conditions at various time scales. The SPI index can consider daily, weekly, and monthly variations in precipitation across multiple time scales. The present study computes the meteorological drought indices in terms of SPI using rainfall data from the year 1986 to 2015 using a 3-month time scales. SPI at 3-month time scale was interpolated to show how drought patterns are spatially distributed and how severe they are during droughts and wet years. A correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate its effectiveness in quantifying the effects of drought on crop production. In addition, the SPI 3-month time series was used to assess drought risk in Gujarat. In this study, the crop yield anomaly index was also applied for the analysis of the association between precipitation and crop yield throughout wet and dry years. In this study, a significant correlation between NDVI and rainfall (r = 0.51), NDVI and crop yield anomaly (0.42), and SPI and crop yield anomaly (0.65) was observed. The findings show that the frequency of drought events varied on a complex drought during the study period. As a result of the combined drought risk map, 21.68%, 22.66%, and 30.26% of the study area were at risk for very severe, severe, and moderate drought conditions, respectively.

TI  - Establishing severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance in a sentinel hospital, Ireland, 2021 to 2022
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) accelerated development of European-level severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance. Aim: We aimed to establish SARI surveillance in one Irish hospital as part of a European network E-SARI -NET. Methods: We used routine emergency department records to identify cases in one adult acute hospital. The SARI case definition was adapted from the ECDC clinical criteria for a possible COVID-19 case. Clinical data were collected using an online questionnaire. Cases were tested for SARS-CoV-2, influenza and res-piratory syncytial virus (RSV), including whole genome sequencing (WGS) on SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive sam-ples and viral characterisation/sequencing on influ-enza RNA-positive samples. Descriptive analysis was conducted for SARI cases hospitalised between July 2021 and April 2022. Results: Overall, we identified 437 SARI cases, the incidence ranged from two to 28 cases per week (0.7-9.2/100,000 hospital catchment population). Of 431 cases tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 226 (52%) were positive. Of 349 (80%) cases tested for influenza and RSV RNA, 15 (4.3%) were positive for influenza and eight (2.3%) for RSV. Using WGS, we identified Delta-and Omicron-dominant periods. The resource-intensive nature of manual clinical data collection, specimen management and laboratory supply shortages for influenza and RSV testing were challenging. Conclusion: We successfully established SARI surveillance as part of E-SARI-NET. Expansion to additional sentinel sites is planned following formal evaluation of the existing system. SARI surveillance requires multidisciplinary collaboration, automated data collection where possible, and dedicated person-nel resources, including for specimen management.

TI  - [Relationship Between Urban Spatial Pattern and Thermal Environment Response in Summer: A Case Study of Hefei City].
T2  - Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - With the continuous expansion of cities, the land cover type of the region is transformed, a large number of natural landscapes are replaced by man-made landscapes, and the environmental temperature rises. The study of the response relationship between urban spatial pattern and thermal environment provides some guidance for improving the ecological environment and optimizing the urban spatial layout. Based on the Landsat 8 series remote sensing image data of Hefei City in 2020 and analysis platforms such as ENVI and ARCGIS, Pearson correlation and profile lines were used to reflect the correlation between the two. Then, the three spatial pattern components with the greatest correlation were selected to construct multiple regression functions to investigate the influence of urban spatial pattern on urban thermal environment and its mechanism of action. The results showed that:① the high temperature area of Hefei City increased significantly with the advance of time during 2013-2020. For different seasons, the urban heat island effect showed that summer>autumn>spring>winter. ② In the central urban area, the building occupancy, building height, imperviousness occupancy, and population density were significantly higher than those in the suburbs, whereas fractional vegetation coverage presented a higher suburban than urban area and mainly showed a point distribution in the urban area and an irregular distribution of water bodies. ③ The urban high-temperature zone was mainly distributed in various development zones in urban areas, whereas other places in urban areas were dominated by medium-high temperature and above-temperature zoning, and suburban areas were dominated by medium-low temperature. ④ The Pearson coefficients between the spatial pattern of each element and the thermal environment were positively correlated with the building occupancy (0.395), impervious surface occupancy (0.333), population density (0.481), and building height (0.188) and negatively correlated with fractional vegetation coverage (-0.577) and water occupancy (-0.384). The coefficients of the constructed multiple regression functions, including building occupancy, population density, and fractional vegetation coverage, were 8.372, 0.295, and -5.639 respectively, with a constant of 38.555. The results of this study can provide a reference basis for optimizing urban spatial layouts and improving urban living quality.

TI  - Response in axillary lymph nodes to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancers: correlation with breast response, pathologic features, and accuracy of radioactive seed localization
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesThis study examined the accuracy of radioactive seed localization (RSL) of lymph nodes (LNs) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for invasive breast carcinoma, recorded pathologic features of LNs following NAC, evaluated concordance of response between breast and LNs, and identified clinicopathologic factors associated with higher risk of residual lymph node involvement.MethodsClinical records, imaging, and pathology reports and slides were retrospectively reviewed for 174 breast cancer patients who received NAC. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare differences in risk of residual lymph node disease.ResultsRetrieval of biopsied pre-therapy positive LN was confirmed in 86/93 (88%) cases overall, and in 75/77 (97%) of cases utilizing RSL. Biopsy clip site was the best pathologic feature to confirm retrieval of a biopsied lymph node. Pre-therapy clinical N stage > 0, positive pre-therapy lymph node biopsy, estrogen and progesterone receptor positivity, Ki67 < 50%, HR + /HER2- tumors, and residual breast disease had higher likelihood of residual lymph node disease after NAC (p < 0.001).ConclusionsRSL-guided LN excision improves retrieval of previously biopsied LNs following NAC. The pathologist can use histologic features to confirm retrieval of targeted LNs, and tumor characteristics can be used to predict a higher risk of residual LN involvement.

TI  - Revealing the environmental pollution of two estuaries through histopathological biomarkers in five fishes from different trophic guilds of northeastern Brazil
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuaries in Brazil are mostly anthropically affected due to the discharge of industrial and domestic effluents. In two of them, the Santa Cruz Channel Estuary (ITAP) and Sirinhae & PRIME;m River Estuary (SIR), historically affected by mercury pollution and sugarcane industry in Northeast Brazil, we assessed environmental pollution using liver and gill histopathological biomarkers in fish from different trophic levels. Liver samples exhibited serious damages such as hepatic steatosis, necrosis, and infiltration. The gills showed moderate to severe changes, such as lifting of epithelial cells, lamellar aneurysm, and rupture of lamellar epithelium. Most of the changes in the liver and gills were reported for species Centropomus undecimalis and the Gobionellus stomatus, which were considered as good sentinels of pollution. The combination of biomarker methodologies was efficient in diagnosing the serious damage to the species, reinforcing the need for monitoring the health of the ecosystems evaluated.

TI  - Sustainable marketing: an exploratory study of a sustain-centric, versus profit-centric, approach
T2  - BUSINESS AND SOCIETY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - As the need for business to address pressing social and ecological issues intensifies, so does the importance of enhancing the development of sustainable marketing. The current dominant approach to sustainable marketing is based on a Triple Bottom Line (TBL) profit-centric worldview, which suggests that firms can simultaneously improve their financial well-being as they reduce negative social and ecological externalities. However, whereas the scope of TBL marketing is limited to sustainability initiatives that enhance profits, there is a growing need for-and interest in-developing a sustain-centric approach to marketing that relaxes the need to maximize financial well-being in order to optimize social and ecological well-being. Even so, because of the dominance of the profit-centric worldview, hallmarks of sustain-centric marketing practices remain under-developed and may even lend themselves to becoming inauthentically mimicked on a piecemeal basis by greenwashing profit-centric firms. We provide an exploratory empirical study of marketing practices evident in two sustain-centric firms and draw implications to advance theory for both sustain-centric and profit-centric marketing.

TI  - Use of sentinel lymph node biopsy in elderly patients with breast cancer-10-year experience from a Swiss university hospital
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe Choosing Wisely initiative recommended the omission of routine sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients >= 70 years of age, with clinically node-negative, early stage, hormone receptor (HR) positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) negative breast cancer in August 2016. Here, we assess the adherence to this recommendation in a Swiss university hospital.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective single center cohort study from a prospectively maintained database. Patients >= 18 years of age with node-negative breast cancer were treated between 05/2011 and 03/2022. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients in the Choosing Wisely target group who underwent SLNB before and after the initiative went live. Statistical significance was tested using chi-squared test for categorical and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables.ResultsIn total, 586 patients met the inclusion criteria with a median follow-up of 2.7 years. Of these, 163 were >= 70 years of age and 79 were eligible for treatment according to the Choosing Wisely recommendations. There was a trend toward a higher rate of SLNB (92.7% vs. 75.0%, p = 0.07) after the Choosing Wisely recommendations were published. In patients >= 70 years with invasive disease, fewer received adjuvant radiotherapy after omission of SLNB (6.2% vs. 64.0%, p < 0.001), without differences concerning adjuvant systemic therapy. Both short-term and long-term complication rates after SLNB were low, without differences between elderly patients and those < 70 years.ConclusionsChoosing Wisely recommendations did not result in a decreased use of SLNB in the elderly at a Swiss university hospital.

TI  - Flaring latitudes in ensembles of low-mass stars
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of small-scale magnetic fields in stellar photospheres is an important ingredient in our understanding of the magnetism of low-mass stars. Their spatial distribution connects the field generated in the stellar interior with the outer corona and the large scale field, and thereby affects the space weather of planets. Unfortunately, we lack techniques that can locate them on most low-mass stars. One strategy is to localize field concentrations using the flares that occur in their vicinity. We explore a new method that adapts the spot simulation software fleck to study the modulation of flaring times as a function of active latitude. We use empirical relations to construct flare light curves similar to those available from Kepler and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), search them for flares, and use the waiting times between flares to determine the location of active latitudes. We find that the mean and standard deviations of the waiting time distribution provide a unique diagnostic of flaring latitudes as a function of the number of active regions. Latitudes are best recovered when stars have three or less active regions that flare repeatedly, and active latitude widths below 20 deg; when either increases, the information about the active latitude location is gradually lost. We demonstrate our technique on a sample of flaring G dwarfs observed with the Kepler satellite, and furthermore suggest that combining ensemble methods for spots and flares could overcome the limitations of each individual technique for the localization of surface magnetic fields.

TI  - Predictors of sentinel lymph node metastasis in very thin invasive melanomas
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nodal positivity has prognostic significance for very thin melanomas. In our cohort, the rate of nodal positivity was 5% overall in these patients who underwent SLNB, which significantly affected survival. Specific tumour factors (e.g. lymphovascular invasion, ulceration, mitoses, nodular subtype) were associated with higher rates of SLN metastases. In addition, the presence of two or more of these features was associated with worse survival. This should be used to guide clinicians in choosing which patients will benefit from SLNB.Background Melanomas < 0.8 mm in Breslow depth have less than a 5% risk for nodal positivity. Nonetheless, nodal positivity is prognostic for this group. Early identification of nodal positivity may improve the outcomes for these patients. Objectives To determine the degree to which ulceration and other high-risk features predict sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity for very thin melanomas. Methods The National Cancer Database was reviewed from 2012 to 2018 for patients with melanoma with Breslow thickness < 0.8 mm. Data were analysed from 7 July 2022 through to 25 February 2023. Patients were excluded if data regarding their ulceration status or SLN biopsy (SLNB) performance were unknown. We analysed patient, tumour and health system factors for their effect on SLN positivity. Data were analysed using & chi;(2) tests and logistic regressions. Overall survival (OS) was compared by Kaplan-Meier analyses. Results Positive nodal metastases were seen in 876 (5.0%) patients who underwent SLNB (17 692). Factors significantly associated with nodal positivity on multivariable analysis include lymphovascular invasion [odds ratio (OR) 4.5, P < 0.001], ulceration (OR 2.6, P < 0.001), mitoses (OR 2.1, P < 0.001) and nodular subtype (OR 2.1, P < 0.001). Five-year OS was 75% and 92% for patients with positive and negative SLN, respectively. Conclusions Nodal positivity has prognostic significance for very thin melanomas. In our cohort, the rate of nodal positivity was 5% overall in these patients who underwent SLNB. Specific tumour factors (e.g. lymphovascular invasion, ulceration, mitoses, nodular subtype) were associated with higher rates of SLN metastases and should be used to guide clinicians in choosing which patients will benefit from SLNB.

TI  - Spatial estimation of soil erosion risk using RUSLE model in District Swat Eastern Hindu Kush, Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a natural geomorphic process having the potential to damage fertile land. In this study, soil erosion risk is spatially estimated in District Swat by applying Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). The RUSLE parameters that trigger soil erosion including rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, topography, cover management, and support practices were derived from monthly rainfall data obtained from Pakistan Metrology Department, soil texture map from Soil Survey of Pakistan and Digital Soil Map of the World database, land use land cover extracted from SPOT 5 satellite image, whereas slope and digital terrain extracted from Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM). It was found from the analysis that out of the total reported area, 34.5% falls in the area affected by very high soil erosion. The results of spatial pattern and erosion proneness of the study region have been further classified into very low (45%), low (8.5%), moderate (7%), high (5.2%), and very high zones (34.5%). The results show that the study area requires effective mitigation strategies to curtail the precious soil. This study has the potential to assist the decision making and planners for soil loss risk reduction.

TI  - Multidecadal changes in planform morphology of the confluence of River Niger and River Benue, West Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of 35 years (1987-2022) of time-lapse data derived from Landsat imagery and SRTM DEM has revealed significant changes in planform morphology at the confluence of the River Niger and River Benue in Lokoja, West Africa. In the study area, the Niger is flanked by high elevation plateaus of ca. 400 m altitude and low-lying floodplains on its western bank. The Benue is characterized by more abundant intra-channel and bankattached bars relative to the Niger. Over the 35-year period, a net downstream migration of 880 m was observed at the junction, its angle decreased from ca. 175 degrees in 1987 to 50 degrees in 2006 and to ca. 16 degrees in 2022 and showed varied segmentation patterns. We establish a linkage between this decrease in confluence angle and increase in annual runoff in the study area. Expansion along the banks of the Niger, Benue, and post-confluence channels was found to be low and non-uniform, suggesting varied resistance of the banks to erosion, which is linked to the abundance of vegetation. These decadal changes in confluence planform are important for understanding river confluence dynamics in major river systems around the world.

TI  - Incidence of harmful algal blooms in pristine subtropical ocean: a satellite remote sensing approach (Jeju Island)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the increasing numbers of red tide events in the pristine subtropical ocean, a paucity of previous observations has limited understanding of harmful algae in the seas around the Korean Peninsula. Therefore, using six years (2012-2017) of Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite data, we characterized the red tides around Jeju Island, a volcanic island located near the paths of the Jeju Warm Current and Tsushima Warm Current, using the Normalized Red Tide Index (NRTI) method. The seawater around Jeju Island has for a long time been considered to be very clear, with relatively low suspended particulate matter concentrations and few harmful algae. Nonetheless, the satellite-based NRTI detection method used in this study detected and supported the existence of red tides in the coastal region around Jeju Island. Analysis of the red tide distribution showed that red tide first began to appear near the western coast of Jeju Island, then developed in the northern and eastern coastal regions, and finally vanished in the eastern coastal region. The monthly averages of the NRTI demonstrated a bloom event from April to May in every year. Additional fall blooms were detected in August-September, particularly in 2013 and 2016. The NRTI revealed strong interannual variations. The longest blooms occurred in 2015, and the most comprehensive and strongest event occurred in the spring of 2016. The latter three years (2015-2017) had much higher NRTI than the former three years (2012-2014). The probability of red tide occurrence at a given point during the 6-year study period revealed spatial differences. Relatively high probability of 0.3-0.5 was determined along the northern coastal region, whereas low probability of less than 0.2 was found along the southern region. Ground truth data also showed more frequent observations and higher red tide cell densities along the northern coast. Changes in NRTI in spring are positively correlated with changes in ENSO indices in winter. This study is the first to use a satellite-based approach with a vast long-term satellite database to elucidate the existence and probability of red tides near Jeju Island. We anticipate that this study will provide a useful strategy for remote monitoring of harmful algal blooms over wide regions using optical data.

TI  - [Spatial Network of Urban Heat Environment in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration Based on MSPA and Circuit Theory].
T2  - Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has increased the complexity of the urban heat environment system, which has negative impacts on the health of the urban ecological system and the human habitat. By combining theories and technologies such as geographic information systems, remote sensing, morphological spatial pattern analysis, and circuit theory with data from MODIS land surface temperature production, urban heat island patches in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration were quantitatively identified in terms of their spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and their spatial and temporal transfer paths. This foundation revealed the geographical network structure of the urban heat environment as well as the spatial and temporal evolution process of critical corridors. According to the findings, urban heat island patches covered 16610 km2 in 2020, accounting for 7.68% of the study area. In the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, both the area and the number of urban heat island patches considerably increased between 2005 and 2020, going from being dominated by isolated island types of urban heat island patches in 2005 to being dominated by core types in 2020. In particular, the non-urban heat island patches, core type, and edge type of urban heat island patches in 2005 were the major ancestors of the core type and edge type urban heat island patches in 2020. In the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, there were more urban heat environment source sites, corridor length, densities, and present densities in 2020 than there were in 2005. The sensitive corridor was found to be the predominant type of urban heat island corridor in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration in 2020. The number of sensitive corridors increased the highest in the period from 2005-2020. As the coefficient of urban heat environment corridors increased concurrently, it was apparent that the urban heat environment corridor had a propensity to grow continuously in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration. The active adaptation and mitigation measures of the urban heat environment were proposed, and a spatial network model of the urban heat environment was finally provided. To adapt to, mitigate, and promote urban sustainable development risks, these research findings will serve as a paradigm for the identification of the urban heat environment spatial network actively and methodically.

TI  - Video-Assisted Endoscopic Inguinal Lymph Node Dissection for Acral Melanoma
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses acral melanoma, a rare subtype of melanoma often presented at the later stages of the disease and is, thus, associated with poor survival rates, especially in patients with a lower socioeconomic status. Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for localized acral melanoma, while amputation is often necessary for tumors on the digits or the midfoot. Lymphadenectomy may be necessary for patients with regional lymph node involvement; however, the therapeutic role of dissection remains controversial. Here, we present the case of a 68-year-old man with acral melanoma who underwent a Lisfranc amputation and endoscopic groin lymph node dissection for ganglionic metastasis. In Ecuador, this is the first reported case of endoscopic groin lymphadenectomy for regional lymph node metastasis secondary to acral melanoma. The discussion explores the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy and the completion of lymph node dissection in managing regional lymph nodes in melanoma patients. This case study aims to contribute to the growing knowledge on acral melanoma, assess the need for better patient care, and analyze the role of minimally invasive techniques for inguinal lymph node dissections.

TI  - Northern expansion is not compensating for southern declines in North American boreal forests
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is expected to shift the boreal biome northward through expansion at the northern and contraction at the southern boundary respectively. However, biome-scale evidence of such a shift is rare. Here, we used remotely-sensed tree cover data to quantify temporal changes across the North American boreal biome from 2000 to 2019. We reveal a strong north-south asymmetry in tree cover change, coupled with a range shrinkage of tree cover distributions. We found no evidence for tree cover expansion in the northern biome, while tree cover increased markedly in the core of the biome range. By contrast, tree cover declined along the southern biome boundary, where losses were related largely to wildfires and timber logging. We show that these contrasting trends are structural indicators for a possible onset of a biome contraction which may lead to long-term carbon declines.

TI  - Discrimination and monitoring of rice cultural types using dense time series of Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Details about the spatial extent of rice cultivation in different seasons are essential for ensuring global food security as well as addressing environmental issues and climate change. This study aims to introduce a novel approach to discriminate between different rice cultural types and subtypes and identify their optimum stages to represent crop growth profiles using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Dense time series Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data were analyzed at 12 days intervals throughout the growth period of summer and kharif rice. Statistical analysis using ANOVA at 5% level of significance was conducted to identify the critical stages of discrimination for all cultural types and subtypes. Knowledge-based decision tree algorithm was employed to classify all major types of rice grown during summer and kharif season. A comprehensive analysis revealed significant variations in backscatter profiles among different rice types. The most critical period for effectively distinguishing between various rice cultural types and subtypes was found to be from transplanting to tillering stage. Decision tree algorithm was able to discriminate between rice cultural types and subtypes with high overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient, viz., 94.74% and 0.94 for summer rice and 91.80% and 0.90 for kharif rice, respectively. The findings of this study revealed that C-band co and cross-polarized Sentinel-1 data have the potential to detect differences between different cultural types and subtypes of rice and, therefore, will be helpful in crop growth monitoring and agro-ecological change detection in the cultivation pattern.

TI  - DUACS DT2021 reprocessed altimetry improves sea level retrieval in thecoastal band of the European seas
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 29 years of altimeter data have been recentlyreprocessed by the multi-satellite Data Unification and AltimeterCombination System (DUACS) and made available under the name of DT2021 through the Copernicus Marine Service (CMEMS) and the CopernicusClimate Change Service (C3S). New standards have been applied and variousgeophysical correction parameters have been updated compared to the previousrelease in order to improve the product quality. This paper describes the assessment of this new release through thecomparison of both the all satellites and the two satellites product with external in situ tide gaugemeasurements in the coastal areas of the European seas for a time periodfrom 1 January 1993 to 31 May 2020. The aim is to quantify theimprovements on the previous DT2018 processing version for the retrieval ofsea level in the coastal zone. The results confirmed that the CMEMS product in the new DT2021 processingversion better solves the signal in the coastal band. The all satellites dataset showed areduction of 3 % in errors when compared with tide gauges and of 5 % inthe variance of the differences between the datasets compared to DT2018reprocessing. Moreover, the all satellites dataset provided more accurate sea levelmeasurements when making a comparison with tide gauges with respect to the climatic two satellitesdataset due to the better performance of the former for the assessment ofhigher than climatic frequency signals. By contrast, the two satellite dataset is themost suitable product for the assessment of long-term sea level sea surface height (SSH) trendsin the coastal zone due to its larger stability to the detriment of the all satellitesdataset.

TI  - Estimations of Secchi depth from the turbid Eastern China Coastal Seas using MODIS data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a neural network-based Secchi depth retrieval model (NNSD) was developed using observations obtained during 2003-2012 in the Bohai, Yellow, and China East Seas (Eastern China Coastal Seas, ECCS). Based on the results of the analyses, the NNSD model produced less than 25% uncertainty in quantifying the Secchi depth in the optically complex ECCS. The slope of the linear relationship between the field-measured and NNSD model-derived Secchi depth varied from 0.98 to 1.08 among the datasets. However, the corresponding determination coefficients were not any lower than 0.91. To determine the effectiveness of the NNSD model in deriving the Secchi depth in the ECCS, the performances of the three existing models were also evaluated, and the results are presented in this study. By comparison, using the NNSD model decreased the uncertainty by 26% when compared with the three existing models in deriving the Secchi depth in the ECCS. Finally, the NNSD model was further applied to the MODIS data over the ECCS to briefly illustrate its applicability to general oceanographic studies. The NNSD model could produce 24.62% MRE and 0.14 RMSE values in deriving the Secchi depth from the ECCS, which was > 26% MRE and > 0.07 RMSE values better than all the BGSD, KDSD and SASD models. In regards to the spatial distribution pattern of the Secchi depth, the eastern and northern sections of the ECCS were much higher than the western and southern areas. Additionally, the temporal distribution mode indicated that the winter season was higher than the summer season. These spatiotemporal characteristics were caused primarily by the regional climate, river discharges, and strong tidal currents and winds, among other factors.

TI  - Evaluation and uncertainty analysis of Himawari-8 hourly aerosol product version 3.1 and its influence on surface solar radiation before and during the COVID-19 outbreak
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The hourly Himawari-8 version 3.1 (V31) aerosol product has been released and incorporates an updated Level 2 al-gorithm that uses forecast data as an a priori estimate. However, there has not been a thorough evaluation of V31 data across a full-disk scan, and V31 has yet to be applied in the analysis of its influence on surface solar radiation (SSR). This study firstly investigates the accuracy of V31 aerosol products, which includes three categories of aerosol optical depth (AOD) (AODMean, AODPure, and AODMerged) as well as the corresponding & ANGS;ngstrom exponent (AE), using ground -based measurements from the AERONET and SKYNET. Results indicate that V31 AOD products are more consistent with ground-based measurements compared to previous products (V30). The highest correlation and lowest error were seen in the AODMerged, with a correlation coefficient of 0.8335 and minimal root mean square error of 0.1919. In contrast, the AEMerged shows a larger discrepancy with measurements unlike the AEMean and AEPure. Error analysis reveals that V31 AODMerged has generally stable accuracy across various ground types and geometrical observation an-gles, however, there are higher uncertainties in areas with high aerosol loading, particularly for fine aerosols. The tem-poral analysis shows that V31 AODMerged performs better compared to V30, particularly in the afternoon. Finally, the impacts of aerosols on SSR based on the V31 AODMerged are investigated through the development of a sophisticated SSR estimation algorithm in the clear sky. Results demonstrate that the estimated SSR is significant consistency with those of well-known CERES products, with preservation of 20 times higher spatial resolution. The spatial analysis reveals a significant reduction of AOD in the North China Plain before and during the COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in an average 24.57 W m-2 variation of the surface shortwave radiative forcing in clear sky daytime.

TI  - Deep learning radiomics for prediction of axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with clinical stage T1-2 breast cancer
T2  - QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study investigates whether deep learning radiomics of conventional ultrasound images can predict preoperative axillary lymph node (ALN) status in patients with clinical stages T1-2 breast cancer (BC).Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed the preoperative ultrasound data of 892 patients with BC, who were classified into training (n=535), validation (n=178), and test (n=179) cohorts. Linear combinations of the selected features were weighted by their coefficients to obtain the predicted score. Then, deep learning radiomic features were extracted from the ultrasound images to evaluate the ALN status. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were drawn, followed by the calculation of the area under the curve (AUC) to assess the accuracy of the prediction model in predicting axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) in the three cohorts.Results: Deep learning radiomics combined with radiomics and clinical parameters was the optimal diagnostic predictor of the ALN status in the absence and presence of ALNM, with the AUC of 0.920 (95% confidence interval: 0.872 and 0.968, respectively). Additionally, this combination could also differentiate low-load ALNM [N + (1-2)] from heavy-load ALNM with >_3 positive nodes [N + (>_3)] in the test cohort, with the AUC of 0.819 (95% confidence interval: 0.568 and 1.00, respectively).Conclusions: Conclusively, deep learning radiomics of ultrasound images is a non-invasive approach to predicting preoperative ALNM in BC.

TI  - Assessing the ecological impacts of opencast coal mining in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau-a case study in Muli coal field, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal-based industries are critical to the contemporary world's growth, while the environmental degradation associated with the industry is also increasing. In this study, we develop the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) and map its distribution from 2000 to 2020 using the Muli coalfield near Qinghai Lake as the research object. This index is obtained by fitting four components that are critically related to the quality of the ecological environment, including greenness, humidity, heat and dryness, to finally obtain a desirable evaluation. The results illustrate that: (1) The RSEI displayed an overall increasing trend on the time scale, but it also went through three lengthier phases of trend changes. In space view, the RSEI of the unaltered areas has greatly improved, while the damaged areas are clearly concentrated in the study area's northwestern region, where mining is common. (2) In the trend test, the overall variation of RSEI was found to be around 3%. RSEI significantly increased in 69.57% of the study region, whereas RSEI decreased dramatically in 30.43% of the study area. (3) In opencast mining disturbed areas and undisturbed areas, a different quality structure can be discovered, with Moderate and Good levels predominating in disturbed areas and Good and Excellent levels predominating in undisturbed areas. The ecological decline in damaged areas significantly hampered the overall upward trend of RSEI. (4) The Globalmoran's I value was 0.558, 0.546, 0.409, 0.574, and 0.680 in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, respectively, showing a positive association between regional distribution of ecological environment quality and that opencast mining does really degrade that quality. It has been demonstrated that our evaluation accurately classify the local environment as affected by opencast mining, making it crucial for studying the relationship between coal mining and ecological quality. This index can also be utilized in the future when conducting surveys of other regions of intense human disturbance.

TI  - Local Full-Sector Land Uses Influenced by Multiregional Demand and Supply: The Case of Beijing
T2  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land is the foundation of human survival and well-being. It is important to investigate the land uses of economic sectors and recognize critical supply chain activities influencing land uses. However, the full-sector land uses and relevant multiregional supply chain activities have not been well characterized. This study constructs a new accounting framework based on road network, point of interest data, and remote sensing data to estimate sector-specific land uses. The accounting framework is applied to Beijing, China. The multiregional supply chain activities influencing full-sector land uses in Beijing are revealed based on environmentally extended multiregional input-output model. Results show that the largest nonagricultural land users are the wholesale and retail trades sector and the accommodation and catering sector. Land uses of these sectors are substantially driven by the final demand for the construction sector and enabled by the primary inputs of the finance sector. Moreover, the final demands of Henan and Zhejiang as well as the primary inputs of Jiangsu and Hebei are critical impetus. Optimizing consumption behavior of final consumers and product allocation of primary suppliers can help improve land management. This accounting framework can be further applied flexibly to studies on larger spatial scales and time-series studies.

TI  - Homologous recombination pathway gene variants identified by tumor-only sequencing assays in lung carcinoma patients
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway plays a key role in double-stranded DNA break repair, and germline HR pathway gene variants are associated with increased risk of several cancers, including breast and ovarian cancer. HR deficiency is also a therapeutically targetable phenotype. Methods: Somatic (tumour-only) sequencing was performed on 1,109 cases of lung tumors, and the pathological data were reviewed to filter for lung primary carcinomas. Cases were filtered for variants (disease-associated or of uncertain significance) in 14 HR pathway genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM. The clinical, pathological and molecular data were reviewed. Results: Sixty-one HR pathway gene variants in 56 patients with primary lung cancer were identified. Further filtering by variant allele fraction (VAF) of >_30% identified 17 HR pathway gene variants in 17 patients. ATM gene variants were most the commonly identified (9/17), including two patients with c.7271T>G (p.V2424G), a variant in the germline that is associated with increased familial cancer risk. Four (4/17) patients had a family history of lung cancer, among which three patients had ATM gene variants suspected to be germline in origin. In three other patients with BRCA1/2 or PALB2 gene variants who had undergone germline testing, the variants were confirmed to be germline; lung cancer was the sentinel cancer in two of these patients with a BRCA1 or PALB2 variant. Conclusions: Genomic variants in the HR repair pathway identified in tumor-only sequencing and occurring at higher VAFs (i.e., >_30%) may suggest a germline origin. Correlating with personal and family history, a subset of these variants is also suggested to be associated with familial cancer risks. Patient age, smoking history and driver mutation status are expected to be a poor screening tool in identifying these patients. Finally, the relative enrichment for ATM variants in our cohort suggests a possible association between ATM mutation and lung cancer risk.

TI  - Demonstration of large area land cover classification with a one dimensional convolutional neural network applied to single pixel temporal metric percentiles
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over large areas, land cover classification has conventionally been undertaken using satellite time series. Typically temporal metric percentiles derived from single pixel location time series have been used to take advantage of spectral differences among land cover classes over time and to minimize the impact of missing observations. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated potential for land cover classification of single date images. However, over large areas and using time series their application is complicated because they are sensitive to missing observations and they may misclassify small and spatially fragmented surface features due to their spatial patch-based implementation. This study demonstrates, for the first time, a one-dimensional (1D) CNN single pixel time series land classification approach that uses temporal percentile metrics and that does not have these issues. This is demonstrated for all the Conterminous United States (CONUS) considering two different 1D CNN structures with 5 and 8 layers, respectively. CONUS 30 m land cover classifications were derived using all the available Landsat-5 and -7 imagery over a seven-month growing season in 2011 with 3.3 million 30 m land cover class labelled samples extracted from the contemporaneous CONUS National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 16 class land cover product. The 1D CNNs and, a conventional random forest model, were trained using 10%, 50% and 90% samples, and the classification accuracies were evaluated with an independent 10% proportion. Temporal metrics were classified using 5, 7 and 9 percentiles for each of five Landsat reflective wavelength bands and their eight band ratios. The CONUS and detailed 150 x 150 km classification results demonstrate that the approach is effective at scale and locally. The 1D CNN classification land cover class boundaries were preserved for small axis dimension features, such as roads and rivers, with no stripes or anomalous spatial patterns. The 8-layer 1D CNN provided the highest overall classification accuracies and both the 5-layer and 8-layer 1D CNN architectures provided higher accuracies than the random forest by 1.9% - 2.8% which as all the accuracies were > 83% is a meaningful increase. The CONUS overall classification accuracies increased marginally with the number of percentiles (86.21%, 86.40%, and 86.43% for 5, 7 and 9 percentiles, respectively) using the 8-layer 1D-CNN. Class specific producer and user accuracies were quantified, with lower accuracies for the developed land, crop and pasture/hay classes, but no systematic pattern among classes with respect to the number of temporal percentiles used. Application of the trained model to a different year of CONUS Landsat ARD showed moderately decreased accuracy (80.79% for 7 percentiles) that we illustrate is likely due to different intra-annual surface variations between years. These encouraging results are discussed with recommended research for deep learning using temporal metric percentiles.

TI  - Large discrepancies among remote sensing indices for characterizing vegetation growth dynamics in Nepal
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain ecosystems provide multiple ecosystem services and are "natural laboratories" to understand ecosystem responses to global change. Because of the inaccessibility and the high cost of field surveys, remote sensing indices are the major and sometimes the only measures to monitor the vegetation growth dynamics in mountains. However, there are large discrepancies in those indices that should be quantified in mountainous regions. This case study in Nepal, a highly mountainous region, explores the consistency and inconsistency of six widely used remote sensing indices in monitoring vegetation growth from 2000 to 2020. The study considers three greenness indices of normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), one cover index of leaf area index (LAI), and two productivity indices of gross primary productivity (GPP) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). We find high spatial consistency in the multiyear means (r = 0.79 similar to 1, N = 4300, p < 0.01), especially in the highlands and between EVI and NIRv, and a logarithmic relationship between greenness indices or GOSIF and LAI or GPP. In contrast, the long-term trends differ substantially by index and space. Only 7% of the lands show synchronized significant increase though all the indices show a widespread increasing tendency (77 similar to 87% of the lands). The prevalent non-significant changes of all the indices primarily contribute to the trend uncertainties, especially in the highlands. The inconsistencies between greenness and productivity indices and in them further exaggerate the uncertainties. Our results emphasize the large discrepancies of remote sensing indices in quantifying mountain vegetation growth dynamics. Larger inconsistency is expected if we consider disparities among the quality-control schemes, study seasons, remote sensing models, satellite platforms, and sensors. Reinforced remote sensing data, model improvements and/or new indices are needed for an accurate quantification of the vegetation growth dynamics in mountain regions.

TI  - Imaging of Neck Nodes in Head and Neck Cancers- a Comprehensive Update
T2  - CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cervical lymph node metastases from head and neck squamous cell cancers significantly reduce disease-free survival and worsen overall prognosis and, hence, deserve more aggressive management and follow-up. As per the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging manual, extranodal extension, especially in human papillomavirus-negative cancers, has been incorporated in staging as it is important in deciding management and significantly impacts the outcome of head and neck squamous cell cancer. Lymph node imaging with various radiological modalities, including ultrasound, computed to-mography and magnetic resonance imaging, has been widely used, not only to demonstrate nodal involvement but also for guided histopathological evaluation and therapeutic intervention. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, together with positron emission tomography, are used widely for the follow-up of treated patients. Finally, there is an emerging role for artificial intelligence in neck node imaging that has shown promising results, increasing the accuracy of detection of nodal involvement, especially normal-appearing nodes. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the diagnosis and management of involved neck nodes with a focus on sentinel node anatomy, pathogenesis, imaging correlates (including radiogenomics and artificial intelligence) and the role of image-guided interventions.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal College of Radiologists.

TI  - Background nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) over the United States and itsimplications for satellite observations and trends: effects of nitratephotolysis, aircraft, and open fires
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) measured from satellites has been widely used to track anthropogenic NOx emissions, but its retrieval and interpretation can be complicated by the free tropospheric NO2 background to which satellite measurements are particularly sensitive. Tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) from the spaceborne Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) averaged over the contiguous US (CONUS) show no trend after 2009, despite sustained decreases in anthropogenic NOx emissions, implying an important and rising contribution from the free tropospheric background. Here, we use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model applied to the simulation of OMI NO2 to better understand the sources and trends of background NO2 over CONUS. The previous model underestimate of the background is largely corrected by the consideration of aerosol nitrate photolysis, which increases the model NO2 VCDs by 13 % on an annual basis (25 % in spring) and also increases the air mass factor (AMF) to convert the tropospheric slant column densities (SCDs) inferred from the OMI spectra into VCDs by 7 % on an annual basis (11 % in spring). The increase in the AMF decreases the retrieved NO2 VCDs in the satellite observations, contributing to the improved agreement with the model. Accounting for the 2009-2017 increase in aircraft NOx emissions drives only a 1.4 % mean increase in NO2 VCDs over CONUS and a 2 % increase in the AMF, but the combination of decreasing surface NOx emissions and increasing aircraft emissions is expected to drive a 14 % increase in the AMF over the next decade that will be necessary to account for in the interpretation of satellite NO2 trends. Fire smoke identification with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Hazard Mapping System (HMS) indicates that wildfires contribute 1 %-8 % of OMI NO2 VCDs over the western US in June-September and that this contribution has been increasing since 2009, contributing to the flattening of OMI NO2 trends. Future analyses of NO2 trends from satellite data to infer trends in surface NOx emissions must critically consider the effects of a rising free tropospheric background due to increasing emissions from aircraft, fires, and possibly lightning.

TI  - Superresolution of Lunar Satellite Images for Enhanced Robotic Traverse Planning: Maximizing the Value of Existing Data Products for Space Robotics
T2  - IEEE ROBOTICS & AUTOMATION MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Lunar exploration missions require detailed and accurate planning to ensure their safety. Remote sensing data, such as optical satellite imagery acquired by lunar orbiters, are key for the identification of future landing and mission sites. Here robot- and astronaut-scale obstacles are the most relevant to resolve; however, the spatial resolution of the available image data is often insufficient, particularly in the poorly illuminated polar regions of the moon, leading to uncertainty. This work shows how a novel single-image superresolution (SISR) application, the Adversarial Network for Uncertainty-Based Image SR (ANUBIS), can enhance lunar surface imagery by improving the resolution by a factor of two, outperforming other approaches and benchmarks. The enhanced images improve the reliability and detail of lunar traverse planning and topographic reconstruction, while providing an estimate of the uncertainty associated with the enhancement process, vital to ensure mission planning integrity. This work demonstrates how machine-learning-driven processing can enhance existing data products to maximize their value for science and the exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies.

TI  - An adaptive image fusion method for Sentinel-2 images and high-resolution images with long-time intervals
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 imagery has garnered significant attention in many earth system studies due to free access and high revisit frequency. Since its spatial resolution is insufficient for many applications, e.g., fine-grained land cover mapping, some studies employ fusion technique that combines high-resolution RGB images with Sentinel-2 multispectral images to improve the resolution of the latter. However, there are two issues in the existing image fusion methods. First, these methods usually assume that the time intervals between images are short (within several days), which is a strong assumption for large-scale high-resolution images and many real-world applications. Second, the spectral discrepancy between multispectral and RGB images could induce spectral aberrations in Sentinel-2 imagery upon fusion. To alleviate these issues, we propose an adaptive image fusion approach named S2IFNet, adaptively fusing images with long-time intervals (from months to years) and spectral inconsistency, thereby increasing the multispectral band resolution of Sentinel-2 imagery. Building on top of the feature extraction and fusion modules, we propose a spectral feature compensation module and a change-aware feature reconstruction module. The former alleviates the possible degradation of spectral attributes in Sentinel-2 imagery resulting from feature fusion. The latter integrates semantic and texture information to avoid adding fake textures caused by land cover changes over time. The experiments demonstrate that S2IFNet surpasses existing image fusion and reference-based super-resolution methods on synthetic and real datasets, yielding fusion results that are clearer and more reliable.

TI  - Advancements in earth observation for water resources monitoring and management in Africa: A comprehensive review
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper provides an overview of the progress made in remote sensing of water resources in Africa, focusing on various applications such as precipitation estimation, land surface temperature analysis, soil moisture assessment, surface water extent measurement, surface runoff and streamflow analysis, water quality evaluation, land cover/land use mapping, and groundwater analysis. Specifically, the study sheds light on the remarkable progress made in remote sensing applications, showcasing scientific advancements and highlighting the challenges encountered. Moreover, it identifies crucial knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in order to further advance this field. The review's key findings indicate that the availability of sensors and observations, along with analytical models, has contributed to monitoring Africa's water resources at various scales. The availability and accessibility of hydrological data for monitoring and assessing water resources in Africa have been partially improved through the adoption of satellite data and processing technologies. Additionally, the emergence of various international remote sensing initiatives, North-South research collaborations, and projects has contributed to the research progress. Prominent satellite data series such as Landsat, MODIS, and GRACE have played significant roles in African hydrological research. However, the limited and malfunctioning in-situ hydrological monitoring networks in Africa have affected the accurate calibration and validation of remotely sensed hydrological models. Insufficient long-term rainfall and climate data pose challenges to long-term earth observation research on African water systems. The lack of high-resolution spatial and temporal data hampered accurate monitoring of hydrological processes at smaller scales. Despite the widespread use of rainfall satellite products, validation attempts over Africa, particularly in western and southern regions, have been limited. Furthermore, the reliability of hydrological satellite datasets is affected by factors such as the number and coverage of surface stations, retrieval algorithms, data integration techniques, and cloud cover. Overall, this work demonstrates the importance of earth observation in understanding Africa's hydrology, previously hindered by the lack of in-situ data. Nevertheless, efforts are therefore needed to enhance the adoption and application of remote sensing, particularly in groundwater and surface water estimation at smaller scales. Future research should focus on multi-source data integration, assimilation, and big data analytics using cloud computing and machine learning to address complex hydrological research questions at various scales.

TI  - Correction for LST directionality impact on the estimation of surface upwelling longwave radiation over vegetated surfaces at the satellite scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface upwelling longwave radiation (SULR) is a major component of the Earth's radiation budget and directly influences the retrieval of evapotranspiration (ET) in the terrestrial ecosystems. Land surface temperature (LST) is an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) for direct estimation of SULR. However, accurate retrieval of SULR from satellite observations may be severely hindered by the anisotropic properties of land surface targets since most of them show marked angular variations in LST. This study aims at investigating the magnitude and impact factors of the directional effects of LST on SULR estimation over vegetated surfaces given that angular variation in emissivity has a limited impact on SULR estimation over most land surface types. It follows an attempt to correct for such effects in SULR estimation. We further explore the possibility to find a viewing direction at which SULR estimated from the directional LST can surrogate the hemispherical integration. To do so, a parametric model mimicking LST anisotropy with the hot spot is incorporated into the physical temperature-emissivity method. Two widely used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST products (i.e., MYD11_L2 and MYD21_L2) are analyzed. SULR estimates before and after correcting for LST directionality are compared with insitu measurements acquired at 15 sites from the FLUXNET and SURFRAD networks in different regions. Our analysis reveals that LST directional effects on SULR estimation exhibit diurnal and seasonal variations, which are substantial in spring and summer for the daytime. The effects are negligible (<5 W m  2) in autumn and winter for the daytime except for in arid and semiarid regions. For the night-time, the effects are insignificant over all the biomes. Using MYD21 LST, after correction, the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) and bias of SULR estimates for all sites decrease by 8 and 8.34 W m  2 in spring, and by 8.9 and 12.13 W m  2 in summer. Using MYD11 LST, after correction, the average RMSE is between 10 and 15 W m  2 and the average bias is close to zero in all seasons. The RMSE and absolute bias of SULR estimates for sites with low to moderate vegetation (LAI <3) is lowered substantially (7-14 W m  2) after correction. Interestingly, SULR estimates from LST viewed at 54 degrees backward and hemispherically integrated are close, with differences <3 W m  2 at most of the sites. These findings support a strategy for SULR estimation in ET retrieval over vegetated surfaces from directional LST.

TI  - Cloud mask algorithm from the EarthCARE Multi-Spectral Imager: the M-CM products
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The EarthCARE (Earth Clouds, Aerosols and Radiation Explorer) satellite mission will provide new insights into aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions by means of synergistic observations of the Earth's atmosphere from a collection of active and passive remote sensing instruments, flying on a single satellite platform. The Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) will provide visible and infrared images in the cross-track direction with a 150 km swath and a pixel sampling at 500 m. The suite of MSI cloud algorithms will deliver cloud macro- and microphysical properties complementary to the vertical profiles measured from the Atmospheric Lidar (ATLID) and the Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) instruments. This paper provides an overview of the MSI cloud mask algorithm (M-CM) being developed to derive the cloud flag, cloud phase and cloud type products, which are essential inputs to downstream EarthCARE algorithms providing cloud optical and physical properties (M-COP) and aerosol optical properties (M-AOT). The MSI cloud mask algorithm has been applied to simulated test data from the EarthCARE end-to-end simulator and satellite data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as well as from the Spinning Enhanced Visible InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI). Verification of the MSI cloud mask algorithm to the simulated test data and the official cloud products from SEVIRI and MODIS demonstrates a good performance of the algorithm. Some discrepancies are found, however, for the detection of thin cirrus clouds over bright surfaces like desert or snow. This will be improved by tuning of the thresholds once real observations are available.

TI  - Sentinel plot surveillance of cotton leaf curl disease in Pakistan- a case study at the cultivated cotton-wild host plant interface
T2  - VIRUS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A sentinel plot case study was carried out to identify and map the distribution of begomovirus-betasatellite complexes in sentinel plots and commercial cotton fields over a four-year period using molecular and highthroughput DNA 'discovery' sequencing approaches. Samples were collected from 15 study sites in the two major cotton-producing areas of Pakistan. Whitefly- and leafhopper-transmitted geminiviruses were detected in previously unreported host plant species and locations. The most prevalent begomovirus was cotton leaf curl Kokhran virus-Burewala (CLCuKoV-Bu). Unexpectedly, a recently recognized recombinant, cotton leaf curl Multan virus-Rajasthan (CLCuMuV-Ra) was prevalent in five of 15 sites. cotton leaf curl Alabad virus (CLCuAlV) and cotton leaf curl Kokhran virus-Kokhran, 'core' members of CLCuD-begomoviruses that co-occurred with CLCuMuV in the 'Multan' epidemic were detected in one of 15 sentinel plots. Also identified were chickpea chlorotic dwarf virus and 'non-core' CLCuD-begomoviruses, okra enation leaf curl virus, squash leaf curl virus, and tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus. Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMuB) was the most prevalent CLCuD-betasatellite, and less commonly, two 'non-core' betasatellites. Recombination analysis revealed previously uncharacterized recombinants among helper virus-betasatellite complexes consisting of CLCuKoV, CLCuMuV, CLCuAlV and CLCuMuB. Population analyses provided early evidence for CLCuMuV-Ra expansion and displacement of CLCuKoV-Bu in India and Pakistan from 2012-2017. Identification of 'core' and non-core CLCuD-species/strains in cotton and other potential reservoirs, and presence of the now predominant CLCuMuV-Ra strain are indicative of ongoing diversification. Investigating the phylodynamics of geminivirus emergence in cotton-vegetable cropping systems offers an opportunity to understand the driving forces underlying disease outbreaks and reconcile viral evolution with epidemiological relationships that also capture pathogen population shifts.

TI  - Structure-property relationship of zeolite-Y/cubic ZnS nanohybrid material and its utilization for gaseous phase mercury removal
T2  - CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Zinc acetate dihydrate and thiourea based metal sulfide was synthesized and used to develop zeolite-ZnS (ZYZnS) nanohybrid material by using sonication process, solvothermal method and heat treatment process. The sulfur atom in thiourea is involved in formation of metal sulfide and ethylene glycol was used as solvents in the solvothermal method. The structure of the nanohybrid material was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD and XPS. Raman spectra confirmed the presence of 4, 6- membered rings of zeolite and polar modes A1 and E1 and nonpolar mode E-2 of ZnS nanoparticles. The morphology of the nanohybrid material was analyzed by TEM and SEM analysis. The uniform distribution of ZnS in the zeolite matrix was observed in TEM and SEM morphology. The spherical aggregates ZnS crystals size between 100 and 200 nm were observed. Cubical morphology was observed in pure zeolite samples in the range of 400 nm-500 nm. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was used to confirm the metal-sulfide species in the hybrid material. Mercury adsorption (elemental (Hg degrees)) in the vapor phase follows both pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. Kinetic study shows that the mercury adsorption on the zeolite-ZnS nanohybrid adsorbent was mostly regulated by the chemisorption. Vapor phase mercury adsorption capacity of zeolite-Y (ZY) and zeolite-ZnS (ZY-ZnS), is 2295 and 3461 mu g/g at 180 degrees C, respectively. In ZY and ZY-ZnS the intraparticle diffusion rates were 86.1 and 141.2 mu g/gmin(-1/2), respectively. The higher intraparticle diffusion rate observed in ZY-ZnS confirm the uniformly decorated ZnS nano particles in ZY-ZnS nanohybrid material.

TI  - Evolution of aerosol plumes from 2019 Raikoke volcanic eruption observed with polarization lidar over central China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Raikoke volcano erupted on 21-22 June 2019 and emitted large amounts of volcanic ash into the upper troposphere, and later might impose long-term effects on the global and regional radiation budget after the long-range transport of volcanic aerosol plumes. Height-resolved ground-based lidar observations are beneficial to trace and cross-check the 3-D evolution of complicated aerosol plumes, which are, however, scarce at mid -latitude regions. Here, we present a rare ground-based lidar observation of Raikoke aerosol plumes in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (site: Wuhan; location: 30.5 degrees N, 114.4 degrees E) from 25 July to 30 September 2019. The main aerosol plume first arrived at Wuhan on 25 July and was intermittently observed during the following 2 months at altitudes of 15.0-20.5 km. From 22 August to 23 September, this aerosol plume underwent two quasi-elliptical transport pathways in East Asia driven by an Asian monsoon anticyclone. The particle de-polarization ratio of volcanic aerosols is < 0.05. The layer-integrated AODs (aerosol optical depths) of 0.001-0.017 are smaller than those observed from other high-altitude sites previously owing to the dispersal of particles. Interestingly, another separated dense aerosol cloud was observed twice, closely followed by a thin and horizontally extended aerosol plume (named 'trail'). This study provides valuable information for studying the evolution of the vertical distribution and optical properties of Raikoke volcanic aerosols, which is anticipated to be a crucial supplement/reference for dispersion model simulation, data assimilation, and forecasting refinement.

TI  - A spatiotemporal fusion method based on interpretable deep networks
T2  - APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Remote sensing spatiotemporal fusion is currently a popular research field in remote sensing that can cost-effectively generate remote sensing images with high spatiotemporal resolution. The deep neural network-based approach has strong feature extraction capability and has achieved great success in the fields of signal and image processing, but the deep network lacks interpretability. In this paper, a new interpretable deep network-based spatiotemporal fusion (UNSTF) method is proposed. The method proposes a new network model by first establishing a concise a priori formulation using sparse representation, constructing the proposed network by unfolding the proximal gradient algorithm for solving the model, and carefully designing each basic network module in the model to have a reasonable physical meaning, making the whole network interpretable. In addition, the UNSTF network method proposes a new network iteration loss function, where the predicted images of each iteration stage of the network are constrained by the real images, and the final stage and the intermediate network stages conform well to their inherent prior structures, effectively improving the accuracy and reliability of model prediction. Through extensive experiments, it is shown that the proposed method outperforms existing fusion methods in terms of both subjective and objective metrics.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Small lakes (areas between 0.01 km(2) and 1 km(2)) on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) are prone to fluctuations in number and area, with serious implications for the surface water storage and water and carbon cycles of this fragile environment. However, there are no detailed long-term datasets of the small lakes of the QTP. Therefore, the intra-annual changes of small lakes in the Qilian Mountains region (QMR) in the northeastern part of the QTP were investigated. The small lake water bodies (SLWB) in the QMR were extracted by improving existing commonly used waterbody extraction algorithms. Using the Google Earth Engine platform and 13,297 Landsat TM/ETM + /OLI images, the SLWB of the QMR were extracted from 1987 to 2020 applying the improved algorithm, cross-validation and manual corrections. The reliability, uncertainty and limitations of the improved algorithm were discussed. An intra-annual small lake dataset for QMR (QMR-SLD) from 1987 to 2020 was released, containing eight attributes: code, perimeter (km), area (km(2)), latitude and longitude, elevation (m), area error, relative error (%), and subregion.

TI  - High spatiotemporal resolution reconstruction of suspended particulate matter concentration in arid brackish lake, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aquatic ecosystems and regional habitat quality of brackish Ebinur Lake in arid northwest China are significantly affected by suspended particulate matter (SPM). The Landsat series, Sentinel 2 and MODIS remotesensing data offer a great potential to overcome the issue of the lack of reliable observation data for continuous SPM monitoring, but more accurate SPM inversion models are required for the arid regions. Hence, this research aims to: (1) determine the optimal strategy for applying the SPM inversion model to various time series images, (2) explore the inversion mode of SPM under the missing-image scenario, and (3) analyze the spatiotemporal changes of SPM over the Ebinur Lake lake from May to October during the 2011-2020 period. The findings show that ESTARFM_IVS (Inversion of SPM using images generated by Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model) produces the best inversion accuracy, with the values of R2 & GE; 0.57, RMSE & LE; 44.51 mg/L. Secondly, the exponential model for the Landsat 5/7 and fused images were adopted, while the QuasiAnalytical Algorithms for reference wavelengths of 655 nm and 665 nm (QAA_655(665)) were used for the Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images. Thirdly, the SPM fluctuations varied significantly, and the SPM concentrations showed an increasing trend with a widening amplitude over time. The inter-annual SPM increasing trend was significant, while the inter-month SPM variations have not changed much. When compared to the lake's core area, the SPM concentrations in the nearshore area were noticeably higher, and this has been consistent over the years. The results should serve as helpful guides for monitoring brackish lake water environment using satellite technologies.

TI  - Interaction of climate, topography and soil properties with cropland and cropping pattern using remote sensing data and machine learning methods
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Precision agriculture which facilitates and enables crop management through site-specific recommendations, is essential to optimize agricultural inputs in space and time. In this study, we used Landsat and MODIS-NDVI product data with climatic, topographic data and laboratory-analyzed soil samples to map the spatial distribution of seven soil properties; soil texture (T), electrical conductivity (EC), potential hydrogen (pH), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and organic matter (OM) in the Punjab, Pakistan from 2000 to 2020. We examined and compared three statistical prediction models: the support vector machine (SVM), the random forest regression (RFR), and the multiple linear regression (MLR). The predictions were validated against a separate set of soil samples while considering the modeling region and an extrapolation area. Model performance statistics showed that the RFR often provided the highest accuracy, with the machine learning algorithms performing slightly better than the MLR. It was discovered that one obstacle to accurately forecasting soil parameters at unsampled areas with MLR was its inability to handle non-linear connections between independent and dependent variables. The results indicate that the cultivated area decreased from 43.16 % in 2000 to 38.24% in 2020. The soil has a high level of EC due to salinity. In general, the soils contained < 1% OM with lower N. However, the K and P contents were considered medium and adequate. Free remote sensing data has made it possible to improve soil knowledge at local and regional scales in data like Punjab with little outlays of time and money. & COPY; 2023 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Comparison of oncological outcomes between sentinel lymph node biopsy and complete lymphadenectomy for endometrial cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping allows node-negative patients to be spared from the surgical comorbidities associated with total lymphadenectomy. This study aimed to evaluate the oncological outcomes of SLN biopsy versus complete lymph node dissection in patients with early-stage endometrial carcinoma.Methods: Retrospective analyses were performed in patients with pathologically confirmed endometrioid endometrial carcinoma, who underwent minimally invasive surgical staging with SLN biopsy or complete lymph node dissection at Yonsei Cancer Center between 2015 and 2019.Results: A total of 301 patients were included in this study. Eighty-two patients underwent SLN biopsy, while 219 underwent complete lymph node dissection. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the two groups. In terms of operative characteristics, the SLN biopsy-only group had a significantly shorter surgical duration (p < 0.001) than the lymphadenectomy group. The mean follow-up period was 41.4 months. There were no differences in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between the two groups (SLN biopsy vs. complete lymph node dissection; p = 0.798 and 0.301, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that SLN biopsy was not an independent prognostic factor for PFS or OS.Conclusion: Our results showed that SLN biopsy provided oncological outcomes similar to those of lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Examining Cultural Worldview and Social Media as Contributors to Reduced COVID-19 Prevention Behaviors in the US and France
T2  - WESTERN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study examines how cultural worldview and social media use contribute to reduced COVID-19 prevention behaviors in the U.S. and France - two countries that face numerous pandemic-related public health challenges. Drawing from the comprehensive model of information seeking (CMIS) and a cultural cognition framework, we surveyed French and U.S. citizens prior to full vaccine rollout (2020/early 2021) to assess how individualistic (stressing individual concerns over group concerns) and hierarchical (embracing a status quo/power differences) worldviews drive information seeking processes and prevention outcomes - vaccine intentions and non-vaccine prevention behaviors (e.g. mask wearing, social distancing). Among U.S. respondents-only, findings show that holding hierarchical worldviews contribute to greater use of social media for COVID-19 information. In subsequent analyses predicting prevention outcomes, social media use among U.S. adults predicted reduced COVID-19 vaccine intentions, whereas individualist worldview across both samples independently predicted distinct COVID-19 prevention outcomes. The relationship between individualist worldview and prevention behavior was qualified by level of social media use for COVID-19 information. In particular, among U.S. and French respondents, individualist worldview negatively predicted non-vaccine prevention action at higher, but not lower, levels of information seeking via social media. Overall, the findings indicate distinct relationships between cultural worldview dimensions and social media information channels that have implications for prevention behavior.

T2  - GEOSCIENCE DATA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
M3  - Early Access
AB  - As the most constraining environmental factor of vegetation development in arid areas, soil moisture is mainly supplied by precipitation and groundwater resources. Considering the varying sensitivity of different plant communities to precipitation and groundwater-induced water shortages, the communities' management requires the study of the effects of both meteorological and hydrogeological droughts on vegetation. Therefore, this study sought to model the effects of meteorological and hydrogeological droughts on vegetation indices obtained from MODIS satellite images in the Sirjan plain from 2000 to 2019. To this end, vegetation communities were first identified and separated based on extensive field operations, taking into account the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) at the plant communities' scale. Then, meteorological drought was calculated using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the hydrogeological drought was also measured by Groundwater Resource Index (GRI) via the Kriging technique. Finally, the relationship was modelled using Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR). The results revealed that SPI at a 6-month time scale (as an important index) played a significant role in elaborating the changes in VCI in eight communities out of 18 ones at the 6-month scale, acting as a strong and reliable estimator. Moreover, 61.6% of VCI changes in Artemisia sieberi-Seidlitzia rosmarinus community were explained with GRI and SPI at a 6-month time scale, indicating the dependence on groundwater and precipitation. Nonetheless, some communities (i.e. six cases) were unresponsive. These findings draw our attention to the importance of considering the special reaction of each plant community in the management.

TI  - Merkel cell carcinoma: a review of clinical management with focus on Asian patients
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma is a highly aggressive skin cancer characterized by neuroendocrine differentiation. This review aimed to present updates on the knowledge and current trends of clinical management of Merkel cell carcinoma. Additionally, we focused on Asian reports of Merkel cell carcinoma because most skin cancers differ substantially between Caucasians and Asians, and researchers have reported differences in Merkel cell carcinoma in racial and ethnic groups. Owing to its rarity, there is limited evidence for the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and Merkel cell carcinoma treatment. The development of a nationwide survey or cancer registry, the identification of Merkel cell polyomavirus and the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors allowed a better understanding of its characteristics and biology and have revolutionized the clinical management of patients with Merkel cell carcinoma. Its incidence has gradually increased worldwide; however, it depends on the geographic location, race and ethnicity. No randomized prospective studies have evaluated the significance of sentinel lymph node biopsy, complete lymph node dissection and adjuvant radiation therapy; however, most patients with localized Merkel cell carcinoma are treated surgically or with post-operative radiation. Patients with distant Merkel cell carcinoma are administered immune checkpoint inhibitors as the first-line therapy; however, there is no established second-line therapy for refractory Merkel cell carcinoma. Furthermore, it is necessary to validate the favorable results of clinical studies performed in Western countries in the patients in Asia.Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma. We reviewed recent updates of the pathogenesis and clinical management and focused on Asian patients who have limited evidence.

TI  - Moderation and mediation of land use change! Interplay between β-diversity and landscape structures in agri- and silvicultural modified grasslands of South America
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Although land use change is the main driver of biodiversity decline in the South American temperate grasslands, its impacts on beta-diversity have not yet been evaluated. We investigated relationships between beta-diversity, landscape features, and geographical variables by surveying vegetation from 163 plots distributed in eight different land use types in Uruguay. We created land use maps using Landsat images and calculated landscape metrics, determining beta-diversity across all plots and exploring variation of beta-diversity among different land use types. We ran distance decay models to explore relationships between beta-diversity and geographical location, climate, and landscape metrics. Plant species communities were characterized by a high turnover and low nestedness of species, indicating high dissimilarity across Uruguay. Native forest showed higher beta-diversity than grassland, timber plantation, and crops. beta-diversity increased with geographical distance and environmental dissimilarity. At landscape scale, turnover decreased negatively and nestedness increased to contagion, number of patches, and area-weighted mean. Nestedness increased with timber plantation and species turnover with crop area. Higher Landscape Shape Index of grassland and crops decreased species turnover. An increase of grassland and crop patches in the surrounding landscape was directly related to a higher species turnover. The high beta-diversity across Uruguay resulting from land use change, moderated by landscape configurations, suggests that numerous protected areas for different habitats are urgently required. A more inclusive vision on biodiversity conservation is necessary, extending the predominant focus from native forests to grasslands, and convincing a broad range of stakeholders, especially landowners and managers, about biodiversity-friendly land-use approaches.

TI  - Trophic status estimation of case-2 water bodies of the Godavari River basin using satellite imagery and artificial neural network (ANN)
T2  - H2OPEN JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of trophic status estimation of case-2 water bodies on a synoptic mode for frequent intervals is essential for water quality management. The present study attempts to develop trophic status estimation approaches utilizing Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images as inputs. The chlorophyll-a concentration, a proxy parameter for trophic status, was estimated using the empirical method, fluorescence line height (FLH) method, and artificial neural network (ANN) approaches using spectral reflectance values as inputs. The outcomes following the empirical approaches revealed the scope of kernel normalized difference vegetation index (kNDVI) (R2 = 0.85; RMSE = 2 mu g/l) for estimating the chlorophyll-a concentration using Sentinel-2 images of the Godavari River basin. Though the performance of the FLH method (R-2 = 0.91; RMSE = 1.6 mu g/l) was superior to kNDVIbased estimation, it lacks the capability to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration above 20 mu g/l. Due to the existence of eutrophic regions within the Godavari basin (28%), adopting better approaches like ANN for trophic status estimation is essential. To accomplish the same, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm-based ANN was developed using non-redundant bands of Sentinel-2 as inputs, and Sentinel-3 derived chlorophyll-a values as output. The developed architecture was successful in estimating trophic status estimations at all levels.

TI  - Multi-grain habitat models that combine satellite sensors with different resolutions explain bird species richness patterns best
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Animals select habitat at multiple spatial scales, suggesting that biodiversity modeling, for example of species richness, should be based on environmental data gathered at multiple spatial scales, and especially multiple grain sizes. Different satellite sensors collect data at different spatial resolutions and therefore provide opportunities for multi-grain habitat measures. The dynamic habitat indices (DHIs), which are derived from satellite data, capture patterns of vegetative productivity and predict bird species richness well. However, the DHIs have only been analyzed at single resolutions (e.g., 1-km), and have not yet been derived from high-resolution satellite data (< 10-m). Our goal was to predict bird species richness based on measures of vegetation productivity (DHIs, NDVI median and NDVI percentile 90th) across a range of spatial resolutions both from different sensors, and from resampled high-resolution imagery. We analyzed bird species richness within 215 forest, grassland and shrubland plots (56.25 ha) located at 26 terrestrial field sites of the National Ecology Observatory Network (NEON), in the continental US. To obtain our multi-resolution measures of vegetation productivity, we acquired data from Planetscope (3-m), RapidEye (5-m), Sentinel-2 (10-m), Landsat-8 (30-m) and MODIS (250-m) from 2017 to 2020, generated time series of NDVI, calculated the three DHIs (cumulative, minimum and variation), NDVI median and the 90th percentile NDVI and calculated 1st and 2nd order texture measures. We evaluated the performance of the derived measures to predict bird species richness of habitat specialist guilds based on (i) univariate models (ii) multivariate models with single-resolution measures and (iii) multivariate models with multi-resolution measures. Single-spatial resolution measures predicted bird species richness moderately well (R2 up to 0.51) and the best performing spatial resolution and measure differed among bird species guilds. High -spatial resolution (3-5 m) measures outperformed medium-resolution measures (10-250 m). Models for all guilds performed best when incorporating multiple resolutions, including for all species richness (R2 = 0.63) and for forest (R2 = 0.72), grassland (R2 = 0.53) and shrubland specialists (R2 = 0.46). In addition, models based on multi-resolution data from different sensors performed better than models based on resampled high-resolution data for any of the guilds. Our results highlight, first, the value of the DHIs derived from high-resolution sat-ellite data to predict bird species richness and, second, that remotely-sensed vegetation productivity measures from multiple spatial resolutions offer great promise for quantifying biodiversity.

TI  - Response of total suspended matter to natural and anthropogenic factors since 1990 in China's large lakes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended matter (TSM) as a critical water quality parameter is closely linked with nutrients, micropollutants, and heavy metals threatening the ecological health of aquatic ecosystems. However, the long-term spatiotemporal dynamics of lake TSM in China and their response to natural and anthropogenic factors are rarely explored. In this study, based on Landsat top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance embedded in GEE and in-situ TSM data collecting in the periods 2014-2020, we developed a unified empirical model (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 10.16 mg/L, and MAPE = 38.37 %) to retrieve the autumn TSM of lakes at national scale. This model exhibited stable and reliable performances through transferability validation and comparative analysis with published TSM models, and was implemented to generate autumn TSM maps for large lakes (& GE;50 km2) across China during 1990-2020.We found that 78.03 % of large lakes with TSM < 20 mg/L were dominant in 2020 across China, and these lakes were mainly located in the plateau and mountain regions. In the first gradient terrain (FGT) and second gradient terrain (SGT), the number of lakes showing significant (p < 0.05) decreasing TSM trends increased from 1990-2004 to 2004-2020, while those with opposite directions in TSM decreased. Lakes in the third gradient terrain (TGT) exhibited the inverse quantitative change in these two TSM trends compared with the FGT and SGT. A relative contribution analysis at the watershed level indicated that the first two leading factors that control TSM significant change in the FGT were lake area and wind speed, in the SGT were lake area and NDVI, and in the TGT were population and NDVI, respectively. The impacts of anthropogenic factors on lakes are continuing, particularly in eastern China, and more efforts are needed to improve and protect the water environment in the future. Our findings might help water resource managers better grasp the current state of water quality.

TI  - Comparison of an Optimised Multiresolution Segmentation Approach with Deep Neural Networks for Delineating Agricultural Fields from Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective monitoring of agricultural lands requires accurate spatial information about the locations and boundaries of agricultural fields. Through satellite imagery, such information can be mapped on a large scale at a high temporal frequency. Various methods exist in the literature for segmenting agricultural fields from satellite images. Edge-based, region-based, or hybrid segmentation methods are traditional methods that have widely been used for segmenting agricultural fields. Lately, the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for various tasks in remote sensing has been gaining traction. Therefore, to identify the optimal method for segmenting agricultural fields from satellite images, we evaluated three state-of-the-art DNNs, namely Mask R-CNN, U-Net, and FracTAL ResUNet against the multiresolution segmentation (MRS) algorithm, which is a region-based and a more traditional segmentation method. Given that the DNNs are supervised methods, we used an optimised version of the MRS algorithm based on supervised Bayesian optimisation. Monotemporal Sentinel-2 (S2) images acquired in Lower Saxony, Germany were used in this study. Based on the agricultural parcels declared by farmers within the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) framework, the segmentation results of each method were evaluated using the F-score and intersection over union (IoU) metrics. The respective average F-score and IoU obtained by each method are 0.682 and 0.524 for Mask R-CNN, 0.781 and 0.646 for U-Net, 0.808 and 0.683 for FracTAL ResUNet, and 0.805 and 0.678 for the optimised MRS approach. This study shows that DNNs, particularly FracTAL ResUNet, can be effectively used for large-scale segmentation of agricultural fields from satellite images.

TI  - Understanding the landscape evolution of El Mogote barrier spit, Baja California Sur, Mexico, using OSL dating, satellite images and a multivariate analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Barrier spits are natural archives that provide information about coastal evolution and prevailing environmental conditions of the mainland. In this study, we analyze one of the largest barrier spits in Baja California Sur, Mexico, known as El Mogote bar, using a multi-method approach to unravel the coastal landscape evolution. We used (1) OSL dating to provide a robust geochronology and depositional rates of the emerged beach-dune ridges, (2) satellite imagery interpretation using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software to assess shoreline changes on Landsat images from 1986 to 2014, and (3) the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with climatic and geomorphologic parameters to elucidate the environmental conditions of the beach-dune ridges for the period comprised in the DSAS analysis. OSL results indicate that the emerged bars started to form similar to 2 ka and were developed in three main building phases: (1) the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and part of the Little Ice Age (LIA) with accretional rates of 1.13 m yr(-1), (2) the ending of the LIA with 7.03 m yr(-1) and (3) the post-LIA with 3.98 m yr(-1). In this paper, we hypothesize two probable causes that led to the destruction of the former beach-dune ridges: (1) tsunami waves triggered by seismic events and (2) local sea level rise associated with local tectonic subsidence. Satellite images and DSAS analysis show that, in the barrier spit, accretion and erosion have been in dynamic equilibrium for at least three decades. PCA results indicate that dry and cold weather conditions, El Nino modes, and tropical cyclone occurrence with high accretional rates on the barrier spit are the main controls on the beach-dune ridges. We conclude that the multi-method approach used in this research is suitable to tease out the landscape evolution of a barrier spit from a climatic and geomorphological perspective, as we were able to identify that the accretional episodes of El Mogote bar are mainly related to rainfall during the coldest and driest environmental conditions that enhance sediment supply from continental areas to the coast.

TI  - Forest fuel type classification: Review of remote sensing techniques, constraints and future trends
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Improved forest management plans require a better understanding of wildfire risk and behavior to enhance the conservation of biodiversity and plan effective risk mitigation activities across the landscape. More particularly, for spatial fire hazard and risk assessing as well as fire intensity and growth modeling across a landscape, an adequate knowledge of the spatial distribution of key forest fuels attributes is required. Mapping fuel attributes is a challenging and complicated procedure because fuels are highly variable and complex. To simplify, classifi-cation schemes are used to summarize the large number of fuel attributes (e.g., height, density, continuity, arrangement, size, form, etc.) into fuel types which groups vegetation classes with a similar predicted fire behavior. Remote sensing is a cost-effective and objective technology that have been used to regularly map fuel types and have demonstrated greater success compared to traditional field surveys, especially with recent ad-vancements in remote sensing data acquisition and fusion techniques. Thus, the main goal of this manuscript is to provide a comprehensive review of the recent remote sensing approaches used for fuel type classification. We build on findings from previous review manuscripts and focus on identifying the key challenges of different mapping approaches and the research gaps that still need to be filled in. To improve classification outcomes, more research into developing state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms with integrated remote sensing data sources is encouraged for future research. This review can be used as a guideline for practitioners, researchers, and decision-makers in the domain of fire management service.

TI  - A novel framework for fine-grained spatio-temporal change detection in satellite images
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Change Detection(CD), in the context of remote sensing, determines the differences in different portions of land images when studied over a while. Human change detection and analysis are limited and prone to errors and are incompetent for the scale and speed required for processing satellite data. Automating CD of earth surface features helps humans develop a deeper understanding of the changes in natural phenomena. In this work, we propose a novel framework for detecting the changes in the satellite images using the Siamese based neural network pipeline. Based on Spatio-Temporal analysis, our approach leverages the divide and conquer paradigm to divide the original image into sub-images and then uses the convolution layers to extract the feature maps at a sub-image level to detect fine-grained changes. To evaluate our proposed approach, we used a recently released dataset in 2020, LEVIR-CD, which consists of 637 pairs of high resolution images. In our work, we experimentally establish that decreasing the sub-image size of the original input image increases the accuracy of change detection, with the best performance achieved at 2 x 2 sub-image level with the best recall and F1-score with values 92% and 91.5%, respectively, outperforming the previous best results. Further, we find that our novel framework performs well on different terrains, with varying amounts and types of changes in the satellite image.

TI  - Quantifying the effectiveness of shaded fuel breaks from ground-based, aerial, and spaceborne observations
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Shaded fuel breaks are treatments that aim to mitigate wildfires by establishing linearly aligned locations where wildfire suppression efforts can be more effective at stopping wildfires. Despite the potential of fuel breaks to alter fire behavior, there have been limited quantitative assessments of their effectiveness following exposure to wildfires. In addition, wildfires often occur in complex terrains that are difficult to access with ground vehicles and sensors, posing challenges for data acquisition. However, the use of Remote-controlled Aerial Vehicles (RAVs), such as drones, is becoming increasingly popular as a viable means of conducting high-resolution ob-servations in areas of interest. This study presents the results from a unique opportunity to utilize three distinct observation scale platforms (in-situ, aerial, and spaceborne) to investigate the burn severity impacts across a prior shaded fuel break that serendipitously encountered the 2020 Creek Fire in the Sierra Nevada forests of California, USA. To provide a direct measure of fire severity, ground-based measurements determined the per-centage crown volume (PCV) of scorch and char as a function of distance from the fuel break edge. Along five transects of the fuel break, we also utilized visible bands from drone imagery and digital photogrammetry, to generate georeferenced orthophotos and quantify vegetation health using the Green Leaf Index (GLI). We also quantified burn severity by computing the Delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and vegetation health using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel 2 spaceborne observations. Our results indicate that within the fuel break, the PCV of char is 2 x less than it was outside of it (with PCV char declining at a rate of 2% per 3 m into the fuel break). Burn severity is 5 x less, and vegetation health is approximately 3 x greater within the fuel break compared to directly outside. Furthermore, postfire vegetation health was only 1 x less within the fuel break compared to the pre fire condition, whereas it was 5 x less in the surrounding region. The results confirm that the fuel break altered the fire behavior, reducing the fire intensity, thereby proving effective at reducing fire burn severity and preserving vegetation health within the fuel break.

TI  - Nodal frozen section plus elective neck dissection as an alternative to sentinel lymph node biopsy for the management of cT1-2N0 oral squamous cell carcinoma patients: a viability and accuracy study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeOral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is characterized by a high aggressiveness and a tendency to metastasize. The management of the neck in cT1-2N0 patients c follows three strategies: watchful waiting, elective neck dissection (END) or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The aim was to assess the viability of intraoperative frozen sections of the nodes of cT1-2N0 to spot occult metastases as an alternative to SLNB, performing a modified radical neck dissection (MRND) in intraoperatively positive patients. Methods: The patients were treated at the Maxillo-Facial Surgery Unit of Policlinico San Marco of Catania between 2020 and 2022. END was performed in all patients, including frozen section examination of at least one clinically suspicious node per level. In case of positivity after frozen section examination, neck dissection was extended to levels IV and V. Results: All frozen sections were compared with a definitive test after paraffin inclusion. During surgery, 70 END were performed, and 210 nodes were analyzed with frozen sections. Among the 70 END, 52 were negative after frozen Sects. (156 negative nodes), and surgery was ended. Five of the 52 negative ENDs resulted in pN + after paraffin inclusion (9.6%), which underwent postoperative adjuvant treatment. The sensibility of our END + frozen section method was 75%, while the specificity of our test was 94%. The negative predictive value was 90,4%.ConclusionsElective neck dissection + intraoperative frozen section could be an alternative to SLNB to spot occult nodal metastases in cT1-2N0 OSCC due to the opportunity to perform a one-step diagnostic/therapeutic procedure.

TI  - From "Confusion" and "Fear" to "Broadened Horizons." Students' Transformative Experiences in Two Higher Education Contexts: Argentina and Sweden
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSFORMATIVE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This article explores students' experiences of intellectual, social, and emotional growth during the first year at university and the extent to which these experiences can be considered transformative (Mezirow, 1981). The study is a qualitative interpretive multiple-case study built on semi-structured interviews with students in two higher education contexts, Argentina and Sweden. The results show that most students experience similarly interrelated changes concerning self-confidence, knowledge- and language-abilities, critical thinking, and values and beliefs. For some students, these changes lead to profound shifts in how they perceive themselves and their possibilities. Such transformative experiences are emancipatory and empowering, giving students more control over their lives. Other students are gradually changing, experiencing growth in knowledge, literacy, and self-confidence. However, they do not yet experience profound changes in their worldview and how they perceive themselves. Contextual factors related to family life and future profession affect the significance students attach to experienced changes.

TI  - Assessing the impact of coexposure on the measurement of biomarkers of exposure to the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin in agricultural workers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - There are few published data on the impact of combined exposure to multiple pesticides (coexposure) on levels of biomarkers of exposure in workers, which may alter their toxicokinetics and thus the interpretation of biomonitoring data. This study aimed to assess the impact of coexposure to two pesticides with shared metabolism pathways on levels of biomarkers of exposure to pyrethroid pesticides in agricultural workers. The pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin (LCT) and the fungicide captan were used as sentinel pesticides, since they are widely sprayed concomitantly in agricultural crops. Eighty-seven (87) workers assigned to different tasks (application, weeding, picking) were recruited. The recruited workers provided two-consecutive 24-h urine collections following an episode of lambda-cyhalothrin application alone or in combination with captan or following tasks in the treated fields, as well as a control collection. Concentrations of lambda-cyhalothrin metabolites - 3-(2-chloro3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-en-1-yl)-2,2-dimethyl-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (CFMP) and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA) - were measured in the samples. Potential determinants of exposure established in a previous study, including the task performed and personal factors were documented by questionnaire. Multivariate analyses showed that coexposure did not have a statistically significant effect on the observed urinary levels of 3-PBA (Exp (8) (95% confidence interval (95% CI)): 0.94 (0.78-1.13)) and CFMP (1.10 (0.93-1.30). The repeated biological measurements ("time variable") - defined as the within-subjects variable - was a significant predictor of observed biological levels of 3-PBA and CFMP; the within-subjects variance (Exp(8) (95% (95% CI)) for 3-PBA and CFMP was 1.11 (1.09-3.49) and 1.25 (1.20-1.31). Only the main occupational task was associated with urinary levels of 3-PBA and CFMP. Compared to the weeding or picking task, the pesticide application task was associated with higher urinary 3-PBA and CFMP concentrations. In sum, coexposure to agricultural pesticides in the strawberry fields did not increase pyrethroid biomarker concentrations at the exposure levels observed in the studied workers. The study also confirmed previous data suggesting that applicators were more exposed than workers assigned to field tasks such as weeding and picking.

TI  - Estimating net primary productivity of semi-arid Crimean pine stands using biogeochemical modelling, remote sensing, and machine learning
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the paper was to predict net primary productivity (NPP) in pure Pinus nigra J.F. Arnold (Crimean pine) stands by consecutively implementing remote sensing, biogeochemical modelling, and machine learning tech-niques. In this context, NPP was estimated using Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA). Following, NPP was re-modelled with spectral characteristics of the P.nigra using multi-temporal remotely sensed images (Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2), land use, soils and meteorological information in a total of 180 temporary sample plots. The model results were validated using litterfall samples from 30 stations for each forest stand, including needle, branch, cone, bark, male flower, and others. The highest relationship was between NPP and male flowers (r =--0.75). In addition, reflectance (R), vegetation indices (VI) and texture (TEX) values (calculated according to filter and degree) for each sample plot were calculated from each sensor. Multiple linear regression (MLR) was applied to define the best subset to model the NPP values with R, VI and TEX values using MLR, support vector machines (SVM) and deep learning (DL) methods. The best prediction accuracy was obtained in TEX data in the SVM method and Sentinel-2 sensor combination. NPP testing determination co-efficiency (R2) values were 0.95. The performance of the male flower litterfall in the validation control was promising for the modelling of NPP in Crimean pine. The TEX properties of the satellite images were well reflected by using different filters, degrees, and functions, resulting in achieving a high success.

TI  - Artificial IntelligenceeAided Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Lymph Node Metastasis on Histologic Slides in a Digital Workflow
T2  - MODERN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying lymph node (LN) metastasis in invasive breast carcinoma can be tedious and time-consuming. We investigated an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to detect LN metastasis by screening hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) slides in a clinical digital workflow. The study included 2 sentinel LN (SLN) cohorts (a validation cohort with 234 SLNs and a consensus cohort with 102 SLNs) and 1 nonsentinel LN cohort (258 LNs enriched with lobular carcinoma and postneoadjuvant therapy cases). All H & E slides were scanned into whole slide images in a clinical digital workflow, and whole slide images were automatically batch-analyzed using the Visiopharm Integrator System (VIS) metastasis AI algorithm. For the SLN validation cohort, the VIS metastasis AI algorithm detected all 46 metastases, including 19 macrometastases, 26 micrometastases, and 1 with isolated tumor cells with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 41.5%, positive predictive value of 29.5%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%. The false positivity was caused by histiocytes (52.7%), crushed lymphocytes (18.2%), and others (29.1%), which were readily recognized during patholo-gists' reviews. For the SLN consensus cohort, 3 pathologists examined all VIS AI annotated H & E slides and cytokeratin immunohistochemistry slides with similar average concordance rates (99% for both modalities). However, the average time consumed by pathologists using VIS AI annotated slides was significantly less than using immunohistochemistry slides (0.6 vs 1.0 minutes, P 1/4 .0377). For the nonsentinel LN cohort, the AI algorithm detected all 81 metastases, including 23 from lobular carcinoma and 31 from postneoadjuvant chemotherapy cases, with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 78.5%, positive predictive value of 68.1%, and NPV of 100%. The VIS AI algorithm showed perfect sensitivity and NPV in detecting LN metastasis and less time consumed, suggesting its potential utility as a screening modality in routine clinical digital pathology workflow to improve efficiency.& COPY; 2023 United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.

TI  - Recent estimates of the ground deformation from remote sensing and terrestrial data around the High Dam Area, Aswan, Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aswan High Dam, located in southern Egypt, is considered one of the most strategic engineering structures in Egypt. After its full operation of the dam in 1971, a series of micro-earthquakes occurred around the High Dam. The largest seismic event recorded in the region was in November 14, 1981, earth-quake with a magnitude of 5.6 ML, located 60 km to the southwest of the dam. Due to the great impor-tance of this area, a combination of remote sensing (InSAR) and terrestrial data (precise leveling) was used to shed light on the current state of crustal deformation in this area. The data collected from three leveling lines (six campaigns) covering the period 2013-2022 in addition to 107 SAR scenes (2017-2021) from the Sentinel-1 mission were used to estimate the up-to-date ground deformation of the study area. The results from both Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) and leveling measurements show that the fault nor-mal velocity of the Spillway fault is approximately 3 & PLUSMN; 0.15 mm/yr. The obtained results coincide with the seismicity pattern recorded in the study area, as the seismic events close to the dam are characterized by normal fault mechanisms. Outcomes show the importance of combining terrestrial (leveling) and space geodetic techniques (InSAR) to map the active faults and estimate the deformation rates along these faults.& COPY; 2023 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Does stroke-associated pneumonia play an important role on risk of in-hospital mortality associated with severe stroke? A four-way decomposition analysis of a national cohort of stroke patients
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STROKE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Severe strokes and stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) have long been associated with poorer patient health outcomes, for example, in-hospital mortality. However, it is unclear what role SAP plays in the risk of in-hospital mortality associated with a severe stroke at admission. Methods: Using the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Program data on stroke admissions (2013-2018) in England and Wales, we modeled the "total" effect for severe stroke on risk of in-hospital mortality. Through four-way decomposition methodology, we broke down the "total" observed risk into four components. The direct "severity on outcome only" effect, the pure indirect effect of severity mediated via SAP only, the interaction between severity and SAP when mediation is not present, and when mediation via SAP is present. Results: Of 339,139 stroke patients included, 9.4% had SAP and 15.6% died in hospital. Of SAP patients, 45% died versus 12% of non-SAP patients. The risk ratio for in-hospital mortality associated with severe versus mild/moderate stroke (i.e. total effect) was 4.72 (95% confidence interval: 4.60-4.85). Of this, 43%-increased risk was due to additive SAP interaction, this increased to 50% for "very severe" stroke. The remaining excess relative risk was due to the direct severity on outcome effect only, that is, there was no evidence here for a mediation effect via SAP. Conclusion: SAP was associated with a higher mortality in severe stroke patients. Prioritizing SAP prevention in severe stroke patients may improve in-hospital survival. Our results suggest that in severe stroke patients avoiding SAP might result in an up to 43% reduction in mortality.

TI  - Estimation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions at different scales for assessing SDG indicators: Method and application
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2 is one of the major causes of global warming. Accurate esti-mation of anthropogenic carbon emissions is significant for the government to monitor CO2 emissions timely and formulate emission reduction policies. To explore the application potential of interannual carbon emission dis-tribution estimated by remotely-sensed data in monitoring carbon-related indicators of SDGs, this study con-structed 0.2 degrees grid-scale and municipal-scale anthropogenic CO2 emission models in mainland China and calculated carbon intensity and total CO2 emissions from 2015 to 2020. SDG indicator 9.4.1 and 13.2.2 were used as model indicators to evaluate the achievement of cities in each province. The experimental results show that all cities in Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guizhou Province, as well as Beijing, Chongqing, and Shanghai City, have reached the indicator 9.4.1. For the indicator 13.2.2, 15.6% of the cities have successfully controlled the growth of total carbon emissions, among which the Yangtze River Delta controlled well while that in the western region were slowly decreasing. Other cities still have a certain distance to reach the indicator 9.4.1 and 13.2.2. Using remote sensing data to quantify anthropogenic CO2 emissions at different scales can assist local governments in monitoring key energy-using units according to the emission distribution results and can also effectively solve the problems of lagging, absent and opacity of carbon emission statistics. It can provide indirect evidences for assessing local SDG indicators and technical support for relevant institutions to make decisions based on local conditions.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 on spatio-temporal variation of aerosols and air pollutants concentration over India derived from MODIS, OMI and AIRS
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The atmospheric aerosols and air pollutants affect the earth's atmosphere, human health and climate system. Human-induced aerosols and air pollutants are the major causes of the deterioration of air quality. The COVID-19 lockdown restricted the movement of people and vehicles, stopped industrial and agricultural activities and may have impacts on the aerosols in the atmosphere. Spatio-temporal map of MODIS Terra AOD_550 nm, OMI Aura UVAI, Ozone, NO2, SO2 and AIRS CO during the lockdown illustrates the significant reduction in their concentration. During the lockdown, the North India shows a record reduction of over 20% in Aerosol Optical Depth and Aerosol Index values. A substantial decrease in AOD and AI was also observed in Eastern and Western parts of India. The average AOD value were reduced from 1.36 (2016-2019) to 1.09 (2020) over India during the lockdown. The satellite-retrieved aerosol variables over India recorded lowest AOD values on 29th March, 2020 (0.2566) and 21st April 2020 (0.2591). Similarly, air pollutants CO, NO2 and SO2 also significantly reduced in India. Despite all variables showing a reduction in concentration, Ozone recorded an increase in value during lockdown primarily over North and North-eastern parts of India. Western India recorded a substantial reduction in SO2 (47%) followed by Central India (31%). As pan India is considered, CO was reduced by 1%, NO2 reduced by 15.29% and SO2 was reduced by 26.82% during the lockdown period. This abrupt reduction in aerosol and air pollutants concentration over India was mainly due to the lockdown of COVID-19.

TI  - A dual-encoder U-Net for landslide detection using Sentinel-2 and DEM data
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely landslide mapping plays a critical role in emergency response and long-term land use planning. Deep learning-based methods represented by convolutional neural networks have been widely exploited in automatic landslide detection for their outstanding capability of feature representation and end-to-end learning mode. Most of the recent deep learning-based studies used toll-access high-resolution imagery for landslide detection. Considering demands for the future large-scale landslide mapping, this study aims to develop a new deep learning-based method to detect landslides using medium-resolution imagery and digital elevation model (DEM) data which are free-access and covered globally. Firstly, a workflow for constructing the landslide dataset is developed. Then, we design a semantic segmentation model to learn deep features and generate per-pixel landslide predictions. Specifically, the proposed network has a dual-encoder architecture with feature fusion to hierarchically represent deep features from the optical bands and DEM data. We also employ a self-attention module in the decoder of the proposed network to improve the performance. Experiments on two regions demonstrate that our method achieves the best F1 score of 79.24%, outperforming SegNet, U-Net, and Attention U-Net, the models popularly used in the semantic segmentation-based landslide detection. The proposed method may have an application potential in disaster risk assessment and post-disaster reconstruction and provide a technical reference for the large-scale landslide mapping in the future.

TI  - Performance evaluation of MODIS and VIIRS satellite AOD products over the Indian subcontinent
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the first systematic performance evaluation of aerosol optical depth (AOD) products retrieved using two satellite sensors i.e., Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Aqua-Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is carried out over India. We have used ground-based AOD from AERONET at 550 nm wavelength for inter-comparison with MODIS Aqua version C6.1 (C061) Deep Blue (DB) aerosol product and VIIRS/SNPP collection version 1.1 (V1.1) DB aerosol product over the time span of 7-year (2014-2020) observation periods. For validation, the average value of satellite pixels falling within the box of 50 Km x 50 Km keeping the AERONET station at the center is retrieved. The average daily data from the AERONET sun photometer (2014-2019) were obtained within +/- 15 min of satellite overpass time. Statistical parameters like correlation coefficient (R), RMSE, MAE, and RMB were calculated. The uncertainty of satellite AOD is evaluated using an envelope of Expected Error (EE = +/- 0.05 + 0.15 AOD for land). Statistical analysis shows that the MODIS AOD product outperforms VIIRS-retrieved AOD. The AOD retrieved from both sensors yields a high correlation (0.86-Jaipur, 0.79-Kanpur, 0.84-Gandhi College, and 0.74-Pune for MODIS and 0.75-Jaipur, 0.77-Kanpur, 0.49-Gandhi College, and 0.86-Pune for VIIRS) and low MAE (0.12-Jaipur, 0.20-Kanpur, 0.15-Gandhi College, and 0.09-Pune for MODIS and 0.13-Jaipur, 0.13-Kanpur, 0.26-Gandhi College, and 0.10-Pune for VIIRS). Other statistical measures such as RMSE, RMB, and P also suggest similar performance. More than 66% of the total data fall within the range of EE for both the satellite products at each station. Spatial comparison exhibits the same AOD pattern seasonally as well as annually having a minimum bias from -0.3 to +0.3 between MODIS and VIIRS. Slight underestimation and overestimation are observed in all the stations by MODIS, whereas VIIRS continuously underestimates AOD with increase in optical depth, suggesting improvements in the aerosol model and surface reflection in retrieval. Overall, the comparison of ground AERONET AOD reveals better accuracy of MODIS AOD with that of VIIRS satellite datasets over India.

TI  - Snow-vegetation-atmosphere interactions in alpine tundra
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The interannual variability of snow cover in alpine areas is increasing, which may affect the tightly coupled cycles of carbon and water through snow-vegetation-atmosphere interactions across a range of spatio-temporal scales. To explore the role of snow cover for the land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 and water vapor in alpine tundra ecosystems, we combined 3 years (2019-2021) of continuous eddy covariance flux measurements of the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and evapotranspiration (ET) from the Finse site in alpine Norway (1210 ma.s.l.) with a ground-based ecosystem-type classification and satellite imagery from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and MODIS. While the snow conditions in 2019 and 2021 can be described as site typical, 2020 features an extreme snow accumulation associated with a strong negative phase of the Scandinavian pattern of the synoptic atmospheric circulation during spring. This extreme snow accumulation caused a 1-month delay in melt-out date, which falls in the 92nd percentile in the distribution of yearly melt-out dates in the period 2001-2021. The melt-out dates follow a consistent fine-scale spatial relationship with ecosystem types across years. Mountain and lichen heathlands melt out more heterogeneously than fens and flood plains, while late snowbeds melt out up to 1 month later than the other ecosystem types. While the summertime average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was reduced considerably during the extreme-snow year 2020, it reached the same maximum as in the other years for all but one of the ecosystem types (late snowbeds), indicating that the delayed onset of vegetation growth is compensated to the same maximum productivity. Eddy covariance estimates of NEE and ET are gap-filled separately for two wind sectors using a random forest regression model to account for complex and nonlinear ecohydrological interactions. While the two wind sectors differ markedly in vegetation composition and flux magnitudes, their flux response is controlled by the same drivers as estimated by the predictor importance of the random forest model, as well as by the high correlation of flux magnitudes (correlation coefficient r D 0 :92 for NEE and r D 0 :89 for ET) between both areas. The 1-month delay of the start of the snow-free season in 2020 reduced the total annual ET by 50% compared to 2019 and 2021 and reduced the growing-season carbon assimilation to turn the ecosystem from a moderate annual carbon sink (31 to -6 gCm(-2) yr(-1)) to a source (34 to 20 gCm(-2) yr(-1)). These results underpin the strong dependence of ecosystem structure and functioning on snow dynamics, whose anomalies can result in important ecological extreme events for alpine ecosystems.

TI  - The worldview and interculturality in the training of entrepreneurs: a model of participatory edu-communication in Ecuador
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The education system in Ecuador has historically been structured in a way that excludes women, especially those living in the urban-marginal and rural sectors, where access and permanence are hindered by socio-economic and cultural factors. The objective of the study is the design of an Intercultural Edu-communication Model for the Training of Women Entrepreneurs (MEIFE), which recognizes and legitimizes intersectionality, Interculturality and the gender approach, as a sustainable path towards Good Living or "sumak kawsay". The methodology used is based on participatory research that includes a qualitative-quantitative method, in which direct observation, interviews and surveys were used as techniques. The design was elaborated considering sources of indigenous, Afro-Ecuadorian and mestizo thought. The study shows that the education system for women in Imbabura widens the gap in the rural sector: only 33% of the women surveyed have completed six years of basic education, and 15%, although they passed one or more courses, did not finish. Regarding secondary education, 14% of women have completed all years of secondary education, and 17.85% have attended one year of study. Seven per cent of the women surveyed had not attended formal education. In response, MEIFE is a non-formal education tool aimed at women entrepreneurs, developed taking into account the indigenous worldview, who form part of a community where it is necessary to create opportunities and encourage initiatives that allow them to generate income and guarantee their autonomy in coherence with their ancestral culture.

TI  - Contextuality without Incompatibility
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The existence of incompatible measurements is often believed to be a feature of quantum theory which signals its inconsistency with any classical worldview. To prove the failure of classicality in the sense of Kochen-Specker noncontextuality, one does indeed require sets of incompatible measurements. However, a more broadly applicable notion of classicality is the existence of a generalized-noncontextual ontological model. In particular, this notion can imply constraints on the representation of outcomes even within a single nonprojective measurement. We leverage this fact to demonstrate that measurement incompatibility is neither necessary nor sufficient for proofs of the failure of generalized noncontextuality. Furthermore, we show that every proof of the failure of generalized noncontextuality in a quantum prepare-measure scenario can be converted into a proof of the failure of generalized noncontextuality in a corresponding scenario with no incompatible measurements.

TI  - Multiscale (microscopic to remote sensing) preliminary exploration of auriferous-uraniferous marbles: A case study from the Egyptian Nubian Shield
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since their recent first record within the Egyptian Nubian Shield, auriferous and uraniferous marbles (Au = 0.98-2.76 g/t; U = 133-640 g/t) have rarely been addressed, despite not only their probable economic importance but also the fact that it is a new genetic style of gold and uranium mineralization in the Nubian Shield rocks. This is mainly attributed to the inadequate localization of these marbles within harsh terrains, as well as the cost and time spent with conventional fieldwork for their identification compared to the main lithological components of the Nubian Shield. On the contrary, remote sensing and machine learning techniques save time and effort while introducing reliable feature identification with reasonable accuracy. Consequently, the current research is an attempt to apply the well-known machine learning algorithm (Support vector Machine-SVM) over Sentinel 2 remote sensing data (with a spatial resolution of up to 10 m) to delineate the distribution of auriferous-uraniferous marbles in the Barramiya-Daghbagh district (Eastern Desert of Egypt), as a case study from the Nubian Shield. Towards better results, marbles were accurately distinguished utilizing ALOS PRISM (2.5 m) pan-sharpened Sentinel 2 data and well-known exposures during fieldwork. With an overall accuracy of more than 90%, a thematic map for auriferous-uraniferous marbles and the major rock units in the Barramiya-Daghbagh district was produced. Marbles are spatially related to ophiolitic serpentinite rocks, as consistent with their genesis within the Neoproterozoic oceanic lithosphere. Field and petrographic investigations have confirmed the newly detected Au and U-bearing zones (impure calcitic to impure dolomitic marbles in Wadi Al Barramiya and Wadi Daghbagh areas and impure calcitic marble in Gebel El-Rukham area). Additionally, X-ray diffraction (XRD), back-scattered electron images (BSEIs), and Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) results were integrated to verify our remote sensing results and petrographic investigations. Different times of mineralization are indicated, ranging from syn-metamorphism (gold in Wadi Al Barramiya and Gebel El-Rukham) to post-metamorphism (gold in Wadi Daghbagh and uranium in all locations). Based on the application of geological, mineralogical, machine learning and remote sensing results for the construction of a preliminary exploration model of the auriferous-uraniferous marble in the Egyptian Nubian Shield, we recommend a detailed exploration of Au and U-bearing zones in Barramiya-Dghbagh district and applying the adopted approach to other districts of similar geological environments.

TI  - Assessment of germplasm resource and detection of genomic signature under artificial selection of Zhikong scallop<i> (Chlamys</i><i> farreri)</i>
T2  - AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri) is an economically important bivalve species and a major contributor to aquaculture in China as it is nutrient-dense and has a large adductor muscle. Farming and artificial breeding of this species mainly have relied mainly upon natural collected seed to be moved onto farms or be artificially bred. Hence, it is vital to determine the current status of C. farreri germplasm resources. In the present study, we genotyped six natural populations around the Shandong Peninsula in Northern China as well as populations of the artificially selected PR and ZY strains characterized by rapid growth and high survival. We identified 19,438 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that evenly distributed across the C. farreri genome. All populations exhibited high levels of genetic diversity, including high heterozygosity (Ho: 0.280-0.311) and low inbreeding (Fis: - 0.087-0.019). They also displayed a high frequency of rare alleles (13.80%-23.63%). Hence, these germplasms could be applied toward the genetic improvement of this species. A population analysis revealed no obvious genetic differentiation among natural populations. In contrast, the artificially selected populations in general, and the ZY strain in particular, significantly differed from the natural ones (Fst > 0.05). A selective sweep analysis indicated that 95 regions containing 76 genes, and 118 regions containing 99 genes, showed significant selection signatures in PR and ZY, respectively. These candidate genes may regulate various biological processes including growth, reproduction, and stress resistance, and account for the rapid growth and stress-resistance characteristic ZY and PR. The results of this work provide valuable information for resource management and germplasm improvement in C. farreri, and contribute to understand the genetic basis of selective breeding in scallop.

TI  - Ecodatacube.eu: analysis-ready open environmental data cube for Europe
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The article describes the production steps and accuracy assessment of an analysisready, open-access European data cube consisting of 2000-2020+ Landsat data, 2017-2021+ Sentinel-2 data and a 30 m resolution digital terrain model (DTM). The main purpose of the data cube is to make annual continental-scale spatiotemporal machine learning tasks accessible to a wider user base by providing a spatially and temporally consistent multidimensional feature space. This has required systematic spatiotemporal harmonization, efficient compression, and imputation of missing values. Sentinel-2 and Landsat reflectance values were aggregated into four quarterly averages approximating the four seasons common in Europe (winter, spring, summer and autumn), as well as the 25th and 75th percentile, in order to retain intra-seasonal variance. Remaining missing data in the Landsat time-series was imputed with a temporal moving window median (TMWM) approach. An accuracy assessment shows TMWM performs relatively better in Southern Europe and lower in mountainous regions such as the Scandinavian Mountains, the Alps, and the Pyrenees. We quantify the usability of the different component data sets for spatiotemporal machine learning tasks with a series of land cover classification experiments, which show that models utilizing the full feature space (30 m DTM, 30 m Landsat, 30 m and 10 m Sentinel-2) yield the highest land cover classification accuracy, with different data sets improving the results for different land cover classes. The data sets presented in the article are part of the EcoDataCube platform, which also hosts open vegetation, soil, and land use/land cover (LULC) maps created. All data sets are available under CC-BY license as Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (ca. 12 TB in size) through SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) and the EcoDataCube data portal.

TI  - An advanced thermal roughness model for airless planetary bodies Implications for global variations of lunar hydration and mineralogical mapping of Mercury with the MERTIS spectrometer
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a combined reflectance and thermal radiance model for airless planetary bodies. The Hapke model provides the reflected component. The developed thermal model is the first to consistently use rough fractal surfaces, self-scattering, self-heating, and diskresolved bolometric albedo for entire planets. We validated the model with disk-resolved lunar measurements acquired by the Chinese weather satellite Gaofen-4 at around 3.5-4.1 mu m and measurements of the Diviner lunar radiometer at 8.25 mu m and 25-41 mu m, finding nearly exact agreement. Further, we reprocessed the thermal correction of the global lunar reflectance maps obtained by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper M3 and employed the new model to correct excess thermal radiance. The results confirm the diurnal, latitudinal, and compositional variations of lunar hydration reported in previous and recent studies with other instruments. Further, we compared the model to lunar measurements obtained by the Mercury Radiometer and Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (MERTIS) on board BepiColombo during a flyby maneuver on April 9, 2020: the measured and the modeled radiance variations across the disk match. Finally, we adapted the thermal model to Mercury for emissivity calibration of upcoming Mercury flyby measurements and in-orbit operation. Although a physical parameter must be invariant under various observation scenarios, the best lunar surface roughness fits vary between different datasets. We critically discuss possible reasons and conclude that anisotropic emissivity modeling has room for improvement and requires attention in future studies.

T2  - FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gene family is responsible for regulating the degradation of Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM) proteins, which are important for physiological processes such as wound healing, tissue remod-eling, and stress response. Although MMPs have been studied in many species, their role in immune response in Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) is still not fully understood. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of MMPs in flounder, including gene structures, evolutionary relationships, conserved domains, mo-lecular evolution, and expression patterns. Analysis revealed that MMP genes could be grouped into 17 sub-families and were evolutionarily conserved and functionally-constrained. Meanwhile, MMP genes were found to express in different embryonic and larval stages and might play the role of sentinel in healthy tissues. Furthermore, expression profiling showed that MMPs had diverse functions in environmental stress, with 60% (9/15) and 73% (11/15) of MMPs showing differential expression patterns under temperature stress and Edwardsiella tarda (E. tarda) infection, respectively. These findings provide a useful resource for understanding the immune functions of MMP genes in Japanese flounder.

T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple surface fissures were reported over the last few years within the Najran valley, southern Saudi Arabia. The earth fissures have been observed mainly in the vicinity of agricultural territories. This study maps the surface deformation of Najran valley using geodetic data and investigates the underlying mechanisms. Indeed, we use Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique with standard Sentinel-1 Geocoded UNWrapped interferogram (GUNW) products acquisition from 2016 to 2022 and processed by Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis (ARIA) project using InSAR Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE). We generate displacement time series using the Miami INsar Time series software in Python language (MintPy). The result shows a rate of subsidence within the Najran valley ranging between 0.2 and 0.6 cm/yr. We processed the Najran GNSS station with time series extended from 2017 to 2022 to validate the observed displacement field. We analyze groundwater variation and soil properties to interpret the results. This assessment verifies that the potential drivers of subsidence might be due to an excessive withdrawal of groundwater, with the potential contribution of other factors related to the sequence of drought and moisture in the soil layer. The presence of a fine-grained layer of soil (clay) suggests a potential impact on the observed deformation. The observed signal and potential underlying mechanism represent one of the classical problems in arid regions worldwide, our investigation is crucial to improve the environmental assessment of Najran valley, which may mitigate any potential future hazards.

TI  - Satellite-based prediction of surface dust mass concentration in southeastern Iran using an intelligent approach
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The southeastern section of Iran, especially the province of Khuzestan, experience severe air pollution levels, such as high values of surface dust mass concentration (SDMC). The province lacks accurate and well-placed ground observational stations, therefore the only viable approach for evaluating SDMC is via remote sensing. In this study, meteorological, hydrological and geological data on 11 input variables from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2), global precipitation measurement (GPM) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) for the year 2018 are used for prediction of the SDMC values, also obtained from another MERRA-2 mission. For real-time prediction, Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) analysis shows that wind-related variables-surface wind speed, surface aerodynamic conductance and surface pressure-are those with the highest correlation with SDMC. Using the gradient boosting regression (GBR) algorithm, these three variables can simulate SDMC with good accuracy (R-2 = 0.76, NSE = 0.76, N-RMSE = 0.48 and N-MAE = 0.34). Furthermore, near-future SDMC forecasting down to 8 days prior of SMDC occurrence is also carried out. A sequential forward feature selection of the input variables, based on PCC, is used for four lead times and results show that surface pressure and heat flux govern near-future predictions. With R-2 = 0.46 and N-RMSE = 0.74, GBR shows good potential for forecasting SDMC 8 days in advance. Real-time and near future simulation results generally show that robust SDMC prediction can be obtained using exclusively remote sensing data, without ground-based observations.

TI  - Use of ICEsat-2 and Sentinel-2 Open Data for the Derivation of Bathymetry in Shallow Waters: Case Studies in Sardinia and in the Venice Lagoon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the high accuracy of conventional acoustic hydrographic systems, measurement of the seabed along coastal belts is still a complex problem due to the limitations arising from shallow water. In addition to traditional echo sounders, airborne LiDAR also suffers from high application costs, low efficiency, and limited coverage. On the other hand, remote sensing offers a practical alternative for the extraction of depth information, providing fast, reproducible, low-cost mapping over large areas to optimize and minimize fieldwork. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) techniques have proven to be a promising alternative to supply shallow-water bathymetry data. However, this methodology is still limited since it usually requires in situ observations as control points for multispectral imagery calibration and bathymetric validation. In this context, this paper illustrates the potential for bathymetric derivation conducted entirely from open satellite data, without relying on in situ data collected using traditional methods. The SDB was performed using multispectral images from Sentinel-2 and bathymetric data collected by NASA's ICESat-2 on two areas of relevant interest. To assess outcomes' reliability, bathymetries extracted from ICESat-2 and derived from Sentinel-2 were compared with the updated and reliable data from the BathyDataBase of the Italian Hydrographic Institute.

TI  - What transforms? - Transformative learning in a sustainability leadership master's program
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTransformative learning and leadership are key leverage points for supporting society's transition towards sustainability. The purpose of this study was to identify the outcomes of transformational learning within an international sustainability leadership master's program in Sweden. The study also prototypes a typology for transformative learning (TTL) in the context of sustainability leadership education. Design/methodology/approachAlumni spanning 15 cohorts provided answers to a survey, and the responses were used to identify the outcomes of the program. Graduates were asked to describe what transformed for them through the program. Empirical data was coded prototyping the use of the TTL in sustainability education context. FindingsGraduates of the Master's in Strategic Leadership towards Sustainability program, described transformation with regards to their Self-in-relation to Others and the World, their Self-knowledge, sense of Empowerment/Responsibility; their Worldview became More Comprehensive or Complex, and they gained New Awareness/New Understandings which transformed their Worldview. Many described transformations in their general Ways of Being in the world. Findings suggest the TTL learning as a good basis for analysis in the education for sustainable development (ESD) context. Suggestions for the TTL include further development of the process that articulates the relational, interdependent and perhaps a priori relationships between elements that transform. Research limitations/implicationsThis study presents the outcomes of transformational learning within an international sustainability leadership master's program. It prototypes the use of a TTL within the ESD context using empirical data. This combination provides practical insights to a dynamic, often theoretical and hard to articulate process. Originality/valueThis study presents the outcomes of transformational learning within an international sustainability leadership master's program. It prototypes the use of a TTL in the ESD context and assesses the outcomes of a sustainability leadership program using empirical data. This combination provides practical insights to a dynamic, often theoretical and hard to articulate process.

TI  - Broadening the focus of forest conservation beyond carbon
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Two concurrent trends are contributing towards a much broader view of forest conservation. First, the appre-ciation of the role of forests as a nature-based climate solution has grown rapidly, particularly among govern-ments and the private sector. Second, the spatiotemporal resolution of forest mapping and the ease of tracking forest changes have dramatically improved. As a result, who does and who pays for forest conser-vation is changing: sectors and people previously considered separate from forest conservation now play an important role and need to be held accountable and motivated or forced to conserve forests. This change requires, and has stimulated, a broader range of forest conservation solutions. The need to assess the out-comes of conservation interventions has motivated the development and application of sophisticated econo-metric analyses, enabled by high resolution satellite data. At the same time, the focus on climate, together with the nature of available data and evaluation methods, has worked against a more comprehensive view of forest conservation. Instead, it has encouraged a focus on trees as carbon stores, often leaving out other important goals of forest conservation, such as biodiversity and human wellbeing. Even though both are intrinsically connected to climate outcomes, these areas have not kept pace with the scale and diversification of forest conservation. Finding synergies between these 'co-benefits', which play out on a local scale, with the carbon objective, related to the global amount of forests, is a major challenge and area for future advances in forest conservation.

TI  - Online prediction tools for melanoma survival: A comparison
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundBreslow thickness, patient age and ulceration are the three most valuable clinical and pathological predictors of melanoma survival. A readily available reliable online tool that accurately considers these and other predictors could be valuable for clinicians managing melanoma patients. ObjectiveTo compare online melanoma survival prediction tools that request user input on clinical and pathological features. MethodsSearch engines were used to identify available predictive nomograms. For each, clinical and pathological predictors were compared. ResultsThree tools were identified. The American Joint Committee on Cancer tool inappropriately rated thin tumours as higher risk than intermediate tumours. The University of Louisville tool was found to have six shortcomings: a requirement for sentinel node biopsy, unavailable input of thin melanoma or patients over 70 years of age and less reliable hazard ratio calculations for age, ulceration and tumour thickness. The LifeMath.net tool was found to appropriately consider tumour thickness, ulceration, age, sex, site and tumour subtype in predicting survival. LimitationsThe authors did not have access to the base data used to compile various prediction tools. ConclusionThe LifeMath.net prediction tool is the most reliable for clinicians in counselling patients with newly diagnosed primary cutaneous melanoma regarding their survival prospects.

TI  - An improved nomogram including elastography for the prediction of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients with 1 or 2 sentinel lymph node metastases
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe rate of breast-conserving surgery is very low in China, compared with that in developed countries; most breast cancer patients receive mastectomy. It is great important to explore the possibility of omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in early-stage breast cancer patients with 1 or 2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in China. The aim of this study was to develop a nomogram based on elastography for the prediction of the risk of non-SLN (NSLN) metastasis in early-stage breast cancer patients with 1 or 2 positive SLNs. MethodsA total of 601 breast cancer patients were initially recruited. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 118 early-stage breast cancer patients with 1 or 2 positive SLNs were finally enrolled and were assigned to the training cohort (n=82) and the validation cohort (n=36), respectively. In the training cohort, the independent predictors were screened by logistic regression analysis and then were used to conducted the nomogram for the prediction of NSLN metastasis in early-stage breast cancer patients with 1 or 2 positive SLNs. The calibration curves, concordance index (C-index), the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), and Decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to verified the performance of the nomogram. ResultsThe multivariable analysis showed that the enrolled patients with positive HER2 expression (OR=6.179, P=0.013), Ki67 >= 14% (OR=8.976, P=0.015), larger lesion size (OR=1.038, P=0.045), and higher Emean (OR=2.237, P=0.006) were observed to be the independent factors of NSLN metastasis. Based on the above four independent predictors, a nomogram was conducted to predict the risk of the NSLN metastasis in early-stage breast cancer patients with 1 or 2 positive SLNs. The nomogram showed good discrimination in the prediction of NSLN metastasis, with bias-corrected C-index of 0.855 (95% CI, 0.754-0.956) and 0.853 (95% CI, 0.724-0.983) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Furthermore, the AUC was 0.877 (95%CI: 0.776- 0.978) and 0.861 (95%CI: 0.732-0.991), respectively, indicating a good performance of the nomogram. The calibration curve suggested a satisfactory agreement between the predictive and actual risk in both the training (chi 2 = 11.484, P=0.176, HL test) and validation (chi 2 = 6.247, p = 0.620, HL test) cohorts, and the obvious clinical nets were revealed by DCA. ConclusionsWe conducted a satisfactory nomogram model to evaluate the risk of NSLN metastasis in early-stage breast cancer patients with 1 or 2 SLN metastases. This model could be considered as an ancillary tool to help such patients to be selectively exempted from ALND.

TI  - Evaluation of Whole Carcass Composting as a Mortality Disposal Option for African Swine Fever Virus-Infected Swine
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - African swine fever (ASF) epizootic outbreaks often result in the deaths of large numbers of swine either through confirmed or suspected disease or depopulation for outbreak control. Identification of effective biosecure livestock mortality disposal methods, capable of inactivating ASF virus (ASFV) in contaminated carcasses, remains an important component for development of localized outbreak response and recovery plans. In this study, we evaluated ASFV inactivation and viral DNA degradation during composting of ASFV-infected swine carcasses in an Animal Biosafety Level 3-Ag (ABSL3-Ag) high-containment vivarium utilizing virus isolation (VI) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Four ASFV-infected pigs, approximately 54 kg, were composted for 37 days in a static, nonaerated windrow assembled using wood chips, horse manure, and pine shavings as the primary sources of carbon. The windrow daily temperature was sustained at >= 55 degrees C for 18 days. Spleen samples, collected over 28 days, were negative for infectious ASFV by virus isolation on day 5 but remained positive for ASFV DNA by RT-PCR through day 28. At the conclusion of the study, bone marrow, muscle, and pinna samples were collected from composted carcasses, in addition to carbon materials in the windrow. No infectious ASFV was detected by virus isolation in any of the decomposed tissues or carbon samples. However, ASFV DNA remained detectable in all swine tissues (n = 36) and in 14/16 sentinel carbon samples at the end of the study, indicating that positive detection of ASFV DNA did not correlate with virus infectivity. In conclusion, infectious ASFV was rapidly eliminated in ASFV-infected swine during composting of whole carcasses by day 5, coinciding with a temperature increase in the compost pile to >= 55 degrees C.

TI  - An Extraction Method for Large Gradient Three-Dimensional Displacements of Mining Areas Using Single-Track InSAR, Boltzmann Function, and Subsidence Characteristics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an extraction method for large gradient three-dimensional (3-D) displacements of mining areas using single-track interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), Boltzmann function, and subsidence characteristics. This is mainly aimed at overcoming the limitations of surface deformation monitoring in mining areas by using single-track InSAR technology. One is that the rapid and large gradient deformation of the mine surface usually leads to image decoherence, which makes it difficult to obtain correct deformation information. Second, the surface deformation monitored by InSAR is only one-dimensional line of sight (LOS) displacement, and thus it is difficult to reflect the real 3-D displacements of the surface. Firstly, the Boltzmann function prediction model (BPM) is introduced to assist InSAR phase unwrapping; thus the missing large gradient deformation phase of InSAR is recovered. Then, the subsidence characteristics in mining horizontal (or near-horizontal) coal seams are used as prior knowledge for theoretical derivation, and a 3-D displacement extraction model of coal seam mining with single-track InSAR is constructed. The feasibility of the method is verified by simulating LOS displacements with random noise and underestimation phenomenon caused by the large gradient deformation as InSAR observations. The results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of 3-D displacements on the observation line calculated by the proposed method is 21.5 mm, 19.0 mm, and 32.9 mm, respectively. Based on the single-track Sentinel-1 images, the method in this paper was applied to the extraction of surface 3-D displacements in the Huaibei coal mine, and the experimental results show that the extracted 3-D displacements are in good agreement with that of measurement by the surface observation station. The proposed method can adapt to limited InSAR acquisitions and complex monitoring environments.

TI  - Interhemispheric ionosphere-plasmasphere system shows a high sensitivity to the exospheric neutral hydrogen density: a caution of the global reference atmospheric model hydrogen density
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ASTRONOMY AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the impact of the exosphere hydrogen (H) density on the ionosphere-plasmasphere system using a model whose key inputs are constrained by ionosphere observations at both ends of the magnetic field line with an L-value of 1.75 in the American longitudinal sector during a period with low solar and magnetic activities. This study is the first to be validated by ground-based and satellite data in the plasmasphere and both hemispheres. The main finding is that the entire ionosphere-plasmasphere system is very sensitive to the neutral hydrogen density in the lower exosphere. It was found that an increase in the H density by a factor of 2.75 from the commonly accepted values was necessary to bring the simulated plasma density into satisfactory agreement with Arase satellite measurements in the plasmasphere and also with DMSP satellite measurements in the topside ionospheres of the northern and southern hemispheres. A factor of 2.75 increase in the H density increases the simulated plasma density in the afternoon plasmasphere up to & SIM;80% and in the nighttime topside ionosphere up to & SIM;100%. These results indicate prominently that using the commonly accepted empirical model of the H density causes unacceptable errors in the simulated plasma density of the near-Earth plasma shells. We alert the space science community of this problem.

TI  - A Survey of Practice Patterns for Clinical Nodal Staging Prior to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGIST
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background The importance of clinical staging in breast cancer has increased owing to the wide use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST). This study aimed to investigate the current practice patterns regarding clinical nodal staging in breast cancer in real-world settings. Materials and Methods A web-based survey was administered to board-certified oncologists in Korea, including breast surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists, from January to April 2022. The survey included 19 general questions and 4 case-based questions. Results In total, 122 oncologists (45 radiation, 44 surgical, and 33 medical oncologists) completed the survey. Among them, 108 (88%) responded that clinical staging before NST was primarily performed by breast surgeons. All the respondents referred to imaging studies during nodal staging. Overall, 64 (52.5%) responders determined the stage strictly based on the radiology reports, whereas 58 (47.5%) made their own decision while noting radiology reports. Of those who made their own decisions, 88% referred to the number or size of the suspicious node. Of the 75 respondents involved in prescribing regimens for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 58 (77.3%) responded that the reimbursement regulations in the selection of NST regimens affected nodal staging in clinical practice. In the case-based questions, high variability was observed among the clinicians in the same cases. Conclusions Diverse assessments by specialists owing to the lack of a clear, harmonized staging system for the clinical nodal staging of breast cancer can lead to diverse practice patterns. Thus, practical, harmonized, and objective methods for clinical nodal staging and for the outcomes of post-NST response are warranted for appropriate treatment decisions and accurate outcome evaluation.Nodal stage serves a pivotal role in making treatment decisions in breast cancer patients. This study investigated current practice patterns regarding clinical nodal staging in breast cancer in a real-world setting.

TI  - Identifying alternative stable states in a tropical landscape using remote sensing
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although natural regeneration is often an efficient process for recovering degraded areas, the emergence of invasive species can complicate this process and lead the ecosystem to an alternative stable state (ASS) that disrupts ecosystem functioning. Identifying this condition is a key step in the design of restoration strategies. In this sense, we used a spatially explicit approach using the landscape metric area and the analysis of land-use and land-cover change to identify the dynamics of areas dominated by P. aquilinum, an invasive species well known for producing ASS. In our study site, a Mexican semi-evergreen tropical forest and seasonal lowland flooded forest, P. aquilinum has been in ASS for decades. We analyzed P. aquilinum dynamics in a period of 28 years (1989-2017) using a supervised classification of Landsat imagery. We found that, at the landscape scale, agriculture and livestock increased 224%, while semi-evergreen tropical forest and P. aquilinum cover showed losses of 13% and 72%, respectively. At the patch scale, we also found a statistically significant decrease in P. aquilinum patch area between 1989 and 1997 and 2017, but not between 1997 and 2017. Our results show that the areas dominated by P. aquilinum only change in time mainly through management toward productive activities, while patches not managed retain their area. Our study highlights the importance of spatial scale analysis for the understanding of landscape ecosystem dynamics for guiding decision-making and further research.

TI  - Epidemiology and susceptibility of Nakaseomyces (formerly Candida) glabrata bloodstream isolates from hospitalised adults in South Africa
T2  - MEDICAL MYCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - During 2016-2017, Nakaseomyces glabrata (formerly Candida glabrata) caused 14% of cases of candidaemia in South Africa. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of adults with N. glabrata candidaemia at 20 sentinel hospitals (accounting for 20% (172/917) of cases) and the antifungal susceptibility of the corresponding isolates. A higher proportion of patients with N. glabrata candidaemia were older (median age: 55 years [interquartile range (IQR): 41-65 years] vs. 49 years [IQR: 35-63 years]; p = 0.04), female (87/164, 53% vs. 283/671, 42%; p = 0.01), admitted to a public-sector hospital (152/172, 88% vs. 470/745, 63%; p < 0.001), treated with fluconazole only (most with suboptimal doses) (51/95, 54% vs. 139/361, 39%; p < 0.001), and had surgery (47/172, 27% vs. 123/745, 17%; p = 0.001) and a shorter hospital stay (median 7 days [IQR: 2-20 days] vs. 13 days [IQR: 4-27 days]; p < 0.001) compared to patients with other causes of candidaemia. Eight N. glabrata isolates (6%, 8/131) had minimum inhibitory concentrations in the intermediate or resistant range for & GE; 1 echinocandin and a R1377K amino acid substitution encoded by the hotspot 2 region of the FKS2 gene. Only 11 isolates (8%, 11/131) were resistant to fluconazole. Patients with confirmed N. glabrata candidaemia are recommended to be treated with an echinocandin (or polyene), thus further guideline training is required.Lay Summary Nakaseomyces (formerly Candida) glabrata is a yeast-like fungus that forms part of the commensal gut flora and among people with certain risk factors, can invade into the bloodstream. Nakaseomyces glabrata is a relatively more common cause of candidaemia in high-income vs. low- and middle-income countries. There are no N. glabrata clinical isolates that are considered susceptible to fluconazole, and thus echinocandins are recommended for treatment. However, echinocandin resistance is emerging. We described the characteristics of South African patients with N. glabrata bloodstream infections and the antifungal susceptibility of corresponding isolates. We found that patients infected with N. glabrata were more likely to be older, female, admitted to public hospitals and to be post-surgery and these patients were also more likely to be treated with fluconazole monotherapy and to have stayed a shorter time in hospital compared to patients infected with other Candida species. Only 6% of N. glabrata isolates were echinocandin-resistant with mutations in specific resistance genes that we have found in South African N. glabrata isolates previously. Eight percent of N. glabrata isolates were resistant to fluconazole and the remainder were in the susceptible dose dependent category, requiring higher fluconazole treatment doses. Patients with confirmed N. glabrata bloodstream infection should ideally be treated with an echinocandin or polyene rather than fluconazole and training is required for doctors treating these patients.

TI  - An Assessment of Southeast United States Headwater Tidal Creek Sediment Contamination Over a Twenty-Year Period in Relation to Coastal Development
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Headwater tidal creeks are a primary link between estuarine and upland habitats, serving as conduits for runoff. They are sentinel habitats, providing early warning of potential harm, thus ideal systems to evaluate the effects of coastal suburban and urban development on environmental quality. Estuarine sediments have concentrations of metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) that are associated with human activity. High concentrations of contaminants can impair faunal communities, habitat quality, and ecosystem function. Forty-three headwater creeks were sampled between 1994 and 2006 to assess contaminants, and 18 of these were sampled again in 2014/2015. Watersheds were classified as forested, forested to suburban, suburban, or urban land. These values are based on their percent impervious cover (IC) levels and change in IC from 1994-2014. Analyses of temporal data resulted in significant relationships between IC and select metals, PAHs, pesticides, PCBs, and PBDEs. In addition, 11 of the creeks sampled in 2014/2015 have paired data from 1994/1995, allowing for change analysis over the 20 years. Results indicated increasing chemical contamination occurring with increasing levels of development, although only PAHs and total dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) exhibited a statistically significant increase over time; PAHs also exhibited significantly higher concentrations in developed creeks. Additionally, several metals were deemed enriched in developed creeks based on reference conditions. These results expand our knowledge of how these systems respond to urban development and can inform managers about how human population growth along coastlines may predict altered tidal creek health.

TI  - Unravelling the Interannual Changes in the Decade Observations of GHGs as Climate Indicators
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenhouse gases emitted mainly by anthropogenic activities alter Earth's energy balance and thus its climate. Here, we report the interannual variations of CO2 and CH4 for a decade between the years 2013 and 2022 over the suburban city of Shadnagar, near Hyderabad, India. CO2 and CH4 measurements have been carried out uninterruptedly under Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)-Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (ISRO-GBP) at the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) laboratory and were calibrated periodically against the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reference spans while meeting the World Meteorological Organization standards. Our observations indicate an annual atmospheric CO2 and CH4 growth rate over the area as 2.63 ppm year(-1) and 17 ppb year(-1), respectively, during the 2013-2022 period. A stats model algorithm was applied to the long-term CO2 and CH4 observations to extract the interannual trend, seasonal, and residual components. The regulated activities of the terrestrial biosphere and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are connected to the interannual variability in CO2 growth rates. A sudden spike in the annual growth of CO2 concentration by 5.5 ppm year(-1) in 2017 is attributed to the extended phase of El Nino in 2015-2016. The present study depicted the association of vegetative indexes with the variability of CO2 and CH4 concentrations at the site. Our study has shown that atmospheric CO2 fluctuation is mainly associated with photosynthesis and biogenic respiration besides local and long-range anthropogenic forcing.

TI  - Pregnancy reduces concurrent pup care behaviour in meerkats, generating differences between dominant and subordinate females
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In some mammals, and particularly in cooperative breeding ones, successive bouts of reproduction can overlap so that a female is often pregnant while still nurturing dependent young from her previous litter. Such an overlap requires females to divide their energetic budget between two reproductive activities, and pregnancy costs would consequently be expected to reduce investment in concurrent offspring care. However, explicit evidence for such reductions is scarce, and the potential effects they may have on work division in cooperative breeders have not been explored.Using 25 years of data on reproduction and cooperative behaviour in wild Kalahari meerkats, supplemented with field experiments, we investigated whether pregnancy reduces contributions to cooperative pup care behaviours, including babysitting, provisioning and raised guarding. We also explored whether pregnancy, which is more frequent in dominants than subordinates, could account for the reduced contributions of dominants to the cooperative pup care behaviours.We found that pregnancy, particularly at late stages of gestation, reduces contributions to cooperative pup care; that these reductions are eliminated when the food available to pregnant females is experimentally supplemented; and that pregnancy effects accounted for differences between dominants and subordinates in two of the three cooperative behaviours examined (pup provisioning and raised guarding but not babysitting).By linking pregnancy costs with reductions in concurrent pup care, our findings illuminate a trade-off between investment in successive, overlapping bouts of reproduction. They also suggest that some of the differences in cooperative behaviour between dominant and subordinate females in cooperative breeding mammals can be a direct consequence of differences in their breeding frequency.

TI  - Chir pine forest and pre-monsoon drought determine spatial, and temporal patterns of forest fires in Uttarakhand Himalaya
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Associated with farming practices (between 300 and 2000 m elevations), human-ignited small, and patchy surface forest fires occur almost every year in Uttarakhand (between 28 degrees 43`- 31 degrees 27` N and 77 degrees 34`- 81 degrees 02`E; area 51,125 km(2)), a Himalayan state of India. Using fire incidence data of 19 years (2002-2020) generated by MODIS, we analysed the factors which drive temporal and spatial patterns of fire in the region. The fire incidence data were organized by 24 forest divisions, the unit of state forest management and administration. The standardized regression model showed that pre-monsoon temperature (March to May or mid-June), proportional area of the forest division under chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) forest (positive effect), and pre-monsoon and winter precipitation (negative effect) accounted for 56% of the variance in fire incidence density (FID). The pre-monsoon temperature (warmer) and precipitation (lower) were significantly different in 2009, 2012, 2016 and 2019, the years with high FID (average 54.9 fire/100 km(2)) than the rest of years with low FID (average 20.9 fire/100 km(2)). During the two decades of warming, high FID (> 30 incidence per year /100 km(2)) occurred after every three to four years, and fire peaks tended to increase with time. The study suggests that effective fire management can be attained by improving pre-monsoon precipitation forecasting and targeting forest compartments with a higher occurrence of chir pine and fire-vulnerable oaks. Furthermore, since fires are human-ignited, periodical analysis of changes in population distribution and communities' dependence on forests would need to be conducted.

TI  - Assessing Transferability of Remote Sensing Pasture Estimates Using Multiple Machine Learning Algorithms and Evaluation Structures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Both the vastness of pasturelands and the value they contain-e.g., food security, ecosystem services-have resulted in increased scientific and industry efforts to remotely monitor them via satellite imagery and machine learning (ML). However, the transferability of these models is uncertain, as modelers commonly train and test on site-specific or homogenized-i.e., randomly partitioned-datasets and choose complex ML algorithms with increased potential to overfit a limited dataset. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy and transferability of remote sensing pasture models, using multiple ML algorithms and evaluation structures. Specifically, we predicted pasture above-ground biomass and nitrogen concentration from Sentinel-2 imagery. The implemented ML algorithms include principal components regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), random forest (RF), support vector machine regression (SVR), and a gradient boosting model (GBM). The evaluation structures were determined using levels of spatial and temporal dissimilarity to partition the train and test datasets. Our results demonstrated a general decline in accuracy as evaluation structures increase in spatiotemporal dissimilarity. In addition, the more simplistic algorithms-PCR, PLSR, and LASSO-out-performed the more complex models RF, SVR, and GBM for the prediction of dissimilar evaluation structures. We conclude that multi-spectral satellite and pasture physiological variable datasets, such as the one presented in this study, contain spatiotemporal internal dependence, which makes the generalization of predictive models to new localities challenging, especially for complex ML algorithms. Further studies on this topic should include the assessment of model transferability by using dissimilar evaluation structures, and we expect generalization to improve for larger and denser datasets.

TI  - The savannization of tropical forests in mainland Southeast Asia since 2000
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - ContextTropical forests in mainland Southeast (MSEA) have important conservation values and provide critical ecosystem functioning and services. With climate change and increasing anthropogenic activities, these forests can be lost to other land use types or degraded.ObjectivesWe aim to understand how these forests have changed under the context of MSEA's rapidly changing physical and socioeconomic environments in recent decades.MethodsWe employed satellite-derived tree cover products, primarily the MODIS-based Vegetation continuous field (VCF) data, to investigate changes in forest cover with a focus on potential forest degradation to savannah since 2000 for the four MSEA countries, i.e., Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.ResultsWe found an overall increasing trend of savannah (defined as places with tree cover between 10 and 55%) during the period 2000-2020. However, the sources of the increased savannah area differed significantly between 2000-2009 and 2009-2020: In the earlier decade, the positive trend of the savannah area was primarily attributed to tree regeneration from grasslands; while during the more recent decade, the degradation (savannization) of forests was the major cause. Fire disturbance primarily controlled interannual variation in tree cover for the savannah gain during the period of 2000-2009, while high atmospheric water demand drove the degradation of forests during the period of 2010-2020.ConclusionsOur analysis sheds light on the understanding of changing forest landscapes in a globally important region of tropical forests, which is critical for informing land management and tropical forest protection.

TI  - MCPT: Mixed Convolutional Parallel Transformer for Polarimetric SAR Image Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vision transformers (ViT) have the characteristics of massive training data and complex model, which cannot be directly applied to polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification tasks. Therefore, a mixed convolutional parallel transformer (MCPT) model based on ViT is proposed for fast PolSAR image classification. First of all, a mixed depthwise convolution tokenization is introduced. It replaces the learnable linear projection in the original ViT to obtain patch embeddings. The process of tokenization can reduce computational and parameter complexity and extract features of different receptive fields as input to the encoder. Furthermore, combining the idea of shallow networks with lower latency and easier optimization, a parallel encoder is implemented by pairing the same modules and recombining to form parallel blocks, which can decrease the network depth and computing power requirement. In addition, the original class embedding and position embedding are removed during tokenization, and a global average pooling layer is added after the encoder for category feature extraction. Finally, the experimental results on AIRSAR Flevoland and RADARSAT-2 San Francisco datasets show that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement in training and prediction speed. Meanwhile, the overall accuracy achieved was 97.9% and 96.77%, respectively.

TI  - Developing Spatial and Temporal Continuous Fractional Vegetation Cover Based on Landsat and Sentinel-2 Data with a Deep Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) has a significant role in indicating changes in ecosystems and is useful for simulating growth processes and modeling land surfaces. The fine-resolution FVC products represent detailed vegetation cover information within fine grids. However, the long revisit cycle of satellites with fine-resolution sensors and cloud contamination has resulted in poor spatial and temporal continuity. In this study, we propose to derive a spatially and temporally continuous FVC dataset by comparing multiple methods, including the data-fusion method (STARFM), curve-fitting reconstruction (S-G filtering), and deep learning prediction (Bi-LSTM). By combining Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, the integrated FVC was used to construct the initial input of fine-resolution FVC with gaps. The results showed that the FVC of gaps were estimated and time-series FVC was reconstructed. The Bi-LSTM method was the most effective and achieved the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.857), followed by the data-fusion method (R-2 = 0.709) and curve-fitting method (R-2 = 0.705), and the optimal time step was 3. The inclusion of relevant variables in the Bi-LSTM model, including LAI, albedo, and FAPAR derived from coarse-resolution products, further reduced the RMSE from 5.022 to 2.797. By applying the optimized Bi-LSTM model to Hubei Province, a time series 30 m FVC dataset was generated, characterized by a spatial and temporal continuity. In terms of the major vegetation types in Hubei (e.g., evergreen and deciduous forests, grass, and cropland), the seasonal trends as well as the spatial details were captured by the reconstructed 30 m FVC. It was concluded that the proposed method was applicable to reconstruct the time-series FVC over a large spatial scale, and the produced fine-resolution dataset can support the data needed by many Earth system science studies.

TI  - Inferring geological structural features from geophysical and geological mapping data using machine learning algorithms
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL PROSPECTING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - We present an automated approach for inferring surface geological structures from geophysical survey data. Our method employs machine learning, using mapped geological structures as labels and filtered geophysical surveys as reference maps. We compared the performance of the eight main machine learning algorithms and their 32 branches. Applied to the Geological Survey of Victoria's database for the Bendigo Zone, following an appropriate choice of geological features, the 3-class classification model using subspace K-nearest neighbour methods achieves a stable and validated 92% accuracy in around 1 min. The fault-only classification model achieves a stable and validated 97% accuracy in around 6 min. This shows that geological structural features on the surface may be inferred from between one and three of the following geophysical data types: gravity, airborne total magnetic intensity and first vertical derivative of total magnetic intensity. It shows the prospect of machine learning in geological research and suggests that geophysical data combined with machine learning may be useful and efficient in determining the existence of geological structural features.

TI  - Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Fused Dataset for High Spatial-Temporal Resolution Monitoring of Farmland in China's Diverse Latitudes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop growth and development exhibit high temporal heterogeneity. It is crucial to capture the dynamic characteristics of crop growth using intensive time-series data. However, single satellites are limited by revisit cycles and weather conditions to provide dense time-series data for earth observations. However, up until now, there has been no proposed remote sensing fusion product that offers high spatial-temporal resolution specifically for farmland monitoring. Therefore, focusing on the demands of farmland remote sensing monitoring, identifying quantitative conversion relationships between multiple sensors, and providing high spatial-temporal resolution products is the first step that needs to be addressed. In this study, a fused Landsat 8 (L8) Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) multi-spectral instruments (MSI) data product for regional monitoring of farmland at high, mid, and low latitudes in China is proposed. Two image pairs for each study area covering different years were acquired from simultaneous transits of L8 OLI and S-2 MSI sensors. Then, the isolation forest (iForest) algorithm was employed to remove the anomalous pixels of image pairs and eliminate the influence of anomalous data on the conversion relationships. Subsequently, the adjustment coefficients for multi-source sensors at mixed latitudes with high spatial resolution were obtained using an ordinary least squares regression method. Finally, the L8-S-2 fused dataset based on the adjustment coefficients is proposed, which is suitable for different latitude farming areas in China. The results showed that the iForest algorithm could effectively improve the correlation between the corresponding spectral bands of the two sensors at a spatial resolution of 10 m. After the removal of anomalous pixels, excellent correlation and consistency were obtained in three study areas, and the Pearson correlation coefficients between the corresponding spectral bands almost all exceeded 0.88. Furthermore, we mixed the six image pairs of the three latitudes to obtain the adjustment coefficients derived for integrated L8 and S-2 data with high-spatial-resolution. The significance and accuracy quantification of the adjustment coefficients were thoroughly examined from three dimensions: qualitative and quantitative analyses, and spatial heterogeneity assessment. The obtained results were highly satisfactory, affirming the validity and precision of the adjustment coefficients. Finally, we applied the adjustment coefficients to crop monitoring in three latitudes. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series curves drawn by the integrated dataset could accurately describe the cropping system and capture the intensity changes of crop growth within the high, middle, and low latitudes of China. This study provides valuable insights into enhancing the application of multi-source remote sensing satellite data for long-term, continuous quantitative inversion of surface parameters and is of great significance for crop remote sensing monitoring.
