AB  - The thermal imagine provides data with synoptic coverage for investigating thermal information from hot sources for detecting, mapping energy loss from the industrial area. This study attempts to retrieved heat loss from the industrial area using Landsat-8 TIRS experimented at an industrial area of Pasir Gudang, Peninsular Malaysia, the main objective is to investigate the sensitivity of Landsat-8 TIR for detecting industrial thermal energy within the various range of targets of different temperatures. An estimated heat map with absolute surface temperature values is the final output. Apart of the pre-processing of Landsat-8 TIRS data, data are processed for the retrieval of land surface temperature, then subjected to a downscaling process to final 30 x 30 m pixels, hence enable to merge with all Landsat-8 bands for visualization and validation of results. The split window algorithm (SWA) is used for the temperature retrieval from band 10 and 11, with other driven parameters. The Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) model for spatial downscaling was adopted in this study. The generated thermal energy map was then validated over selected targets in the field and compared to corresponding downscaled MODIS LST product (MODIS11A2). TIR bands applied with SWA generated 13.7 degrees C temperature dynamic range from 22.35 similar to 51.36 degrees C in comparison with MODIS LST product values range from 27.17 similar to 37.65 degrees C). Results indicated good agreement between the generated thermal energy map with the in-situ validations (RMSE=0.43 degrees C). It is therefore concluded that derived Land surface temperature map derived is suitable for study industrial thermal environment at 1:50,000 degrees 100,000 scales, adequately to be used for environmental impact assessment.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 version 7 precipitation data has been extensively used for inter-comparison with observations and model validation. The rain distribution over the Northwest Himalaya (NWH) were found to be accurate with a strong positive correlation of 0.88 between TRMM and India Meteorological Department (IMD) station data, supporting the use of 3B42 V7 for the study of extreme rainfall events (ERE's) over the region. However, many high resolution satellite data sets were made available in the recent past and their potential have not been evaluated for ERE's like cloudbursts in the NWH. The present endeavor aims to provide guidance to the choice of global precipitation data sets (GPDs). In particular, this study is conducted to evaluate three recent satellite-based rainfall products, i.e. Global Precipitation Measurements (GPM), Indian National Satellite System (INSAT 3D), and CPC Morphing Technique (CMORPH), against the highly used TRMM-RT 3B42 V7 precipitation data for the estimation of rainfall episodes in the recent years (2014-2016). Our results reveal that the magnitude of precipitation and location of peak rainfall are biased in INSAT 3D, whereas CMORPH and the high resolution GPM product capture it with relatively higher values of the employed statistical metrics. Also, the rainfall estimates from GPM and CMORPH are in good agreement with TRMM for cloudbursts events. Particularly, high resolution GPM is useful for monitoring the extreme rainfall event in the region.

AB  - Carbon stock estimation is becoming an important component for fighting against global warming. Assessment of biomass can give an idea of the amount of CO2 that can be removed from the atmosphere by forests and other plantations. Geo-Spatial technologies, including Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), offer the mean to enable rapid assessment of terrestrial biomass over large areas in a timely and cost-effective manner, allowing for the estimation of above and below ground biomass. Hence, the deployment of an integrating RS-GIS approach for precision carbon management is of high significance. This article provides a review of various RS and GIS techniques used in forest aboveground biomass mapping and monitoring as well as highpoints the associated challenges and opportunities. The review concluded that the use of RS and GIS in large-scale forest aboveground biomass assessment provides a sound alternative when compared to the use of conventional approaches. It was noted that the freely available moderate resolution optical sensors could be used reliably for estimating forest carbon stock. Furthermore, the integration of multi-sensor data in a GIS environment increased the accuracy of the estimation results. This study helps contributing to the topic in a way that it illustrates the growing developments using geospatial technologies by identifying most sensitive RS variables to measurable biophysical parameters. Furthermore, it demonstrates the usefulness of geospatial technologies for estimating terrestrial carbon sequestered. Finally, gaps, limitations and the need for further studies are underlined.

AB  - Water segmentation is a fundamental step for the information processing of SAR image, which plays an important role in ship detection, disaster monitoring and other applications. Because of the complexity of scenario in the SAR images, water segmentation of SAR image is a challenging task. Fewer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been developed for SAR image water segmentation in recent years, the accuracy and speed of CNN for water segmentation can be further improved. In this paper, we established a SAR water segmentation dataset based on the GF3 satellite data. then an improved water segmentation network based on Bilateral Segmentation Network (BiSeNet) is proposed. Further we propose a loss function based on edge area and a novel training data generation method to improve the segmentation ability of the network. Experimental results based on water segmentation dataset show that the proposed segmentation method has better segmentation accuracy and speed.

TI  - Metastatic status of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer determined with photoacoustic microscopy via dual-targeting nanoparticles.
T2  - Light, science & applications
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) is critical to guide the treatment of breast cancer. However, distinguishing metastatic SLNs from normal and inflamed lymph nodes (LNs) during surgical resection remains a challenge. Here, we report a CD44 and scavenger receptor class B1 dual-targeting hyaluronic acid nanoparticle (5K-HA-HPPS) loaded with the near-infra-red fluorescent dye DiR-BOA for SLN imaging in breast cancer. The small sized (~40nm) self-assembled 5K-HA-HPPSs accumulated rapidly in the SLNs after intradermal injection. Compared with normal popliteal LNs (N-LN), there were ~3.2-fold and ~2.4-fold increases in fluorescence intensity in tumour metastatic SLNs (T-MLN) and inflamed LNs (Inf-LN), respectively, 6h after nanoparticle inoculation. More importantly, photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) of 5K-HA-HPPS showed a significantly distinct distribution in T-MLN compared with N-LN and Inf-LN. Signals were mainly distributed at the centre of T-MLN but at the periphery of N-LN and Inf-LN. The ratio of PA intensity (R) at the centre of the LNs compared with that at the periphery was 5.93±0.75 for T-MLNs of the 5K-HA-HPPS group, which was much higher than that for the Inf-LNs (R=0.2±0.07) and N-LNs (R=0.45±0.09). These results suggest that 5K-HA-HPPS injection combined with PAM provides a powerful tool for distinguishing metastatic SLNs from pLNs and inflamed LNs, thus guiding the removal of SLNs during breast cancer surgery.

AB  - Three major technological developments changed the world in 1869, allowing for much faster communication across three different continents and between seas and oceans: the first Transcontinental Railroad across the United States, the French Atlantic Cable, and the Suez Canal in Egypt. Each of these technological feats, though, was also strictly linked to different and competing agendas of imperial and colonial expansion and of territorial and maritime control pursued by the world's great powers. This essay argues that, by 1869, the previously widespread Euro-American worldview that had combined the cause of nation-building with the cause of progress had morphed into a novel and complex Euro-American ideology of << Progressive Imperialism >>, which justified the rule of empires with the extension of progressive institutions and progressive technological advancements. Yet, behind this veneer of optimism associated to the achievements of << Progressive Imperialism >>, the shrinking of the world caused by the sudden spread of technological changes in transcontinental communications also led to a great deal of anxiety for those who saw those changes as powerful instruments in the global expansion of capitalism as a system of imperial exploitation. In turn, the anxiety caused by the 1873 economic crisis showed the limits of the project of economic and political globalization pursued by the Euro-American powers according to the ideology of << Progressive Imperialism >>. At the same time, as a result of the worsening of the conditions of the workers worldwide, this also led to a radicalization of worker movements with the rise of a global anarcho-syndicalism, while it also heralded the start of a new wave of millenarian cults.

TI  - Applying the NDVI from satellite images in delimiting management zones for annual crops
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - The utilization of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data obtained through satellite images can technically improve the process of delimiting management zones (MZ) for annual crops, resulting in socio-economic and environmental benefits. The aim of this study was to compare delimited MZ, using crop productivity data, with delimited MZ using the NDVI obtained from satellite images in areas under a no-tillage system. The study was carried out in three areas located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Three crop productivity maps, from 2009 to 2015, were used for each area, whereby the NDVI was calculated for each crop productivity map using images from the Landsat series of satellites. Descriptive and geostatistical analysis were conducted to determine the productivity and NDVI data. The MZ were then delimited using the fuzzy c-means algorithm. Spearman's correlation matrix was used to compare the methodologies used for delimiting the MZ. The MZ based on NDVI calculated from the satellite images correlated with the MZ based on crop productivity data (0.48 < r < 0.61), suggesting that the NDVI can replace or be complementary to productivity data in delimiting MZ for annual cropping systems.

AB  - Fires, floods, water pollution and landfills are among some of the core environmental problems today. In the present work we consider the processes related to temperature pollution from landfills for municipal waste storage. Landfills where a temperature anomaly occurred as a result of a fire are also considered. Optical images from the multispectral instrument (MSI) of the Sentinel 2 platform and radar (SAR) data from the Sentinel 1 platform of the Copernicus program of the European Space Agency were used. The heat channel of the Landsat 5 - 7 (ETM) and Landsat 8 (OLI / TIRS) sensors was used to calculate the surface temperature from the landfill. By using orthogonation of satellite images, the dynamics of the individual components of the earth's surface - vegetation, soil and moisture - was traced. A combination of optical and radar imaging has been used to showcase the potential of this method by which landfills can be identified. Disturbance index was used as a quantitative indicator of the studied areas. Satellite data from different seasons and years have been selected to monitor the dynamics of thermal pollution from the landfills.

TI  - Downscaling of SMAP Soil Moisture in the Lower Mekong River Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In large river basins where in situ data were limited or absent, satellite-based soil moisture estimates can be used to supplement ground measurements for land and water resource management solutions. Consistent soil moisture estimation can aid in monitoring droughts, forecasting floods, monitoring crop productivity, and assisting weather forecasting. Satellite-based soil moisture estimates are readily available at the global scale but are provided at spatial scales that are relatively coarse for many hydrological modeling and decision-making purposes. Soil moisture data are obtained from NASA's soil moisture active passive (SMAP) mission radiometer as an interpolated product at 9 km gridded resolution. This study implements a soil moisture downscaling algorithm that was developed based on the relationship between daily temperature change and average soil moisture under varying vegetation conditions. It applies a look-up table using global land data assimilation system (GLDAS) soil moisture and surface temperature data, and advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST). MODIS LST and NDVI are used to obtain downscaled soil moisture estimates. These estimates are then used to enhance the spatial resolution of soil moisture estimates from SMAP 9 km to 1 km. Soil moisture estimates at 1 km resolution are able to provide detailed information on the spatial distribution and pattern over the regions being analyzed. Higher resolution soil moisture data are needed for practical applications and modelling in large watersheds with limited in situ data, like in the Lower Mekong River Basin (LMB) in Southeast Asia. The 1 km soil moisture estimates can be applied directly to improve flood prediction and assessment as well as drought monitoring and agricultural productivity predictions for large river basins.

AB  - This article is based on a plenary held during the Child & Youth Care in Action VI Conference: Moving Through Trails and Trials Toward Community Wellness, held in Victoria, British Columbia in April 2019. It explores how we can re-imagine child and youth care practice with African Canadian youth. This emerging paradigm aligns with child and youth care politicized praxis as well as trauma-informed and strengths-based approaches in the field's literature. We highlight the importance of mobilizing critical and transformative theoretical frameworks along with an Africentric worldview to substantially support youth of African descent with a strengths-based approach. Moreover, the protective role of Black-affirming spaces is developed and articulated.

TI  - RITUAL CLOTHING OF THE SAKHA PEOPLE: <i>TANGALAI SON</i> (HISTORICAL MEMORY AND SEMANTICS)
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The ancient ritual clothing of the Sakha tangalai son people in a broad historical retrospective through the prism of "remembering culture" (according to Ya. Assman), based on a wide range of folklore, linguistic and ethnographic materials, is examined in the article. For the first time, a detailed historiographic review of works devoted to the ritual clothing of the tangalai son was made. The main goal of this study was the reconstruction of archaic elements associated with the historical memory of the ritual. The interpretation of the semantics of the word is proposed. The analysis of the semiotic code of this garment is carried out. It has been established that in this ritual clothing, through a symbolic code, totemistic views associated with the archaic worldview of the people are clearly expressed. Semantic analysis of the name tangalai son showed that the Turkic-Mongol peoples had similar ideas associated with the bird cult and originating in ancient totemistic and shamanistic ideas. The image of a white bird / totem was revealed, which found expression in the symbolic design of the tangalai son, and the "fur code" was analyzed as an element of the ritual of the symbolic rebirth of the bride.

AB  - Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) processing techniques have gradually become a powerful tool for earth observation. The ubiquitous problem of noise filtering represents also a challenge in the SAR signal processing field. In case of the analysis of land regions, the identification of a general algorithm, suitable for the large-scale processing, represents an additional challenge, due to the diversity of the areas' characteristics. More specifically, two main classes of scattering mechanisms can be defined: Persistent Scatterers (PS), coherent, point-wise targets, and Distributed Scatterers (DS), mechanisms with moderate coherence, whose contribution spreads across multiple pixels of the images. Due to their different characteristics, the joint processing of PS and DS was difficult to address, until the development of the SqueeSAR algorithm. This method, based on the joint processing of statistical homogeneous pixels, was successfully implemented in the field of SAR Interferometry, which exploits solely the phase of the focused acquisitions. The objective of this work is to evaluate the applicability of the SqueeSAR principle in the frame of SAR Tomography, a multi-temporal SAR processing technique which also has the ability to separate interfering scattering mechanisms.

AB  - The paper considers the application of artificial neural networks for drought monitoring using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites' data in the South of Ukraine. From the data collected from several weather stations equipped with suction pressure measuring Watermark sensors in 2017-2018, we formed 5 datasets containing suction pressure; NDVI and NDWI values calculated using Sentinel-2 images; digital number values of co and cross-polarized radar data obtained from the Sentinel-1 images. Four datasets were used to train a neural network, and the fifth one - for accuracy checking. We used a multilayer perceptron neural network to detect the dependencies between suction pressure and normalized values of spectral indices combined with radar data. The best accuracy within the training datasets was obtained for the neural network with one neuron in one hidden layer and one neuron in the input layer with sigmoidal transfer function (maximal relative error of 28.0% or 17 kPa in absolute values). Estimates for the testing dataset described the actual data with an average relative error of 32.0%. The neural network better estimated lower levels of moisture content that is essential while predicting soil droughts. We also compared the results of neural network assessment with several spectral drought indices. As a proof of adequacy, for three images acquired in 2018, the estimates obtained by the neural network correlated with ln(TVX) (temperature vegetation index) with R=0.44-0.62. The neural network approach with the use of Sentinel imagery, however, allows evaluating soil moisture content with greater time resolution.

M3  - Article
AB  - Phase delay caused by atmospheric effects due to spatial and temporal variations of pressure, temperature, and water vapor content is one of the major error sources in estimation of ground deformation by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR >). Therefore, accuracy of ground deformation measurement is highly contingent on the robustness of the atmospheric correction techniques. These techniques rely either on auxiliary data such as numerical weather models (NWMs) or on the analysis of the interferometric phase itself. The accuracy in phase delays estimation of mixing effects of turbulent delay in atmosphere and stratified delay in lower troposphere is a key factor in determination of performance of each technique. Hence, the performance evaluation of the techniques is required in order to assess their potentials, robustness, and limitations. This article analyzes and evaluates the performance of four NWMs (i.e., ERA-Interim, ERA5, MERRA2, and WRF) and two phase-based techniques (i.e., linear and power law) to estimate phase delay using Sentinel-1A/B data over the Corvara landslide located in the Alps. The GPS data and GACOS product were used to validate the results. We generally found that ERA5 outperformed among other weather models with a phase standard deviation reduction of 77.7% (with respect to the InSAR phase), a correlation coefficient of 0.86 (between InSAR phase and estimated tropospheric delay) and a less significant error in the velocity estimation of the landslide.

AB  - Cooperative wireless networks, enabled by Cognitive Radios, facilitate mobile users to dynamically share access to spectrum. However, spectrum bands can be accessed illegitimately by malicious users. Therefore, the success of dynamic spectrum sharing relies on automated enforcement of spectrum policies. While the focus has been on ex ante spectrum enforcement, this work explores new approaches to address efficient ex post spectrum enforcement. The main objective of this work is to ensure maximum coverage of the area of enforcement and accurate detection of spectrum access violation. The first objective is achieved with the help of Lloyd's algorithm to divide the enforcement area into a set of uniformly sized coverage regions. The interference detection accuracy is achieved through crowdsourcing of the spectrum access monitoring to volunteers, based on their computational capabilities, location attributes and reputation. A simulation framework was developed in CSIM19 (C++ version) to analyze the performance of the proposed system over the entire area of enforcement. The results show that the proposed scheme ensures efficient coverage of all the channels and regions in the area of enforcement and a high average accuracy of detection.

AB  - Neural network models are quite popular among the various machine learning approaches for prediction of derived remote sensing image time series. However, the existing models are mostly based on multi-pass parameter learning strategy and these use fixed network architectures which need to be determined through rigorous empirical study. Eventually, their performance deteriorates during online prediction of such data, as commonly encountered in various real-life scenarios. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes OPAL, an online prediction model based on autonomous learning approach. The autonomous learning of OPAL is achieved by employing a self-evolutionary recurrent neural network, whereas its single-pass learning makes it fit for online prediction environment. Experimentation with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, derived from MODIS Terra satellite imagery, shows that proposed OPAL is able to attain state-of-the-art accuracy even with single-pass learning and without requiring empirical adjustment of network architecture.

TI  - Monitoring Oil Exploitation Infrastructure and Dirt Roads with Object-Based Image Analysis and Random Forest in the Eastern Mongolian Steppe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on the spatial distribution of human disturbance is important for assessing and monitoring land degradation. In the Eastern Mongolian Steppe Ecosystem, one of the major driving factors of human-induced land degradation is the expansion of road networks mainly due to intensifications of oil exploration and exploitation. So far, neither the extents of road networks nor the extent of surrounding grasslands affected by the oil industry are monitored which is generally labor consuming. This causes that no information on the changes in the area which is affected by those disturbance drivers is available. Consequently, the study aim is to provide a cost-effective methodology to classify infrastructure and oil exploitation areas from remotely sensed images using object-based classifications with Random Forest. By combining satellite data with different spatial and spectral resolutions (PlanetScope, RapidEye, and Landsat ETM+), the product delivers data since 2005. For the classification variables, segmentation, spectral characteristics, and indices were extracted from all above mentioned imagery and used as predictors. Results show that overall accuracies of land use maps ranged 73%-93% mainly depending on satellites' spatial resolution. Since 2005, the area of grassland disturbed by dirt roads and oil exploitation infrastructure increased by 88% with its highest expansion by 47% in the period 2005-2010. Settlements and croplands remained relatively constant throughout the 13 years. Comparison of multiscale classification suggests that, although high spatial resolutions are clearly beneficial, all datasets were useful to delineate linear features such as roads. Consequently, the results of this study provide an effective evaluation for the potential of Random Forest for extracting relatively narrow linear features such as roads from multiscale satellite images and map products that are possible to use for detailed land degradation assessments.

CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVI
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The main objective of this study is to investigate suitable approaches to monitor the land infrastructure growth over a period of time using multimodality of remote sensing satellite images. Bi-temporal change detection method is unable to indicate the continuous change occurring over a long period of time and thus to achieve this purpose, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral satellite images of same geographical region over a period of 2015 to 2018 are obtained and analyzed. SAR data from Sentinel-1 and multispectral image data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 are used.Statistical composite hypothesis technique is used for estimating pixel-based change detection. The well-established likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic is used for determining the pixel-wise change in a series of complex covariance matrices of multilooked polarimetric SAR data. In case of multispectral images, the approach used is to estimate a statistical model from series of multispectral image data over a long period of time, assuming there is no considerable change during that time period and then compare it with the multispectral image data obtained at a later time. The generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is used to detect the target (changed pixel) from probabilistic estimated model of the corresponding background clutter (non-changed pixels). To minimize error due to co-registration, 8- neighborhood pixels around the pixel under test are also considered. There are different challenges in both the cases. SAR images have the advantage of being insensitive to atmospheric and light conditions, but it suffers the presence of speckle phenomenon. In case of multispectral, challenge is to get quite large number of datasets without cloud coverage in region of interest for multivariate distribution modelling. Due to imperfect modelling there will be high probability of false alarm. Co-registration is also an important criterion in multitemporal image analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Internet data can be used to improve infectious disease models. However, the representativeness and individual-level validity of internet-derived measures are largely unexplored as this requires ground truth data for study.OBJECTIVE: This study sought to identify relationships between Web-based behaviors and/or conversation topics and health status using a ground truth, survey-based dataset.METHODS: This study leveraged a unique dataset of self-reported surveys, microbiological laboratory tests, and social media data from the same individuals toward understanding the validity of individual-level constructs pertaining to influenza-like illness in social media data. Logistic regression models were used to identify illness in Twitter posts using user posting behaviors and topic model features extracted from users' tweets.RESULTS: Of 396 original study participants, only 81 met the inclusion criteria for this study. Of these participants' tweets, we identified only two instances that were related to health and occurred within 2 weeks (before or after) of a survey indicating symptoms. It was not possible to predict when participants reported symptoms using features derived from topic models (area under the curve [AUC]=0.51; P=.38), though it was possible using behavior features, albeit with a very small effect size (AUC=0.53; P≤.001). Individual symptoms were also generally not predictable either. The study sample and a random sample from Twitter are predictably different on held-out data (AUC=0.67; P≤.001), meaning that the content posted by people who participated in this study was predictably different from that posted by random Twitter users. Individuals in the random sample and the GoViral sample used Twitter with similar frequencies (similar @ mentions, number of tweets, and number of retweets; AUC=0.50; P=.19).CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first instance of an attempt to use a ground truth dataset to validate infectious disease observations in social media data. The lack of signal, the lack of predictability among behaviors or topics, and the demonstrated volunteer bias in the study population are important findings for the large and growing body of disease surveillance using internet-sourced data.

AB  - Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) has the ability to provide a great amount of information over a large area of study. SRS technology has yet to penetrate the main scientific discourse of Archaeology. Traditional limitations of SRS in Archaeology have started to dissipate with the launch of new satellite systems such as the Sentinel constellation. Traditional methods of field monitoring are costly and labour intensive, and tend to lead to the untimely detection of the destruction of cultural heritage, as was the case in many sites in Alentejo, Portugal. In this work, we discuss the potential of Sentinel 1 Synthetic Aperture Radar and Sentinel 2 Multispectral satellites as tools for heritage monitoring, use SRS to analyse the Portuguese site of Pisoes, and evaluate if it is possible to build an early warning system based on SRS, in order to solve one of the greatest problems currently affecting archaeological preservation.

TI  - Heritage monitoring and surveillance using Sentinel satellite data in the Lower Alentejo (Portugal)
T2  - GE-CONSERVACION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, the potential of Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) for large-scale monitoring of archaeological sites is analysed. This analysis focuses on the Portuguese Lower Alentejo region, where multiple sites have been destroyed over the last years, mainly due to intensive agriculture. The development of a surveillance system based on data from the Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 satellite constellations, named SENSEOS, had its pilot application in this region during the first half of 2019. In a vast region where authorities lacked the proper resources to timely detect events endangering the integrity of heritage sites, this system tried to overcome these issues. By using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical data, it was possible to detect such events through a technique labelled Normalized Difference Amplitude Index (NDAI). The identification of these changes on the surface, associated with potentially destructive events, contributed to minimize the damage and destruction of archaeological sites..

AB  - This work proposes a deep learning based method to despeckle SAR images that does not require noise-free reference data. Instead, our method exploits the redundancy between images of the same area at different times to train a residual convolutional neural network in a regression framework to predict speckle-free images. Moreover, thanks to end-to-end training of the network, our approach does not require explicit parameter tuning. Experiments show the relevance of our approach on Sentinel 1 images acquired over volcanic areas. The method is shown to compete well with well-known approaches such as the Lee filter and the more recent SAR-BM3D filter.

AB  - The article describes the leadership development program for students-volunteers at the Pedagogical Institute of Pacific National University. The author substantiates the idea that the basis for the younger generation upbringing is the accumulation and use of social experience; when training volunteer leaders, the emphasis should be placed on the development of students' leadership qualities. The results obtained during the implementation of the program indicate that specially organized work contributed to the development of students' worldview, their social intelligence, independence, creativity, formation of the active and responsible approach to life, formation of the sense of complicity to people and own country. The program "I am your donor" helped each of its participants to recognize themselves as unique persons, cognize and understand themselves, expand the sphere of communication with peers, free themselves from complexes. It also provided its participants with the opportunity to adapt to the new social environment, make their own life choices, learn about themselves and their place in the society. Successful implementation of the program is possible with the close interaction between the teacher and each program participant on the basis of cooperation, co-creation, co-management and transformation of the space made up of various activities into a reflective and valuable educational space.

TI  - Campylobacteriosis associated with the consumption of unpasteurised milk: findings from a sentinel surveillance site
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Campylobacteriosis is the most common notifiable disease in New Zealand. While the risk of campylobacteriosis has been found to be strongly associated with the consumption of undercooked poultry, other risk factors include rainwater-sourced drinking water, contact with animals and consumption of raw dairy products. Despite this, there has been little investigation of raw milk as a risk factor for campylobacteriosis. Recent increases in demand for untreated or 'raw' milk have also raised concerns that this exposure may become a more important source of disease in the future. This study describes the cases of notified campylobacteriosis from a sentinel surveillance site. Previously collected data from notified cases of raw milk-associated campylobacteriosis were examined and compared with campylobacteriosis cases who did not report raw milk consumption. Raw milk campylobacteriosis cases differed from non-raw milk cases on comparison of age and occupation demographics, with raw milk cases more likely to be younger and categorised as children or students for occupation. Raw milk cases were more likely to be associated with outbreaks than non-raw milk cases. Study-suggested motivations for raw milk consumption (health reasons, natural product, produced on farm, inexpensive or to support locals) were not strongly supported by cases. More information about the raw milk consumption habits of New Zealanders would be helpful to better understand the risks of this disease, especially with respect to increased disease risk observed in younger people. Further discussion with raw milk consumers around their motivations may also be useful to find common ground between public health concerns and consumer preferences as efforts continue to manage this ongoing public health issue.

TI  - Long-term assessment of oil palm expansion and landscape change in the eastern Brazilian Amazon
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Brazilian Amazon, land use and land cover changes (LULC) are extremely heterogeneous, in both spatial and temporal terms. Understanding the long-term trajectory of changes in LULC, and the resulting impact on landscape structure, is essential for the development of adequate, environmentally sound land use policies. To this end, we characterized the spatiotemporal aspects of LULC changes, and their effects on the landscape, in an agricultural backdrop of oil palm cultivation, based on a multi-temporal analysis of the period between 1991 and 2013. We classified Landsat images and analyzed landscape changes in 2588.72 km(2) of the oil palm expansion zone (polo do dende), located between the municipalities of Moju, Acara, and Tailandia (called Moju region), northeastern Para, Brazil. We found that, during this period, 47.7% of the primary forest was converted for other uses, degraded forest increased by 17%, and oil palm plantation increased by 11%. Thirty percent of the primary forest was converted to oil palm plantation during the 22-year study period, however, between 2005 and 2013, primary forest conversion to oil palm increased by just 2%. In contrast, changes in landscape structure were related to the fragmentation of the forest cover, leading to an increasing isolation of forest patches and reduction in the area of forest remnants. These data offer a clear warning sign that for future expansion of palm oil plantations in the Para state we need to adopt strategies focused on landscape integrity, and develop initiatives towards the regulation of large areas of monoculture, helping guarantee the region's environmental sustainability.

CP  - Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications XI held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Anthropic changes resulting from urbanization contribute to the modification of surface materials, originating the suppression of vegetation, waterproofing of the soil and the variation of albedo, which can contribute to the formation of Heat Islands (HI). This phenomenon results from the higher absorption of electromagnetic energy by the buildings, when compared to vegetation, corroborating both the increase of surface temperature and the minimization of the relative humidity of the air. This effect is potentiated at night, when urbanized regions maintain higher average temperatures for a longer time, when compared to vegetation areas. Some impacts of this effect are: (i) thermal discomfort and influence on the local microclimate and; (ii) displacement of water bodies. This work aimed to analyze the relationship between the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Vegetation Proportion (Pv), derived from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), in the densely built area of Brasilia (Brazil), in order to evaluate if its characteristics confirm the micro-scale climate change. Several images from Landsat 5 and 8 thermal sensors were processed between 1989 and 2019 and the results obtained point out that the LST is inversely proportional to Pv, i.e., the highest temperatures were observed in classified areas with scarce or no Pv, which corroborates with the hypothesis that anthropic altered regions can influence the local climate. Despite the phenomenon observed and the 50% increase in maximum temperature in 2019 when compared to the 1989 and the decrease in maximum Pv by 36% in the same years, it is mandatory additional studies to confirm these findings.

AB  - Pasture and croplands comprise two different types of land use, which are very common in Brazil. Mapping these areas using remote sensing techniques is a challenge when using a single date image due to their similarity in spectral response. Time series might aid in discrimination of these areas once it explores the temporal behavior of surface patterns. In this work we explore time series obtained from remote sensing images to separate pasturelands from croplands in Brazilian Cerrado biome, using metrics derived from a data cube. We used Landsat 8 imagery as data source to compose a time series of six bands from OLI sensor (2 to 7) for the year of 2018. Random Forest algorithm was elected to execute the classification obtaining global accuracy of 80% and 0.58 of Kappa.

TI  - China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite on global scientific literature: trends using scientometric analysis
T2  - BOLETIN GOIANO DE GEOGRAFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of the cooperation between Brazil and China, the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) is a program for the development of remote sensing satellites which has contributed to the understanding of various phenomena and territorial management. Although there is knowledge production from CBERS data, it has not been characterised within the global scientific literature. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate, through a scientometric analysis, the trends and gaps in studies related to the use of CBERS. Considering the ISI Web of Knowledge platform, manuscripts that used or analysed CBERS were searched, resulting in 216 articles, which were examined based on ten different criteria. A significant increase in articles has been observed over time. The CBERS-2 satellite was the most widely used, with CCD being the most frequent of all sensors. When using another remote sensing product, Landsat and Aqua/Terra satellites (MODIS sensor) were the most observed. A bias related to the nationality of the program maintainers was identified, as well as the prevalence of the English language. The majority of studies took place in terrestrial environments, causing some gaps to be explored. In addition to understanding how the international scientific community has been using CBERS for knowledge generation, the scientometric analysis identified the fulfilment of the purpose for which the program was designed and the autonomy in the generation of orbital data.

A displacement dataset of the Morandi bridge in Genoa (Italy) has been created, before its collapse. The outputs obtained were then compared to those found in literature and achieved through the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI), a more complex and reliable technique. Results demonstrate that the adopted procedure has great potentiality in the application field and could effectively be extended to different types of civil infrastructures.

AB  - Increasing the accuracy of crop yield estimates may allow improvements in the whole crop production chain, allowing farmers to better plan for harvest, and for insurers to better understand risks of production, to name a few advantages. To perform their predictions, most current machine learning models use NDVI data, which can be hard to use, due to the presence of clouds and their shadows in acquired images, and due to the absence of reliable crop masks for large areas, especially in developing countries. In this paper, we present a deep learning model able to perform pre-season and in-season predictions for live different crops. Our model uses crop calendars, easy-to-obtain remote sensing data and weather forecast information to provide accurate yield estimates.

TI  - APPLICATIONS OF SAR DATA TO ESTIMATE FOREST BIOPHYSICAL VARIABLES IN BRAZIL
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of SAR images has been highlighted in scientific research focused on forest data collection worldwide. Thus, the present work aimed at gathering studies turned to the application of SAR images to obtain biophysical variables of forests in Brazil. Based on studies published in recognized databases, a growing amount of publications over time was observed with more focus on researches made mainly in Amazonian biome, followed by planted forests with eucalyptus destined to wood production. Most works were made based on airborne radar data, followed by ALOS/PALSAR and JERS-1 orbital data. It is remarkable the scientific knowledge produced using radar data from Brazilian forests, demonstrating that this technology is an other tool for studies and applications in Forestry Sciences that can assist in the country's forestry management. Nevertheless, the need of studies on the several forest typologies across Brazil was evidenced, along with the lack of research related to radar use to estimate biophysical variables in caatinga and Atlantic Forest biomes.

AB  - Remote sensing is a technique which can be used for the thermal study of the surface covers of the territory and the characterization of spaces based on their ability to withstand overheating. The objective of this work is to describe the urban heat island (UHI) of the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM) campus and to determine its degree of influence by Madrid's UHI. The work has been based on images from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 satellites, and images from the DESIREX campaign, an initiative of ESA (European Space Agency). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) of the surface covers are calculated and the evolution of temperatures throughout the day, the thermal amplitude and hot spots are analyzed. The results show that the thermal behavior of the campus is similar to that of rural and non-urban areas, and that it is not specially influenced by the capital's UHI.

Our approach is designed to harness Multi-Pol SAR acquisitions, while single-pol acquisitions are used in most of the approaches in this area, employing an Autoassociative Neural Network (AANN) for data fusion purposes and a Pulse-Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) for the generation of a final coastline. Using RADARSAT-2 data, main findings are shown, exhibiting better and comparable results with respect to consolidated approaches and with a recent automated method which may be regarded as within the state-of-the art methods in the field of coastline extraction from SAR data.

M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the spatial-temporal dynamics of land-use and coverage in the Parque Estadual da Pedra Selada (PEPS) and its landscape, located in Resende and Itatiaia, Rio de Janeiro. Orbital images of the Landsat platform were obtained for the years 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015. NDVI was calculated for each year, and its amplitude described the classes of land-use and coverage in water bodies, urban area, exposed soil, grassland and forest. For landscape analysis, a 3-km radius buffer was incorporated, delimiting the Buffer Zone (BZ). The forest class was the largest in all years, but there was a reduction in its area over time, especially in BZ. An increase was observed in the grassland and urban areas when comparing the years 1995 and 2015, where the urban area doubled its territory. Intense anthropic activity explains this transition as livestock activities began to be used for urban sprawl. The increase in deforested areas in the region, due to pressures such as tourism, real estate speculation, farming and agriculture, drives the fragmentation process that may affect the diversity of flora and fauna present in PEPS.

Beginning with the first aerial photographs of the early 20th century to the satellite imagery of today, the amount of remote-sensing data has increased geometrically with a higher resolution. The need to analyze these modern digital data motivated research to accelerate remote-sensing image classification. Fortunately, great advances have been made by the computer vision community to classify natural images or photographs taken with an ordinary camera. Natural image datasets can range up to millions of samples and are, therefore, amenable to deep-learning techniques. Many fields of science, remote sensing included, were able to exploit the success of natural image classification by convolutional neural network models using a technique commonly called transfer learning. We provide a systematic review of transfer learning application for scene classification using different datasets and different deep-learning models. We evaluate how the specialization of convolutional neural network models affects the transfer learning process by splitting original models in different points. As expected, we find the choice of hyperparameters used to train the model has a significant influence on the final performance of the models. Curiously, we find transfer learning from models trained on larger, more generic natural images datasets outperformed transfer learning from models trained directly on smaller remotely sensed datasets. Nonetheless, results show that transfer learning provides a powerful tool for remote-sensing scene classification.

AB  - This paper is focused on investigating the capabilities of SAR S-1 sensors for burned area mapping. To this aim, we analyzed S-1 data focusing on a fire that occurred onAugust 10th, 2017, in a protected natural site. An unsupervised classification, using a k-mean machine learning algorithm, was carried out, and the choice of an adequate number of clusters was guided by the calculation of the silhouette score. The Delta NBR index calculated from optical S-2 based images was used to evaluate the burned area delimitation accuracy. The fire covered around 38.51 km(2) and also affected areas outside the boundaries of the reserve. S-1 based outputs successfully matched the S-2 burnt mapping.

AB  - In this study, the effects of surface films on Internal Wave (IW) signatures in SAR imagery are analyzed by means of co-polarized phase difference (CPD) information. Two ALOS PALSAR images collected over the Andaman sea are exploited. Experimental results show that: i) the standard deviation of the CPD IW contrasts are reduced and do not show clear correlation with the HH intensity contrasts for an image acquired under lower chlorophyll a concentration; ii) the standard deviation of the CPD IW contrasts are essentially in anti-phase with the HH intensity contrasts for an image collected under higher chlorophyll a concentration.

TI  - Methodology of Data Fusion Using Deep Learning for Semantic Segmentation of Land Types in the Amazon
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a methodology using deep learning and a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm to perform the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. Initially the image is segmented using a CNN, and then an image with homogeneous regions is generated using a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm. Finally, a data fusion process is performed with these two images, generating the final classified image. The field of study was the Brazilian Amazon region. The proposed methodology classifies images in the following classes: forest, pasture and agriculture. The input data used were LANDSAT-8/OLI images. The reference data were extracted from the results of the TerraClass project in 2014. Two datasets were evaluated: the first with six bands and the second with three bands. Three CNN architectures were evaluated together with three optimization methods: SGDM, ADAM, and RMSProp and the dropout and L-2 regularization methods as methods for generalization improvement. The best model, CNN optimization method technique for generalization improvement, evaluated in the validation set, was submitted to a 5-fold cross validation methodology, and the results were compared with pre-trained networks using the learning transfer methodology; in this case the networks used for comparison were ResNet50, InceptionResnetv2, MobileNetv2 and Xception. The proposed methodology was evaluated through image segmentation of some regions of the Amazon. Finally, the proposed methodology was evaluated in regions used by other authors. The accuracy values obtained for the images evaluated were over 99%.

TI  - Urban growth dynamics based on surface Albedo changes in Petrolina, Brazil
T2  - ACTA SCIENTIARUM-TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities keep growing, and in most of the cases this expansion process is hard to model and describe for planning actions. Quantitative methods are increasingly used to help planning, monitoring, and regulating urban land-use processes. Remote sensing images series are making possible different types of spatial-temporal analysis of the Earth surface. Surface albedo is a remote sensing product acquired in a long series of satellite images such as Landsat (more than 40 years of observation). Those analyses allow measuring waterproofed areas for urban drainage studies, as well as monitoring urban spreading patterns, growth vectors, and issues related to comfort and environmental quality, as well as about land use and land-use planning (directives for master plans) among others. This article shows the direct applicability of surface albedo changes as an indicator of urban land-cover changes. The current study analyzed the urban area of Petrolina County (PE) in the following periods: 2001 and 2006, 2006 and 2011, and 2011 and 2017. Such analysis uses the surface albedo variation along the time and results showed a strong correlation between increased surface albedo and urban expansion. Besides, it enabled to observe the relation between the high urban growth in the 2011-2017 period and the urban spot expansion by 14% (approximately 590 thousand square meters of territorial extension). The Urban development stood out in the Northern and Southwestern regions of Petrolina County.

TI  - FROZEN GROUND AND SNOW COVER MONITORING IN LIVINGSTON AND DECEPTION ISLANDS, ANTARCTICA: PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF THE 2015-2019 PERMASNOW PROJECT
T2  - CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2006, our research team has been establishing in the islands of Livingston and Deception, (South Shetland archipelago, Antarctica) several monitoring stations of the active layer thickness within the international network Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM), and the ground thermal regime for the Ground Terrestrial Network-Permafrost (GTN-P). Both networks were developed within the International Permafrost Association (IPA). In the GTN-P stations, in addition to the temperature of the air, soil, and terrain at different depths, the snow thickness is also monitored by snow poles. Since 2006, a delay in the disappearance of the snow layer has been observed, which could explain the variations we observed in the active layer thickness and permafrost temperatures. Therefore, in late 2015 our research group started the PERMASNOW project (2015-2019) to pay attention to the effect of snow cover on ground thermal This project had two different ways to study the snow cover. On the first hand, in early 2017 we deployed new instrumentation, including new time lapse cameras, snow poles with high number of sensors and a complete and complex set of instruments and sensors to configure a snow pack analyzer station providing 32 environmental and snow parameters. We used the data acquired along 2017 and 2018 years with the new instruments, together with the available from all our already existing sensors, to study in detail the snow cover. On the other hand, remote sensing data were used to try to map the snow cover, not only at our monitoring stations but the entire islands in order to map and study the snow cover distribution, as well as to start the way for future permafrost mapping in the entire islands. MODIS-derived surface temperatures and albedo products were used to detect the snow cover and to test the surface temperature. Since cloud presence limited the acquisition of valid observations of MODIS sensor, we also analyzed Terrasar X data to overcome this limitation. Remote sensing data validation required the acquirement of in situ ground-true data, consisting on data front our permanent instruments, as well as ad hoc measurements in the field (snow cover mapping, snow pits, albedo characterization, etc.). Although the project is finished, the data analysis is still ongoing. We present here the different research tasks we are developing as well as the most important results we already obtained about the snow cover. These results confirm how the snow cover duration has been changing in the last years, affecting the ground thermal behavior.

TI  - Moral ordination of the world and justification of existence in Schopenhauer's metaphysics
T2  - TRANS-FORM-ACAO
M3  - Article
AB  - Arthur Schopenhauer is known as the thinker of "philosophical pessimism". It means, in general lines, the doctrine that presents a certain worldview, but in its more basic sense, it questions the possibility of giving a meaning to the whole of existence: is there "justification" (Rechtfertigung) for the existence? By answering this question the German philosopher develops his "metaphysics of the will" and, as its unfolding, his theory of "redemption" (Erlosung), or soteriology. However, the "philosopher of pessimism" also asserts in his work that there is a "moral ordinance of world" (moralische Weltordnung) and a "moral meaning of existence" (moralische Bedeutung des Daseyns), which seems CO go on the opposite direction of what is claimed by the "pessimism". The present paper analyses the sense of the notions of moral ordinance of world and justification of existence in Schopenhauer's thought, in order to demonstrate how far moral meaning of life and philosophical pessimismo interact in his thought.

AB  - In October 2017, a large wildfire occurred in the Susa valley (Italian Western Alps) affecting wide areas of mixed forests (Pinus sylvetris L.; Fagus sylvatica L., Quercus pubescens Willd.) with a spot pattern. Few days after the event an aerial survey operated by an RGB camera Sony ILCE-7RM2-a7R II was done with the aim of testing a digital photogrammetry-based 3D rapid mapping of fire effects. Flight altitude was about 800 m above ground level (AGL) determining an average image GSD of about 0.2 m. Image block adjustment was performed in Agisoft PhotoScan vs 1.2.4 using 18 ground control points that were recognized over true color orthoimages (GSD = 0.4 m). Height values of GCPs were obtained from a 5 m grid size DTM. Both orthoimages and DTM were obtained for free from the Piemonte Region Cartographic Office (ICE dataset 2010). A point cloud, having an average density of 7 pt/m(2) and covering 14 km(2) was generated, filtered and regularized to generate the correspondent DSM (Digital Surface Model) with a grid size of 0.5 m. With reference to the above-mentioned ICE DTM, a Canopy Height Model (CHM) was generated by grid differencing with a grid size of 0.5 m. A true-orthoimage was also generated having a GSD of 0.5 m. The latter was used to map burned areas by a pixel based unsupervised classification approach operating with reference to the pseudo GNDVI image, previously computed from the native red and green bands (no radiometric calibration was applied aimed at converting back the raw digital numbers to reflectance). Results were compared with 2 official datasets that were generated after the event from satellite data, one produced by the Piemonte Region and the other one by the Copernicus Emergency System. In order to test differences between burned and not-burned areas, point density, point spacing and canopy heights were computed and compared looking for evidences of geometrical differences possibly characterizing burned areas in respect of the not burned ones. Results showed that no significant differences were found between point density and point spacing in burned and not burned area. There was a significant difference in CHM minimum values distribution between burned and not-burned areas while maximum values distribution does not change significantly, proving that fire change crown structure but tree height remain unchanged. These results suggest that aerial photogrammetry could detect fire effect on forest having higher accuracy respect to ordinary approaches used in forest disturbance ecology.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of Sentinel-2 (S2) as a tool for early detection and estimation of forest harvesting in the Piemonte Region, which can be used by the regional forest admin:stration. The priority was the detection, at the regional scale, of annual forest cover changes with the following goals: i) mapping of irregular (in respect of the regional Forestry Regulation) forest cuts; ii) quantification of the intensity of the silvicultural interventions. Results are expected to support forest police controls.The proposed procedure is based on a supervised classification approach based on Random Forest algorithm. Accuracy of harvested areas detection proved to be high (overall accuracy 98%). Characterization of the occurred forest cuts was obtained computing the local coefficient of variation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) after harvesting, that showed to be a good predictor of forest harvesting intensity.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study illustrates the spatio-temporal change of land use and land cover of the Muhuri River basin using multispectral imagery under GIS environment. Satellite imagery is the good representation of spatiotemporal change of LULC of the study area. The remote sensing data, derived from Land sat imagery acquired by Earth Explorer for three different years i.e., 1975, 1995 and 2016, and processed using different enhancement techniques. For change detection of LULC supervised classification method has been adopted using maximum likelihood technique in Arc GIS 10.1. The LULC of the study area has been categorised into six types like open forest, dense forest, settlement, barren land, cultivated land and water body. The classification accuracy is assessed by estimating the Overall Accuracy, Producer's Accuracy and User's Accuracy. The overall accuracy of all the maps ranges between 87-91%. The study of land use change in four decades (1975-2016) shows that settled area and agricultural area of the basin have been increased by 180.95% and 128.36% respectively while, on the other hand, the area under open forest and dense forest have been decreased by 69.04% and 92.56% respectively. The study also reveals that high population pressure and traditional jhoom cultivation trigger the conversion of the forest land into settled area, agricultural land and barren land.

AB  - The aim of this study is to develop the land quality index (LQI) based on expert opinion and multi-criteria decision support approaches for agricultural lands The study was conducted on 8 soil series and 20 land units belonging to the lands of Ankara-Giivenc Basin, Turkey which covers about 17.5 km(2), representing the ecological conditions of a semi-arid climate. In this research, 9 main indicators were chosen including depth, slope, stoniness, bulk density (BD), texture, electrical conductivity (EC), pH, organic matter (OM) and CaCO3. Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) method was used a pairwise comparison of indicators. As a result of the LQI assessment, while 17.14% of the lands were classified as "High" and 37.41% Moderate, the agricultural quality class of 41.55% of the studies land was determined as "Low" and "Very Low" and mapped in GIS. In this study, it was determined that the final index value of the land was affected by depth (24.2%), slope (21.1%) and bulk density (16.6%) indicators with high weight coefficients. In addition, the values of the LQI were compared with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values for testing and it has been determined that land quality assessment for agricultural usage has been performed with high accuracy for NDVI (r(2) = 0.74%). Finally, the results of the study showed that the LQI was achieved for micro basin scale under semi-arid climate conditions.

TI  - Assessment of the vegetation indices on Sentinel-2A images for predicting the soil productivity potential in Bursa, Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although field surveys represent an essential method for determining soil productivity, the use of remote sensing techniques has become a popular option over recent years due to its economic and practical applications. The fundamental basis of this approach is the estimation of soil productivity by using the vegetation indices as an indicator, with reference to the yield. In this study, it is aimed to estimate the productivity potential of the agriculture areas from biomass density in case of limited pedological and parcel-based data. For this purpose, relationships between the FAO Soil Productivity Rating (SPR) and different vegetation indices were investigated. The indices NDVI, RE-OSAVI, and REMCARI were used with Sentinel-2A images. Wheat was selected as an indicator plant to estimate the yield because it is the most occupied (27.47%) cultigen in the field. The study was conducted at the Karacabey State Farm with an area of 87 km(2) and is located in Bursa province, Turkey. The research showed a positive relationship between SPR and 2018 yield values (r(2) = 0.616). During the tillering period, the r(2) for RE-OSAVI was 0.629. In the heading stage, the r(2) for NDVI was 0.577. The index REMCARI provided yield estimations with low accuracy coefficient (0.216 <= r(2) <= 0.258) during all vegetation periods. These findings can be interpreted as the monitoring of the land quality with multispectral satellite images via NDVI and RE-OSAVI. In this way, we could decide the time to redefinition of soil properties with land surveys for determination of soil productivity when the detection of a decrease using the indices during some vegetation periods. However, further investigations are needed in controlled trial patterns with differential reference plants, although the findings obtained from the study are promising for the use of spectral vegetation indices to prediction and/or monitoring of soil productivity. Thus, the possibilities of using spectral indices in different ecologies and different plant species can be evaluated from a broad perspective. It was also suggested that Sentinel-2A images may be used for similar studies due to their spectral capabilities with the ESA-SNAP tool.

T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The fictional world in A.O. Adarov's novels corresponds to several levels of narration. First, there is the "real" time of the novel's events; second, historical reconstruction given through subjective focalization; third, the realm of the unreal conveyed by visions and dreams. The novel shows the modeled reality from the perspective of a particular person, a survivor of political repressions. Through the categories of life and death, love and fate, honor and dignity, the novel speaks of the eternal ontological values and the importance of self-identification in a very difficult time, a time of re-evaluation of old values and the search for moral guidelines. According to the author's concept, traditional folk constants play a crucial role in the worldview and perception of the world and turn out to be crucial for individual choice. The sacralization of space and the presence of a symbolically charged topos in the center of the fictional world, itself an infinite mosaic of various local territories, supports the idea of the spatial structure of the novel as a single cosmic whole. Conventional chronotopic boundaries as well as the theme of death as a pass to the other world present in all the novels of this author, together with the motif of the "eternal return," support his conception of the soul's immortality.

TI  - Axillary Hibernoma in woman with Lobular breast cancer and MEN1 syndrome: A case report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The present study reports the case of an axillary hibernoma in a patient with lobular homolateral breast cancer and multiple endocrine neoplasia typel (MEN-1). Hibernoma is a rare benign adipose tissue tumor, and usually manifests as a slowly growing and painless rubbery mass. These tumors can arise in various sites, but mammary hibernomas remain extraordinarily uncommon. Although hibernomas are metabolically active and therefore "glucose-avid" on fluorodeoxyglucose CT-positron emission tomography (FDG CT-PET), imaging alone is inadequate in providing a reliable diagnosis and definitive differential diagnosis from other malignancy. Only complete surgical excision is diagnostic and, in most cases, curative.PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 42-years-old woman was followed for MEN-1 syndrome associating with hyperparathyroidism, insulinoma, non-secretory adrenal adenoma and thyroid lump. A FDG CT-PET found high glucid hypermetabolism in thickened elongated area on the front axillary line. Hibernoma was diagnosed after realization of prophylactic left mastectomy, homolateral sentinel lymph node biopsy and exeresis of the known axillary lesion.DISCUSSION: Clinical importance lies in distinguishing hibernoma from other benign and malignant breast neoplasms, as well as inflammatory conditions that come into the histologic or radiologic differential. Hibernoma is not currently classified as a non-endocrine tumor related to MEN1, but this association could be not fortuitous for the linkage between modification of Menin protein function and pathogenesis of hibernomas.CONCLUSION: Our case deserves extraordinary attention because, not only it's a case of MEN1 syndrome associated with hibernoma, but in the context of this lesion there are multiple micro-foci of infiltrating lobular carcinoma.

TI  - Sensing Tissue Damage by Myeloid C-Type Lectin Receptors
T2  - C-TYPE LECTINS IN IMMUNE HOMEOSTASIS
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - After both sterile and infectious insults, damage is inflicted on tissues leading to accidental or programmed cell death. In addition, events of programmed cell death also take place under homeostatic conditions, such as in embryo development or in the turnover of hematopoietic cells. Mammalian tissues are seeded with myeloid immune cells, which harbor a plethora of receptors that allow the detection of cell death, modulating immune responses. The myeloid C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are one of the most prominent families of receptors involved in tailoring immunity after sensing dead cells. In this chapter, we will cover a diversity of signals arising from different forms of cell death and how they are recognized by myeloid CLRs. We will also explore how myeloid cells develop their sentinel function, exploring how some of these CLRs identify cell death and the type of responses triggered thereof. In particular, we will focus on DNGR-1 (CLEC9A), Mincle (CLEC4E), CLL-1 (CLEC12A), LOX-1 (OLR1), CD301 (CLEC10A) and DEC-205 (LY75) as paradigmatic death-sensing CLRs expressed by myeloid cells. The molecular processes triggered after cell death recognition by myeloid CLRs contribute to the regulation of immune responses in pathologies associated with tissue damage, such as infection, autoimmunity and cancer. A better understanding of these processes may help to improve the current approaches for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Comparing Deep Learning and Shallow Learning for Large-Scale Wetland Classification in Alberta, Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in machine learning have changed many fields of study and it has also drawn attention in a variety of remote sensing applications. In particular, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven very useful in fields such as image recognition; however, the use of CNNs in large-scale remote sensing landcover classifications still needs further investigation. We set out to test CNN-based landcover classification against a more conventional XGBoost shallow learning algorithm for mapping a notoriously difficult group of landcover classes, wetland class as defined by the Canadian Wetland Classification System. We developed two wetland inventory style products for a large (397,958 km(2)) area in the Boreal Forest region of Alberta, Canada, using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS DEM data acquired in Google Earth Engine. We then tested the accuracy of these two products against three validation data sets (two photo-interpreted and one field). The CNN-generated wetland product proved to be more accurate than the shallow learning XGBoost wetland product by 5%. The overall accuracy of the CNN product was 80.2% with a mean F1-score of 0.58. We believe that CNNs are better able to capture natural complexities within wetland classes, and thus may be very useful for complex landcover classifications. Overall, this CNN framework shows great promise for generating large-scale wetland inventory data and may prove useful for other landcover mapping applications.

TI  - Metaphorical taxonomy in <i>La estacion violenta</i> (1958), rhetorical orientation towards the progressive interpretation of humanity
T2  - AMERICA SIN NOMBRE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper takes as reference the poems "No Exit?" and "The River" from The Violent Station (1958), to demonstrate that this literary work inserts the reflective thought that humanity must prioritize their personal projects, preserve them and develop them in as much as possible. This ideological orientation of the author will be verified through the rhetorical interpretation of this object of analysis, which is valid from the taxonomy of the types of metaphor. This theoretical proposal was formulated by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in his book Metaphors We Live By (1995) and has been rigorously studied by researcher Camilo Fernandez Cozman. Among its approaches, the one that will be used is the one that seeks the distinction and articulation between megametaphors (general notions that, at the same time, conform the orientational, ontological and structural metaphors) and specific metaphors (particular notions that derive from megametaphors). This work has the purpose of arguing with epistemological property the literary work of the Mexican writer Octavio Paz. In the same way, the concepts of interlocutors and worldview are confronted as support to strengthen this peculiar ideological directionality of the poems.

AB  - As sadly known, forest fires are part of a set of natural disasters that have always affected regions of the world typically characterized by a tropical climate with long periods of drought. However, due to climate changes of the recent years, other regions of our planet that were not affected by this plague have also had to deal with this phenomenon. One of them is certainly the Italian peninsula, and especially the regions of southern Italy. For this reason, the scientific community, and in particular that one of the remote sensing, plays an important role in the development of reliable techniques to provide useful support to the competent authorities. Therefore, in this work, the capability of the Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI), derived from spaceborne remote sensing (RS) data, is assessed to monitor the forest fires occurred on a specific study area during the summer of 2017: the volcano Vesuvius, near Naples (in Campania, Italy). In particular, the index is obtained from Sentinel-2 multispectral images of the European Space Agency (ESA), which are free of charge and open accessible. Moreover, the twin Sentinel-2 (S-2) sensors allows to overcome some restrictions on time delivery and high frequency observation. These requirements are goodly matched by other spaceborne sensors, such as MODIS and VIIRS satellites, but at the expense of a lower spatial resolution.

AB  - Restricted episodic changes occurred in a short time period and over large spatial extents. Extreme weather conditions usually give rise to restricted episodic changes. Sentinel-1 radar images of the Salar de Aguas Calientes in Chile acquired in the Altiplanic winter (March 2015 and June 2017), 2018 austral winter and 2017-2018 springtime, demonstrates the ability to monitor episodic events remotely. The results of the backscattered power are encouraging and show episodic variations in VV polarization at C-band. The surface features in Salar de Aguas Calientes Sur change in response to snowfalls during either the Altiplanic or austral winter with an increase of the backscattering in presence of dry snow over the salt pan crust. Flooding events related to snow-melting during spring 2017-2018 showed a decrease in the backscattering signal over ponded water and an increase when wind blows over the water. Remote-sensing observations of the salar can provide a means for monitoring changes in the surface of the salar and a better understanding of the associated climatic episodic event processes. Furthermore, it can help to have a better understanding of environmental changes in arid regions and the understanding of global climate change.

TI  - Improving the Predictive Skill of a Distributed Hydrological Model by Calibration on Spatial Patterns With Multiple Satellite Data Sets
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological model calibration combining Earth observations and in situ measurements is a promising solution to overcome the limitations of the traditional streamflow-only calibration. However, combining multiple data sources in model calibration requires a meaningful integration of the data sets, which should harness their most reliable contents to avoid accumulation of their uncertainties and mislead the parameter estimation procedure. This study analyzes the improvement of model parameter selection by using only the spatial patterns of satellite remote sensing data, thereby ignoring their absolute values. Although satellite products are characterized by uncertainties, their most reliable key feature is the representation of spatial patterns, which is a unique and relevant source of information for distributed hydrological models. We propose a novel multivariate calibration framework exploiting spatial patterns and simultaneously incorporating streamflow and three satellite products (i.e., Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model [GLEAM] evaporation, European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative [ESA CCI] soil moisture, and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment [GRACE] terrestrial water storage). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature data set is used for model evaluation. A bias-insensitive and multicomponent spatial pattern matching metric is developed to formulate a multiobjective function. The proposed multivariate calibration framework is tested with the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM) and applied to the poorly gauged Volta River basin located in a predominantly semiarid climate in West Africa. Results of the multivariate calibration show that the decrease in performance for streamflow (-7%) and terrestrial water storage (-6%) is counterbalanced with an increase in performance for soil moisture (+105%) and evaporation (+26%). These results demonstrate that there are benefits in using satellite data sets, when suitably integrated in a robust model parametrization scheme.

CP  - IEEE Southwest Symposium on Image Analysis and Interpretation (SSIAI)

AB  - West Nile Virus (WNV) and St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE) are two of the most common mosquito-borne diseases in North America. WNV and SLE have sporadic spatial and temporal outbreaks, making their outbreaks difficult to predict. However, recent studies have found that mosquito abundance is correlated with WNV and SLE transmission, providing researchers with a starting point for the development of mosquito borne disease forecasting systems. Mosquito populations are controlled by a variety of environmental variables, including humidity, temperature, vegetation, and available water habitat for breeding. Current mosquito population forecasting models heavily weigh precipitation and temperature inputs, as they are traditionally seen as the best estimates of available breeding space in a region of interest. Although rainfall data are easy to acquire, precipitation data may not actually be the best estimates of mosquito habitat, as water does not flow evenly across landscapes. Furthermore, precipitation data generally come at a spatial resolution of 800 m to 2,500 m, and while this resolution can help predict mosquito abundances on large spatial scales, it inhibits the estimation of mosquito populations in urban areas with granular landscape heterogeneity. To overcome these limitations, this research explores the use of multispectral imagery for predicting mosquito populations, specifically in the Greater Toronto Area. Multispectral imagery is an attractive data source for predicting mosquito abundance due to its consistent collection and comparatively high spatial resolution (e.g., 30 m for Landsat). We derive a monthly time series of standard spectral indices from multispectral imagery over the Greater Toronto Area from 2004 to 2011. We then explore how spectral indices perform as a predictor for combined Cx. restuans and Cx. pipiens mosquito populations, with the ultimate aim of using multispectral imagery to forecast mosquito-borne diseases in highly urbanized areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of the interannual variability of primary production, surface water temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, and sea ice cover in the Laptev Sea were performed based on MODIS-Aqua data (2002-2018). For a 17-year period, a statistically significant positive trend of surface temperature (R-2 = 0.27) and a negative trend of photosynthetically active radiation (R-2 = 0.24) were established. For the investigated period, the average annual water temperature in the Laptev Sea increased by 1.38 degrees C and photosynthetically active radiation decreased by 3.4 Ein m(-2) d(-1). The ice-free water area extended insignificantly (0.15% y(-1)). The total primary production declined by 1.87 TgC or by 1.4% y(-1). This decline was accompanied by a decrease in area-specific primary production. For the investigated period, the average annual area-specific primary production values declined by 37.4 mgC m(-2) d(-1) or by 1.6% y(-1). The presented results suggest that changes in Laptev Sea primary productivity for the last 17 years were mainly caused by a decrease in photosynthetically active radiation and area-specific primary production rather than the dynamics of the sea ice cover.

AB  - Bosporus is an important strait which connects Black Sea to the Mediterranean along Marmara Sea, and very strategic marine transportation line for commercial sea-vessels which carry economic good. Traditionally the statistics of vessels are under responsibility of Turkish coastline security Department. In this study, we develop a sustainable vessel monitoring system which allows user to monitor the sea vessels from the specific date which SAR satellite data are available. The system is based in Google Earth Engine Platform. Sentinel 2 images have been used to create water mask. Sentinel SAR image has been used to detect the vessels. The image has been preprocessed for angle correction to ensure the image all pixels to the same pixel size. Then, the median value of SAR pixel values of all image collection in Google Earth engine is calculated to allow the detection of any object on the sea, which shifts the pixel value from the median value. The method is implemented in Google Earth Platform and the user can select any date to monitor the vessels over Bosporus including the information of number of total vessels.

TI  - THE ACCURACY OF SENTINEL LYMPH NODE POSITIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH CUTANEOUS SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA
T2  - ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) accounts for approximately 20% of the non-melanoma cancers and is the second most common skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma. In 85%of the cases, the first metastasis site is the regional lymph nodes. However, due to lack of evidence, predictivity and utility of SLNB in cSCC remain controversial. This study aims to determine the ratio of sentinel lymph node positivity and the accuracy of this technique in high-risk cSCC patients.Materials and methods: The study group included 164 SCC patients who were admitted to our clinic between January 2014 and January 2019. Patient data including age and clinical history, tumor localization and diameter, and pathological diagnoses were recorded from the database.Results: Out of the 164 patients in the study group, 124 (75.6%) were men and 40 (24.4%) were women. Tumor diameter was the mot common (92.7%) independent criteria for local recurrence and metastasis. Twelve patients who had been identified with perineural/vascular involvement in pathological examination all had diagnosed SLNB positivity. SLNB positivity was identified in 24 (14.6%) patients.Conclusion: Whilst SCC is one of the most important skin cancers, the accuracy, and indications of the SLNB are not well documented. Although there are many studies in the literature, there is no consensus in reporting the advantages of SLNB in patients with SCC. In this study, we believe that SLNB may reduce the potential morbidity of elective lymph node dissection, reduce the number of unnecessary regional LN dissections, and may improve the quality of life.

AB  - Developing new metrics for spatial pattern comparison of observed and simulated variables has been planned as major part of the first work package (WP1) of the SPACE project. This goal was achieved by developing SPAtial EFficiency metric (SPAEF) described below. For that first we have extensively investigated the current state-of-art spatial comparison metrics. We tested available metrics such as coefficient of variation, correlation coefficient, Goodman and Kruskal's lambda [1], Mapcurves [2], agreement coefficient [3], FSS, Theil's Uncertainty, EOF and Cramer's V [4-6] in calibration of a distributed hydrologic model. However, after many calibration-attempts we found them inadequate due to the unexpected resultant visual patterns resulted in high correlation but too low standard deviation or highly separate groups. Therefore, we introduced a brand new multi-component SPAEF metric in Demirel et al. [7] which showed the utility of SPAEF in an ensemble model calibration case. For further comparison of the SPAEF with other metrics and particularly analysing each component separately in a calibration framework please refer to the subsequent study by Koch et al. [8]. Illustrative examples and source codes are available in R, Python 2.7 and Matlab [9]. The SPAEF has an optimal value of 1 and defined as:  SPAEF=1-[(A-1)2+(B-1)2+(C-1)2]1/2 A=Correlation Coefficient (O,S) B=COV(O)/ COV(S) C=Histogram Match (O,S)  where A is the Pearson's correlation coefficient between observed AET map (O) and simulated AET map (S) for a particular month, B is the fraction of coefficient of variations representing spatial variability and C is the percentage of histogram intersection [10]. The C is calculated for a given histogram O of the observed AET map (O) and the histogram S of the model simulated AET map (S), each one containing bins i.e. number of bins is currently estimated as the square root of number of pixels/grids on the raster maps (if 2500 grids on the maps then 50 bins will be used). It is important to note that the raster maps are normalized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation equal to 1 (zscore) to avoid the effect of different units.  References: [1] L. A. Goodman and W.

AB  - Radiometric normalization is a fundamental preprocessing step for the analysis of multitemporal and multisensor satellite images. Some of the previous radiometric normalization studies addressed the elimination of spectral differences between bitemporal or cross-sensor images by performing canonical correlation analysis (CCA) or its generalization called kernel CCA (KCCA). The KCCA-based normalization methods, which assume that the relation between at-sensor radiances is spatially nonlinear, can successfully extract pseudoinvariant features (PIFs) for bitemporal images with nonlinear differences caused by seasonal variation and for bitemporal images acquired by different sensors with different spectral centers and bandwidths of spectral bands. However, these methods did not consider the problems of high computation and storage costs induced by the huge size of kernel matrices and the overfitting problem caused by nonlinear regression, making the methods infeasible for satellite images of large sizes. To solve these problems, a hybrid CCA with hybrid regression model is proposed, which can preserve the characteristics of nonlinear CCA and regression while reducing time and space complexity and solving overfitting problems. Cross-sensor images acquired by Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager sensors were used to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to the related CCA-based methods in terms of computational performance and PIF quality.

AB  - The ground measurement of forest height is time-consuming and labor-consuming. In recent years, with the development of satellite remote sensing technology, it is possible to obtain forest height using radar remote sensing data. This paper uses the simulated full polarization radar data as the research object. The PCT inversion method (PCT), RVoG inversion method (RVoG), coherent amplitude inversion method (COH) and DEM difference inversion method (DEM) was used to obtain forest height. Through these four inversion methods, the influence of four parameters (radar incident angle, vegetation density, tree species, actual forest height) on the inversion result was studied. The experimental results show that if the radar incident angle is closer to 45 degrees, the vegetation density is greater than or equal to 300 trees, and the actual forest height is higher than 10 meters, the forest height inversion results have better accuracy. The research's conclusions can provide a theoretical basis and method for error analysis of forest height inversion from real radar remote sensing data.

AB  - Coal mining in Peixian County, Jiangsu Province has a long history, and the surface subsidence of mining area is obvious. To better grasp the characteristics of long time-series surface subsidence in of mining area, this paper uses SBAS method fusing distributed scattererst to process 14 Sentinel-1A images ranging from October 2016 to April 2017, and obtains the deformation field caused by mining in Zhangshuanglou(ZSL) mine. The results show that SBAS method based on distributed object fusion can effectively monitor the surface subsidence. The maximum subsidence of Zhangshuanglou mining area reached - 209.3 mm in the period from October 2016 to April 2017, and there is a trend of gradual increase of surface subsidence. It needs to be early-warning through time series observation.

AB  - Examination of actual forest vegetation boundary has great economic importance. A positive examination result can serve as evidence of a violation of the rules for forest utilization. The use of remote sensing (RS) data can reduce the complexity of such a task and speed up the detection of the violations by using a pair of RS images collected at different dates. The article compares two algorithms of searching for changes in the forest vegetation boundary. The first is an elementwise classification algorithm using a tree histogram, whereas the second is a structural change detection algorithm based on superpixel segmentation and a modified Pytiev's projector. The algorithms do not require atmospheric correction of images, which makes them attractive for practical use. The article also provides the optimal values of parameters of the algorithms and investigates the influence of various characteristics of RS data such as source, imagery date, band combination, and spatial resolution on the forest boundary change detection accuracy.

AB  - The Sentinel 1 constellation with its early morning and evening pass is well-adapted to the geological study of the Baie des Veys, a French macrotidal bay. Whereas most of the satellites allow mapping only half of the surface of the bay, about 75% can be seen with Sentinel 1. A base comprising 641 Sentinel 1 images has been created. About a quarter of the images show interesting tidal conditions. The results dealt with: (i) the migration of the main channels, (ii) the land-directed sediment transport induced by the tidal asymmetry, (iii) the nature and moisture of the sediment also checked in the field, (iv) the topography of the bay by using the relation between the bare area and the tide record, (v) the development of salt-tolerant plants. Global perspectives offered by the Sentinel constellation meet local solutions as in the case of the Baie des Veys.

AB  - Study Design: Broad narrative review of current literature and adverse event databases. Objective: The aim of this review is to report the current state of wrong-site spine surgery (WSSS), whether the Universal Protocol has affected the rate, and the current trends regarding WSSS. Methods: An updated review of the current literature on WSSS, the Joint Commission sentinel event statistics database, and other state adverse event statistics database were performed. Results: WSSS is an adverse event that remains a potentially devastating problem, and although the incidence is difficult to determine, the rate is low. However, given the potential consequences for the patient as well as the surgeon, WSSS remains an event that continues to be reported alarmingly as often as before the implementation of the Universal Protocol. Conclusions: A systems-based approach like the Universal Protocol should be effective in preventing wrong-patient, wrong-procedure, and wrong-sided surgeries if the established protocol is implemented and followed consistently within a given institution. However, wrong-level surgery can still occur after successful completion of the Universal Protocol. The surgeon is the sole provider who can establish the correct vertebral level during the operation, and therefore, it is imperative that the surgeon design and implement a patient-specific protocol to ensure that the appropriate level is identified during the operation.

AB  - Intense rainfall in a shorter span of time causes a huge amount of erosion resulting in rapid deposition of sediment, consequently reducing the capacity of reservoir. Thus, it is necessary to estimate reservoir sedimentation and identify critical zones susceptible to erosion. With the help of RS and GIS technique, reservoir sedimentation and soil erosion have been assessed in Kodar river watershed. LANDSAT-8 imagery is used to calculate the capacity at various elevations of the reservoir. 14.39% of the reservoir capacity has been lost due to sedimentation in the last 36 years when compared to the designed storage. RUSLE model is being applied to estimate erosion. Thematic maps were prepared for various factors and overlaid in GIS resulting in computation of erosion. The estimated average soil erosion is 5.50 tons/hectare/year. To identify the critical zones, watershed is isolated into 11 sub-watersheds out of which 5 are under critical zone which needs best management practices.

AB  - Depth determination in shallow water area is critical to model for instance, a detailed shoreline position, a change in beach topography, and the potency of beach erosion. Multispectral images can provide a complete map of areas that are difficult to map by conventional hydrographic surveys due to their logistics difficulties and limited spatial coverage. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of various training and testing set ratios to model bathymetric data from remotely sensed imagery. This research applied three methods to derive shallow water bathymetric data tested on two subsets located along Tanjung Kelayang coastal areas. The methods combined echo-sounding measurements and the reflectance of blue, green, red and near infrared of Sentinel 2A image with 10 m spatial resolution. In the experiment, the echo-sounding data set was split into training and testing set in three different ratios to see the effect of these various training and testing ratios to the accuracy of all algorithms. From the results, we can see that all models perform well in estimating bathymetric data for the shallow water depth, however, the accuracies were slightly changing by the variation of the training and testing data included in the model. In general, all methods provide a comparable performance for shallow water depth with RMSE less than 1 m and can be used effectively for deriving accurate and updated medium resolution bathymetric maps.

AB  - El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) climate variability are global climate variability that can affect oceanographic conditions including SST (Sea Surface Temperature). Located between two oceans, the Indian and the Pacific, the variability of SST in Indonesia is influenced by ENSO and IOD. Previous studies have shown that the influence of ENSO in the Java Sea depends on the season, and while positive (negative) IOD decreases (increase) SST in Indonesian seas. This study aims to examine the effect of ENSO and IOD climate variability on the variability of SST in the Java Sea. SST data are obtained from NOAA Pathfinder and Aqua MODIS satellite image data, while wind data is obtained from ECMWF satellite imagery with long observed data for 36 years (1982-2017) using quantitative methods in spatial and temporal, we found that the influence of ENSO and IOD in Java Sea based on the intensity of the anomaly. The intensity of ENSO which is stronger can affect SST more than IOD.

TI  - A Robust Performance Evaluation Metric for Extracted Building Boundaries From Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Various methods for automatic building extraction from remote sensing data including light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data have been proposed over the last two decades but a standard metric for evaluation of the extracted building boundary has not been found yet. An extracted building boundary from LiDAR data usually has a zigzag pattern with missing detail, which makes it hard to compare the boundary with its reference. The existing metrics do not consider the significant point (e.g., corner) correspondences, therefore, cannot identify individual extralap and underlap areas in the extracted boundary. This article proposes an evaluation metric for the extracted boundary based on a newly proposed robust corner correspondence algorithm that finds one-to-one true corner correspondences between the reference and extracted boundaries. Assuming a building has a rectilinear shape, corners and lines are first detected for the extracted boundary. Then, corner correspondences are obtained between the extracted and reference boundaries. Each corner has two corresponding lines on its two sides that ideally are perpendicular to each other. The corner correspondences are finally ranked based on their distance, angle, and parallelism of corresponding lines. The metric is defined as the average minimum distance d(avg) from the extracted boundary points to their corresponding reference lines. Extralap and underlap areas are identified by comparing the point distances with d(avg). In experiments, the proposed metric performs more realistic than the existing metrics and finds the individual extralap and underlap areas effectively.

AB  - The scattering information from targets is either estimated by fitting suitable scattering models or by optimizing the received wave intensity through the diagonalization of the coherency (or covariance) matrix. In this study, a new roll-invariant scattering-type parameter is introduced, which jointly uses the 3D Barakat degree of polarisation and the elements of the coherency matrix as the received wave information from full-polarimetric (FP) SAR data. This scattering-type parameter is analogous to that of Cloude-Pottier's alpha for FP SAR data. Furthermore, we utilize this new scattering-type parameter to obtain a unique non-model based three-component scattering power decomposition technique. The powers obtained from the proposed technique are guaranteed to be non-negative, with the total power being conserved. The proposed method is qualitatively and quantitatively assessed using the L-band ALOS-2 and the C-band Radarsat-2 FP SAR data.

AB  - Target detection is an important problem in remote-sensing with crucial applications in law-enforcement, military and security surveillance, search-and-rescue operations, and air traffic control, among others. Owing to the recently increased availability of computational resources, deep-learning based methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in target detection from unimodal aerial imagery. In addition, owing to the availability of remote-sensing data from various imaging modalities, such as RGB, infrared, hyper-spectral, multi-spectral, synthetic aperture radar, and lidar, researchers have focused on leveraging the complementary information offered by these various modalities. Over the past few years, deep-learning methods have demonstrated enhanced performance using multi-modal data. In this work, we propose a method for vehicle detection from multi-modal aerial imagery, by means of a modified YOLOv3 deep neural network that conducts mid-level fusion. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed mid-level fusion architecture is the first of its kind to be used for vehicle detection from multi-modal aerial imagery using a hierarchical object detection network. Our experimental studies corroborate the advantages of the proposed method.

AB  - Shrimp is one of the agricultural commodities which has high economic value with global and increasing market value abroad. Thus, Shrimp production continues to increase. Shrimp production in Indramayu Regency in 2017 was 191,919.41 tons. This makes Indramayu Regency the largest producer of shrimp in West Java (BPS, 2017). Meanwhile, Mangrove is an area that has a high contribution. Mangrove ecosystems have an association with pond productivity. This study aims to analyze the productivity value of shrimp in Indramayu Regency and its effect on the mangrove ecosystem in Indramayu Regency in that particular area. The method that is used to change identify mangrove forests is Landsat 8 image then continued with composite band 564 and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetationation Index) with a distance of 1 Km, 2 Km, and 3 Km from the mangroves. Furthermore, the result of the interviews is used to find out the value of shrimp productivity. Analysis of data is calculated through regression methods to see the-relation proximity between shrimp productivity and mangroves. The regression result between the distance of mangroves and productivity yields with the value of R Square equals 71.7%. This result indicates a positive link between shrimp productivity and mangrove ecosystem.

AB  - The use of CubeSat missions for Earth Observation has greatly increased in the last 5 years, thanks to the miniaturization of components, optical payloads, the boost in power efficiency of critical systems and the resulting reduction in overall costs for the mission. GAUSS is proposing the creation of a hybrid constellation of 3U and 6U Cubesats, designed using lean-satellite methodology for the reduction in the costs of the single platform's development and manufacturing. The constellation under study will be competitively positioned in the Earth Observation scenario, generally dominated by institutional missions, in terms of data quality and fast response. The mission will make use of an advanced optical payload with sensing capabilities in the VNIR range, with seven spectral bands, some of which will be chosen from the 10m resolution bands currently in use by Sentinel-2. In particular, the proposed constellation will feature a min GSD of 5m for all the selected spectral bands, with a 20km swath at 500km of altitude, thanks to a TDI (Time Delay and Integration) CCD detector technology notably employed in low-light settings, as well as for fast-moving objects. This inclusion will increase radiometric performances, as well as multi-band enhancements and cross-sensor consistency, which are generally referred as the principal limitations of current CubeSat EO (Earth Observation) missions in orbit. The use of spectral bands currently employed by Sentinel missions will allow such observations to be integrated with publicly available Sentinel data, providing meaningful insights regarding the cooperation of existing and new EO constellations, as well as to conduct several studies on inter-calibration techniques of the space platforms. The constellation will be composed of both 3U and 6U CubeSat platforms, in SSO orbits selected and spaced as to allow interlink communications among the neighbouring CubeSats, for improved data download even when the satellites are not in visibility of a groundstation. The proposed constellation, compared to traditional missions, will have the advantage of being easily scalable, with faster access time to space, as well as reduced costs for the production of the single platform and its launch, particularly with the employment of the 3U CubeSat form factor. The constellation will make use of a hybrid approach also for the ADCS, with a custom-developed system composed of both reaction wheels and magnetorquers for the active control of the platforms. hi this paper the main characteristics relative to this CubeSat constellation for multi-spectral imaging will be discussed.

AB  - As the media landscape is increasingly populated by less than reputable sources of information, educators have turned to argument evaluation training as a potential solution. Unfortunately, the bias literature suggests that our ability to objectively evaluate an argument is, to a large extent, determined by the relationship between our own beliefs and the beliefs latent in the argument we are evaluating. If the argument supports our worldview, we are much more likely to overlook logical errors. Teachers recognize this need to adapt argument evaluation instruction to the specific beliefs of students. For instance, a teacher might intentionally assign a student an argument that the student disagrees with. Unfortunately, this kind of value-adaptive instruction is infrequent due to its unscalability. We propose a novel method for data-driven value-adaptive instruction in instructional technologies. This method can be used to combat bias in real-world contexts and support human reasoning during media consumption.

TI  - FORESTRY IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF ROSARIO DO SUL: A CASE STUDY IN THE PAMPA SUL-RIOGRANDENSE BIOME
T2  - GEO UERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The advance of forestry in the Pampa biome has developed as a state political strategy neoliberalist, camouflaged in a proposal of economic development of the region of the Campanha Gaucha. This article aims to present an overview of silvicultural activities in the municipality of Rosario do Suk, located in the southwest of Rio Grande do Sul. For this, a characterization of the forestry through thematic maps was elaborated. The construction of land use maps and their respective analyzes occurred from the use of LANDSAT 5 TM satellite images for the year of 1996 and LANDSAT 8 OLI for 2016. The image classification process was carried out using the software ENVI (R) 4.8, where samples were collected referring to water bodies, arboreal-shrub vegetation, sand banks,fields, crops, forestry and urban. During the field works it was observed that the areas where are the cultivation of exotic species, are used predominantly for commercial purposes such as the manufacture of cellulose, being few cases that are being used as "windbreaks" and for the protection of livestock small properties. Based on the presented scenario, can be concluded that unlike municipalities Rio Grande do Sul, in Rosario do Sul, eucalyptus plantations occurred in areas where was destined for agriculture, and there was no need for the appropriation of new areas with native vegetal cover, thus maintaining the fields used for livestock which is a traditional practice in the area of study.

AB  - Wetlands protection has been a constitutive part of the conservation strategies that the Chilean Forest Service has implemented in the Protected Wild Areas of Chile. These ecosystems are highly vulnerable to changes in their hydrological regime, generating direct effects on the hiodiversity associated with them. These changes may he related to the rainfall regime, however, the activities of drainage, overgrazing, landfill, or tributary deviation are the greatest threats that these ecosystems face today. For years, long-term satellite information was dismissed in the Chilean public service due to the lack of technical, computational or software capabilities. Nowadays, cloud computing tools with massive geodata analysis have democratized remote sensing, giving way to the development of web applications and online information analysis platforms. An interactive web application was developed in Google Earth Engine (GEE) that uses spectral indexes correlated with the presence of water, generating estimates in "almost real time" on Landsat and Sentinel-2 images. The Surface Water Satellite Monitoring Platform allows the automatic processing through the internee of the images available for the analyzed wetlands, overcoming the time and computational capacity restrictions required with conventional geomatics programs. This has allowed to support the management of these ecosystems, reducing the costs of field work and increasing the efficiency in the monitoring of wetlands in the Protected Wild Areas of Chile.

AB  - This brief note introduces a study that aims at quantifying the gain for sea ice observations which is achieved when combining L- and C-band SAR imagery for the retrieval of ice conditions and iceberg occurrences. An L-band SAR mission is currently under discussion at the European Space Agency (ESA) as one of the six Copernicus High Priority Candidate Missions (HPCMs). Since the emphasis of the study is on operational monitoring and ice charting, it involves contributions from different ice services that are members of the International Ice Charting Group (IICWG). Preliminary results confirm findings of earlier investigations on the use of L-band for sea ice monitoring and extend them with first systematic investigations of iceberg detection at L-band.

TI  - Quantification of Annual Settlement Growth in Rural Mining Areas Using Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on annual settlement growth have mainly focused on larger cities or incorporated data rarely available in, or applicable to, sparsely populated areas in sub-Saharan Africa, such as aerial photography or night-time light data. The aim of the present study is to quantify settlement growth in rural communities in Burkina Faso affected by industrial mining, which often experience substantial in-migration. A multi-annual training dataset was created using historic Google Earth imagery. Support vector machine classifiers were fitted on Landsat scenes to produce annual land use classification maps. Post-classification steps included visual quality assessments, majority voting of scenes of the same year and temporal consistency correction. Overall accuracy in the four studied scenes ranged between 58.5% and 95.1%. Arid conditions and limited availability of Google Earth imagery negatively affected classification accuracy. Humid study sites, where training data could be generated in proximity to the areas of interest, showed the highest classification accuracies. Overall, by relying solely on freely and globally available imagery, the proposed methodology is a promising approach for tracking fast-paced population dynamics in rural areas where population data is scarce. With the growing availability of longitudinal high-resolution imagery, including data from the Sentinel satellites, the potential applications of the methodology presented will further increase in the future.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) constitutes a meteorological and hydrogeological parameter which plays a critical role to climate, crop irrigation and water management (aquifer and surface water supplies). The scarcity of ground-based data along with the call for regional and global scale research, led to the emergence of remote sensing methods and products. Thus, algorithms and adaptations of the empirical methods have been developed to incorporate satellite data or a combination of satellite and meteorological data. The current study reviews popular models, namely, surface energy balance (SEB) algorithms (i.e. SEBAL, S-SEBAL, SEBAL-Tasumi, SEBS, T-SEB, S-SEBI, SSEBop, ASEBAL, METRIC), models based on vegetation and soil moisture indices (e.g. EVI, NDVI, LAI, GVMI) such as NDVI-CWS and modifications of established ET equations such as Penman-Monteith, Priestley-Taylor, Hargreaves-Samani, Granger, Carlson and Buffum, Droogers-Allen, REMCT incorporating satellite data. The aforementioned models come with their limitations in ET estimation depending on parameters such as scale, landuse/landcover (LU/LC) of the study area, quality of meteorological and satellite data, spatiotemporal resolution of satellite products, number of inputs and usability. Uncertainties occur when coarse MODIS-retrieved data inputs are incorporated. In Greece few research attempts employing satellite data for ET estimation are numbered, the majority of which of field scale or local scale over Thessaly. Future research could implement interpolation of measurements derived from a wide number of meteorological stations distributed over the study area at regional scale. Moreover, comparisons of ET estimations to pan evaporation measurements are recommended, aiming at obtaining more sophisticated, area-tailored models and quantifiable physical relations.

TI  - VERBALIZATION OF BACCHIC ACTIONS IN THE ARTISTIC WORLD OF FYODOR ABRAMOV
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The features of verbalization of Bacchic actions in the works of Fyodor Abramov (tetralogy "Brothers and Sisters", novels "Pelageya", "Alka", "Mamonikha", "Wooden Horses" and stories) are considered. The linguistic means of the individual author's interpretation of the "Wine Drinking" sphere as a fragment of the semantic field of a literary text are analyzed. Bacchic action from the point of view of manifestation of one or another cultural semantics in it (according to M. L. Kovshova): utilitarian, functional, aesthetic, social hierarchical, ideological and spiritual is studied. It is noted that in the artistic world of Abramov, the utilitarian and functional aspects generally correspond to the general cultural ones, reflected in the paremias. It was revealed that the social-hierarchical cultural layer has its own specificity, which manifests itself in two oppositions: "village - city", "collective farmer-peasant - rural intellectuals". The author notes that the ideological and spiritual component in understanding the situation of wine drinking is associated with the expression of the author's attitude, his worldview through the prism of the character's opinion. It is concluded that the verbalization of Bacchic action is distinguished by figurative interpretation, the attraction of components from various spheres: the use of expressions containing somatisms, animalisms, perceptual vocabulary, verbs of physical impact, etc. When analyzing the social component of some Bacchic expressions, it is noted that the objects of wine drinking (vessels) are interpreted as subjects of interpersonal relationships.

AB  - This article aims to present the developed, adapted and applied methodology for the study, mapping, and evaluation of the effect and intensity of the urban heat island(UHI) within the urban space of the city of Sofia, while assessing its potential impact on the structure of the city and the prospects for its development and structure. For this purpose, a combination of GIS-based spatial analysis techniques is used, based both on the application of traditional satellite data sources and on the use of state-of-the-art unmanned aerial vehicle systems (UAVs), delivering high-resolution information. The results obtained from the study are adapted towards their use for the purpose of supporting urban planning processes in the city and could greatly assist in the establishment of more adequate models of spatial planning in the urban area of Sofia, in the context of global climate change and the expected intensification of the UHI effects in the near future.

T2  - SLAVIA MERIDIONALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to trace the evolution of Assen Ignatov's attitude towards religion and to outline the main features of this change - from an intellectual whose worldview was initially Marxist to being a dissident philosopher known also for his respect for Christianity. The first part of the study is devoted to the early professional stages of Assen Ignatov's life (as a lecturer at Sofia University), when he attacked the "Bourgeois" philosophy for its affinity to religion. Gradually, these initial attitudes were seriously shaken, partly because he was one of the very few erudite thinkers in Bulgaria during the "socialist" period who witnessed the dogmatism and narrow interests of the Party philosophers. In addition, his escape to Western Europe was a radical break with the past, specifically with regard to religion. Assen Ignatov interpreted communism as a pseudo-religion from the viewpoint of Christian personalism and existentialism. The author concludes that the radical change of Ignatov's attitude towards religion shows the measure of his general change of worldview.

TI  - Quantifying the spatio-temporal patterns of dune migration near Minqin Oasis in northwestern China with time series of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigation of the spatio-temporal patterns of dune migration in a large-scale area with optical remote sensing techniques can help us to better understand aeolian phenomena and mitigate sand-dust disasters. With the rapid growth in data volume, extracting more accurate dune displacement time series and rates from optical observations has become possible; however, the method is not yet fully fledged. To address this issue, we propose an extended algorithm for the mature optical imagery cross-correlation (OICC) technique based on Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) acquisitions. The main innovative points of this algorithm are: 1) the proposed pairing strategy for the OICC processing; 2) the modularized post-processing procedures for noise removal; and 3) the introduction of singular value decomposition (SVD) time-series inversion of the redundant optical observations to quantify the dune migration. To test the effectiveness of this algorithm, it was applied in the study of dune migration near Minqin Oasis in northwestern China, using enriched L8 and S2 images collected between April 2013 and April 2018. Compared with the original OICC results in stable areas, the post-processing and inversion of the proposed algorithm reduce the uncertainty by around 22-35% and 3-5% for L8, 29-48% and 5-12% for S2, respectively. The cross-comparison between the L8- and S2-derived displacement time series shows high consistency, and presents a lower uncertainty than the result of the traditional no-inversion method. Furthermore, the derived displacement rates show spatial patterns that are similar to those of the manually digitized results obtained with historical Google (TM) Earth (GE) images. These comparisons show the advantage of the proposed algorithm in automatically and accurately quantifying dune migration. Taking into account these measurements, the spatio-temporal evolution patterns of dune migration in the study area were analyzed. From the spatial perspective, the sand dunes move along a northwest-southeast axis with four detected transport pathways. Our research also shows that around 1087.7 km(2) of dune fields present an active status. The active sand dunes are currently encroaching on around 155.5 km(2) and 4.4 km(2) of land each year outside and inside the oasis, respectively, representing a problem of rapid desertification. Temporally, the displacement time series along the dominant migration direction appears as seasonal variations that are seemly consistent with the changes in local atmospheric conditions. The proposed algorithm provides a new perspective to investigate the spatio-temporal evolution of dune migration with medium-resolution L8 and S2 optical datasets.

CP  - 11th International Symposium on Cyberspace Safety and Security (CSS)
CL  - Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The diffuse attenuation coefficient, K-d, is an inherent optical parameter of water. It is an important hydrologic index for both oceanography and biology. We proposed a new method to retrieve the diffuse attenuation coefficient from airborne LiDAR bathymetry data in this paper. Firstly, a formula was derived for calculating the values of K-d by using waveform from single laser shot. An algorithm was then deduced from the formula. K-d values could be retrieved from this algorithm. A case study on Wuzhizhou island in China was carried out to validate the method, it using a big Optech Aquarius bathymetry data. The results show well agreement with the MODIS products. Compared with other previous algorithms, this new algorithm could obtain the value of K-d from single laser shot, and the method could be applied to laser shots without bottom response even in deep or turbid water area.

AB  - The existence of wideband interference (WBI) would seriously reduce the SAR imaging quality and the following image interpretation accuracy. However, it is difficult to mitigate WBI owing to its large bandwidth and severe overlapping with useful signal. This paper proposes a WBI mitigation algorithm based on variational Bayesian inference. Firstly, a low-rank matrix factorization model for WBI is established according to the low rank characteristics of WBI in time-frequency domain. Then, we build the Bayesian posterior probability model for the low rank matrix factorization. Finally, the variational Bayesian inference is utilized to estimate the model parameters and reconstruct the WBI. The experimental results of WBI mitigation using measured WBI data acquired by the sentinel-1 satellite have verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - The Colombo is the main commercial metropolitan city in Sri Lanka with having highest population and building density, making the city is more ideal place to form Urban Heat Islands. This study was conducted to ecologically evaluate the Urban Heat Island effect in Colombo city using Landsat 8 satellite data. The temperature variation of the city was acquired by Land Surface Temperature, a parameter derived from Landsat 8, band10 (Thermal Infrared band), band4 (Red band) and band5 (Near Infrared) using Radiative Transfer Method. Evaluation of ecological condition was assessed using Urban Thermal Field Variance Index, a quantitative measurement of the urban ecological quality of life with respect to Urban Heat Island effect. The model verification was obtained by theoretical relationships between Surface Temperature, Normalized Difference Built-up Index and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Temperature distribution in Colombo city revealed that, majority of the environmentally critical areas were located near the harbor, central business area along the main transport system and coastal belt. According to above index, the city experiences two extremes as areas of optimal micro-climate and areas with heat stresses indicating the requirement of strong Urban Heat Island mitigation measures in future landscape development and urban planning of the city.

TI  - Modelling Distributions of Rove Beetles in Mountainous Areas Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots that are increasingly threatened by climate and land use/land cover changes. Long-term biodiversity monitoring programs provide unique insights into resulting adverse impacts on plant and animal species distribution. Species distribution models (SDMs) in combination with satellite remote sensing (SRS) data offer the opportunity to analyze shifts of species distributions in response to these changes in a spatially explicit way. Here, we predicted the presence probability of three different rove beetles in a mountainous protected area (Gran Paradiso National Park, GPNP) using environmental variables derived from Landsat and Aster Global Digital Elevation Model data and an ensemble modelling approach based on five different model algorithms (maximum entropy, random forest, generalized boosting models, generalized additive models, and generalized linear models). The objectives of the study were (1) to evaluate the potential of SRS data for predicting the presence of species dependent on local-scale environmental parameters at two different time periods, (2) to analyze shifts in species distributions between the years, and (3) to identify the most important species-specific SRS predictor variables. All ensemble models showed area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics values above 0.7 and true skills statistics (TSS) values above 0.4, highlighting the great potential of SRS data. While only a small proportion of the total area was predicted as highly suitable for each species, our results suggest an increase of suitable habitat over time for the species Platydracus stercorarius and Ocypus ophthalmicus, and an opposite trend for Dinothenarus fossor. Vegetation cover was the most important predictor variable in the majority of the SDMs across all three study species. To better account for intra- and inter-annual variability of population dynamics as well as environmental conditions, a continuation of the monitoring program in GPNP as well as the employment of SRS with higher spatial and temporal resolution is recommended.

AB  - Urban growth monitoring has always been a main concern for remote sensing researchers. Spectral indices and supervised classification can be used to extract urban areas automatically by saving technicians from digitizing hundreds of polygons by hands. Multiclass classifications exhibit a very promising performance in terms of accuracy. However, such methods are expensive and labor-intensive task as they require labeling all present classes in the study area. Nevertheless, in many applications, users may only be interested in a single land class. This referred to one-class classification (OC) problem. In this paper, we compare Binary Random Forest (RF), OC-Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), and Presence and Background Learning (PBL) algorithm for the extraction of built-up areas from multi date Landsat imagery. The obtained classification accuracies show that PBL based approach provides competitive extraction results with the less effort.

The extracted features are used in a patch-based classification of optical Sentinel-2 and Radar and Sentinel-1 images over an urban area to discriminate between different housing types. To evaluate the pertinence of the multiband texture features, various state-of-the-art color-texture feature extraction methods, such as Integrative Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrices (IGLCM), Opponent Gabor (OGabor) filters, Opponent Local Binary Patterns (OLBP), are considered and compared by means of K-nearest neighbors' classifier. Results from this study show that proposed approach produces the best accuracies, with the lowest computational time

AB  - The introductory part of the article focuses on the concept of legal pluralism, on the legal system of indigenous communities in Colombia and their own worldview, with an emphasis on the Nasa people located in the Cauca Department. Then, it underlines the key aspects of ancestral practices related to dispute resolution, which are the offender's recognition of responsibility, his feeling of shame, the victim's forgiveness, and the restitution of the original state, in order to reintegrate the transgressor to the community, to recover the social peace and, in general, to prevent conflicts.After pointing out the main features of traditional indigenous dispute resolution forms, the article concludes that there are similarities between indigenous and restorative justice. Thus, indigenous law could be an inspiration for the modern criminal law regarding the restorative and conciliatory issues, from the contemporary law point of view.

AB  - Statistical texture features are frequently used for the thematic processing of very high spatial resolution satellite images. The assessment of information content of 1st and 2nd order statistics is carried out based on processing WorldView-2 images of test areas located on the territory of the Savvatyevskoe forestry and employing the corresponding ground-based data. The comparison of the accuracy and computational efficiency of traditional and ensemble classifiers in the problem of pattern recognition of various natural and man-made objects reveals the high performance of the error correcting output codes method. The estimates obtained in this study demonstrate the advantage of using ensemble classification and 2nd order statistical texture features.

AB  - A wide range of involved areas of knowledge indicates a transdisciplinary focus on the formation of the fundamental basis of the NBIC convergence and, in turn, generates a particular sequence of problem layers of a worldview, philosophical, and ethical nature. The scientific community and politicians are faced with the question of moral and humanistic character and social philosophy, connected with the influence of the so-called "big technological four" on the transformational restructuring of the civilization, and on distinction changes that will affect the life outlook of every person. Considering the evolutionary formation of NBIC convergence from the point of view of the dialectical significance of the technological component in the chain of perception of the model of world civilization, we can draw an analogy with the formation of technological platforms for promising evolutionary development, which in synergetic and emergent interaction will create a configuration of favorable living conditions and socio-economic background. In turn, this trend will determine the trajectory of significant aspects of society, making it possible to verify the shape of the influence of convergent technologies on them.

TI  - Estimate of mean daily concentration of fine particulate matter in the Industrial and Port Complex area of Pecem, Ceara, Brazil
T2  - CADERNOS DE SAUDE PUBLICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with numerous negative health outcomes. Thus, monitoring the environmental concentration of PM2.5 is important, especially in heavily industrialized areas, since they harbor potential emitters of PM2.5 and substances with the potential to increase the toxicity of already suspended particles. This study aims to estimate daily concentrations of PM2.5 in three areas under the influence of the Industrial and Port Complex of Pecem (CIPP), Ceara State, Brazil. A nonlinear regression model was applied to estimate PM2.5, using satellite-monitored optical depth data. Estimates were performed in three areas of influence (Ai) of the CIPP (Sao Goncalo do Amarante - Ail, Paracuru and Paraipaba - Aill, and Caucaia - AiIII), from 2006 to 2017. Estimated mean annual concentrations were lower than established by Brazil's national legislation in all three Ai (8 mu g m(-3)). In all the Ai, the months of the dry season (September to February) showed the highest concentrations and a predominance of east winds, while the months of the rainy season (March to August) showed the lowest concentrations and less defined winds Weather conditions can play an important role in the removal, dispersal, or maintenance of concentrations of particulate matter in the region. Even at low estimated concentrations, it is important to assess the composition of fine participles in this region and their possible association with adverse health outcomes in the local population.

AB  - This work aims to determinate the relationship between C-band SAR backscattering measurements over Amazonian tropical forests and hourly precipitation rates, and to study the feasibility of a SAR-anomaly masking method based on orbital rain measurements. To do so, a comprehensive dataset of ESA's Sentinel-1 backscattering data and the concomitant GPM-IMERG precipitation data was collected and analysed. Backscattering anomalies were characterized in a statistically meaningful way. GAM models were then adjusted to the backscatter-rain data pairs. The computed models show a positive correlation between non-anomalous backscattering values and accumulated rain, of approximately 0,2 dB/rnm.h(-1) and 0,4 dB/mm.h(-1) for VV and VH polarizations. Negative anomalies, which can easily mislead deforestation algorithms, have a strong negative correlation with rain rate observed at the time of the SAR acquisition. This is especially true for VV measurements. The subsequent anomaly masking procedure, based on computed accumulated and hourly rain thresholding, yielded unsatisfactory results. These poor results are probably due to the coarse resolution of the 0.1 degrees GPM-IERG data, which is insufficient to track anomaly-generating atmospheric events such as storm rain cells. Rain related changes in SAR backscattering can compromise deforestation detection algorithms, and further research and sensor developing is needed to increase spatial resolution of precipitation measures, to reach an optimal backscattering anomaly screening.

AB  - The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) project was designed to observe the Earth's radiation budget at the 1 degrees regional and global scale. The CERES instruments on the Terra (10:30 AM local equator crossing time) and Aqua (1:30 PM) satellite may not accurately capture the 24-hour mean flux over regions with systematic diurnal cycles. The Terra-only and Aqua-only derived regional monthly mean SW flux can differ by 25 Wm(-2) over maritime stratus and land afternoon convective regions. The CERES project utilizes hourly Geostationary imager (GEO) derived broadband fluxes to more accurately estimate the regional diurnal flux in between CERES measurements. We propose an approach that converts the GEO visible radiance to broadband radiance using RTM radiances that are specific to the individual GEO visible channel spectral response functions. The RTM is first validated using the very spectrally narrow MODIS visible channel and CERES broadband radiances.

AB  - This paper examined the grotesque and the possibility of the healing power of the grotesque through Choi In-hun’s “Guunmong.” Humanity is in a contradictory situation of existing in chaotic world that cannot be explained rationally and the desperate search for finding clarity deeply seated in the mind. As such, the tragic worldview recognizes the suffering presupposed on the existence of man, and the grotesque signifies the reproduction of unfamiliar and eerie feelings. This has emerged as a way of prevailing in life for man who inherently embodies unconscious repression and fear, which has also evolved. Such grotesque inclinations are evident in “Guunmong.” The novel is composed of three layers that are discrete where hallucinations and delusions continue without context forming little relevance between the layers, making it difficult to construct a single narrative. It is plausible that the author had embodied an innate desire of self-healing through unbridling the compulsive consciousness as an intellectual who endured confusing and oppressive political situations. The grotesque narrative, stimulating the unconsciousness of the reader, is embraced, which then allows them to take a step toward the healing process of releasing unconscious oppression.

TI  - Pembrolizumab and tavokinogene telseplasmid electroporation in metastatic melanoma
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tavokinogene Telseplasmid Electroporation Therapy (TAVO) and Pembrolizumab therapy is being studied in subjects with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) resistant melanoma. TAVO is a novel office-based local therapy shown to be effective in patients with advanced melanoma. The technique involves the direct injection of a plasmid encoding IL-12 into an accessible tumor driven by electroporation. The tumor cells have then been shown to express high levels of IL-12 resulting in a local inflammatory response within the tumor microenvironment.PRESENTATION OF CASE: The patient with stage IIB, pT3b melanoma was treated with primary tumor resection and found to have a negative sentinel node biopsy. She subsequently developed regional recurrence and was treated with inguinal lymphadenectomy and adjuvant Nivolumab. Despite therapy, she had progression of disease with skin and subcutaneous metastases (in-transit lesions), brain and liver lesions, hilar and iliac nodal disease. She was transitioned to nivolumab + ipilimumab, and Talimogene Laherparepvec (T-VEC) therapy for the in-transit lesions, without success. Stereotactic radiosurgery was used for the brain metastasis. Groin subcutaneous and in-transit lesions were treated with TAVO and intravenous pembrolizumab. Serial physical exams and CT scans were used to assess response.DISCUSSION: All lesions treated with TAVO resolved. An abscopal response was also noted: hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy resolved. The liver mass and pelvic lymphadenopathy decreased in size, and her brain metastasis remained stable after radiation.CONCLUSION: This case suggests that combination TAVO and Pembrolizumab is a safe and effective local treatment for ICI resistant metastatic melanoma in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis. An abscopal effect was also noted through control of systemic disease. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IJS Publishing Group Ltd.

T2  - AUC GEOGRAPHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Erythropotamos is a tributary of river Evros and during the last decade its drainage basin flooded many times, causing extensive damage on properties. In order to assess flood susceptibility in the aforementioned study area, the inundated areas of floods that occurred in 2010, 2017 and 2018 were initially delineated with the aid of SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery by applying an established flood delineation methodology. Subsequently, flood susceptibility mapping was conducted for the study area by applying the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Topographical, hydrological and meteorological factors were used and each one of them was classified into three (3) flood susceptibility categories (low, medium and high). The determination of the importance for each factor over the others, which is the main objective of this research, was decided according to the proportion of the 2010 inundated area, captured by ENVISAT/ASAR imagery, which intersected with each factor's high susceptibility class. Finally, the resulting flood susceptibility map was validated according with the inundated areas of the 2017 and 2018 flood events, captured by SENTINEL-1 A/B imagery, indicating that approximately 60% of both of these areas intersected with the map's high susceptibility zone.

AB  - Worldview-3 stereo-extracted DSMs represent state-of-the-art products in the domain of satellite-based digital surface modelling. Main goal of our research was to evaluate the vertical accuracy of WV-3 derived DSMs over olive groves. Creation of high-accuracy WV-3 derived DSMs would allow efficient large scale management and protection of this valuable agricultural resource.Vertical accuracy of WV-3 derived DSM was evaluated at two test sites within Olive Gardens of Lun (Pag Island, Croatia), through the comparison with reference UAV photogrammetry derived VHR DSM. Two test sites were selected by object-based approach, established on spectral (NDVI, VARI) and height information (digital olive models (DOMs)). While first test site covers one single, individual oldest olive tree (45 m(2)), second test site covers larger area (2500 m(2)) with dense, unattended olive trees.Although vertical accuracy of individual olive trees still significantly deviates from reference model (RMSE = 3.604 m; MAE = 3.203 m), accuracy within larger test was much better (RMSE = 1.462 m; MAE = 1.127 m). This demonstrated that WV-3 stereo imagery has great potential for application in creation of DSMs over large scale forested areas, that would be hard to cover with field geospatial techniques (e.g. LiDAR or UAV photogrammetry).

AB  - Phenology monitoring observations have been traditionally linked to citizen science (CS) practices and limited to common species closely located to an observer's residence. This is a modest approximation to cover the strong variability of the vegetation phenology across biomes and to improve the knowledge of vegetation changes as climate change impacts. Thankfully, remote sensing imagery (RS), especially data from high spatial and temporal resolution satellites such as Sentinel-2A and 2B, has the potential to become an essential dataset for in-situ approaches by guiding volunteers in achieving this aim. This study presents the methodological design carried out in Catalunya to harmonize phenological vegetation monitoring protocol between RS and CS making data acquired from both approaches interoperable.First, an Earth Observation Open Data Cube (ODC) containing Sentinel-2 radiometrically corrected data was created. The ODC offers a solution for storing big data products in an efficient way with low-cost hardware and provides easy access to data by indexing it. A selection of similar to 40 000 areas presenting a homogeneous cover common species of interest has been extracted from existing vegetation cartography. A time-series analysis of vegetation indices (greening and flowering) derived from the ODC has been performed for each area. A final subset of similar to 5 000 areas presenting a flowering amplitude signal > 10% and a greening-up amplitude signal > 20% was extracted and included in an interactive map browser available to CS observers so they are guided to interesting areas to report their phenophase and evaluate their correlation with RS data.This protocol, resulting from the PhenoTandem project (CSEOL - ESA) provides an innovative approach making in-situ observations interoperable with RS products and confirms a promising partnership for phenology monitoring.

AB  - This study investigated the performance of various case definitions and influenza symptoms in a primary healthcare sentinel surveillance system. A retrospective study of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the cases reported by a primary healthcare sentinel surveillance network for eleven years in Catalonia was conducted. Crude and adjusted diagnostic odds ratios (aDORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the case definitions and symptoms for all weeks and epidemic weeks were estimated. The most predictive case definition for laboratory-confirmed influenza was the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition for ILI in all weeks (aDOR 2.69; 95% CI 2.42-2.99) and epidemic weeks (aDOR 2.20; 95% CI 1.90-2.54). The symptoms that were significant positive predictors for confirmed influenza were fever, cough, myalgia, headache, malaise, and sudden onset. Fever had the highest aDOR in all weeks (4.03; 95% CI 3.38-4.80) and epidemic weeks (2.78; 95% CI 2.21-3.50). All of the case definitions assessed performed better in patients with comorbidities than in those without. The performance of symptoms varied by age groups, with fever being of high value in older people, and cough being of high value in children. In patients with comorbidities, the performance of fever was the highest (aDOR 5.45; 95% CI 3.43-8.66). No differences in the performance of the case definition or symptoms in influenza cases according to virus type were found.

TI  - Thematic interpretation of high-resolution satellite images of vegetation based on field research data
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the results of studies on decoding vegetation using high and ultra-high resolution satellite images and ground-based observation data using direct decryption signs. Space images from the WorldView-2 apparatus with a spatial resolution of 0.5-1.0 m were selected for the dates of late spring, summer, early autumn during the period of a stable state of the deciduous vegetation cover. The work describes the communities of pine, spruce, mixed forests, as well as overgrown with trees areas of meadows in the territory of the Orichevsky district of the Kirov region. An explanation of the necessity of using images in a certain period of the year is given. Images taken in early spring (late april - early may) and in mid-autumn (late september - early october) are the most acceptable for interpretation in order to map forest tree communities.In the work, we used such deciphering signs as tone, color, structure, texture, background. The image of forest stands has a pronounced photographic drawing, which allows them to be distinguished in photographs from areas not covered with forest. When decoding, first of all, a grainy pattern is visible. Differences in the shapes and sizes of tree crowns, as well as in the outlines of their shadows in high- and ultra-high resolution images, make it possible to determine the composition of plantations. An important feature of the image of woody vegetation in a satellite image is its tonality. Mostly spruce, fir and pine forests in panchromatic black-and-white images are characterized by a darker tone than deciduous ones. The data of interpretation of space images can be used as the basis for creating a map of vegetation of the studied area.

T2  - CONFINS-REVUE FRANCO-BRESILIENNE DE GEOGRAPHIE-REVISTA FRANCO-BRASILEIRA DE GEOGRAFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study intended to analyze the dynamics of deforestation and land use in the region of Tailandia-PA, Brazil, between the years 1985 to 2015, focusing on the dynamics of the palm oil's implantation. Supervised classification and Landsat imagery acquired between 1985 and 2015 were used in this analysis, with the Maximum Likelihood algorithm use. The classes forest, secondary forest, exposed soil, farming, natural fields, oil palm and water were considered. The results show an old dynamic of deforestation, with greater or lesser intensity in the different historical periods identified, but persistent over time, even extending to the present. There was a 45% reduction in the forested area and the conversion of forests into, mainly, agricultural and livestock. The oil palm area increased by 904% in the period studied, being greater after 2009. It was proven that Thailand followed the Amazon traditional model of occupation, related to logging followed by cattle ranching, which persists, despite the decrease in deforestation. It should be noted that the scenario in 2015 was better, from an environmental point of view, than the scenarios observed in previous decades; however, oil palm needs periodic sustainability analysis mechanisms. Although no new deforestation has been observed for the direct implantation of palm oil from 2008, deforestation still occurs in areas of oil palm expansion and consolidation, which leads us to conjecture that oil palm could also indirectly foment deforestation.

TI  - Enhancing sustainability of grassland ecosystems through ecological restoration and grazing management in an era of climate change on Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The grassland ecosystems cover above 60% of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and provide important ecosystem services and functions at local and regional scales. However, both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic disturbances are challenging the sustainability of the QTP's grassland ecosystems in the era of global change. In this review paper, we summarized the causes and effects of grassland degradation, restoration practices used on degraded grasslands, impacts of climate change and nitrogen deposition on plants and soils, adaptation strategies to climate changes, impacts of livestock grazing on plants and soils, and sustainable grazing management on the QTP. We believed that the integration of internal drivers of ecosystem fragility with external disturbances such as overgrazing are the major causes of grassland degradations on the QTP. The quantitative evaluation systems for grassland ecosystem health including plant, soil and livestock indicators are theoretically feasible and technically reliable. The major impacts of grassland degradation on the QTP are loss of biodiversity, increased water erosion, reduced carbon sequestration, decrease pastoral productivity and reduced local human well-being. The current restoration practices are mostly revegetation of "Bare Land" severely degraded grasslands using cultivated grasses. Other restoration practices such as grazing fallow and grassland fencing can be applied to restore the lightly or moderately degraded grasslands. We believed that the side effects from soil drying on plant productivity and diversity in manipulative warming experiments could be the main cause of controversial findings about the effects of climate change on plant productivity, diversity, phenology, soil physics, biochemistry and organisms. Many scholars argued the advances and delays in greening-up date, lengthening and shortening of the growth period in the phenological responses of alpine grassland plants to a warming climate. Multiple sources of remote sensing data and diverse interpretive approaches should be applied and ground-based observations and surveys should be performed to improve the accuracy and reliability of model predictions on plant phenology. Inconsistent conclusions of climate change impacts on soil biochemistry and organisms except soil acidification and eutrophication have been widely observed in most manipulated studies of nitrogen deposition. Adaptive strategies should be employed to promote grassland system's sustainability of the QTP. Rotational grazing regime with moderate grazing intensity in the warm season may retain or promote plant height, cover, productivity and biodiversity, improve soil structure, fertility and microbial biomass, enhance carbon and nitrogen storage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the alpine grassland ecosystems.

TI  - RESEARCH ON ENERGY SAVING PLANNING OF URBAN HIGH-DENSITY GREEN SPACE BASED ON DIGITAL REMOTE SENSING IMAGES
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Green space is an important part of the construction of living environment. Planning of urban high-density green space has become a hot spot in urban space research. The data of urban high-density green space energy-saving planning data is of a diversified nature. The existing methods have poor correlation in the way of data recording, which has led to the problem of long planning time and single plant species. In this paper, we propose a method for energy-saving planning of urban high-density green space based on digital remote sensing images. The multi-scale segmentation method is used to segment the acquired digital remote sensing images, which can help us obtain information about the highly dense urban green space. The population size of the study area is predicted based on the ecological footprint. Based on the minimum cumulative resistance model, combined with the population size prediction results, an urban high-density green space energy-saving planning model is constructed to realize the urban high-density green space energy-saving planning. The experimental results show that the planning time of the proposed method is less than 2 min in multiple experimental iterations, and the plant diversity coefficient is higher than 7. This shows that the proposed method has the shortest planning time, and the plant diversity characteristics after planning are better.

AB  - The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a key structure parameter of plant canopy and is a basic input variable in various terrestrial ecological models. Previous studies indicate that the spatial heterogeneity and the mixture of different land cover types in the moderate resolution pixels will cause large errors in the retrieval of moderate resolution LAI product. Therefore, the influence of spatial heterogeneity should be corrected to retrieve a more reasonable LAI. In this study, we propose a method to improve the accuracy of moderate resolution LAI retrievals based on the mixed-pixel clumping index. The data simulated by the LESS model are used to validate the proposed method. Results show that the LAI estimated by the MODIS operational algorithm become smaller with the increase in spatial heterogeneity of pixel. The proposed method can correct the influence of mixed land cover types and spatial heterogeneity to obtain a more reasonable LAI, and thus shows the potential in generating the global moderate resolution LAI product with improved accuracy.

TI  - Coseismic and Postseismic Deformation of the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.6 Aketao Earthquake from InSAR Observations and Modelling
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - On November 25, 2016, the M-w 6.6 Aketao earthquake occurred in Xinjiang, western China. We used the combination of ascending Sentinel-1A, descending Sentinel-1B and ascending ALOS-2 PALSAR data to measure the coseismic deformation. The line-of-sight (LOS) coseismic deformation implies that the earthquake was dominated by right-lateral strike-slip. Ignoring the fault-perpendicular deformation, the fault-parallel and up-down deformation was extracted based on the combination of Sentinel-1A and 1B observations. Results show that the maximum fault-parallel deformation is ~ 13.7 cm at the north wall and the minimum is ~ -16.5 cm at the south wall of the Muji fault. Then, coseismic slip distribution was derived using the steepest descent method (SDM) based on a single-segment fault model using the three InSAR LOS observations as constraints. The slip distribution reveals two slip centers. The maximum slip of the eastern center is 0.5 m at a depth of 8.8 km, where the rake angle is ~ 181.2 degrees. The maximum slip of the western center is 0.6 m at a depth of 10.8 km, where the rake angle is ~ 181.1 degrees. The derived seismic moment obtained equals the M-w 6.6 earthquake. In this study, postseismic deformation time series in 1.5 years after the earthquake were retrieved from 26 multi-temporal Sentinel-1 descending scenes. The postseismic LOS deformation at the north and south walls of Muji fault both increases with time but in opposite directions. The cumulative deformation is 60-80 mm at the north wall, and -30 to -20 mm at the south wall. The postseismic deformation shows similar patterns with the coseismic deformation, and has the same mechanism. There is no obvious lock at the unbroken gap.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns of Forest Changes in Korean Peninsula Using Landsat Images During 1990-2015: A Comparative Study of Two Neighboring Countries
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest change in the Korean Peninsula related to different socioeconomic developments in North and South Korea and impacted on the regional environment. However, there was a lack of consistent information about forest changes, especially comparative knowledge of North and South Korea that support management and policymaking. We used the change object update method to generate the first object-based 30m land cover set for the peninsula and analyzed new observations of forest changes in North and South Korea from 1990-2000 to 2000-2015. Results showed that, in North Korea, annual forest loss increased from 142 km(2).yr(-1) to 257 km(2).yr(-1), and the total loss increased from 1,407 km(2) to 3,769 km(2). The elevation range where forest loss concentrated shifted from 100-300 m to 300-1,000 m. The conversion of forest to cropland increased from 1,256 km2 to 3,910 km(2), indicating North Korea's forest eroded by agriculture expansion to ensure food security. By contrast, in SouthKorea, despite forest total loss increased from 338 km(2) to 513 km(2), annual loss remained at 34 km(2).yr(-1). The forest loss was concentrated at the elevation range of 0-300 m, which linked with built-up land expansion. Different public income and social developments drove distinct magnitude of forest loss in the two countries. Follow the Global Forest Observations Initiative, although forest loss might be underestimated for North Korea and overestimated for South Korea, our land change information equipped good overall accuracy (>= 0.94 +/- 0.031). This study could provide useful implications for forest management and regional sustainable development.

AB  - The article is devoted to the study of ontological, aesthetical and anthropological features of visual communication in Plato and Thomas Mann. I compare T. Mann's Death in Venice artistic conception with the philosophical understanding of the image, contemplation, beauty and Eros of Plato, primarily in the dialogues Phaedrus and Symposium (with some reference to F. Nietzsche and the film by L. Visconti). The author explores the specifics of the visual-plastic worldview and the contemplative cognition of being, determined by the erotic foundation of the aesthetic contemplation of the human image as phenomenal manifestation of truth, fundamentally different from the one revealed in speech communication, and even capable of being autonomous from it, and represents the philosophical and artistic phenomenology of the development, transformation and implementation of such consciousness. The role of Athens and Venice as particularly significant historical-cultural topoi of visual communication is specially emphasized.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The study represents analysis of the features of the Black Sea ecosystem components transfer from the northwestern shelf to the deep-sea part and its dependence on circulation in the sea upper layer.Methods and Results. The fluxes of water mass, nutrients and bioproduction from the shelf zone to the deep part of the sea were calculated using the current fields and biogeochemical ones resulted from the reanalysis, which, in its turn, was carried out due to the Black Sea ecosystem model including assimilation of remote sensing data both in the numerical circulation model and in the biogeochemical block. Numerical modeling permitted to calculate the fluxes through three sections that bound the shelf zone (by the capes Kaliakra and Chersonesus, and along the 200 m isobath). Behavior of the RIM Current jet and, consequently, direction and magnitude of the flows through the boundaries of the northwestern shelf depend on the wind stress vorticity over the western part of the Black Sea. The type of circulation with the intense RIM Current jet pressed to the shelf edge, is characterized by the pattern of distribution of the inorganic nitrogen and phytoplankton surface concentration as a narrow strip of its high values along the Black Sea western and partially southern coasts. When the RIM Current jet is weak or moves from the shelf edge (that corresponds to the low values of the wind stress vorticity) the increased concentration values are located on the northwestern shelf.Conclusions. Direction, magnitude and character of horizontal distribution of the nutrient and bioproduction fluxes are determined mainly by circulation in the sea upper layer. The magnitude of these flows is significantly affected by difference between the nutrient and bioproduction concentrations in the shelf zone and in the deep part of the Black Sea.

AB  - Pasture biomass information is essential to monitor forage resources in grazed areas, as well as to support grazing management decisions. The increasing temporal and spatial resolutions offered by the new generation of orbital platforms, such as Planet CubeSat satellites, have improved the capability of monitoring pasture biomass using remotely -sensed data. In a preliminary study, we investigated the potential of spectral variables derived from PlanetScope imagery to predict pasture biomass in an area of Integrated Crop -Livestock System (ICLS) in Brazil. Satellite and field data were collected during the same period (May August 2019) for calibration and validation of the relation between predictor variables and pasture biomass using the Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm. We used as predictor variables 24 vegetation indices derived from PlanetScope imagery, as well as the four PlanetScope bands, and field management information. Pasture biomass ranged from approximately 24 to 656 g.m-2, with a coefficient of variation of 54.96%. Near Infrared Green Simple Ratio (N1R/Green), Green Leaf Algorithm (GLA) vegetation indices and days after sowing (DAS) are among the most important variables as measured by the RF Variable Importance metric in the best RF model predicting pasture biomass, which resulted in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 52.04 g.m-2 (32.75%). Accurate estimates of pasture biomass using spectral variables derived from PlanetScope imagery are promising, providing new insights into the opportunities and limitations related to the use of PlanetScope imagery for pasture monitoring.

M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has a rich density of superficial water bodies in its territory, this is associated with one of the largest potentials for hydroelectric power generation in the world. This potential has gradually been explored with the installation of hydroelectric projects over the years. In 2016, two hydroelectric plants were put into operation in the course of the Madeira River (Jirau and Santo Antonio hydroelectric). This study evaluated the fluvial morphology and the depositional dynamics of sediment downstream of these ventures, using data on the concentration of suspended sediments (CSS), and data from the orbital sensor Landsat 5 and 8 processed using the QGIS software. The results showed that there were physical alterations in the fluvial canal along the evaluated stretch, highlighting the erosion in the margins and the emergence of fluvial sand bank. Although the spatial analysis indicates an increase in river sand banks along the study area, the statistical analysis did not indicate significant differences between the CSS concentrations after the installation of hydroelectric enterprises.

AB  - Air Surface Temperature (Tair) available from meteorological stations, provides only limited information about spatial patterns over wide areas. The use of remote sensing data can help overcome this problem, particularly in areas with low station density, having the potential to improve the estimation of Tair at both regional and global scales. A study has been carried out to understand the relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST), available from INSAT 3D, and Tair, available from ground meteorological station. The result shows good correlation for winter season but it keeps reducing as we move towards monsoon probably due to increase in the extreme temperature and data unavailability. We also observed low root mean square error (RMSE) of similar to 1.5 C-o for months of winter season while it increases to similar to 4.5 C-o in June. We conclude that there is a good agreement between LST and air temperature, although the two temperatures have different physical meaning and responses to atmospheric conditions.

TI  - The influencing factors and precision improvement of IMRT head and neck tumor setup errors guided by CBCT imaging
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to analyze the factors that affect and improve the accuracy in the setup errors of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for head and neck tumor using CBCT imaging. A retrospective analysis was performed using the Elekta synergy linear accelerator airborne imaging system. CBCT scanning was performed during the pre-treatment (pr), post-correction (pc), and post-treatment (pt) periods, respectively. CBCT image-guided setup error data and the affecting factors were analyzed, and the standardized process for enhancing IMRT precision was put forward accordingly. The setup errors in the X, Y, and Z directions during the pr period were (0.63 +/- 0.77), (0.93 +/- 1.01), and (0.72 +/- 0.92) mm, during the pc period they were (0.06 +/- 0.54), (0.07 +/- 0.59), and (0.02 +/- 0.32) mm, and during the pt period they were (0.07 +/- 0.90), (0.16 +/- 0.71), and (0.05 +/- 0.87) mm, respectively. The pr and pc showed significant differences in the setup errors in the X, Y, and Z directions (Fx=9.66, Fy=6.29, Fz=38.49), (P<0.05), and during the pr period the frequencies of the setup of >= 3 mm were 8, 20, and 8 in the X, Y, and Z directions, accounting for 4.6%, 11.6%, and 4.6%, respectively. The setup errors gained their maximum value in the Y direction. The setup errors for IMRT in head and neck tumors remained low and matched the contribution to reduce the setup error. There are multiple factors affecting the setup errors of head and neck tumors. The pre-intervention parts should emphasize the positioning of the plastic mask and the preparation of the radiotherapy planning and quality control should be strictly performed to standardize the treatment-processes and monitor the equipment.

AB  - Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with regression models measure height, diameter and crown tree at an individual tree level to estimate inventory data, including volume, biomass, basal area, and diameter at breast height. The optical images provide high spatial resolution and multispectral reflectance, which improves the accuracy of tree identification. Fusion of multispectral and light detection and ranging data decrease segmentation errors. Many researches demonstrate that fusion reduced RMSE (root mean squared error) by 7% to 8%. In this paper, we study the feasibility of fusing of LIDAR and Multispectral data sets for forest structure parameter assessment. This fusion provides many 'features such as identifying individual trees, species, measuring tree height and crown diameter. To assess the benefit of fusing ALS and Sentinel images, 4 regression algorithms (Linear Model, Partial least Squares Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) were compared to model bagel area (G) and Gini index (GINI) as a function of ALS variables alone and both ALS and Sentinel 2 variables. Resulting models were compared based on both RIME (Root Mean Square Error) and R-2 values.

TI  - Optimizing arbovirus surveillance using risk mapping and coverage modelling
T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Diseases carried by mosquitoes and other arthropods endanger human health globally. Though costly, surveillance efforts are vital for disease control and prevention This paper describes an approach for strategically configuring targeted disease surveillance sites across a study area. The methodology combines risk index mapping and spatial optimization modelling. The risk index is used to identify demand for surveillance, and the maximum covering location problem is used to select a specified number of candidate surveillance sites that covers the maximum amount of risk. The approach is demonstrated using a case study where optimal locations for sentinel surveillance sites are selected for the purposes of detecting eastern equine encephalitis virus in a county in the state of Florida. Optimal sentinel sites were selected under a number of scenarios that modelled different target populations (horses or humans), coverage distances (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 km), and numbers of sites to select (1-12). Sentinel site selections for the horse and human models displayed different spatial patterns, with horse sites located largely in the west-central region and human ones in the north-central. Minor amounts of spatial overlap between the horse and human sites were observed, especially as coverage distances and numbers of sites were increased. Additionally, a near linear increase in risk coverage was observed as sites were incrementally added to the scenarios. This finding suggests that the number of sentinel sites within the ranges explored should be based on the maximum that can be funded, since they provide similar levels of benefit.

TI  - Aristotle's Philosophy as a Historical and Cultural Event
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper grounds today's value of Aristotle's philosophical ideas. The author emphasizes: the philosophical universe of Aristotle, his ideas are often considered in the context of culture, since philosophy is a form of cultural self-awareness. In relation to Aristotle, general provisions are concretized by the cultural eventuality of his ideas, their influence on the development of European science and education. The article holds the idea that Aristotle completes and summarizes the ancient worldview. He understood that myth and logos, "theologians" and "physicists" were separating. The conceptual and logical thought becomes independent, separating from mythological fantasies (not arising from them). Aristotle echoes the predecessors and at the same time paves the way for a new ontology project that he developed in connection with the question of "existing as such". The author examines how Aristotle's metaphysical concept completes the destruction of the Olympic system, and how the creation of a "physical" model of the world on its remains and marks the transition to the "ontological" model. Here is the watershed between traditional and European cultures. The author postulates that European culture in the person of Aristotle finds its discoverer and creator, who proves that the mind is a universal tool for anthropological dimensions of the space and creating a rational world view.

TI  - DANIIL KHARMS' PHRASEOLOGY AS TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH, SERBIAN, AND IRISH: SEMANTICS AND NATIONAL/CULTURAL PECULIARITIES
T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the meaning and use of idioms with reference to parallel texts, nominations of gestures and speech formulas, and the national/cultural peculiarities of an author's phraseology. The article refers to translations of Daniil Kharms' Incidences into Serbian, English, and Irish. The author studies the meanings of idioms used by Kharms and their modifications, the actualisation of certain semantic components as part of the translation process, and the rendition of the national/cultural peculiarities of idioms. The choice of a translation equivalent for an idiom depends of the author's ability to use idioms and their modifications. Kharms does not use idioms very often, but there are idioms in his texts whose use is untypical from the point of view of semantics: this makes the search for an equivalent in the language of translation challenging. The author analyses the culture-specific nature of Russian idioms in the text, including situations where the equivalent in the translation is also culture-specific (e. g. in the case of the Russian idiom (sic)). The article also focuses on the shades of meaning in international idioms and the appearance of translator's false friends in case of dated idioms (cf. (sic), i. e. 'start behaving in a certain way' vs. (sic)). Additionally, the work considers the influence of the linguistic worldview on translation transformations, such as the specification of urban landscape in the Irish translation, i. e. the use of the language of the rural population.

TI  - Hyperspectral remote sensing monitoring of cyanobacteria blooms in a large South American reservoir: high- and medium-spatial resolution satellite algorithm simulation
T2  - MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We used hyperspectral remote sensing with the aim of establishing a monitoring program for cyanobacteria in a South American reservoir. We sampled at a wide temporal (2012-16; 10 seasons) and spatial (30 km) gradient, and retrieved 111 field hyperspectral signatures, chlorophyll-a, cyanobacteria densities and total suspended solids. The hyperspectral signatures for cyanobacteria-dominated situations (n = 75) were used to select the most suitable spectral bands in seven high- and medium-spatial resolution satellites (Sentinel 2, Landsat 5, 7 and 8, SPOT-4/5 and -6/7, WorldView 2), and for the development of chlorophyll and cyanobacteria cell abundance algorithms (lambda(550) - lambda(650) + lambda(800)) divided by (lambda(550) + lambda(650) + lambda(800)). The best-performing chlorophyll algorithm was Sentinel 2 ((lambda(560) - lambda(660) + lambda(703)) divided by (lambda(560) + lambda(660) + lambda(703)); R-2 = 0.80), followed by WorldView 2 ((lambda(550) - lambda(660) + lambda(720)) divided by (lambda(550) + lambda(660) + lambda(720)); R-2 = 0.78), Landsat and the SPOT series ((lambda(550) - lambda(650) + lambda(800)) divided by (lambda(550) + lambda(650) + lambda(800)); R-2 = 0.67-0.74). When these models were run for cyanobacteria abundance, the coefficient of determination remained similar, but the root mean square error increased. This could affect the estimate of cyanobacteria cell abundance by similar to 20%, yet it still enable assessment of the alert level categories for risk assessment. The results of this study highlight the importance of the red and near-infrared region for identifying cyanobacteria in hypereutrophic waters, demonstrating coherence with field cyanobacteria abundance and enabling assessment of bloom distribution in this ecosystem.

AB  - The capability of synergistic satellite flood monitoring and forecasts is crucial for improving disaster preparedness and mitigation. In this study, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) fractional water (FW) data sets were used for flood mapping over southeast Africa during the Cyclone Idai event. We then developed a machine-learning approach with the support of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for 24-hour flood forecasting and 30-m inundation mapping using observations from SMAP and Landsat coupled with rainfall forecasts from Global Forecast System (GFS) 384-Hour Predicted Atmosphere Data. The forecast results for the Idai event captured the flood dynamics at 30-m resolution and showed inundation patterns consistent with independent satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations. The approach provides new capacity for flood monitoring and forecasts from synergistic satellite observations and is particularly valuable for data sparse regions.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - In this work, an effective 3-D reconstruction method for the transmission tower in mountain area, which combines the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and SAR Tomography (TomoSAR) based on generalized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (gOMP) algorithm, is proposed. This paper is focused on reconstruction performance of gOMP algorithm on SAR signal and the 3-D reconstruction of transmission tower, using the results obtained in mountain area on simulated and real TerraSAR-X data. The vertical signal of slant distance from SAR images can be regarded as sparse signal, so the gOMP algorithm can be used to obtain extraction of elevation and deformation rate of transmission towers in mountain area. When only primary and secondary scattering points is present in each range-azimuth resolution cell, this method can be exploited to estimate the elevation and the deformation rate of the transmission tower. The results have demonstrated the advantage of this method.

TI  - Understanding Land Subsidence Along the Coastal Areas of Guangdong, China, by Analyzing Multi-Track MTInSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal areas are usually densely populated, economically developed, ecologically dense, and subject to a phenomenon that is becoming increasingly serious, land subsidence. Land subsidence can accelerate the increase in relative sea level, lead to a series of potential hazards, and threaten the stability of the ecological environment and human lives. In this paper, we adopted two commonly used multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MTInSAR) techniques, Small baseline subset (SBAS) and Temporarily coherent point (TCP) InSAR, to monitor the land subsidence along the entire coastline of Guangdong Province. The long-wavelength L-band ALOS/PALSAR-1 dataset collected from 2007 to 2011 is used to generate the average deformation velocity and deformation time series. Linear subsidence rates over 150 mm/yr are observed in the Chaoshan Plain. The spatiotemporal characteristics are analyzed and then compared with land use and geology to infer potential causes of the land subsidence. The results show that (1) subsidence with notable rates (>20 mm/yr) mainly occurs in areas of aquaculture, followed by urban, agricultural, and forest areas, with percentages of 40.8%, 37.1%, 21.5%, and 0.6%, respectively; (2) subsidence is mainly concentrated in the compressible Holocene deposits, and clearly associated with the thickness of the deposits; and (3) groundwater exploitation for aquaculture and agricultural use outside city areas is probably the main cause of subsidence along these coastal areas.

TI  - Spectral features of submerged aquatic vegetation and water depths impact in Lake Ulansuhai
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Submerged plants play an important role in improving eutrophic water and rebuilding aquatic ecosystem. Using remote sensing technology, the distribution and growth of submerged plants can he monitored in real time and in large area. The depth from the water surface to the plant canopy ( WDC) directly affects the accurate remote sensing interpretation of submerged plants in lakes and rivers. Based on the measured spectral data, the spectral characteristics of submerged aquatic vegetation in Lake Ulansuhai were analyzed, and the effects of canopy water depth on the reflectance spectra of submerged plants in Lake Ulansuhai were studied. The retrieval model of canopy water depth of submerged plants in Lake Ulansuhai was established. The results showed that 1) There is a reflection peak near the 1662 nm and 2223 nm of the short wave infrared of the emergent plants, which is an important hand that distinguishes the emergent plants from the submerged plants and the floating algae. The spectral reflectance of the submerged plants ( WDC= 0) and the floating algae is very close, but there are obvious differences in the green band (550-690 nm). Therefore, the spectral characteristics of the green band and the short wave infrared band can he used to distinguish emergent plants, submerged plants and floating algae. 2) The spectral reflectance of submerged plant community decreased with the increase of WDC, and it changed most obviously in the range of 700-900 nm, and there was a significant negative correlation between the spectral reflectance of submerged plant community and WDC near the range of 700-735 nm. 3) A single hand / hand ratio retrieval model of WDC is established, in which the hand ratio retrieval model is better than the single hand retrieval model. The R2 of the band retrieval model is more than 0.70, the RMSE<13.70 cm, the MRPE< 28%, and the retrieval accuracy is high, which is suitable for retrieval of canopy water depth of submerged plants of 10-60 cm. 4) The situ spectral reflectance is integrated into the Landsat-8 OLI hand by using the spectral response function, and the retrieval model of the water depth of OLI is established. Among them, the power function model of hand ratio has the best retrieval effect, the R2 is 0.49, the RMSE is 18.17 cm, the MRPE is 40.05%, which can he used for the retrieval of the water depth of the submerged plant canopy in Lake Ulansuhai after accurate atmospheric correction.

TI  - Adaptively Selecting Interferograms for SBAS-InSAR Based on Graph Theory and Turbulence Atmosphere
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial-temporal baseline threshold method is commonly used to select interferograms for the Small BAseline Subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technique. However, this selection strategy is rather empirical and prone to including highly contaminated interferograms or excluding those with high quality. To overcome these limitations, this study first derives the relationship between the measurement accuracy of unknown parameters and the number of selected interferograms with their corresponding qualities. Subsequently, an adaptive interferogram selection method is proposed on the basis of Graph Theory (GT) and the turbulence atmospheric effects of interferogram. This proposed method first identifies and deletes the SAR image that is severely polluted by atmospheric phase. Second, high-quality interferograms are selected for SBAS-InSAR based on their corresponding turbulence atmospheric variance. Compared with the traditional selection method, this approach can significantly reduce the effect of turbulence atmosphere on SBAS-InSAR. A set of simulated experiments and real Sentinel-1A data in Hawaii, United States, validate the good performance of the proposed method.

TI  - Investigation method for regional soil erosion based on the Chinese Soil Loss Equation and high-resolution spatial data: Case study on the mountainous Yunnan Province, China
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating soil erosion at the regional scale is challenging because of the difficulties with balancing the accuracy against the cost, especially in areas where the terrain and land use are complex. In this study, we developed a feasible approach to evaluating soil erosion at the regional scale that uses the Chinese Soil Loss Equation (CSLE) and 0.5 m high-resolution Worldview Satellite images, from which soil and water conservation (SWC) engineering practices were interpreted and included into the model as the E factor. We took the mountainous Yunnan Province of southwest China as a case study, and successfully tested this method and estimated the erosion modulus and soil erosion intensity of this region. The model was validated against with measured data derived from 47 runoff plots; the results showed that the coefficient of determination of CSLE was 0.89, which indicates high accuracy. The average erosion modulus was 12.56 t.ha(-1).a(-1 )at the provincial level, and areas with a high erosion modulus were mainly distributed in the central and northeast parts. The total soil erosion area was 104,727.74 km(2), accounting for 27.33% of the total area. More than 77% of above middle erosion occurred in farmlands. Our study is the first effort at incorporating high-precision SWC engineering measures data into regional soil erosion investigation. Our approach reduces the soil erosion estimation error caused by low data accuracy, overcomes the technical bottleneck for obtaining information on regional SWC measures, and provides a practical and low-cost method for evaluating regional soil erosion.

AB  - The landscape structure and composition of fauna and flora in the Mediterranean basin is shaped by fire. Thus, many plants and animals are resilient to fire. This is the case of most Mediterranean reptiles, which are adapted to open and heterogeneously complex landscapes as those derived from wildfires. However, socioeconomic and climate-change factors are modifying the Mediterranean fire regime, increasing the vulnerability of specific reptiles to intense and frequent fires. The Mediterranean terrestrial tortoises of the genus Testudo show high individual mortality by flames, and population declining in burnt landscapes. We predict an increasing negative impact of fire on the remaining tortoise populations across the Mediterranean Basin. In this work, the fire hazard map in the Mediterranean Basin was created based on remote sensing data and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and it was overlapped to the location of the remaining tortoise wild populations. Our results showed that tortoise populations were mostly identified in medium fire hazard. Given the negative response of terrestrial tortoises to fire, we predict a high extinction risk of Testudo species derived from fire activity in synergy to other environmental stressors.

TI  - Afrikaans reformed churches in the humdrum of the times: 1990 and beyond
T2  - STELLENBOSCH THEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - During the past nearly 30 years the epochs of democratisation and globalisation became intertwined with the South African society, determining its spirit of the age. The democratisation of South African since 1994 has its own history of radical rather than evolutionary transformative measures which brought about constructive changes to the political and social fibre of a secularised South Africa. In conjunction, globalisation as dominant worldview became evident in the transposition of South Africa into a secular, liberal, capitalistic, pluralistic society. Over this period the Afrikaans-speaking churches of reformed tradition were not immune to these influences, channelled via their members' experiences of and responses to their changing social and economic setup. These churches have since also changed. Their influence on society and social matters has dwindled. The contexts of their congregations changed. Their traditional collective forms of institutionalised religion are changing due to the influence of a plurality of different personal, religious beliefs and practices. These developments challenge these churches to rethink their denominational identities and consider the way in which they approach society and what they can contribute to the ecumenical church.

TI  - Remote sensing detection of plastic waste: recent improvements and remaining challenges
T2  - EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS XI

CP  - Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications XI held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference

AB  - The presence of plastic litters in the environment (both onshore and offshore) has long been identified as a threat for the ecosystems. Remote sensing provides an efficient and quick access to concentration areas of plastic litters. Due to composition similarities between plastics and hydrocarbons, absorption wavelengths are expected for plastics around 1730 and 2310 nm. Kuhn's Hydrocarbon Index can be used for the detection of plastic targets on a hyperspectral aerial product. Spectral comparison algorithms (Spectral Angle Mapper and Spectral Information Divergence) as well as a spectral unmixing algorithm are used. J. Bioucas-Dias SISAL and MVSA algorithms are adapted for the automation of endmembers selection. Those previous results obtained in a controlled environment were expanded upon by using previous plastic detection algorithms as well as an index- based method (Flooding Debris Index; Biermann et al., 2020) on Sentinel 2 multispectral products. Using a cut-off value on the results of the FDI in southern Spain, onshore greenhouses and offshore plastic debris were detected. A supervised classification complemented the method, based on optical properties of five hundred greenhouses roof and five hundred non-plastic targets. In addition to plastic detection on land, we assessed temporal distribution of threadlike film presence at the sea surface on radar images in the North Atlantic. Wind conditions derived from Sentinel-1 images also help to understand the detection conditions. Spectral band configurations of free constellation of Earth observation satellites are not covering plastic absorption peaks which represent a significant limitation for their detection. The spatial resolution of commercial satellites (i.e Worldview-3) may be better adapted to plastic waste detection that have size distributions lower than open access satellite constellations. Even if offshore plastic detection with open access constellations remain challenging, image processing techniques may improve the detection.

AB  - Yu Chihwan(柳致環, pen name: 靑馬)’s fifth collection With the Infantry(步兵과 더불어) contains 23 poems about his experience as a war writer(從軍作家) during the Korean War and 11 other poems about the war. “With the Infantry” has been unduly marginalized in existing poetry studies, not only in terms of Yu’s weight in Korean literary history, but also in terms of the representation of experiences of on-the-scene war writers generally. This dissertation focuses its analysis on Yu’s 23 ‘war writer’ poems (“With the Infantry”) describing the actual war zone.The 23 poems are relatively direct improvisations about the experience of war, but they are quite out of step with the ‘nationalist gaze’ expected of on-the-scene war writing. They mostly appeal to ‘humanity’(인간애) beyond the horrors of war and the ideology that drove the war. This dissertation reveals Yu’s poetic praxis of objectifying the referent/object in order to highlight this appeal, a praxis (or attitude) that may be called Yu’s method and his spirit. Through poetic objectification, Yu reveals humanity(인간애) by understanding the victims of war at the originary level of the human(인간).Humanity in also closely related to a pro-natural worldview. Human values that go beyond the values / ideologies placed on humans, have their true meaning in the pro-natural world. The best poems in With the Infantry, in their descriptions of scenes depicting humans assimilating with nature, confirm the worthlessness of the war itself and the ideology that brought the war. Such stands as an example of a literary style responding effectively to a crisis in the community such the advent of war.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the perception of prospective science teachers in the process of developing and performing classes by combining individual values, worldviews, with integrated science education to foster scientific literacy required by democratic citizens. The main results of this study are: In order to incorporate the area of individual values of worldview into integrated science education, the subject of the class is appropriate to objectively observe one's thoughts and analyze them by oneself from a perspective that includes various values. In particular, the subject matter of energy or environment is appropriate. In addition, data on the role of teachers and actual class programs are needed for worldviews classes. In the course of the class, a class step should be provided for students to think and think about themselves, and activities such as discussion should be necessary for students to participate in. It is important to incorporate this into science education because the worldview provides the criteria for people to think, and it should provide students with opportunities to reflect on themselves and on the human as a whole. This integrated worldviews and education requires sufficient guidance for teachers.

AB  - The study developed and analyzed programs that incorporate observable worldviews-based science education and education for sustainable development(ESD) in science classes to emphasize integration with the background of the times and achieve effective goals of science education aimed at cultivating scientific literacy. As a result of applying the program to actual high school students, students were able to see the transition to the worldviews of ecology in the process of considering various values and making decisions by identifying their own values. Students' worldviews were found to be at odds during the process of identifying their worldviews and approaching values in various aspects of the class due to the conflicting values of each curriculum and teacher worldviews. In the area of individual values, the worldviews should be applied in science education and understanding of the worldviews of teachers and curriculum contents is also required. Through this study, we hope that access to the area of individual values represented by the worldview in science education will help students change fundamental.

TI  - Staying silent and speaking out in online comment sections: The influence of spiral of silence and corrective action in reaction to news
T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Through the lenses of Spiral of Silence Theory, the Corrective Action Hypothesis, and peer influence research, we conducted an online experiment to identify the influence of varying opinion climates on opinion expression about a news controversy. This study expands the corrective action literature by manipulating the perceived opinion climate and measuring opinion change and subsequent expression. After all participants (N = 415) read the same news story, they were randomly assigned to one of five opinion climate conditions (supportive, oppositional, mixed, uncertain or polarized) operationalized through user comments following the story. The experiment allowed participants to reply, comment, do both, or not further engage in an attempt to mirror real-world expression behavior. The results suggest that the opinion climate formed by news comments influenced the opinions and comments of participants, providing evidence that those who hold strong opinions are more likely to comment when they perceive the opinion climate to be oppositional rather than supportive to their worldview.

AB  - Classifying and evaluating the structure of tropical forest plant biomes based on up-to-date remote sensing data, remains a great challenge due to the species diversity, changes in the stages of seasonal growth. Remote sensing has long been a useful tool for classification and assessment of vegetation. For data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the ability to receive high-resolution data also partly solves this problem. The development of vegetation based on natural conditions includes: topographic, geomorphology, geologic conditions, climate, human impacts. Based on the red-green-blue colour model (RGB) obtained from UAV, analysis of VARI (visible atmospherically resistant Index) and TGI (triangulation greenness index), combined with the development characteristics of each group and type of biomes on different topography and geologic types, the researchers were able to give some characteristics of some tropical forest vegetation in Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve, Kon Tum province, Vietnam.

M3  - Article
AB  - I intend to show in what way the meaning of the concept of human nature emerges from the worldview that, taken within the context of modernization, leads to the devaluation of the meaning of human. Hence the need to re-conceptualize human nature emerges in such a way that the concept of human nature is necessary intertwined with the global processes and onto-epistemo-ethical aspects of the general worldview that designate the (self)understanding of contemporary culture. The aporetic structure of thinking poses a barrier to this goal. Its context of modern progress is based on the separation of nature and culture. The separation establishes an (im)possibility of answering the question whether the culture, as an expression of human nature, is a part of nature or the nature is, as a product of human comprehension, a part of culture. Instead of the posthuman strive to resolve this dilemma by abolishing the concept of human, which resolves neither ecological nor other types of crisis, the concept of human nature needs to be redefined.

In this work we generate Bayesian updating deforestation detection (BUDD) algorithms by incorporating Sentinel-1 backscatter and interferometric coherence with Sentinel-2 normalized vegetation index data. We show that the algorithm provides good performance in validation AOIs. We compare the effectiveness of different combinations of the three data modalities as inputs into the BUDD algorithm and compare against existing benchmarks based on optical imagery.

M3  - Article
AB  - There has been a significant increase in the spatial, spectral and temporal resolution of satellite images due to the developing satellite technologies. These increases also result in an increase in data size and volume, and hence data sharing difficulties. Increased data sizes also make it difficult to share and present geographic data over the web. Compressing satellite images is one of the solutions to these problems, which offers an optimization by reducing data size. In this study, it is aimed to evaluate the performance of JPEG compression algorithm, which is an international standard, in the context of web based spatial data broadcasting in order to compress multi-band satellite images obtained from Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and SPOT-7satellites. In addition, pyramid levels were added on the compressed images in order to enhance the WMS-based presentation performance of satellite images. In this study, four different JPEG compression levels and four different pyramid levels were applied on satellite images with different spatial resolution. The results were compared in terms of processing time, visual quality and data size. In addition, the resulting data was presented on the geographic data server and the broadcast performance on the web was determined. According to the results of the research, high performance and low data volume data can be broadcast with high compression and pyramid level.

AB  - The article first clarified the concept of "Tngri" and the related titles of Genghis Khan and the chief priest Teba-Tengri. It is proved that "Tngri" is not "Blue Sky", since the actual translation of this word is different. For the first time, not only the names of God and the eleven spirits of the medieval Mongols that Mangu Khan spoke about are mentioned, but their functions are explained in detail, the holidays associated with their veneration, the nature and time of their holding are indicated. The myth of shamanism and totemism of medieval Mongols is debunked. The relationship between the faith of the Genghis Khan's Mongols, their feast etiquette and the practice of forming and manning an army in the performance of its combat missions is revealed. It is proved that in medieval Mongolian society a harmonious worldview system was functioning, different from Zoroastrianism, Mithraism, the Bon religion and Tengrianism.

AB  - The article deals with the analysis of environmental problems from the point of view of aspects of publicistic creativity. In the modern period, the issues of preserving life on the planet have become a priority in the list of global world problems, as society stands on the verge of an environmental crisis. Environmental problems are interdisciplinary, but they are based on a sociocultural nature. The mass media and publicists are charged with the task of interpretation of the aspects of interaction between nature and society, the transformation of people's worldview in the aspect of the formation and development of ecological consciousness. Journalism and literature are able to form new meanings and new society's understanding of the importance of restoring harmony in the relationship "Human - Nature". The problem of environmental journalism is considered on the examples of works of the Kyrgyz authors: Ch. Aitmatov, M. Murataliev, K. Akmatova, A. Tokombayev. The presented material let us conclude that the problem of environmental journalism gains a new meaning in today's society and requires renewal of the scientific definition, which determines the scientific value of this article. The practical importance lies in the possibility of implementing the research results in the process of teaching at the faculties of journalism and philology in specialized and elective disciplines, as well as in the practice of mass media specializing in environmental themes.

T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article studies conceptualization of the phenomenon of women's social position on the basis of the language material of Russian as a foreign language coursebooks published in Russia and abroad in the period from 1995 to 2015. The aim of the study is to determine the specific features of the national conceptual systems in relation to the cognition of a fragment of the world about the place and role of women in modern society. The specific features of conceptual systems are revealed via a comparison, confirming the processes of mutual penetration and enrichment. 30 Russian and foreign textbooks have been analyzed, 5 and 7 of which were selected, respectively, for the analysis of thematic sections covering the life of a woman (primarily Russian). The selected semantic constructs, interpreted as generalized mental units of operational memory and knowledge verbalized by means of language, allowed the authors to discern a significantly greater number of semantic features of the concept in question in foreign textbooks of Russian as a foreign language, which may indicate a violation of the strategy of linguocultural correlation in these manuals. It is emphasized that when cognitive gaps are detected, the Russian conceptual system can be enriched with new knowledge brought into it by a different conceptual system.

AB  - The majority of optical images acquired via spaceborne remote sensing are affected by clouds. Recent advances in cloud removal combine multimodal data with deep neural networks recovering the affected areas. To relax the requirements on the data the network is trained on previous approaches utilized generative models no longer necessitating strict pixel-wise correspondences between cloudy input and cloud-free target images. However, such models are often-times prone to fiction, i.e. the generation of content systematically differing from the structure of the target images. In this work we combine the fusion of optical and radar imagery with the advantages of generative models trainable on unpaired optical data, while reducing fiction by reconstructing optical information only where it need be-over cloud-covered areas. We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively and demonstrate its effectiveness.

AB  - Satellite data and imagery have come a long way to improving the ability to analyze and forecast intense tropical cyclone (TC) development since the use of only visual and infrared imagery. With each new generation of sensor, knowledge of how and when a TC intensifies has expanded greatly, especially when coupled with the latest numerical models. This is especially important in the ocean basins where in situ measurements cannot be routinely obtained. A brief review of these new capabilities is presented here.

TI  - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Analysis of the first part impacted with the breaking of the Fundao Dam in Mariana-MG
T2  - REVISTA ELETRONICA EM GESTAO EDUCACAO E TECNOLOGIA AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the exploitation of mineral resources and suggests that an environmental management that meets a set of measures and mutual cooperation between public and private managers, civil society, and mining companies that exploit natural, renewable, and non-renewable resources is needed. Cooperation between managers and joint safety measures can prevent present and future accidents like the one that occurred in Mariana City in Minas Gerais State (MG). The questioning presented puts into discussion the disaster that occurred in Mariana City due to the rupture of the ore tailings dam (Fundao dam) in November 2015. With an estimated population of 60,000 inhabitants, Mariana City has a local economy directly linked to mining activities. Due to the impact caused by the rupture of the Fundao dam, both city and vegetation were destroyed, among other factors observed along the path followed by the tailings. However, what is discussed in this article with greater emphasis is the loss of vegetation in the watershed. The methodology compared the degree of vegetation coverage in the basin area through the analysis of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI for 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 in different months. Some images refer to August and other samples are from September, complementing the process through the use of Landsat 8 satellite images - OLI sensor, acquired from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) repository. 299 points were distributed in the quadrant to perform the analyses (n = 299). The level of significance was set at 5% with a 95% confidence, to ascertain and verify whether the data distribution is in an acceptable condition (dense or semi-dense vegetation cover). Regarding vegetation analysis, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests were used. Both tests indicated a non-normal distribution for the NDVI data set, which indicates the absence of a vegetation index that was covered by the tailings, resulting in an area with large spaces without the coverage previously registered in 2013. We conclude that the vegetation suffered a drastic alteration provoked by the rupture of the Fundao dam which also led to homeless residents, negative impacts on the livelihood of the small farmers and fishermen, silting up of rivers and streams, death of several animal and plant species, and also affected the ecosystem and the local and regional biodiversity.

TI  - The Sunbelt Melanoma Trial
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The Sunbelt Melanoma Trial, a multicenter, prospective randomized clinical study, evaluated the role of high-dose interferon alfa-2b (HDI) therapy for patients with a single positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis treated with a completion lymph node dissection (CLND). A second protocol in the trial evaluated the prognostic significance of using molecular markers to identify submicroscopic metastases in sentinel lymph nodes that were negative by routine pathologic analysis. The role of CLND with or without adjuvant HDI was evaluated in this group of patients. The results of the study demonstrated that adjuvant HDI offered no survival benefit for patients with a single positive SLN in terms of disease-free or overall survival. Molecular staging using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for melanoma markers did not identify a high-risk group of patients at increased risk of melanoma recurrence. Additional treatment of these patients who were PCR-positive with either CLND alone or CLND plus HDI did not improve their survival. Additional studies from the Sunbelt Melanoma Trial helped to validate the operational standards of the SLN biopsy procedure and defined the complication rates for both SLN biopsy and CLND. A prognostic risk calculator has been developed from trial data, and the importance of different micro-metastatic tumor burden measurements was reported. Although the Sunbelt Melanoma Trial did not demonstrate an improvement in survival with HDI, it is an important trial that highlights the significance of surgeon-initiated randomized clinical trials that incorporate surgical techniques, molecular biomarkers, and adjuvant therapy.

AB  - Paddy growth is influenced by natural factors such as climate and soil, the former being a factor that cannot be controlled. With global climate change, rainfall as one of the sources of water availability is the riskiest element affected, which is very influential in determining cropping patterns. This study aims to inventory the pattern of paddy cultivation in the province of West Sumatra by using the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) of MODIS imagery. This study uses the MODIS EVI image (MOD13Q1, 16 composite days, 250m resolution, 2014 to 2018) in West Sumatra. During the course of this study the Province of West Sumatra experienced 3 paddy cropping seasons with 2 periods of harvest in one cropping calendar year.

AB  - The denomination "school" in academic contexts carries with it a certain ambiguity. It can evoke a stimulating and innovative environment with a positive synergy between its members, but also a self-sufficient and almost complacent academic setting mainly concerned with preserving its own worldview. From this starting point, my contribution will reflect on the impact of the Ecole de Paris within the field of Anglophone research on Greek religion and especially on animal sacrifice. Focus lies on how has the concept of a "Paris school" been handled within the study of Greek religion and what position it occupies among scholars working in this field. Four overlapping positions can be distinguished: (1) naming and using the Paris school as a theoretical approach, (2) critiques, which is also a form of interaction, (3) naming and referring in passing without an in depth engagement, and (4) studies on Greek sacrifice which do not use the term or comment on the Paris school.

AB  - Geothermal energy exploration is an old technique, updated in recent years and expected to develop strongly in the near future. Its potential is inexhaustible. Indeed, it is an energy drawn from the heat of the basement and is renewed permanently. Its uses are many and varied: individual heating, collective heating, networks of heat, production of electricity, storage of calories, exchanges of temperature.In this research, we will study, using GIS (Geographic Information System) and remote sensing, to detect poten- tial geothermal reservoir areas. Three of satellite images types were used namely MODIS, ASTER and LANDSAT to detect and extract geothermal energy zones in the Sahara, the high Altas, the Middle Atlas and the Rif of Moroccan territory. Significant indices were calculated from satellite images to prospect for potential deposits, namely diurnal and nocturnal surface temperature, hydrothermal alteration indices and lineaments density layer. The present results include images of hydrothermal alteration indices, maps of lineaments and cracks for each zone studied and the surface temperature on the whole territory of Morocco. The good correlation between these three maps leads us to conclude that the Moroccan Sahara zone is considered as one of the most potential geothermal reservoir zone. ? 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The OumErRbiabasin is one of the watersheds with the largest number of hydraulic infrastructures in Morocco. These hydraulic structuressupply water for drinking, industrial and agricultural uses. The Ahmed El Hansali dam is a 740 Mm(3) reservoir located near Zaouyat Cheikh andhave an active storage of473 Mm(3). The succession of dry years in the OumErRbiabasin has had a negative impact on the water resource and has caused a remarkable decrease in the reservoir of the Ahmed el Hansali dam. In this paper, the MNDWI (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index) from Landsat 5-TM, Landsat 7-ETM, and Landsat 8-OLI satellite images was used to estimate the spatial and temporal fluctuations of the volumes of water stored in the reservoir between hydrological years 2002-03 and 2018-19. Results show that the volumes estimated by remote sensing reasonably match the volumes estimated by the OumErRbia Hydraulic Basin Agency (OERHBA)using recorded water levels and reservoir storage curve for years 2002-03 and 2013-14; the determination coefficient R-2 exceeds 0.90. The mapping of the extent of the dam's impoundment has shown a very significant decreasein the flooded area level during dry years.

AB  - The use of remote sensing in archaeological research allows the prospection of sub-surfaces in arid regions non-intrusively before the on-site investigation and excavation. While the actual detection method of expected buried archaeological structures is based on visual interpretation, this work provides a supporting archaeological guidance using remote sensing. The aim is to detect potential archaeological remains underneath the sand. This paper focuses on Saruq Al-Hadid surroundings, which is an archaeologist site discovered in 2002, located about 50 km south-east of Dubai, as archaeologists believe that other archaeological sites are potentially buried in the surroundings. The input data is derived from a combination of wavelength L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR), which is able to penetrate the sand, and multispectral optical images (Landsat 7). This paper develops a new strategy to help in the detection of suspected buried structures. The data fusion of surface roughness and spectral indices enables tackling the well-known limitation of SAR images and offers a set of pixels having an archaeological signature different from the manmade structures. The potential buried sites are then classified by performing a pixel-level unsupervised classification algorithm such as K-means cluster analysis. To test the performance of the proposed method, the results are compared with those obtained by visual interpretation.

TI  - The status of tobacco control in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: progress in the implementation of the MPOWER measures
T2  - EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN HEALTH JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) MPOWER measures are a set of highly effective tobacco control measures drawn from the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), designed to help countries reduce the prevalence of tobacco use. The WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic is published biennially to monitor global implementation of these measures.Aims: This review aimed to critically assess the status of MPOWER implementation in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.Methods: Data were collected for WHO Reports on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, focusing on the most recent 2019 edition. Regional population coverage figures were calculated using this data and population figures for the countries of the Region.Results: Between 2007 and 2018, for any MPOWER measure, there were 29 cases of countries progressing to the highest level of achievement; 23 cases of countries progressing to the intermediate levels from the lowest level; 12 cases of countries falling from the highest level; and 18 cases of countries falling to the lowest level. 57.7% of people are covered at the highest level for the monitoring measure; 63.7% for the smoke-free policies measure; 6.7% for the cessation measure; 60.7% for the health warnings measure; 37.4% for the mass media measure; 29.4% for the advertising bans measure; and 16.1% for the taxation measure.Conclusions: Countries must work comprehensively to improve tobacco control. Regional priorities should include lifting more people out of lowest level coverage for the health warnings and mass media measures, increasing taxation on tobacco products and improving access to cessation services.

AB  - El-Fayoum governorate has unique characteristics which induces mosquito proliferation and thus increased the risk arisen from diseases transmission. Present study explores the role of remote sensing and GIS modeling integrated with field survey for mapping mosquito breeding sites and the areas under risk of diseases transmission in El-Fayoum governorate. Entomological surveys were conducted for a total number of 40 accessible breeding sites during the period 12-16 November 2017. A calibrated Landsat OLI image, synchronized with the field trip, was processed to produce Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), and Land Surface Temperature (LST). A cartographic GIS model was generated to predict breeding sites in the whole governorate and to assess the potential risk. The main filarial disease vector (Culex pipiens) was abundant at Atsa district, while Malaria vectors (Anopheles sergentii and Anopheles multicolor) were mainly distributed in El-Fayoum and Youssef El-Seddiq districts. Means levels of NDVI, NDMI and LST at breeding habitats were recorded; 0.18, 0.08 and 21.75 degrees C, respectively. Results of the model showed that the highest predicted risk area was reported at Atsa district (94.4 km(2)) and Yousef El-Sediq (81.8 km(2)) while the lowest prediction was observed at Abshawai district (35.9 km(2)). It can be concluded that Atsa, Yousef El-Sedik and El-Fayoum districts are more vulnerable to Malaria and Filaria diseases outbreaks, thus precaution and pest control methods must be applied to mitigate the possible risks.

TI  - Cultural Heritage Management Using Remote Sensing Data and GIS Techniques around the Archaeological Area of Ancient Jeddah in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Historic Jeddah is located on the eastern shore of the Red Sea. Historic Jeddah was designated as a UNESCO world heritage site in 2014. The new urban development for the city of Jeddah has resulted in different spatial patterns. The southern part of Jeddah city falls within the moderate zone, because this area is well developed in regard to infrastructure with rainstorm and sewage networks. The middle area of the city falls within high vulnerability risk due to its high population, shallow water depth, flat slopes, and various incomplete network services (i.e., leakage from septic tanks and water pipes). The western and northwestern parts of the city are subject to very high pollution risk, due to the highly permeable area with coralline formation, very shallow water depth, and depressions. Unfortunately, historic Jeddah has been affected by the unplanned development and shallow water depth. Most of the construction and decoration of the ancient buildings are suffering from deterioration. The paper aims to detect the environmental changes, assessing the geo-environmental status, and creating some of the innovative solutions while using the integration between remote sensing and GIS techniques. The combination of SRTM, Corona 1966, Spot 1986, Landsat 1987, Orbview 2003, and Sentinel2A 2017 data will help in monitoring the changes around the study area. The Bands combination and the spatial statistical analysis are considered to be the most effective methods in the examination of the new built-up indices. GIS techniques and some models would be suggested as solutions to protect the archaeological area, according to UNESCO recommendations.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The Visible/Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is a key sensor on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) and the Joint Polar Satellite System JPSS-1 as well as the upcoming JPSS-2, JPSS-3, and JPSS-4. VIIRS collects Earth radiometry and imagery in 22 spectral bands from 0.4 to 12.5.m. Radiometric calibration of the reflective bands in the 0.4 to 2.5.m wavelength range is performed by measuring the sunlight reflectance from the Solar Diffuser Assembly (diffuser is Spectralon (R)). Spectralon (R) is known to solarize due to sun UV exposure at the blue end of the spectrum (similar to 0.4 - 0.6+ mu m) as seen by laboratory tests as well as on orbit data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua and VIIRS on NPP and NOAA-20. Similar to MODIS, the VIIRS uses a Solar Diffuser Stability Monitor (SDSM) to monitor the change in the Solar Diffuser reflectance in the 0.4 - 0.94 mu m wavelength range to correct the calibration coefficients. The SDSM measures the ratio of sun light reflecting from the Solar Diffuser to a direct view of the sun at 8 different spectral bands close to the VIIRS bands in spectral regions where solarization effects are present and absent. The spectral response of these bands is critical to calculating the corrections to the radiometric coefficients. The Relative Spectral Response of the 8 SDSM bands for JPSS-3 and JPSS-4 is presented. The out of band response for spectral regions where most of the solarization occurs (< 600 nm) is <0.15% showing minimal mixing with somewhat larger mixing in the low solarization region.

AB  - We used C-band data from the ESA satellites (ERS, ENVISAT and SENTINEL-1) to map ground motion patterns in the vicinity of Evinos dam in central Greece. The stability of the body of the dam was also examined. In the dam reservoir area, we obtained displacements up to 17 mm/year along the line of sight (LOS) in the vicinity of village Klepas (ENVISAT dataset; 2003-2010). Several active landslides in the InSAR data were confirmed on the field (September 2017). Regarding the dam body, ENVISAT data show no significant deformation (less than 7 mm/year along the LOS). The SENTINEL-1 data (up to 2017) continue to show the same behaviour, however, a periodic signal and differential deformation on the dam body of the order of -8 mm/year along the LOS were detected and needs further investigation. We also mapped small ground motions inside several villages upstream the dam. A new landslide inventory for the dam upstream area was created from optical data.

TI  - Epidermal autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1 and loricrin: a paradigm shift in the prognostication and stratification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I melanomas
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The updated American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria for melanoma remain unable to identify high-risk stage I tumour subsets.Objectives To determine the utility of epidermal autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1 (AMBRA1)/loricrin (AMLo) expression as a prognostic biomarker for AJCC stage I cutaneous melanoma.Methods Peritumoral AMBRA1 expression was evaluated in a retrospective discovery cohort of 76 AJCC stage I melanomas. AMLo expression was correlated with clinical outcomes up to 12 years in two independent powered, retrospective validation and qualification cohorts comprising 379 AJCC stage I melanomas.Results Decreased AMBRA1 expression in the epidermis overlying primary melanomas in a discovery cohort of 76 AJCC stage I tumours was associated with a 7-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate of 81 .5% vs. 100% survival with maintained AMBRA1 (P < 0.081). Following an immunohistochemistry protocol for semi-quantitative analysis of AMLo, analysis was undertaken in validation (n = 218) and qualification cohorts (n = 161) of AJCC stage I melanomas. Combined cohort analysis revealed a DFS rate of 98.3% in the AMLo low-risk group (n = 239) vs. 85.4% in the AMLo high-risk cohort (n = 140; P < 0.001). Subcohort multivariate analysis revealed that an AMLo hazard ratio (HR) of 4.04 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.69-9.66; P = 0.002] is a stronger predictor of DFS than Breslow depth (HR 2.97, 95% CI 0.93-9.56; P = 0.068) in stage IB patients.Conclusions Loss of AMLo expression in the epidermis overlying primary AJCC stage I melanomas identifies high-risk tumour subsets independently of Breslow depth.

TI  - Landsat 8 TIRS-derived relative temperature and thermal heterogeneity predict winter bird species richness patterns across the conterminous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal environment limits species ranges through its influence on physiology and resource distributions and thus affects species richness patterns over broad spatial scales. Understanding how temperature drives species richness patterns is particularly important in the context of global change and for effective conservation planning. Landsat 8's Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) allows direct mapping of temperature at moderate spatial resolutions (100 m, downscaled by the USGS to 30 m), overcoming limitations inherent in coarse interpolated weather station data that poorly capture fine-scale temperature patterns over broad areas. TIRS data thus offer the unique opportunity to understand how the thermal environment influences species richness patterns. Our aim was to develop and assess the ability of TIRS-based temperature metrics to predict patterns of winter bird richness across the conterminous United States during winter, a period of marked temperature stress for birds. We used TIRS data from 2013-2018 to derive metrics of relative temperature and intra-seasonal thermal heterogeneity. To quantify winter bird richness across the conterminous US, we tabulated the richness only for resident bird species, i.e., those species that do not move between the winter and breeding seasons, from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, the most extensive survey of birds in the US. We expected that relative temperature and thermal heterogeneity would have strong positive associations with winter bird richness because colder temperatures heighten temperature stress for birds, and thermal heterogeneity is a proxy for thermal niches and potential thermal refugia that can support more species. We further expected that both the strength of the effects and the relative importance of these variables would be greater for species with greater climate sensitivity, such as small-bodied species and climate-threatened species (i.e., those with large discrepancies between their current and future distributions following projected climate change). Consistent with our predictions, relative temperature and thermal heterogeneity strongly positively influenced winter bird richness patterns, with statistical models explaining 37.3% of the variance in resident bird richness. Thermal heterogeneity was the strongest predictor of small-bodied and climate-threatened species in our models, whereas relative temperature was the strongest predictor of large-bodied and climate-stable species. Our results demonstrate the important role that the thermal environment plays in governing winter bird richness patterns and highlight the previously underappreciated role that intra-seasonal thermal heterogeneity may have in supporting high winter bird species richness. Our findings thus illustrate the exciting potential for TIRS data to guide conservation planning in an era of global change.

AB  - The study shows the use of Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) acquired by the Sentinel 2A in evaluating the trees crowns damage in Japan largest wildfire in 2017. Ground truth used was from field-collected data on scorch crowns of trees from the burned area. Our results show that difference NDMI (dNDMI) of pre and post-fire images was the best spectral index among Normalize Burn Ratio (NBR), NBR2, Normalize Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), difference NBR (dNBR), difference NBR2 (dNBR2) and difference NDVI (dNDVI) for spectral sensitivity in differentiating unburned and burned areas. The estimates area for tree crowns damage due to high severity was the largest at 147 hectares (33.1%) and the total calculated burned area was 445.02 hectares which exceed less than 8% of the total burned area reported. This study is needed for Japan because of the different ecosystem and climate with other fire studies conducted in different regions.

AB  - Precision agricultural skill has constructed and will still construct the road we are moving into this novel theory of precision agriculture. By increasing the inspection and appliance of inputs on the land, farmers are changing from a usual, standardized treatment of every agricultural land to a perfect treatment for as little as possible districts. Remote sensing processes offer a basis for which vegetal stress and growth reaction can be estimated. Remote sensing research based on terrestrial and spatial domains has demonstrated that numerous kinds of plant illness, through pre-visual infection signs for pathogens, hostile species and also plant health indicators, can be identified through aerial hyperspectral imaging. Inspecting foliage using remote sensing data necessitates understanding of the organization and role of foliage and its reflectance characteristics. Sensors have been ameliorated to calculate the reflectance of incident bright at numerous wavebands and have been associated to plant evolution and plant cover. Remote sensing technology has the major advantage to obtaining data about a given entity or region without having physical exchange and frequently employs surface-based instruments or spatial pictures. Remote sensing would be considered as an economic and relevant instrument for land-scale pest controlling and study.

AB  - The proper management of resources allows better yields from crops. Within the field of remote sensing, one of the sectors benefited is the agricultural sector because changes in biodiversity can be quantified through the observation and temporary evaluation of satellite images. For example, different studies have shown the potential of using information from the ESA Sentinel-1 satellite to monitor the growing crops. The backscatter observations obtained from Sentinel 1A and Sentinel 1B satellites showed greater sensitivity to the change in vegetation according to the correlation study, it is shown that the correlation between vegetation parameters and Sentinel-1 observations is greater than 0.8.The application of this methodology allows the understanding of the temporal variability over corn fields in the central zone of Mexico and allows seeing the potential of the Sentinel-1 constellation for the monitoring of natural resources

TI  - Multitemporal land use change analysis in San Fernando, Tamaulipas for the Period 1987 to 2017
T2  - CIENCIAUAT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use Change (LUC) tends to have a negative effect on global atmospheric and climate processes. The objective of this paper was to assess the LUC for the San Fernando, Tamaulipas, Mexico municipality, during the period comprehended between 1987 and 2017. The classification by segmentation method was applied to satellite images obtained from 1987, 1997, 2007 and 2017, which allowed for a reduction in the noise that is characteristic of pixel-based classification. However, it was necessary to edit the results in order to recover human settlements, eliminate clouds and shadows, and reduce the confusion between vegetation cover and cultivated agricultural land in order to avoid introducing artificial LUC in the statistics produced. The multitemporal analysis showed a clear trend in the reduction of vegetation cover (-6.53 %) and of areas devoid of vegetation (-1.71 %). Likewise, the results also highlight a significant increase of agricultural land (+7.61 %), which seems to be unassociated with the increase of human settlements (+0.08 %). The developed methodology seems to be appropriate and of easy implementation to carry out the LUC analysis in other regions of interest.

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to explore Ki Young Hyun’s literary worldview through the storyline of his work Nuran. Having experienced national violence since he was young, Ki Young Hyun has concentrated on bringing out the stories of past time in a passionate tone. Considering that writers often portray the worlds they perceive through their works, Nuran can be interpreted as Hyun’s style of realism that extends from his awareness of national violence, Which is the primary subject matter of his world. Furthermore, interpreting Nuran as a reflection of Hyun’s awareness shown in his previous pieces is rather meaningful in regard to the clarification of his consistent literary direction.Therefore, the current study analyzed the storyline of Nuran in terms of “contradiction of democracy, collapse of community, and epic of disaster” in order to derive Hyun’s literary worldview.The necessity and importance of a macro narrative, which he tried to convey in Nuran, was defined as “literary purification.” In conclusion, Hyun’s Nuran can be considered the outcome of a literary work that suggests a meaningful direction for the reality and novels of the new century.

AB  - The ability to measure multi-axis contact forces and contact surface normals in real time is critical to allow robots to improve their dexterous manipulation and locomotion abilities. This paper presents a new fingertip sensor for 3axis contact force and contact location detection, as well as improvements on an existing footpad sensor through use of a new artificial neural network estimator. The fingertip sensor is intended for use in manipulation, while the footpad sensor is intended for high force use in locomotion. Both sensors consist of pressure sensing elements embedded within a rubber hemisphere, and utilize an artificial neural network to estimate the applied forces (f(x), f(y), and f(z)), and contact angles (theta and phi) from the individual sensor element readings. The sensors are inherently robust, and the hemispherical shape allows for easy integration into point feet and fingertips. Both the fingertip and footpad sensors demonstrate the ability to track forces and angles accurately over the surface of the hemisphere (theta +/- 45 degrees and phi +/- 45 degrees) and can experience up to 25N and 450N normal force, respectively, without saturating. The performance of the sensor is demonstrated with experimental results of dynamic control of a robotic arm with real-time sensor feedback.

AB  - In this paper, a methodological approach to classify lithology features using random forest and multisensor satellite imagery is presented. The incorporation of remote sensing techniques into regional geology mapping is important in order to make possible the implementation of monitoring strategies aimed to enhance national capabilities to provide information for natural disasters management, sustainable exploitation of natural resources, etc. In this context, the use of both optical/infrared and multi-wavelength synthetic aperture radar satellite data was evaluated in order to train a random forest algorithm, taking as reference field data, to generate a lithological map. Preliminary results have shown the capability of this approach to lithological classification with accuracies values higher than 80% in some conditions to map sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic lithological classes.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes the first step toward the development of the geophysical model function (GMF) for the retrieval of wind speed and wind stress in hurricanes, based on developing a relation between the cross-polarized satellite SAR data from Sentinel-1 and winds/stress observed from collocated NOAA GPS-dropsondes data. Field measurements and remote sensing data for tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean were analyzed. Using the data measured by GPS-dropsondes, average wind velocity profiles were obtained, while the parameters of the wind boundary layer (drag coefficient and friction velocity) were restored from the "wake" part of the velocity profiles using the self-similarity property. The self-similarity of the velocity profile "defect" in the boundary layer, known from the fluid dynamics, was used to retrieve the parameters of the atmospheric boundary layer (the surface wind velocity, drag coefficient, and friction velocity) from the dropsonde wind velocity profiles in ten major hurricanes. Based on the processing of the measurements in the hurricanes Irma 2017/09/07 and Maria 2017/09/21 and 2017/09/23 at a time close to the time of acquisition of the Sentinel-1 images, the dependencies of the cross-polarized normalized radar cross section on the wind speed and wind friction velocity were obtained and used for constructing the GMFs.

TI  - Queer Theory and Feminist Methods: A Review
T2  - INVESTIGACIONES FEMINISTAS
M3  - Review
AB  - Feminist research methodologies seek to conduct research that aligns with the political and social project of feminism. These research methodologies specifically focus on women's voice, experiences, and contributions, center a feminist perspective and adopt premises and assumptions of a feminist worldview. Some of these premises -raising critical consciousness, encouraging social change, and emphasizing a diversity of human experience related to gender at the intersection of race, sexuality, and other categories of identity- align with the premises and assumptions of queer theory. Since both feminist and queer research methods aim to centralize the experiences of people marginalized under racist, sexist, heterosexist, patriarchal, and imperialist conditions, both methods seek decentralization of and liberation from such experiences in research methodologies. While this paper will briefly discuss these important points of alignment between feminist methods and queer theory, the main purpose will be to distinguish these two broad approaches and to outline what queer theory additionally brings to the table.

AB  - Methods for analyzing the dynamics of the NDVI vegetation index using satellite data of Terra MODIS and Planet Scope of various spatial resolutions are considered. The combination of geospatial modeling methods and remote sensing data processing technologies allows us to identify the features and patterns of spatiotemporal development of crops. The studies were carried out on the example of the experimental agricultural enterprise "Minino" of the Krasnoyarsk Scientific Center of the SB RAS. The data on selected crops: wheat, barley. A digital model was developed that contains up-to-date information on agricultural fields, varieties, crops, soil, particle size distribution, parent rocks and terrain conditions. All this data is necessary for joint analysis with satellite images.

AB  - Urbanization increases land surface temperature (LST) due to urban surfaces radiating heat, which is influenced by variations in building materials, heights and spacing, and street geometry amongst other natural and manmade factors [1]. LST increases water consumption especially in summer, due to human behavior such as increased showering, drinking, entertainment and cooling. This research aims to use thermal remote sensing data and GIS tools to quantify the impact of LST on water consumption (WC) for the different seasons in Khan Younis Governorate; Palestine. Correlation was studied between water meter data for 2017 (28,000 houses) and the corresponding LST data of Landsat 8 at 100 m resolution. This study shows the potential of remotely sensed LST datasets for estimating WC under various seasonal climatic conditions, which has the potential to be a valuable tool for the management of water resources in urban areas.

AB  - Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform is an online tool, which venerates fast solutions in terms of image classification and does not require high performance computers locally. We investigate several data input scenarios for mapping native-vegetation and nonnative-vegetation in the Atlantic Forest region encompassed in a Landsat scene (224/076) acquired on November 28, 2019. The data input scenarios were: I- spectral bands (blue to shortwave infrared); II- NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index); III- mNDWI (modified Normalized Difference Water Index); IV- scenarios I and II and V- scenarios I to III. Our results showed that the use of spectral bands added NDVI and mNDWI (scenario V) provided the best performance for the native-vegetation mapping, with accuracy of 96.64% and kappa index of 0.91.

TI  - Multiplatform Earth Observation Systems for Monitoring Water Quality in Vulnerable Inland Ecosystems: Maspalomas Water Lagoon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate monitoring of water quality indicators, bathymetry and distribution of benthic habitats in vulnerable ecosystems is key to assessing the effects of climate change, the quality of natural areas and to guide appropriate biodiversity, tourism or fisheries policies. Coastal and inland water ecosystems are very complex but crucial due to their richness and primary production. In this context, remote sensing can be a reliable way to monitor these areas, mainly thanks to satellite sensors' improved spatial and spectral capabilities and airborne or drone instruments. In general, mapping bodies of water is challenging due to low signal-to-noise (SNR) at sensor level, due to the very low reflectance of water surfaces as well as atmospheric effects. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to provide a robust processing framework to estimate water quality parameters in inland shallow waters using multiplatform data. More specifically, we measured chlorophyll concentrations (Chl-a) from multispectral and hyperspectral sensors on board satellites, aircrafts and drones. The Natural Reserve of Maspalomas, Canary Island (Spain), was chosen for the study because of its complexity as well as being an inner lagoon with considerable organic and inorganic matter and chlorophyll concentration. This area can also be considered a well-known coastal-dune ecosystem attracting a large amount of tourists. The water quality parameter estimated by the remote sensing platforms has been validated using co-temporal in situ measurements collected during field campaigns, and quite satisfactory results have been achieved for this complex ecosystem. In particular, for the drone hyperspectral instrument, the root mean square error, computed to quantify the differences between the estimated and in situ chlorophyll-a concentrations, was 3.45 with a bias of 2.96.

AB  - The city of Maceio has been historically affected by cracks and sink events in buildings and city infrastructure. Availability of a consistent Sentinel 1 Mission dataset between 2014 and 2019 allows characterizing the undergoing crustal deformation process that provokes such effects. We processed a dataset of 81 SAR scenes using the DinSARSBAS time-series technique, which allowed us to obtain mean velocity of deformation and deformation time series. Detected displacement patterns show subsidence concentrated in the Mundati lagoon coast in front of Mutange, Pinheiro and Levada neighbourhoods. Inversion of the results, using analytical models, locates a sill-like source at similar to 400m depth and with a radius of similar to 0.8 km. Its depth would be compatible with re-activation of the Mutange fault system, possibly related to salt mining operations in the area. Further investigation is needed to better constrain the deformation source and to identify the observed process was active before the analysed time span.

AB  - This study analyzes Reading Mencius (讀孟子) by Ganjae Jeonwoo (1841–1922) to examine his stance on Seongsa Shimje (性師心弟, let your natural mind govern your cultured mind) and Shimbonseong (心本性, natural mind and cultured mind are one), considering Mencius’s theory of self-improvement at the same time. To examine the annotations of Reading Mencius, the author segmented each chapter and verse for the analysis. In addition, special attention was paid to comments and interpretations added to the seven chapters of Collected Works of Mencius. Ganjae was interested in human mind and stressed its cultivation through “the control of the mind” and “respect.” Thus, this article takes the stance that Ganjae’s interpretations focus on Mencius’s theory of self-improvement and analyzes the commentaries accordingly. In addition, according to the analysis of each chapter and verse, Ganjae has reinterpreted the important classics from the worldview of Neo-Confucianism to emphasize Seongsa Shimje and Shimbonseong, and he used the two principles as the foundation to attack his critics. Furthermore, the perspective of his foundation built on Mencius’s theory of self-improvement can be understood based on “clarity of the mind” and “practice of respect.” Ganjae expressed the relationship between the cultured mind and the natural mind by adopting the position of Kiho (畿湖) school. He built his argument of the cultured and natural mind around Li (理) and Qi (氣), and his theory ultimately reached theoretical consistency for practicing ethical morality. This study examined whether Ganjae’s concepts of the cultured and natural mind could be analyzed considering Mencius’s Neo-Confucian theory of self-improvement. The three most important points from Ganjae’s annotation of Mencius’s work for cultivating oneself were selected as implications for the modern human beings: (1) the immovable spirit (不動心), (2) finding one’s own heart (求放心), and (3) cultivating one’s spirit (牛山章). These facets could be of help in cultivating human morality (e.g., developing immovable spirit, and overcoming selfishness and returning to propriety) and one’s own mind.

AB  - Indigenous interpretative traditions of Islam has been widely developed since 17th century in China, with the great efforts of Chinese muslim scholars to interpret Islam through chinese language and traditions. As a result, we could see Confucianistic muslim scholar like Liu Zhi (劉智) who reconstruct Chinese Islamic worldview through Islamic mystical philosophy and neo-confucianistic way of thinking, as well as muslim scholars who put more stress on the original languages and meanings of Islam. In this paper, we focus on one of the great muslim scholars of Yunnan, Ma Dexin(馬德新) who had been also a leading figure of Yunnan panthay rebellion in 19th century. Ma had been experiencing new tendencies claiming to return to fundamental faith of Islam. And at the same time, he had been struggling to set new identities of Yunnan Muslims to overcome severe conflicts between majority Han zu(漢族) and minority Yunnan muslims after rebellion. Based on these circumstances, Ma’s Chinese translation of Maqṣad-i Aqṣa(the furthest goal), that is Daoxingjiujing 道行究竟was chosen to seek his own understanding on Chinese Islam. In his translaton Ma divided the text into two parts and chose completely different methods to convey their meanings. These different approaches are to be considered to co-relate Islamic worldview in original text with Liu Zhi’s indigenous interpretation of Islam. And analysi s on techni cal terms i n persi an texts and i ts chi nese translations are regarded to show Ma’s unique understanding of Chinese Islam.

TI  - Red-Edge Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI<sub>705</sub>) from Sentinel-2 imagery to assess post-fire regeneration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining post-fire information from a burnt region is of paramount importance in applications such as examining the disturbance of natural ecosystems and in providing crucial information to local authorities that have control on policymaking. This study uses freely available data from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel-2 satellite to create a Red-Edge Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI705) and combines the resulting layer with 30 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to assess topographical parameters (ie. slope steepness and aspect) which may have influenced the revegetation process. Additionally, weather data is combined with the aforementioned datasets to study the revegetation dynamics. A fire event which occurred in June 2016 in Evrychou, Cyprus, was chosen, as it was one of the largest fire events in the island and happened when the Sentinel-2 was already operational, hence a period of time spanning 14 months has been studied. The results have indicated an inconsistent NDVI705 change throughout the period. However, a significant improvement in NDVI705 values was observed in the months of spring 2017. The improvement in vegetation health was mostly observed on north-facing and less-steep slopes, something which corresponds with previous studies in northern-hemisphere Mediterranean climates. The results have also highlighted the ability to conduct a rapid and cost-effective post-fire assessment which can be scaled up or down depending on the fire size and which can be applied to any other environment where post-fire management is required.

The shift people face due to the new pandemic reality make them change their lifestyle and even the way of thinking The study deals with the values that provide the change in axiological sphere and human behavior strategies. The aim is to outline the set of preferential values that form a new global axiological worldview by means of cultural linguistic methodology, i.e. concept analysis and Personal Vocabulary Dictionary method. It results in concept description from the point of view of meaning, and value set outline based on vocabulary used to value foregrounding. All the values in subject turn to be extremely significant in global discourse and shape the actual worldview, ways and modes of behavior, Thus the study of preferential values appears to be essential in a post-pandemic world reality.

TI  - Evaluation of Backscattering Models and Support Vector Machine for the Retrieval of Bare Soil Moisture from Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this work was to retrieve surface soil moisture (SSM) by using scattering models and a support vector machine (SVM) technique driven by backscattering coefficients obtained from Sentinel-1 satellite images acquired over bare agricultural soil in the Tensfit basin of Morocco. Two backscattering models were selected in this study due to their wide use in inversion procedures: the theoretical integral equation model (IEM) and the semi-empirical model (Oh). To this end, the sensitivity of the SAR backscattering coefficients at VV (sigma vv degrees) and VH (sigma vh degrees) polarizations to in situ soil moisture data were analyzed first. As expected, the results showed that over bare soil the sigma vv degrees was well correlated with SSM compared to the sigma vh degrees, which showed more dispersion with correlation coefficients values (r) of about 0.84 and 0.61 for the VV and VH polarizations, respectively. Afterwards, these values of sigma vv degrees were compared to those simulated by the backscatter models. It was found that IEM driven by the measured length correlation L slightly underestimated SAR backscatter coefficients compared to the Oh model with a bias of about -0.7 dB and -1.2 dB and a root mean square (RMSE) of about 1.1 dB and 1.5 dB for Oh and IEM models, respectively. However, the use of an optimal value of L significantly improved the bias of IEM, which became near to zero, and the RMSE decreased to 0.9 dB. Then, a classical inversion approach of sigma vv degrees observations based on backscattering model is compared to a data driven retrieval technic (SVM). By comparing the retrieved soil moisture against ground truth measurements, it was found that results of SVM were very encouraging and were close to those obtained by IEM model. The bias and RMSE were about 0.28 vol.% and 2.77 vol.% and -0.13 vol.% and 2.71 vol.% for SVM and IEM, respectively. However, by taking into account the difficultly of obtaining roughness parameter at large scale, it was concluded that SVM is still a useful tool to retrieve soil moisture, and therefore, can be fairly used to generate maps at such scales.

AB  - This work is based on the use of weighted Least-squares (WLS) approaches for the generation of ground line-of-sight (LOS) displacement time-series through differential interferometric SAR methods. More precisely, in this paper, a WLS method that extends the usability of the Multi-Temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) algorithm in regions with medium-to-low coherence is presented. The proposed method relies on the adaptive selection and exploitation, pixel-by-pixel, of the medium-to-high coherent interferograms, such as to discard the noisy phase measurements. In such a way, for each pixel, it is possible to obtain several disjoined sets of interferograms, which are then connected by exploiting the weighted singular value decomposition (WSVD) method. As a consequence, the interferogram networks reduction may lead to rejecting some SAR acquisitions from the used dataset, this results in the generation of so called variable-length displacement time-series. The experimental results have been performed considering by applying the Weighted Adaptative Variable-lEngth (WAVE) technique to a dataset composed of 50 SAR images, gathered by the Italian Space Agency Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) constellation sensors over the Basilicata region, Southern Italy.

TI  - Monitoring hydropower reliability in Malawi with satellite data and machine learning
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydro-climatic extremes can affect the reliability of electricity supply, in particular in countries that depend greatly on hydropower or cooling water and have a limited adaptive capacity. Assessments of the vulnerability of the power sector and of the impact of extreme events are thus crucial for decision-makers, and yet often they are severely constrained by data scarcity. Here, we introduce and validate an energy-climate-water framework linking remotely-sensed data from multiple satellite missions and instruments (TOPEX/POSEIDON. OSTM/Jason, VIIRS, MODIS, TMPA, AMSR-E) and field observations. The platform exploits random forests regression algorithms to mitigate data scarcity and predict river discharge variability when ungauged. The validated predictions are used to assess the impact of hydroclimatic extremes on hydropower reliability and on the final use of electricity in urban areas proxied by nighttime light radiance variation. We apply the framework to the case of Malawi for the periods 2000-2018 and 2012-2018 for hydrology and power, respectively. Our results highlight the significant impact of hydro-climatic variability and dry extremes on both the supply of electricity and its final use. We thus show that a modelling framework based on open-access data from satellites, machine learning algorithms, and regression analysis can mitigate data scarcity and improve the understanding of vulnerabilities. The proposed approach can support long-term infrastructure development monitoring and identify vulnerable populations, in particular under a changing climate.

AB  - Large amounts of snow on the earth play an important role in atmospheric circulation and radiant energy budget in earth-atmosphere system. The spatial and temporal distribution of snow and the snow albedo determine the calculation of radiation energy budget. MODIS product provides snow cover data and Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer method can calculate snow albedo at ultraviolet, visible, infrared wavelengths. The monthly average snow cover ratio of grid cells in MOD10CM data sets from 2004 to 2018 was analyzed. The results show that the areas in which there are more months with snow in winter are high latitudes that include the arctic. The areas in which there are more months with snow in summer are Greenland and southern South America. The months with snow cover are positively correlated with the average snow cover ratio. DISORT model simulated the snow albedo under different radii, different snow thicknesses and different impurity concentrations. The larger the snow grain size, the lower the snow albedo and the lower the infinite depth of snow. Impurities in snow can reduce snow albedo and infinite depth of snow thickness. When the dust is 100ppmv in snow, the snow albedo with a radius of 50 mu m and 1000 mu m decreases by 10% and 40%, respectively, compared with albedo of pure snow. The spatial and temporal distribution of snow in a particular region and the albedo simulation of snow are helpful for the calculation of the radiation energy budget in this region and investigating the association between them in further study.

AB  - This paper presents a digital magnetic field detection system, which can collect and analyze the remote sensing data by using the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The proposed digital magnetic field detection system contains two different types of digital pulse-width modulation (PWM) ADCs by using the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (C-MOS) mixed-signal technology and the field-programmable gate array platform (FPGA). The 12-bit digital PWM delta-sigma (Delta Sigma) ADC is implemented in 180nm CMOS mixed-signal technology and achieves the signal-to-noise-distortion ratio (SNDR), the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) and the effective number of bits (ENOB) are 70.68dB, 92.62dB and 11.44-bit with a supply voltage of 1.2V and at a sampling rate of 58.82kS/s. The digital PWM successive approximation register (SAR) ADC is based on FPGA to reduce the interference in the workpiece magnetic field to enhance reliability. Proposed digital PWM ADCs can be combined with a Hall effect sensor to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field without using the microcontroller, which are widely used for proximity sensing, positioning, speed detection, and current sensing applications.

TI  - Clinical value of serum biomarkers CA153, CEA, and white blood cells in predicting sentinel lymph node metastasis of breast cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We retrospectively analyzed preoperative serum CA153, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and white blood cells (WBC) in 121 breast cancer patients who underwent breast-conserving therapy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) between June 2017 and April 2019 in our institution. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to determine the optional cut-offs of these biomarkers for predicting SLN metastasis. The relationship between the parameters to SLN metastasis of breast cancer was assessed by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression models. We finally enrolled 121 breast cancer patients who all underwent SLNB, of whom 56 were confirmed as positive SLN by histopathology. ROC curve analysis calculated an ideal CA153 cutoff value of 7.85 U/ml in prediction of SLN metastasis, with a sensitivity of 73.2%, and specificity of 67.7%. The ideal cutoff value for CEA to predict SLN metastasis was 1.66 ng/ml (sensitivity 67.9%, specificity 73.8%). CA153 combined with CEA showed specificity 78.6% and specificity 76.9%. CA153 and CEA combined with WBC presented sensitivity 80.4% and specificity 78.5%. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, CA153 (odds ratio (OR): 1.165, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.061-1.279, P<0.001) and CEA (OR: 3.440, 95% CI: 1.859-6.366, P<0.001) were independent predictive factors of SLN metastasis in patients with breast cancer.

AB  - Mesoscale eddies play an important role in the transportation and distribution of energy, material and heat in the global ocean. Therefore, mesoscale eddy detection has been researched for a long time. At present, several deep learning models have been proposed for mesoscale eddy detection. However, most of these methods only use single-modal data, while ignoring data of other modals closely related to mesoscale eddy detection. In this paper, we introduce a multi-modal mesoscale eddy dataset, consisting of the satellite data in three modals, i.e., sea surface height (SSH), sea surface temperature (SST) and velocity of flow. Furthermore, we propose an EDNet (Eddy Detection Network), which contains four modules, i.e., multi-modal data fusion module, deep fusion module, region proposal module and head module. We use multi-modal data fusion module to fuse multi-modal data, use deep fusion module to learn the feature representations of the fused multi-modal data and use the region proposal module to generate region proposals containing the mesoscale eddies. There are two branches in the head module, one for classifying and locating the mesoscale eddies, while the other for providing pixel-level instance segmentation of the mesoscale eddies. The experimental results show that EDNet based on multi-modal data fusion significantly improves the accuracy of mesoscale eddy detection over previous approaches.

AB  - This study investigates the long-term variation of global leaf area index (LAI) and their uncertainties based on an analysis of the most recent global GEOV2 and MODIS (V6.0) products from 2003 to 2018. The global LAI values, the product qualitative quality flags (QQFs) and quantitative quality indicators (QQIs) were analyzed to study their temporal trend. Results shows that the global GEOV2 and MODIS LAI increased from 2003 to 2018. Meanwhile, the GEOV2 product shows that the global LAI uncertainty (0.019/decade) and relative uncertainties (0.8%/decade) have also increased during the same period. Seasonally, both spring (MAM) and summer (JJA) have seen stronger increase in LAI, uncertainty and relative uncertainty from GEOV2. Among the biome types, the LAI increase mainly occur over the savanna regions, where the LAI uncertainty also increased swiftly (0.033/decade for GEOV2). The GEOV2 product shows that the LAI uncertainties for the evergreen broadleaf forest (EBF) increased abruptly since 2014, possibly because of the shift of satellite sensors. The global urban areas have observed a steady decrease in LAI. This study highlights the importance of global LAI uncertainty study and the information is critical for global environmental studies.

AB  - Global canopy clumping index (CI), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and leaf area index (LAI) are important vegetation biophysical variables. Understanding their relationship is crucial for land surface radiative transfer and land surface modeling. This study analyzed the global CI (CAS-CI, 1.1), FVC (GLASS V2.0), and LAI (MODIS V6.0) relationship derived from the satellite data from 2003 to 2017. The results show that, over the past 15 years, the global FVC and LAI has increased whereas the vegetation CI has decreased during this period. In general, CI shows a negative convex relationship with the global FVC and a concave relationship with LAI. The relationship will be further explored for different biome types and at different regions. The statistical relationship provides a deep understanding of the global CI, FVC, and LAI products. The relationship is useful for estimating the global canopy CI from FVC and LAI.

AB  - This paper demonstrates the first experiment of Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite operated in dual-channel sliding spotlight mode. First, the raw data of two channels need to be preprocessed, including channel error correction and signal reconstruction, so that it can be focused by the subsequent conventional single-channel sliding spotlight mode imaging methods. After imaging processing, to avoid the possible back-folded SAR image, it is necessary to carry out post-processing step. The imaging result of the data acquired by GF-3 is first given in this paper, it proves the capacity of achieving high-resolution wide-swath of multi-channel sliding spotlight mode, and the effectiveness of the processing method.

AB  - Recent climate change effects worsened water scarcity in Morocco and forced the country to seek alternative water resources such as domestic and industrial wastewater. In this context, we assessed the treatment efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) of the BeniMellal-Khenifra region based on physicochemical and biological parameters. Vegetation cover evolution near WWTPs was also analysed using satellite images (Landsat TM and OLI). Six WWTP were evaluated based on treated water quality and a survey of nearby farmers and residents. Results showed treated wastewater is in line with Moroccan standards, and can be reused for irrigation and aquaculture without harmful effects. The survey pointed to the Boujaad WWTP as a model in the region. The vegetation cover evolution before and after WWTP existence showed an important improvement of cultivated lands. As a conclusion, wastewater reuse will allow the BeniMellal-Khenifra region to secure agricultural irrigation to safeguard freshwater quantities and quality despite climate change.

AB  - Pandeglang District becomes a concern because one of the locations had an impact on the Tsunami on December 22, 2018. Its position in the western waters and directly facing the Anak Krakatau Volcano is very potentially vulnerable. The Tsunami triggered by the volcanic activity of Anak Krakatau Volcano, mountain avalanche material. Evaluation regarding coastal land affected is also needed to anticipate future disasters. The study of the coastal areas affected by extraordinary events, such as the Tsunami, was carried out by stakeholders in evaluating coastal land to be more responsive to disasters. Three sub-districts with different morphology selected as samples of the affected areas, Labuan, Sumur, and Panimbang. We used highresolution Sentinel 2.0 images and Elevation Model Data (SRTM DEM) with unsupervised classification method to perform analysis of the area affected by Tsunami condition on coastal features. The results showed that the area affected especially the low land, as open land area at Labuan Sub-district was 189,298 Ha, Sumur Sub-district, 144,837 Ha, and Panimbang Subdistrict was 282.852 Ha. Varied inundation range 50 - 200 meters from the coastline. The elevation of the three sub-districts shows vulnerable areas with an elevation of <2.5 m to 0.5 m above sea level.

AB  - Vegetation bio-physiological parameters are essential in crop management for both agricultural decision-makers and stockholders. Remote sensing has been used for estimation growth indicators during different growth stages. The main objective of the current study is the assessment of Sentinel-2 satellite data for retrieving the Leaf Area Index (LAI) using two different algorithms the Multi-Linear Regression (MLR) and the Neural Networks (NNs) to compare their results with standard method impeded in the SNAP software for calculating LAI. In this study, field measurements of 106 samples of potato and wheat crops were carried out at three different dates during the growing season of 2017. Field measurements included spectral reflectance and LAI. Moreover, the field measurements synchronized to the Sentinel-2 satellite images acquisition at three different growth stages. Preliminary statistical analysis applied to both collected field data and mapped biophysical parameters for identifying data outliers. Furthermore, Stepwise MLR and Gauss-Newton NNs used to model and predict LAI from the satellite data. The NNs showed a higher coefficient of determinations (R-2) than MLR with R-2 = 0.94 and 0.89, respectively, between the predicted and field-measured LAI. Concluding that NNs significantly enhanced the prediction accuracy of LAI using Sentinel-2 data compared to the linear regression methods.

AB  - Characterization of plant water use, generally determined from evapotranspiration, together with water stress, derived from remote sensing data in the thermal infrared domain, are needed to better manage water resources..Evapotranspiration and water stress can be simulated by a dual source energy balance model that combines satellite and in situ hydrometeorological information. Available hydrometeorological observations are often insufficient to account for the spatial and temporal variability of the area of interest. To address this issue, we developed a stochastic weather generator that relies on ERAS reanalyses and provides spatio-temporal scenarios of multiple hydrometeorological variables. The generator is evaluated and compared with two bias correction methods in terms of their ability to reproduce both observed hydrometeorological variables and simulated evapotranspiration and water stress in central Tunisia. Our analyses show that the stochastic generator offers interesting advantages to perform gap-filling and to extend the hydrometeorological time series in the past.

AB  - Triple-GEM detectors are a well known technology in high energy physics. In order to have a complete understanding of their behavior, in parallel with on beam testing, a Monte Carlo code has to be developed to simulate their response to the passage of particles. The software must take into account all the physical processes involved from the primary ionization up to the signal formation, e.g. the avalanche multiplication and the effect of the diffusion on the electrons. In the case of gas detectors, existing software such as Garfield already perform a very detailed simulation but are CPU time consuming. A description of a reliable but faster simulation is presented here: it uses a parametric description of the variables of interest obtained by suitable preliminary Garfield simulations and tuned to the test beam data. It can reproduce the real values of the charge measured by the strip, needed to reconstruct the position with the Charge Centroid method. In addition, particular attention was put to the simulation of the timing information, which permits to apply also the micro-Time Projection Chamber position reconstruction, for the first time on a triple-GEM. A comparison between simulation and experimental values of some sentinel variables in different conditions of magnetic field, high voltage settings and incident angle will be shown.

AB  - Satellite imagery contains valuable large-scale information for precision farming. However, the low-resolution of satellite images can make it challenging to extract crop status information due to mixed pixels, in particular within multi-species crop stands like grass-clover for silage. In contrast, proximal high-resolution images with centimeter to sub-millimeter scale contain cures for single crop species pixels. However, these are often sparsely sampled due to computational limitations.In this paper, we present a preliminary attempt to enrich multispectral satellite images with crop stand population intelligence extracted from sparsely proximal RGB samples. The system attempts to reinforce satellite imagery based on proximal indicators lowering the risk of faulty interpretation knowledge base for future farm management information system (FMIS). A semantic segmentation algorithm is utilized to find the ratio of grass, clover, and soil across proximal images. Sentinel-2 as satellite imagery is employed as the 10-meter ground sampling distance input of the system and the grass, clover, and soil ratios are the output gained simultaneously. The system includes 1) a method where the proximal images and satellite imagery are preprocessed and then aligned with each other; and 2) a non-linear Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) extracting grass, clover, and soil ratio. Estimation results present promising correlation between clover, grass, soil, and Sentinel-2. Although, more data with higher diversity of clover-grass mixture is required to confirm the distinction of clover and grass.

TI  - Computational modeling of land surface temperature using remote sensing data to investigate the spatial arrangement of buildings and energy consumption relationship
T2  - ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTATIONAL FLUID MECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of urban form on energy consumption has been the subject of various studies around the world. Having examined the effect of buildings on energy consumption, these studies indicate that the physical form of a city has a notable impact on the amount of energy consumed in its spaces. The present study identified the variables that affected energy consumption in residential buildings and analyzed their effects on energy consumption in four neighborhoods in Tehran: Apadana, Bimeh, Ekbatan-phase I, and Ekbatan-phase II. After extracting the variables, their effects are estimated with statistical methods, and the results are compared with the land surface temperature (LST) remote sensing data derived from Landsat 8 satellite images taken in the winter of 2019. The results showed that physical variables, such as the size of buildings, population density, vegetation cover, texture concentration, and surface color, have the greatest impacts on energy usage. For the Apadana neighborhood, the factors with the most potent effect on energy consumption were found to be the size of buildings and the population density. However, for other neighborhoods, in addition to these two factors, a third factor was also recognized to have a significant effect on energy consumption. This third factor for the Bimeh, Ekbatan-I, and Ekbatan-II neighborhoods was the type of buildings, texture concentration, and orientation of buildings, respectively.

TI  - Cold and Frost in Joseph Brodsky's Poetry
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The author analyzes the motifs of cold and frost in Joseph Brodsky's liryc poetry. The research shows that these motifs are traditionally associated with negative connotations, hypothetically originating from Robert Frost's lyrics, but revisualized by Brodsky in the light of existentialism. In hid artistic worldview, cold is related not only to a decay of feelings and images of death, it also deprives the poet of his identity, correlating to life understood as the life of a poet or wordsmith. There are several exclusions, mostly in Brodsky's early lyrics ('Chistmas Romance' and partly 'Almost An Elegy'). Nevertheless, Brodsky employs the motifs of cold and frost to express a melancholic attitude to the world where an individual is opressed. In order to deal with the challenges to comment upon semantically and functionally different examples, the author suggest taking a few typical texts and try to find in them the essence of the metaphor as a poetic equivalent of the deepest thoughts and emotions. The analysis reveals the likeness of Frost to Time, this being one of the major topoi of the Nobel winner which allows Brodsky to highlight the emotionality and subjectivity within the existential values as opposed to the objectivity and unruffledness of the outer world in its relation to an individual.

TI  - Assessment of pre-treatment and classification methods for Java paddy field cropping pattern detection on MODIS images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive paddy cropping in Java island has an intricate pattern both in spatial and temporal distribution due to landscape and scheduling complexity, in this case the temporal pattern is a key factor in predicting the paddy cropping season. Cropping pattern relevant to the temporal vegetation indices which can be obtained from MODIS temporal imagery. Monitoring of the cropping pattern is a critical factor in preserving the national food security of Indonesia. Remote sensing can be used as an alternative solution to monitor paddy cropping pattern by incorporating statistics analysis and signal processing methods into pre-processing and classification techniques. The main focus of this research is to evaluate the combination of those techniques implemented in MODIS images to classify the annual cropping patterns of paddy crop in Java island. The evaluated techniques involve combinations of four parameters including (1) temporal reconstruction (R0: untreated; R1: linear interpolation), (2) noise reduction (F0: untreated; F1: band-pass FFT; F2: wavelet filter), (3) unsupervised k-means classification using distance parameters (D1: Euclidean; D2: Mahalanobis), and (4) k number of classes (64, 128, 256). The classification validation was evaluated based on the paddy field site visit in several locations across Java island from the years of 2014 until 2017. The best combination (R1-F1-D1-256, the score of 74.5) was determined by the average score calculated from overall classification accuracy, percentage normality of class member, and the average correlation of class member. This combination can describe the highest number of cropping patterns (i. e., 26 patterns) that cover four types of paddy cropping systems (i.e., non-paddy, single paddy cropping, double paddy cropping, and triple paddy cropping). This selected technique can also be used to calculate the annual paddy cropping area.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed images are widely used in many imaging applications. Images captured under adverse atmospheric conditions lead to degraded images that are contrast deficient and noisy. This study is intended to address these defects of remotely sensed data efficiently. A perceptually inspired variational model is designed based upon the Bayesian framework, powered by the retinex theory. The atmospheric noise or the shot noise (precisely following a Poisson distribution) and contrast inhomogeneity are addressed in this article. The model thus designed is tested and verified both visually and quantitatively using various test data under different statistical measures. The comparative study reveals the efficiency of the model.

AB  - At the beginning of the 21st century, the dynamics of modern cities reform the understanding of the development of residential facilities. Increasing mobility, multifunctionality, problems of social stratification, segregation, as well as the growing dynamics of functional integration of production activities in the living environment and the formation of socio-ecological worldview in the society lead to a change in residential areas. The global practice of urban planning witnesses the newest volumetric and planning solutions in design projects of living environment. There is a development of new structural components of public spaces, change in social and functional characteristics of the dwelling architecture, all of which are of particular interest to the modern theory of urban planning. The article summarizes the patterns of urbanized territories of large cities, affecting the emergence of new forms of residential planning units in the early 21st century. It also characterizes the modern principles of morphogenesis in residential areas. The article builds on the results of on-site investigation of residential planning units in Russia, Germany, USA; the results of the analysis of literary sources, project proposals of the most significant examples of modern residential planning units.

TI  - Post-nonclassical Psychology and Pseudoscience: a Realistic Perspective
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes post-nonclassical psychology from the standpoint of realistic philosophy of science. There are three of its features that contribute to the fact that post-nonclassical psychology becomes a fertile ground for the development of pseudoscientific ideas. These are relativism, based on the pluralism of truth; the denial of reproducibility as a necessary criterion of scientific knowledge; and diffusion of the border between scientific and unscientific knowledge. It is revealed in the article that relativism is often embedded into post-nonclassical psychology by means of constructivism or constructionism. It is stated that the uniqueness of the object is not an obstacle to scientific research, which relies on the criterion of reproducibility. Also a number of characteristics of post-nonclassical psychology that bring it closer to the counter-scientific worldview (according to G. Holton) are identified in the article. It allows to suggest that from the classical standpoint post-nonclassical psychology should be considered not as a new stage in the development of science, but as an anti-science. It is concluded that within the post-nonclassical framework philosophy of science failed to exercise one of its functions, which is to protect science from the preconceptions of philosophers, mystics, church leaders, etc.

T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the reasons for political and epistemological interest in the problems of history and memory observed both in Western countries and in Russia. As such, the author calls, on the one hand, the heterogenization of modern societies as the reverse side of globalization processes and, on the other - the crisis of historical consciousness of Modernity, expressed in the loss of confidence in progressivism as one of the most important features of the historical consciousness of Modernity; in addition, the article notes a significant transformation of the projective nature of human's socio-political and historical worldview in the 19th century. The author holds the idea that the center of ideological controversies in the modern world is no longer the future, which was previously thought as completely subject to human action, but the past, which today is thought as incomplete, open to various interpretations, a system that can change its meaning. Thus, it is the past that turns out to be the moment with which the identification requirements of a social group or community are associated, and as a result, the past is the object of all sorts of ideological and political manipulations. These circumstances determine quite difficult relations between the three modes of our attitude to the past - history, memory and oblivion, the analysis of which requires serious critical efforts on the part of philosophy.

T2  - SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-KOSMICNA NAUKA I TEHNOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the method of the multidimensional density distribution of biotopes' areas of shallow landscapes as a kind of remote estimation of the status of aquatic ecosystems. The developed method is based on the combination of Earth remote sensing data and in-situ measurements of the ecological water quality index to provide sufficient data. The combination of existing methods of water quality assessment with approaches to decoding space images made it possible to develop a method for assessing the ecological status of reservoirs based on the multidimensional density of biotopes. This is achieved by comparing the areas of different types of biotopes decoded on the space images of that year for which the values of the ecological water quality index are known with the areas of the analyzed biotopes of the same aquatic ecosystem in the images of previous years by determining the measure of comparison (the multidimensional density of space units distribution). Landscape complexes identified by decoding of the space images serve as an integral informative indicator of the condition of both the hydro-ecosystem and the water collection areas, which greatly simplifies and reduces the cost of work on scientific generalizations and environmental monitoring. The areas of the aquatic landscape complexes have been transformed into an ecological index by computing the measure of comparison - an indicator of the ecological condition of the ecosystem.

TI  - Seismo-acoustic evidence for vent drying during shallow submarine eruptions at Bogoslof volcano, Alaska
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterizing the state of the volcanic vent is key for interpreting observational datasets and accurately assessing volcanic hazards. This is particularly true for remote, complex eruptions such as the 2016-2017 Bogoslof volcano, Alaska eruption sequence. Bogoslof's eruptions in this period were either shallow submarine or subaerial, or some combination of both. Our results demonstrate how low-frequency sound waves (infrasound), integrated with seismic and satellite data, can provide unique insight into shallow vent processes, otherwise not available. We use simple metrics, such as the infrasound frequency index (FI), event duration, and acoustic-seismic amplitude ratio, to look at changes in the elastic energy radiation and infer changes in seawater access to the vent. Satellite imagery before and after selected eruptions is used to ground-truth inferences on vent conditions. High FI and gradual increases in infrasound frequency content at Bogoslof correspond with transitions from submarine to subaerial vent conditions and a diminished or absent role of water, likely resulting in a drying out of the vent region. Event durations generally correlate with high FI and the range of FI values for each event, suggesting long duration events were more effective at drying out the vent region. A trend from low to high acoustic-seismic amplitude ratios for some long duration events also suggests an increase in acoustic efficiency as the vent dried out. We demonstrate that infrasound can serve as a robust indicator of seawater involvement for Bogoslof and other shallow submarine eruptions that may not be inferable from other datasets, particularly in near-real-time.

AB  - Motivated by its capacity to process complex characteristics and deal with nonlinear problems, tensor decompositions have been also introduced, recently, to treat remote sensing data. In this article, a new tensor formulation based feature extraction framework is suggested for hyperspectral target detection. The new proposed method includes the intrinsic decomposition, as tensor structures, to improve the hyperspectral data representation and get rid of the non-significant spatial proprieties. Besides of the joint exploitation of spectral and spatial content, the new proposed approach allows to extract more effective discriminative spatial features. A series of experiments, for the purpose of hyperspectral target detection, show that the suggested scheme can be conducted on hyperspectral images with satisfactory detection accuracies.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Eco-environmental vulnerability is one of the challenges of Teltele rangeland Southern, Ethiopia. This research aimed to analyzing change of grassland area to bush covered area via remote sensing method using NDVI values, temperature, perception, land use change and the local community background knowledge from 1990-2015. The eco-environmental Vulnerability Integrated Index (EVSI) for each class,1990-1995, 1995-2000, 2000-2005, 2005-2010 and 2010-2015 shows an upward trend. That is 1.59, 2.61, 2.91, 2.67 and 2.8 respectively for each interval. The higher EVSI value, is the more serious impact of eco-environmental vulnerability or encroachment of the bush plant coverage. Based on the NDVI data, the net change in open bare grazing area to bush covered vegetation over the past 25 years was 43.2%. The key factor in the rapid encroachment of bush vegetation was the frequency of drought (El Nifio), causing a decline in the population of pastoralist community of Teltele were faced with poverty due to their livelihood. As a result, trend of livestock population dynamics shows a decreasing in the pattern. Based on the current results, the design of the scientific management techniques for eco-environmental vulnerability and raising awareness in the local community will be the priority area for further studies.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the land surface temperature (LST) variations in urban surfaces using high spatiotemporal resolution thermal infrared data is necessary for urban microthermal environmental modeling. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a thermal infrared imager was used to monitor the high-precision spatiotemporal variation of LSTs for six typical urban surfaces, including water, tree canopy, grass, brick pavement, asphalt pavement, and marble pavement, in the Jiangning district, Nanjing. An estimation of sensible heat release was further conducted to quantitatively describe the fine characteristics of the LSTs of these surfaces. The factors influencing LST were investigated by correlating LSTs with the meteorological factors. The results showed that there were significant differences in LSTs and sensible heat release for six typical urban surfaces in sunny and cloudy days, respectively. On sunny days, the diurnal variations in different surfaces fluctuated substantially, which was not evident on cloudy days. The artificial surfaces always represented as the main source of sensible heat release. Solar radiation and air temperature, among the meteorological factors, were positively correlated with the LSTs of the surfaces. The air humidity was negatively correlated with the LSTs and played a role in cooling the land surface.

AB  - Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification is potentially popular because of its extensive applications. Recently, data from different remote sensors including synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multi-spectrum are employed for LCZ classification. However, different bands in SAR and multi-spectrum are difficult to fuse because of their various physical properties. In this paper, an dynamic end-to-end fusion filter is proposed. Firstly, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based dynamic filter network (DFN) is introduced to integrate different bands in SAR and multi-spectrum data, which enhances the fusion accuracy by a flexible dynamic operation. Then the filter is used for feature extraction, hence improve the performance of the classifier. The proposed method is evaluated using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 dataset and the improvement of accuracy shows the superiority of the proposed dynamic data fusion approach.

AB  - The urban growth has several effects in the environment and society. To promote a rational development in cities, the maintenance of green infrastructure is primordial. In this study, we propose a framework to evaluated changes in the environmental quality of forest fragments using open-access satellite data. The environmental quality of forest fragments was obtained using landscape ecology analysis and the prediction of future scenarios by Markov Chain Analysis and Celular Automata. We demonstrate this Framework using a location that comprises an environmental preservation area, the Jundiai-Mirim river basin, containing the remnants of Atlantic forest near the So Paulo state capital, southeast of Brazil. The results showed a constant trend of deterioration in the environmental quality of natural vegetation, attributed to the intense occupation process of urbanization in the watershed. The proposed methodology showed great potential to prevent the deterioration of urban forests, allowing the understanding of driving factors and disturbance dynamic in forest Fragments. The locations of very low environmental quality proved to be the most vulnerable to the occupation process, highlighting the need of actions to preserve the Atlantic Forest in Jundiai-Mirim river basin.

TI  - Neural Networks for the Retrieval of Methane from the Sentinel-5 Precursor Satellite

AB  - Methane is the second most common anthropocentric greenhouse gas, it is therefore important to accurately and quickly get concentrations globally from satellite readings. Currently, data acquired by TROPOMI on board the Sentinel 5 Precursor satellite is transformed into Methane mixing ratio via a physics-based retrieval algorithm. This paper presents an alternative to the slow and complex algorithm: a neural network. A number of experiments are performed using a range of training sets and different network architectures. These experiments, not only help to chose the final network architecture but also allow discussion about the regional and seasonal correlation of methane mixing ratio in the data. These experiments conclude that there is some seasonal and regional correlation in the data which must be taken into account during training. Finally, a single hidden layer network,with 256 nodes in the hidden layer, is trained over 2500 epochs giving a respectable, but improvable, 136% error. This error is a slight improvement on the original experiment and the results of this network are analysed with areas of improvement suggested. Particularly, improvement of the extreme data points, which are highlighted as being the worst predicted by the network. This work presents the ground work for using neural networks to replace lengthy retrieval systems, not just for methane but other gases commonly investigated in a similar way.

TI  - Propagation of Laguerre-Gaussian and I<sub>m</sub> Bessel beams through atmospheric turbulence: A computational study
T2  - LASER COMMUNICATION AND PROPAGATION THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE AND OCEANS IX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Laser Communication and Propagation through the Atmosphere and Oceans IX held at SPIE Optical Engineering + Applications Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The study of light carrying complex phase profiles, specifically orbital angular momentum (OAM), has been of interest for its use in free-space optical communications and remote sensing systems. Each of these applications requires a beam to propagate through the atmosphere, where optical turbulence is the main distorter of the beam. In this computational study, coherent Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams and partially coherent Bessel beams are propagated through atmospheric turbulence. The LG beams are propagated through turbulence using a split-step method for solving the Fresnel diffraction integral. Whereas for the the I-m Bessel beams, the coherent mode representation is used, where each eigenmode is individually propagated through turbulence. The split-step algorithm is then modified to simulate optical turbulence by the use of phase screens. Beam metrics, in the form of intensity, scintillation, spot size, and OAM spectrum, are then calculated over a number of turbulence realizations. Three turbulence regimes are simulated that include the weak, moderate, and strong turbulence regimes along with two different initial beam sizes. The I-m Bessel beam is simulated using three values of overall coherence xi. The results for the metrics are plotted against propagation distance and OAM mode l. The resulting beam metrics show a strong dependence on turbulence strength, a weak dependence on OAM mode due to LG modes expanding with an extra prefactor of root l + 1, and no strong dependence on the overall coherence xi.

AB  - The recent availability of operational data from the Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 missions provides widespread opportunities to generate diverse high-level remote sensing products. However, the synergies between both multi-spectral instruments are often difficult to exploit from an operational perspective. Standard pansharpening algorithms may encounter important disadvantages due to the limited inter-sensor data availability in actual production environments. Moreover, the lack of a real high-resolution ground-truth for super-resolution techniques may affect the radiometric quality of the final result. In this scenario, this work investigates the viability of using the Multi-Spectral Instrument of Sentinel-2 for super-resolving data products acquired by the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument of Sentinel-3. Specifically, we define an inter-sensor image enhancement framework which combines a PCA-based component substitution pansharpening scheme with a CNN-based spatial enhancing super-resolution mapping. The conducted experiments reveal the suitability of the proposed approach for generating Level-4 data products within the Copernicus programme context.

TI  - Detection of sentinel bacteria in mangrove sediments contaminated with heavy metals
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves in the Northwest Coast of South America are contaminated with heavy metals due to wastewater discharges from industries, affecting the biota from this environment. However, bacteria proliferate in these harsh environmental conditions becoming possible sentinel of these contaminations. In this study, bacterial community composition was analyzed by throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from polluted and pristine mangrove sediments affected by marked differences in heavy metal concentrations. Core bacteria were dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes phyla, with strong differences between sites at class and genus levels, correlated with metal levels. Increment of abundance on specific OTUs were associated with either elevated or decreased concentrations of metals and with the sulfur cycle. The abundance of Sulfurovum lithotrophicum, Leptolinea tardivitalis, Desulfococcus multivorans and Aminobacterium colombiense increases when metals rise. On contrary, Bacillus stamsii, Nioella nitrareducens and Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans abundance increases when metal levels are reduced. We propose these OTUs as bacterial sentinels, whose abundance can help monitor the restoration programs of contaminated mangrove sediments in the future.

TI  - Pasture Monitoring Applying Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Time Series with Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 Images, to Improve Milk Production at Santa Monica Farm, Imbabura, Ecuador

AB  - The soils have had an increasing pressure due to the intensification of their use for agriculture, forestry, grazing and urbanization. In this way, the implementation of good practices for sustainable soil management are essential to reverse their tendency to degradation as preventive measures and so, guarantee food security and protect the provision of different ecosystem services associated with the soil. The advent of the Sentinel and Landsat satellite programs provide free data sets with good spatial and temporal resolution that can be a valuable source of information for monitoring pasture resources. In order to evaluate this type of techniques, a time series (TS) was generated with images of the Landsat 8 (L8) OLI (Operational Land Imager) sensor and a time series with images of the Sentinel-2 (S2), MSI (Multispectral Imager) sensor to determine the best results in the quantification of changes in the coverage of pastures at the Santa Monica farm. In this study, pastures were analyzed using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series obtained from median quarterly mosaics obtained in 2019. Different samples were drawn that represent the change trend throughout the time series and were classified according to their degree of change and persistence in the series. The results indicate that the densification of the time series allows to provide better results in the quantification of the changes and dynamics of the coverage. The established methodology represents a great advance on the generation of images and the monitoring and detection of changes in coverage through time series [22]. Hence, it is one the first studies carried out in the country that incorporate this type of process. It was concluded that the determination of spectral signatures with the index used together with the near infrared (NIR) and short wave infrared (SWIR 1) spectral bands, allow to extract values and intervals where the change produced by pastures is identified with an acceptable level of accuracy.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, Lean and Six Sigma (LSS) methodologies have been used to define, measure, analyse, improve, and control the occurrence of healthcare-associated infections affecting patients' safety at the adult Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital 'Federico II'. The first (01/01/2014-28/02/2015) and second data collection campaign (01/03/2015-28/02/2016) involved 144 and 154 patients, respectively. The results show that Acinetobacter baumannii is the dominant bacterium and a positive correlation exists between the number of colonized patients and the number of healthcare procedures the patients undergo. The different parameters influencing the process and the distribution of the sentinel bacterium have been also identified.

AB  - In this work we present BrazilDAM, a novel public dataset based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite images covering all tailings dams cataloged by the Brazilian National Mining Agency (ANM). The dataset was built using georeferenced images from 769 dams, recorded between 2016 and 2019. The time series were processed in order to produce cloud free images. The dams contain mining waste.from different ore categories and have highly varying shapes, areas and volumes, making BrazilDAM particularly interesting and challenging to be used in machine learning benchmarks. The original catalog contains, besides the dam coordinates, information about: the main ore, constructive method, risk category, and associated potential damage. To evaluate BrazilDAM's predictive potential we performed classification essays using state-of-the-art deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs). In the experiments, we achieved an average classification accuracy of 94,11% in tailing dani binary classification task. In addition, others four setups of experiments were made using the complementary infomiation from the original catalog, exhaustively exploiting the capacity of the proposed dataset.YY

TI  - Multipolarization Time Series of Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery to Analyze Variations of Reservoirs' Water Body
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, a two-year time-series of multipolarization Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is exploited to analyze the changes in the water-covered area of the Monte Cotugno (Italy) reservoir. A two-step processing chain, which includes water/land separation and waterline extraction, is proposed to accomplish this task. Experimental results, verified using independent in situ measurements, demonstrate that: first, Sentinel-1 time series can be successfully used to support the smart water management of reservoirs. In fact, the changes in the water-covered area inferred from the SAR time series agree with the seasonal behavior and they also fit anomalies; and second, multipolarization feature outperforms single-polarization ones in terms of accuracy of the extracted waterline profile.

TI  - On the Ability of PolSAR Measurements to Discriminate Among Mangrove Species
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, a polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) feature is analyzed to discriminate among different mangrove species. This feature, which is related to the Wishart distance, maximizes the contrast among mangrove species optimizing the ratio between quadratic forms. The discrimination performance is assessed both against ground truth and by intercomparing it with conventional model-based decomposition features. Results obtained by processing actual L- and C-band-full-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar scenes collected by ALOS-PALSAR-2 and RADARSAT-2 missions show that the proposed approach achieves accurate enough discrimination performance to differentiate two out of the four mangrove species. In addition, results suggest using a multifrequency PolSAR approach to maximize discrimination performance.

TI  - THE CULT AND CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN POLITICS IN UBISOFT'S <i>FAR CRY 5</i> (2018)
T2  - IMPLICIT RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - When cults with an apocalyptic worldview are represented in contemporary North American fiction, something specific can be seen to occur. As Zizek (2010) argues, the four horsemen of the apocalypse are now embodied by global contemporary issues (for example: biogenetic concerns, ecological crises). Apocalyptic belief underpins not only fictional narratives but recognizable ideologies within religious, political and secular spheres, and has done so for centuries, specifically within the United States. However, a considerable number of post-/apocalyptic videogames have specifically turned toward the cult as a recurrent figure in their storytelling. Therefore, drawing upon philosophical, sociopolitical, and literary source materials (Foucault (1986); Thompson (1997); Sutton (2014); Introvigne (2014), alongside narratives from novelistic, filmic, televisual and videogaming platforms, this article will explore the use of the cult in post-/apocalyptic fictions. Using Ubisoft's 2018 videogame, Far Cry 5, as a case study, this article highlights the use of a fictional cult known as The Project at Eden's Gate to critique contemporary American politics, aligning the violence of apocalyptic scenarios with the violence of President Trump's own apocalyptic rhetoric. Ultimately, this article will posit the cult as a new trope within post-/apocalyptic fictions; one which seeks to challenge constructs of power.

AB  - Empirical, semi empirical or physical modeling approaches have been proposed to simulate the microwave signal that can be observed during periods of bare soil. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of a statistical approach (Random Forest algorithm) to estimate the backscattering coefficients in X-band. Regular satellite images arc acquired by TerraSAR-X, over an agricultural region located in southwestern France. The analyses take advantage of a ground dataset covering a wide range of soil conditions: smooth to rough surfaces (h(rms) 0.5-7.9 cm) monitored in dry to saturated conditions (2.4-35.3%). Once trained and validated on half the dataset, the statistical algorithms shows better performance than previous approaches based on semi empirical or physical models, with correlations above 0,83 and errors below 1.07 dB, The sensitivity of the statistical algorithm keeps consistent with others models, with a higher importance of top soil moisture than surface roughness or texture variables.

AB  - This paper aims at comparing satellite-derived and in situ yearly variations of grassland production, over nine farms located in France. During three successive years (2016, 2017, 2018), a dense experimental device has allowed to characterize the variability of grassland production, through a regular survey conducted on more than 169 plots. Ranging from 4.1 to 11.2 t.ha(-1), the yearly production were derived from several tens of thousands of measurements, and combined to derive yearly variations of production. Such unique dataset was compared to a grassland production index, derived from the combined use of medium resolution satellite images and meteorological data. A high level of accuracy is observed between the in situ and the satellite derived yearly variations of grassland production, with a R-2 of 0.76 and a maximum deviation of 16.3%. Finally, a focus on the maps obtained at the national level makes it possible to analyze the context of the 3 studied years.

T2  - REVISTA CUBANA DE CIENCIAS FORESTALES
M3  - Article
AB  - The work was carried out in the area of "Los Numeros", Guisa municipality, Granma province, Cuba. This area forms one of the largest rural councils in the territory, where forestry plays a fundamental role, with an impact on more than 80 % of the area. The objective of the research was to evaluate the spatial-temporal dynamics of the change in vegetation cover that occurred between 1986 and 2016 in lands under a forest management regime. To this end, through the supervised classification of Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite images, the cover was catalogued into four occupation categories (forest; shrub; grassland or crop; and naked-soil). Information from the forest management project of the Granma Agroforestry Enterprise was used, where the characteristics of the plots are presented. The result was that, during the period analyzed, 20.91 km(2) of shrub areas and 6.38 km(2) of grasslands, pastures or crops decreased, as well as 6.65 km(2) of naked soil, while 33.94 km(2) of forest clearly represented the advance of the forest cover limit. In terms of the persistence of the forest category, the Mountain Rainforest and Pine Forest formations were the most distinctive and, in relation to the persistence of the shrub category, the semi-deciduous formation on limestone soil and mountain rainforest were the most represented. The 54 % of the total recovery was shown in the Pinar del Rio. The reforestation plans undertaken during the period analysed have a major influence on the recovery of the coverage of this formation.

AB  - The article considers the first stage of designing diversification of professional retraining programs for employees of the nuclear industry in the conditions of digital transformation of the industry. The article justifies the new digital approaches to personnel training. At the project development stage, the general methodological foundations of digital disciplines in knowledge production were established in the form of a "digital methodology," the core of which is the knowledge paradigm of technoscience. The potential of "digital methodology" leads to the development of the mental, social, organizational resources of workers. The worldview platform of the project made it possible to formulate guidelines for the formation of competencies in the diversification of the professional retraining program: the development of critical and analytical thinking, technological literacy, personal growth, communicative initiative, and social responsibility. The authors note that the recognition of the methodological reflection of digital technologies is presented in the publications of researchers in various scientific fields, while the practice of foreign research is more advanced in the development of a quantitative assessment of qualitative indicators, and the domestic tradition is focused on the cognitive aspect of digitalization. But the convergence of approaches is manifested in the diversity of digital learning practices.

AB  - Socio-economic development and intensive urbanisation in coastal areas in many parts of the world in recent decades have led to a rapid increase in built-up areas. These activities have negatively affected the environment and upset the balance in the vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The Global Artificial Impervious Areas (GAIA) data analysis indicates an Artificial Impervious Surfaces (AIS) increase of 1.5 times since 1990. Since the 1960s, AIS has been dynamically expanded along the Bulgarian coastal zone. The main factors contributing to increasing AIS are urbanisation, industrialisation and tourism development processes. This study aims to assess the dynamics of impervious surface Bulgarian coastal region in the period 1975-2018, the not studied in detail so far. The analysis is carried out for the Black Sea coastal municipalities using Google Earth Engine platform of the Global Man-made Impervious Surface (GMIS), GHSL (JRC-EC) and GAIA data. Some inferences about the temporal trend of growing and spreading of AIS for four-decadal changes are made. Furthermore, recommendations for national spatial planning for responsible national authorities are provided.

TI  - OPTIMIZING THE MONITORING OF NATURAL PHENOMENA THROUGH THE COUPLING OF ORBITAL MULTI-SENSORS
T2  - GEO UERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - High frequency of images and high spatial resolution are necessary characteristics in studies with high temporal and spatial dynamics, which are difficult to find in a single orbital sensor. Therefore, the possibility of using multiple satellites to overcome this obstacle in monitoring is of fundamental importance. The aim of the study was to evaluate the multi-sensor coupling for the monitoring of phenomena that require a greater frequency of spatial detail and high-temporal observations by intercalibrating the reflectance images of the LISS III sensor, which is on board the satellite ResourceSat-II, and the MSI sensor onboard the Sentinel-2A, utilizing the Landsat-8 OLI sensor as standard. To perform the methodology, prior the intercalibration, it was necessary to convert the digital numbers of the bands into reflectance at the top of the atmosphere, so that intercalibration of data with simple linear regression could be subsequently performed. The results demonstrate that, with the intercalibrations of the reflectance images of the LISS III and MSI sensors, it is possible to couple the information of these sensors with those coming from OLI, enabling the increase of the frequency and availability of information in studies that require more observations, as in agricultural monitoring, natural disasters, and deforestation among others.

TI  - An experiment to test satellite radar interferometry-observed geodetic ties to remotely monitor vertical land motion at tide gauges
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The nature and linearity of vertical land motion (VLM) impacting the global sea level record from tide gauges is not well known, but remains of importance to understand long-term changes to sea level. Local surveys are required to directly measure VLM at tide gauges relative to a global reference frame, but this is limited by the lack of differential VLM measurements between tide gauges and continuously operating GPS (cGPS) stations that are not co-located, i.e., fixed to the tide gauge structure. We present results from an experiment using satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) scenes acquired from the TerraSAR-X satellite mission to test whether InSAR could replace repeat geodetic levelling as a 'geodetic tie' between cGPS stations and tide gauges. Comparisons are made among TerraSAR-X (TSX), cGPS and tide gauge minus altimetry VLM estimates for the Hillarys and Fremantle tide gauges (Perth, Western Australia), which are used as test sites for this method. The results suggest agreement between differential TSX and altimetry minus tide gauge VLM rates, but systematic offsets among the absolute/geocentric rates where the TSX is referenced to IGS08 at the PERT cGPS. The TerraSAR-X VLM at the Fremantle tide gauge for the period 7 October 2012 to 7 October 2017 is + 0.45 +/- 0.40 mm/yr (referenced to IGS08 at PERT cGPS), although this should be treated cautiously over this short period, and because VLM at Fremantle and Hillarys appears to be non-linear over time. We infer from this that the uncertainties in TerraSARX differential VLM rates are comparable to those from the highest quality repeat levelling, although the uncertainty approaches 1 mm/yr if the reference point uncertainty of the TSX and cGPS is considered when transformed to a terrestrial reference frame.

TI  - Comparison of Upper Extremity Function in Women With and Women Without a History of Breast Cancer.
T2  - Physical therapy
M3  - Comparative Study
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Observational Study
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer treatments often result in upper extremity functional limitations in both the short and long term. Current evidence makes comparisons against a baseline or contralateral limb, but does not consider changes in function associated with aging.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare upper extremity function between women treated for breast cancer more than 12months in the past and women without cancer.DESIGN: This was an observational cross-sectional study.METHODS: Women who were diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mean post-surgical treatment time of 51months (range=12-336months) were compared with women who did not have breast cancer (CTRL group). Self-reported upper extremity function using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and shoulder range of motion, strength, and muscular endurance were measured. Participants were divided into 3 groups: breast cancer involving the nondominant limb (BC-ND), breast cancer involving the dominant limb (BC-DOM), and CTRL.RESULTS: A total of 59 women in the CTRL group, 23 women in the BC-ND group, and 28 women in the BC-DOM group completed measures. Mean DASH scores in women with breast cancer were higher than those of women in the CTRL group, regardless of the limb on which cancer occurred (Cohen d=1.13; 95% CI=2.20 to 16.21) Range of motion for the BC-ND group was significantly less for flexion (Cohen d=1.19, 95% CI=-13.08 to -0.11) and external rotation (Cohen d=1.11, 95% CI=-18.62 to -1.98) compared with the CTRL group. Strength in the BC-ND group was 23% to 25% lower in the CTRL group for external (Cohen's d=0.89, 95% CI=0.09 to 0.12) and internal rotation (Cohen d=0.92, 95% CI=0.10 to 0.13). Endurance was not significantly different in the 3 groups.LIMITATIONS: Some participants had rehabilitation, which may have skewed results. The range of post-surgical treatment times was broad, making it difficult to determine when function returned. Muscular endurance measures demonstrated a ceiling effect and large variance, limiting the ability to distinguish differences among participants. These results may not be generalizable to the subset of women who were treated with lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy, or chest wall radiation alone or who underwent a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy.CONCLUSION: In the long term, women with breast cancer have lower self-reported shoulder function than women without breast cancer. Motion and strength are lower among women who have experienced cancer on the nondominant limb.

AB  - An approach for system monitoring of smallholder farms. The system will be based on low-cost mobile units (i.e. IoTs, phones) collecting and transmitting data directly from the farms. The IoT information will be merged with available and free access satellite data to form near real-time thematic images to the end-users. It will serve people with low technical literacy who are working with smallholders in developing countries. The novelty of using an integrated interdisciplinary behavioral-technological approach that builds on our respective disciplinary expertise, and the ability to pilot and implement at scale through partnerships, on the ground, allowing gaining new insights into smallholder cultivation and revolutionizing agricultural extension in the developing world. To achieve that goal of Holistic Integrated Precision Agriculture Network (HIPAN) three networks have been established in experimental farms in India: wireless network for "on-the-ground" sensing, virtual network with satellite multispectral imaging-based data and social network collecting the farmers' inputs. The three networks are fused together and the data is processed using a cloud supported data analysis; the results are visually transferred to the farmers as well as to organizations and companies for their benefit.

AB  - Pasak bumi usually grow under the tree canopies. So that the character of its habitat is assumed to be estimated using several biophysical parameters of the tree canopy around it. The purpose of this research was to model the suitability of the pasak bumi habitat in the Riam Kanan conservation forest zone, using a number of biophysical parameters extracted from Sentinel-2 MSI imagery. Those parameters are Leaf Area Index (LAI), Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC), Canopy Water Content (CWC), Fraction of Vegetation Cover (FVC), and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR). Ground surveys were carried out to find the coordinates of pasak bumi using accidental sampling method. Pasak bumi coordinate points are overlaid with biophysical parameters. Statistical analysis was then applied to predict the range of population values from each biophysical parameter, using Confidence Interval (CI) 95%. The results of the research show that CI LAI 2.532-2.772, CI CCC 137.101-158.028 gr/cm(2), CI CWC 0.05-0.057 gr/m(2), CI FVC 0.698-0.737, and CI FAPAR 0.732-0.765. The values of these biophysical parameters directly describe the biophysical characteristics of the pasak bumi habitat in the research location. These CI values are then implemented using binary modelling to predict the habitat of pasak bumi. Based on the results of modelling, it was found that the area suitable for pasak bumi plants was an area of 1,807.91 hectares. This area has a proportion of 1.55% of the total area of the conservation zone. To improve accuracy, other biophysical parameters can be considered to be involved in modelling.

TI  - Capsaicin in the Treatment of Refractory Neuropathic Pain after Mastectomy Surgery: A Case Report
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A 62-year-old female patient with a history of mastectomy surgery and sentinel lymphadenectomy in the context of breast cancer therapy was referred to our clinic for the treatment of refractory neuropathic pain. She reported a complex set of symptoms including burning and electrical-like sensations as well as profound hyperesthesia, hyperalgesia, and allodynia. The symptoms persisted chronically over months with a strong intensity and did not sufficiently respond to oral pain medication and co-analgetics, that is, tapentadol and pregabalin. As the patient could hardly move her right upper arm due to the pain, the quality of life was greatly reduced. In addition, the patient reported pain-related anxiety and depression. Therefore, a therapy with capsaicin 8% patch was initiated. Treatment with capsaicin 8% led to pain relief without tolerance development and improved flexibility in the affected body area. Despite significant pain relief, previous oral pain medications (tapentadol, pregabalin) as well as the anti-depressant amitriptyline were maintained to fully resolve pain symptoms, anxiety, and depression. In conclusion, capsaicin 8% may represent an effective therapeutic alternative for patients suffering from refractory neuropathic pain.

AB  - Understanding shoreline change due to engineering modifications and how it compares with the long-term trends is vital for future development plans. In this study, we focused on the Jaro Floodway, which was constructed in 2012 to mitigate the yearly floods experienced by Iloilo City. Shoreline positions were extracted from geometrically corrected historical maps (1947, 1955, and 1988) and Landsat images (1998, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2014, 2016, and 2018) for change analysis. Between 1947-1988, the coastline prograded by similar to 1 km due to channel avulsion most likely induced by fishpond construction at the river mouth. Between 1988-1998, erosion occurred likely due to the compounding effects of loss of mangrove cover and an increase in the number of typhoon events during the period. The majority of the coastline became relatively stable from 2004-2006. Progradation occurred at the mouth of Jaro River from 2006-2010. By the end of 2018, shoreline prograded by as much as 1.4 km. Rapid progradation is attributed to both large sediment input and the low accommodation space in the area of new discharge. The estimated volume of sediment deposited annually from 2010 is 4.11 x 10(5) m(3), while the annual sediment input during the progradation phase between 1947-1988 is estimated at 2.70 x 10(4) m(3). The shortened floodwater route likely contributed to the one order magnitude increase in sediment input but an increase of sediment yield in the upper stretches of Jaro River likely had a greater contribution.

AB  - The construction of the Jaro Floodway in 2012 resulted to a rapid progradation of the shoreline in 8 years. This study examined the long- and short-term changes in area covered by mangroves at the river mouth area of this flood canal by utilizing historical maps (1947 and 1988), and Landsat images. A total of 44 Landsat images were used that covered the time periods 1998, 2000-2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010-2011, 2013- 2014, 2016, and 2018. Five images were used for each time period and the mangrove cover for each image was determined by using a supervised classification scheme. The set of rasters for each time period was then averaged to generate the final classification map. From 1947 to 1988, mangrove cover increased from 7.01 to 43.83 ha as a result of channel avulsion of the Jaro River due to fishpond construction at the former river mouth. However, it started to decrease until 2008 (3.42 ha) due to widespread fishpond conversion. Then, it rapidly increased to 40.05 ha in 2018. This increase is primarily attributed to the rapid expansion of the intertidal zone in the discharge area of the Jaro Floodway which is due to high sedimentation and low accommodation space.

TI  - Burning and Climate Interactions Determine Impacts of Grazing on Tallgrass Prairie Systems
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tallgrass prairie may respond differently to prescribed burning and subsequent preferential grazing, termed pyric herbivory, under variable climate conditions. This 6-yr study (2011-2016) compared tallgrass prairie pastures that were subjected to burned and unburned conditions while exposed to grazing under differing climate conditions in the Southern Great Plains of the United States. The study area consisted of six pastures, three burned and three unburned. Each burned pasture was further divided into three patches and subjected to a 3-yr rotational burning cycle. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from Landsat 7/8 (EVILS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, EVIMOD) was used to indicate vegetation production depending on size of pastures. On the basis of EVILS, most burned patches (11 of 18) had lesser production (overall difference of 3%) than unburned patches within the same pasture. The differences were larger (13%) in a drought yr (2011) compared with normal (3% in 2013) and wet (<1% in 2015) yrs. The distribution of precipitation controlled EVILS for periods during and after grazing. The burned patches tended to have lower EVILS during grazing periods than the unburned patches within the same pasture, probably because of selective grazing of newly grown grass in recently burned patches. In contrast, the differences in EVILS between during and after grazing periods were mostly (78%) smaller in burned than unburned patches. However, more variations in EVILS existed among pasture comparisons due to landscape heterogeneity. Similar results were observed with EVIMOD. Overall, results demonstrated that pyric herbivory management and climate determine the impacts of grazing on tallgrass prairie systems. The contrasting seasonal forage availabilities in burned and unburned patches, indicated by different seasonality of EVI, also suggests that patch burning might better balance the quantity and quality of the grass available for cattle grazing.

TI  - Opportunistic Bistatic SAR Image Classification Using Sub-aperture Decomposition
T2  - 2020 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS (COMM)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th International Conference on Communications (COMM)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - In this article the classification of C-band opportunistic bistatic SAR images is assessed. The acquisition setup assumes Sentinel 1 spaceborne transmitter and the ground-based stationary receiver, COBIS located in an urban area. The synchronization/ echoed data spans many monostatic apertures; thus, an increased angular diversity may be exploited. The proposed framework is based on the use of sub-aperture decomposition of the backscatter in order to create the feature vector. Specifically, the goal of such an approach is to identify different scatterer signatures and associate them to specific semantic labels. Because the data dimension increased as a consequence of feature extraction approach, a technique for dimensionality reduction is suitable. The Doppler decomposition features are further embedded in the three-dimensional space in a semi-supervised manner. This operation is performed by UMAP algorithm. Finally, an unsupervised classification is achieved by DBSCAN. The presented results are obtained using manually labeled pixels from the following classes: forest, dam and water.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce a compressive sensingbased approach for increasing bistatic synthetic aperture radar imaging quality in the context of multi-aperture acquisition. The analyzed data is recorded over an opportunistic bistatic setup including a stationary ground based receiver (COBIS) and Sentinel 1 C-band transmitter. Since the terrain observation by progressive scans mode is operated, the receiver is able to record synchronization pulses and echoed signals from the scene during many apertures. Hence, it is possible to improve the azimuth resolution by exploiting the multi-aperture data. Obviously, the recorded data is not contiguous and a naive integration of the chopped azimuth phase history would generate undesired grating lobes. The proposed processing scheme exploits the natural sparsity characterizing the illuminated scene. Therefore, a matching pursuit compressive sensing algorithm is employed for filling the "gaps" occurring in Doppler spectrum. The sparsifying basis/dictionary is constructed using the synthetic generated azimuth chirp. The obtained results show a significant improvement of the azimuth resolution along with dramatic attenuation of the side-lobes.

TI  - CREATING NORMALCY: FOSTER CARE FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH DISABILITIES AND MEDICAL FRAGILITY IN GERMANY
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHILD YOUTH & FAMILY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the area of foster care concerning children and youth with special needs due to disability or medical fragility, there is a paucity of knowledge and research. In Germany, these groups in foster care who have high special needs are an invisible and neglected population at risk. These children and youth are mostly cared for in residential homes; however, some are living in foster families and benefit from a familial setting. The purpose of the study was to understand how foster parents manage their lives with a child or youth who has special needs, and how they meet the challenges that arise. The qualitative research design used the method of narrative inquiry through in-depth interviews, which were conducted in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt with 19 foster parents from 15 families. Within the framework of grounded theory, the author developed a theoretical structure of the strategies foster parents use for coping. Results showed that foster parents dealt with this new and often unpredictable situation by applying one of three patterns of strategies - action-, resource-, or reflection-oriented - based on their personal experiences and worldview. Understanding these behavioral patterns gives administrative and supportive entities like child welfare systems and agencies a unique and tailored approach to recruit, retain, train, and counsel foster families adequately, and to strengthen their well-being and their ability to perform well for themselves and their children and youth.

TI  - Upstream GPS Vertical Displacement and its Standardization for Mekong River Basin Surface Runoff Reconstruction and Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface runoff (R), which is another expression for river water discharge of a river basin, is a critical measurement for regional water cycles. Over the past two decades, river water discharge has been widely investigated, which is based on remotely sensed hydraulic and hydrological variables as well as indices. This study aims to demonstrate the potential of upstream global positioning system (GPS) vertical displacement (VD) and its standardization to statistically derive R time series, which has not been reported in recent literature. The correlation between the in situ R at estuaries and averaged GPS-VD and its standardization in the river basin upstream on a monthly temporal scale of the Mekong River Basin (MRB) is examined. It was found that the reconstructed R time series from the latter agrees with and yields a similar performance to that from the terrestrial water storage based on gravimetric satellite (i.e., Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)) and traditional remote sensing data. The reconstructed R time series from the standardized GPS-VD was found to have a 2-7% accuracy increase against those without standardization. On the other hand, it is comparable to data that are obtained by the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI). Similar accuracies are exhibited by the estimated R when externally validated through another station location with in situ time series. The comparison of the estimated R at the entrance of river delta against that at the estuaries indicates a 1-3% relative error induced by the residual ocean tidal effect at the estuary. The reconstructed R from the standardized GPS-VD yields the lowest total relative error of less than 9% when accounting for the main upstream area of the MRB. The remaining errors may be the result of the combined effect of the proposed methodology, remaining environmental signals in the data time series, and potential time lag (less than a month) between the upstream MRB and estuary.

TI  - Identifying cases of chronic pain using health administrative data: A validation study
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PAIN-REVUE CANADIENNE DE LA DOULEUR
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Most prevalence estimates of chronic pain are derived from surveys and vary widely, both globally (2%-54%) and in Canada (6.5%-44%). Health administrative data are increasingly used for chronic disease surveillance, but their validity as a source to ascertain chronic pain cases is understudied.Aim: The aim of this study was to derive and validate an algorithm to identify cases of chronic pain as a single chronic disease using provincial health administrative data.Methods: A reference standard was developed and applied to the electronic medical records data of a Newfoundland and Labrador general population sample participating in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network. Chronic pain algorithms were created from the administrative data of patient populations with chronic pain, and their classification performance was compared to that of the reference standard via statistical tests of selection accuracy.Results: The most performant algorithm for chronic pain case ascertainment from the Medical Care Plan Fee-for-Service Physicians Claims File was one anesthesiology encounter ever recording a chronic pain clinic procedure code OR five physician encounter dates recording any pain-related diagnostic code in 5 years with more than 183 days separating at least two encounters. The algorithm demonstrated 0.703 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.685-0.722) sensitivity, 0.668 (95% CI, 0.657-0.678) specificity, and 0.408 (95% CI, 0.393-0.423) positive predictive value. The chronic pain algorithm selected 37.6% of a Newfoundland and Labrador provincial cohort.Conclusions: A health administrative data algorithm was derived and validated to identify chronic pain cases and estimate disease burden in residents attending fee-for-service physician encounters in Newfoundland and Labrador.

AB  - The use of AI methods is currently evolving tasks done in the past by image analysts. During the last years, technology had helped to jump into fully automatic methods for monitoring and surveillance tasks, such as object detection, change detection and many more. In this work we want to show some of the AI-based models which RHEA Group has been working on which can be applied to the maritime domain, such as ship detection and super-resolution of satellite data. Each of these models can be further extended and specialized into specific monitoring and surveillance tasks, from the detection of ghost ships, measure environmental damage or monitoring of critical infrastructure near harbors or protected areas. In this paper, we illustrate some examples of the status of our research activities and the developments of these prototype applications.

AB  - The Tamandare-PE continental shelf, on the eastern Brazilian coast is narrow (35 km), shallow with a shelf break at 90 m water depth, has mixed carbonate and siliciclastic sedimentation, and widespread occurrences of ridges and patch reefs. Habitat mapping was carried out using an interferometric swath system (EdgeTech 4600), digital processing of Landsat 8 image, surficial sediment sampling, and underwater video surveys to identify sediment-covered zones and coral reefs. Seven acoustic backscatter patterns were defined, three of which represent hard-substrate habitats and associated biogenic reefs and four represent soft sediment habitats where muddy to gravelly substrates have developed. Reefs attached to the Tamandare Bay and coast have a more complex relief, with caves and steep flanks averaging 4 m in height but reaching 10 m height on the seaward flanks. A second reef field, the Crapitanga Reef, has lower relief with an average height of 2 m, but with knolls up to 6 m high, attributed to an advanced bioerosion stage. A muddy sediment body occurs inbetween reef fields and extends into paleochannels, where there are extensive shrimp fishing activities.

TI  - Above-ground biomass mapping in West African dryland forest using Sentinel-1 and 2 datasets - A case study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sudanian Savanna (SS) of West Africa is characterized by tropical savannas and woodlands. Accurate estimation of AGB and carbon stocks in this biome is important for addressing sustainable development goals as the information can aid natural resource management at varied spatial scales. Previous AGB mapping efforts focused on humid forests, with little attention on savannas. This study explored the use of annual monthly time-series of Senitinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data to map AGB in the SS. Backscatter, spectral reflectance, and derivatives (vegetation indices and biophysical parameters) were combined with field inventory data in a Random Forest regression to map AGB. Eight experiments were conducted with different data configurations to determine: (1) the potential of S-1 and S-2 for AGB mapping, (2) optimal image acquisition period for AGB mapping, and (3) contribution of image derivatives to improving the accuracy of AGB mapping. The predicted map was validated with 40% of the inventory data. Uncertainty in the AGB was assessed using mean absolute error, root mean squared error, coefficient of determination and symmetrical mean absolute percentage error. Results show that about 90% of the study area have low AGB stocks of less than 90 Mg/ha. Compared to S-1 (RMSE: 78.6; MAE: 25.6), S-2 achieved better prediction accuracy (RMSE: 60.6; MAE: 19.2), although combination of the two according to seasonality produced the best results (RMSE: 45.4; MAE: 16.3). Images acquired in the dry season were found to be more useful for predicting AGB than those of rainy season. Also, stress-related vegetation indices and a red-edge dependent normalized difference vegetation index not tested in previous AGB studies using Sentinels were found to be significant contributors to the superior performance of S-2. Since biomass is a finite resource, our results can provide valuable information on the sustainable use of biomass and energy security including studies on carbon cycling and ecosystem functions in the region. The demonstrated possibility of using open access earth observation data to map and monitor AGB in data scarce regions is useful and beneficial to attaining SDG indicators 15.2.1 (sustainable forest management) and 15.3.1 (proportion of land that is degraded over total land area). Further work on developing species-specific wood densities and allometric equations is required to improve AGB and carbon stock estimation in the SS.

AB  - The peculiarities of functioning of demonological lexis in the works of Mykola Gogol in the philosophical and linguocultural perspectives are considered in the article. Demonological lexis is determined to be one of the essential segments of ethnocultural representation. It is projected on linguistic culture and creates a peculiar semiotic culture of a particular ethnic group. Ukrainians' belief in non-Christian culture various mystical forces along with sincere faith in one God, promotes active development of their spiritual culture and philosophical worldview. It is reflected in the artistic heritage.The purpose of the article is the analysis of Ukrainian demonology in Mykola Gogol's works.The subject of the research is demonological lexis in Mykola Gogol's works.The methods such as analysis and synthesis, descriptive, observation, contextual-interpretive, linguistic-stylistic were used for achieving the goal.Ukrainian demonology is proved to be a part of Slavic mythology identity and its attributive element. The philosophical aspect of the article is realized in demonological magic, the connection of the corporeal, spiritual, soul with the body, psychophysiological phenomena, altered states of reality etc. The authors analyzed the existing classifications of demonological lexis and defined that the Ukrainian demonological lexis forms structural, impaired, open microsystem in its constant development.

AB  - Aim. The article is a report from the research conducted in 2017 during the Forum Theatre performance, and it demonstrates the possibilities of using the Forum Theatre of Augusto Boal in activities to prevent exclusion from the peer group of teenage students. The purpose of this article is to signal the possibility of using the idea of Boal in preventing exclusions in the school space.Methods. In order to discuss the problems, the analysis of source material and participant observations were used.Results. At Forum Theatre, young people reveal their worldview and value system by interacting with actors and performing stage activities. The teacher, observing the students actions in the performance, can assess their empathy, sensitivity and interpersonal competence. The teacher gets to know the qualities that affect the student's mental state at the time of exclusion from the peer group. In the theatrical activity, the personality of the student with his or her predisposition to being a victim or torturer is revealed. Using the example of the analysed spectacle The Cage directed by Jamslaw Rebelinski in 2017, it is clearly seen that the Forum Theatre makes it possible to get to know the student, and thus his or her problems in relation with peers. Forum Theatre shows the effects and causes of exclusion while simultaneously signalling to the teacher the symptoms of the problem manifesting themselves in the behaviour of young people.Conclusion. Forum Theatre can be a diagnostic method for teachers in activities preventing the exclusion of a student from a peer group at school. Forum Theatre can be used as a method of working with students at risk of exclusion due to intolerance, lack of acceptance or lack of developed communication skills.

AB  - Over the years, passive and active reflectors are becoming indispensable parts in ground deformation monitoring using Interferometric SAR geodetic techniques. The evolution and the need for more practical and compact in size reflectors motivated the implementation of Electronic Corner Reflectors, namely ECR Transponders. ECR Transponders are compact active permanent scatterers, which are used in the estimation of physical or man-induced deformation processes. Their main advantage lies in their compact size and the fact that a sole unit accounts for both ascending and descending tracks, instead of having a traditional two opposite-facingCorner Reflectors configuration. To date, ECR transponders mainly operate in C-band and, thus, are compatible with Sentinel-1 and Radarsat. Although experiments are in initial stage, the results seem quite promising with respect to the classic passive corner reflectors in many aspects. In this paper, an analysis of the ECR-C band transponders is carried out, along with a worldwide overview and a comparison of their results in various application sectors using different satellite radar missions and techniques.

The algorithm proposes a soil moisture index between 0 and 1. 0 corresponds to the driest context, 1 corresponds to the wettest context. The approach is being tested on different study sites with sentinel-1 radar data. Unlike the classic change detection approach, the algorithm takes into account the effects of land use, vegetation development and the seasonal context. Results show a good correlation between satellite estimations and true measurements for the African studied regions.

TI  - Anatomy of a Severe Dust Storm in the Middle East: Impacts on Aerosol Optical Properties and Radiation Budget
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate matter levels in large urban environments of the Middle East are affected by both anthropogenic and natural sources including frequent dust events which result in considerably enhanced aerosol concentrations with significant human health concerns. In this work, an integrated analysis is conducted of one of the most severe dust storms of the last 20 years in the Middle East. Using WRF-Chem simulations along with satellite data, particulate matter surface measurements and AERONET observations, we study the impact of this event on optical properties and surface radiation. At the peak of the dust storm in Doha, Qatar, both the surface data and the model predictions showed PM10 concentrations in excess of 7,000 mu g m(-3). A 2-week simulation over the whole peninsula revealed the extent of the event and showed that the model was able to capture the temporal and spatial evolution of the dust storm and the associated variations in aerosol optical properties. The simulations and remotely sensed measurements showed good correlation for the aerosol optical depth parameter, which reached a value of 3.0 on 2 April 2015 in the region. In agreement with satellite-derived estimates, the model predicted a significant storm-induced reduction in the shortwave radiation (150 to 300 W m(-2)) reaching the eastern Arabian Peninsula, and the Gulf waters, and a considerable drop in the precipitable water (by a factor of 6) between 01 and 03 of April 2015. The domain-integrated maximum daily dust deposition rate that the model predicted was 27.5 Tg day(-1) mostly over the eastern part of Arabian Peninsula. The performance of the model is encouraging for further use in operational forecasting of dust storms in the region.

Because the dispersion of the eye safe 1.6 micron IR laser beam is much less than the dispersion for a microwave beam, the spot size on earth from GEO is only tens of meters in diameter rather than several km. Even though the laser intensity on the ground will be low, nevertheless, modules with concentrating lenses at the ground can boost the intensity on IR GaSb PV cells and could still deliver 8 KW of solar power 24 hours per day for a first space to ground solar power satellite demonstration.

TI  - Overstory-understory land cover mapping at the watershed scale: accuracy enhancement by multitemporal remote sensing analysis and LiDAR
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In forested watersheds, density, land cover, and its vertical structure are crucial factors for flood management, ecosystem monitoring, and biomass inventory. Nowadays, producing land cover maps with high accuracy has become a reality with the application of remote sensing techniques, but in some situations, it is not so easy to distinguish between the overstory and understory vegetation with only spectral information. The main goal of this study was to analyze the accuracy enhancement in overstory and understory land cover mapping at the watershed scale when using the data fusion of seasonal and annual time series of Sentinel-2 images complemented with low-density LiDAR and soil and vegetation indices. The study area was composed by two neighboring watersheds in Badajoz province (Spain). The accuracy of land cover classifications was trained in two ways: first, for each season and several soil-vegetation indices; and second, for the annual series and soil-vegetation indices. Next, LiDAR data were included in both analyses by means of a Boolean metric concerning the height. The obtained results showed that the overall accuracy was better with the annual evaluation when only spectral information was used for the classification. Additionally, if LiDAR data were included in the classification (data fusion), the overall accuracies were highly improved, especially in summer and autumn seasons. This improvement can be a significant issue in the analysis of vegetation structure and its spatial distribution as it is decisive for watershed ecosystem management.

TI  - CAN REMOTE SENSING AND SEBAL FILL THE GAP ON EVAPOTRANSPIRATION? A CASE STUDY: KUNDUZ CATCHMENT, AFGHANISTAN
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-based approaches developed to solve the limits of direct measurement methods for Evapotranspiration (ET). The purpose of this study was to explore the capability of Landsat-8 OLI imagery and the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model for estimating instantaneous (ET-Inst) and daily (ET-24) ET to fill the gap of ET estimation in lower part of Kunduz Catchment Afghanistan. 27th of September 2016 dated Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data was used to calculate NDVI, LAI, LST and Surface Albedo values in the area. Pixel wise surface energy components including Net Radiation (Rn), Soil Heat Flux (G) and Sensible Heat Flux (H) were calculated for different land cover types. SEBAL results varied from 0.0 mm/day at bare lands where is no water or vegetation to 17.4 mm/day at snow cover. Accuracy of estimated ET from Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS was evaluated based on the observed data using Penman-Monteith (PM), Priestly and Taylor (PT), Makkink (MAK), Hargreaves (HS), Lin and Abtew (Abt) methods. PM has the lowest value for all statistical analysis methods and, it means that PM methods gave the closest results to SEBAL. Using remote sensing data with very limited observed data can calculate the spatial variation of ET, which is crucial for planning and determining the amount of available water in terms of catchment management.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the FMPL-2 on board the FSSCat mission, the 2017 ESA Small Sentinel Satellite Challenge and overall Copernicus Masters Competition winner. FMPL-2 is a passive microwave instrument based on a software-defined radio that implements a conventional global navigation satellite system-Reflectometer and an L-band radiometer, occupying 1 U of a 6 U CubeSat. The article describes the FSSC at mission context, the payload design and implementation phases, the tests results in a controlled environment, and finally the calibration algorithms applied to the downloaded data in order to extract the appropriate geophysical parameters: sea-ice coverage, sea-ice thickness (SIT), and low-resolution soil moisture. This article covers the overall payload design, from a high-level block diagram down to single-component specifications from both hardware and software points of view. The main block of the instrument is based on the combination of an FPGA, which virtualizes a dual-core ARM processor, where most of the calculus are performed, and a software-defined radio module, in charge of I/Q data demodulation. The article also explains the design and implementation of a signal conditioning board required for the correct operation and calibration of both instruments.

AB  - Project: Ensemble Kalman Fitting Paleo-Reanalysis - Assimilation of Instrumental Observations, Historical Climate Indices and Tree-Ring Data into an Atmospheric General Circulation Model in the Period 1600 to 2000One of the backbones of numerical weather prediction is the assimilation of all available observations into models to achieve initial conditions close to reality. The assimilation idea also revolutionized climate research with reanalysis becoming the most important dataset for the last century. Recently, paleo-climatologist began developing new methodologies with the intention to assimilate sparse and temporally averaged proxy information instead of satellite data and instrumental observations. EKF400 is the first monthly resolved paleo-reanalysis covering the period 1603 to 2003. Early instrumental temperature and surface pressure observations, temperature indices derived from historical documents and temperature and moisture sensitive tree-ring proxies were assimilated into an ensemble of atmospheric general circulation model using a Kalman-filtering technique. The resulting paleo-reanalysis combines the advantage of traditional reconstruction methods of being as close a possible to observations with the advantage of climate models of being physically consistent and having 3-dimensional information about the state of the atmosphere through time and for various variables.     We would like to thank the CSCS for their support in conducting the ECHAM simulations.

TI  - The Role of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With B5c Breast Cancer Diagnosis
T2  - IN VIVO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: The histopathological assessment of the B5c category may sometimes be hampered by simple artifacts that may lead to over- or underestimation of that particular breast cancer so that its management is still controversial, especially with regard to the decision to proceed immediately to sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. Hence, a retrospective study was performed in 174 patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery with a preoperative diagnosis of B5c in order to assess the usefulness of axillary node staging by means of SLN biopsy. Patients and Methods: Pre- and postoperative parameters including imaging data, histology of the primary tumor and SLN biopsy, biological prognostic factors, type of operation, and adjuvant regimens were computed. Results: Invasive carcinoma and carcinoma in situ were diagnosed in 46 (26.5%) and 128 patients (73.5%), respectively. Preoperative tumor size was significantly related to postoperative diagnosis of invasive carcinoma (p=0.020), retaining its predictive value at logistic regression analysis (p=0.046). Post-operative predictive factors of invasion were represented by tumor stage (p=0.008) and grading (p=0.008). Conclusion: B5c preoperative diagnosis in patients undergoing breast conservative surgery would suggest an immediate wide local excision avoiding any further preoperative histologic assessment. Conversely, one-stage SLN biopsy might be suggested for patients eligible to mastectomy, similar to patients with carcinoma in situ, although its impact on the therapeutic and prognostic assessment seems negligible.

CP  - 1st Multidisciplinary International Symposium on Disinformation in Open Online Media (MISDOOM)
CL  - Hamburg, GERMANY
AB  - Alternative news media with a right-wing populist leaning are flourishing. They pitch themselves as opposition to a hegemonically interpreted mainstream news media system. Yet, at the same time, they rely on the so criticized others to justify their own existence. Using a co-orientation framework, the current study asked in how far right-wing populist alternative news media orient themselves towards the mainstream. Using a qualitative content analysis of all 658 websites referenced by a popular right-wing conspiracy-theoretical YouTuber in Germany, we demonstrate that distinct source types were quoted. References ranged from mainstream news media up to ultra-right wing truther blogs. A quantitative examination of the content-analytical categories confirmed significant differences between mainstream news media and right-wing populist blogs, with special interest and alternative news media ranging in between these poles. Alternative news media were overall found to orient themselves stylistically strongly towards the mainstream but less so regarding their content selection. Particularly, the top sources, accounting for over 76% of all references, were mostly rooted in the alternative ultra-right-wing ecosystem. In sum, our analyses showed how stylistic co-orientation is used to build a bridge towards the mainstream while content-related co-orientation towards other ultra-right-wing alternative sources allows for validating one's own right-wing populist worldview.

TI  - Recurrence and survival rates in node negative patients after sentinel node biopsy for early-stage vulva cancer - A nationwide study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The sentinel node (SN) procedure is adopted in selected patients with early-stage vulva cancer (VC) in Denmark. Due to the low incidence of VC, large population-based studies on the safety of SN outside multicenter clinical trials are lacking. The current study evaluated the risk of recurrence and survival in SN- negative VC patients.Methods: Nationwide data was collected and registered prospectively in the Danish Gynecologic Cancer Database from January 2011 to July 2017. Patients with clinically stage IB-II unifocal vulva squamous cell carcinoma, tumor <4 cm and no clinically suspicious groin nodes or distant metastases, who underwent SN-procedure, were included.Results: The SN-procedure was performed in 286 patients, of these 190 (66.4%) patients were SN-negative. Twenty-three of the 190 SN-negative patients (12.1%) had one or more recurrences during a median follow-up of 30 months (range 1-83). Four patients (2.1%) had an isolated groin recurrence identified from 5 to 17 months after primary surgery. Fourteen patients (7.4%) experienced a local recurrence in vulva, I patient (0.5%) had a recurrence in the vulva and the groin and 4 patients (2.1%) had distant recurrences. The 3-year overall (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) for SN-negative patients was 84% and 93%, respectively. The 3-year OS for patients with recurrent disease was 58%.Conclusions: This is the largest prospective nationwide study on SN-procedure in vulva cancer. The study confirms the safety of the SN-procedure in selected early-stage VC patients with a low isolated groin recurrence rate and a good DSS. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Implications of diurnal variations in land surface temperature to data assimilation using MODIS LST data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the Beijing Climate Center's land surface model BCC_AVIM (Beijing Climate Center Atmosphere-Vegetation Interaction Model), the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm has been used to perform an assimilation experiment on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) product to study the influence of satellite LST data frequencies on surface temperature data assimilations. The assimilation results have been independently tested and evaluated by Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) LST products. The results show that the assimilation scheme can effectively reduce the BCC_AVIM model simulation bias and the assimilation results reflect more reasonable spatial and temporal distributions. Diurnal variation information in the observation data has a significant effect on the assimilation results. Assimilating LST data that contain diurnal variation information can further improve the accuracy of the assimilation analysis. Overall, when assimilation is performed using observation data at 6-hour intervals, a relatively good assimilation result can be obtained, indicated by smaller bias (<2.2K) and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) (<3.7K) and correlation coefficients larger than 0.60. Conversely, the assimilation using 24-hour data generally showed larger bias (>2.2K) and RMSE (>4K). Further analysis showed that the sensitivity of assimilation effect to diurnal variations in LST varies with time and space. The assimilation using observations with a time interval of 3 hours has the smallest bias in Oceania and Africa (both<1K); the use of 24-hour interval observation data for assimilation produces the smallest bias (<2.2K) in March, April and July.

TI  - The importance of including satellite remotely-sensed ocean colour analyses in the planning of airborne LiDAR bathymetry detection
T2  - Canadian Technical Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - This document summarizes the results of a collaboration between the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) and the Science Branch of Ecosystem and Ocean Science Division within the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO). The study concerns CHS's use of Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry (ALB) in obtaining data to produce hydrographic charts, where the primary challenge is to time LiDAR flights to coincide with when the water is clear, so that the bottom can be detected. This report briefly discusses the issues of water clarity and proposes a solution to the problem, demonstrating how water clarity estimates derived from remotely sensed data can impact the ALB data collection.The report includes in situ physical, chemical, and biological data collected from various research sites in Lobster Bay (southwestern Nova Scotia in 2012), along the Northumberland Strait in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (2015 to 2017), and the Pacific Ocean around the Haida Gwaii archipelago in 2018. Historical ocean-colour remotely sensed Total Suspended Matter (TSM) data from MERIS, as well as specifically-developed information on water clarity (Secchi Disk Depth -SDD) and TSM computed at full MODISAqua spatial resolution (250 m/pixel), became fundamental in planning airborne LiDAR bathymetry missions. NASA's products of chlorophyll a, Diffuse Attenuation Coefficients for Downwelling Irradiance at 490 nm and 532 nm, and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) at the same spatial resolution were also helpful in interpreting the final maps constructed by LiDAR's approach.In areas where were water clarity and meteorological conditions are highly variable, the use of remote sensing data for water clarity analysis was especially valuable. The high resolution and large spatial coverage of data also allowed for alternate planning of ALB survey sites in near real-time. Prior to using the MODISaqua SDD models, local variations were very hard to understand. The extension of this ocean colour approach to sensors such as OLCI and VIIRS would be advantageous in the future to allow continuity of this work as the MODIS sensors age and degrade.The cost of deep water ALB surveys is very high, but given the proper water clarity conditions it can be very productive and extremely cost-effective. The availability of MODISaqua based SDD and TSM dramatically increased ALB mission productivity, improved the overall quality of data by optimizing surveys with the best available water clarity, significantly improved cost benefits by reducing unnecessary (and costly) ALB reconnaissance flights and assisted with planning scheduled downtime during periods of less than ideal water clarity conditions.

AB  - We developed an algorithm to derive extinction coefficients for four aerosol components (water-soluble, dust, sea salt, black carbon) from Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) data. The algorithm was applied to the nine-year data for 2007-2015 and the results were compared to CALIOP standard product (CALIOP-ST) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) standard product (MODIS-ST). Comparisons of the total aerosol optical thickness (AOT) showed that MODIS-ST was the largest, followed by CALIOP-ST (Ver.4), and our product. CALIOP-ST (Ver.3) showed a similar magnitude to ours.

TI  - Evaluation of Water-Saving Methodologies for Rice Farming Using a Distributed Long-Term Rainfall-Runoff Model Incorporated Agricultural Ponds Detected by Multi-Temporal SAR Images in the Ibague Watershed, Colombia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A distributed long-term rainfall-runoff model was developed to quantify the watershed scale impacts of water-saving measures in the Ibague watershed, Colombia. The water-saving effects were evaluated by scenario analyses that incorporated the introduction of a water-saving irrigation method (early stopping) to improve irrigation efficiency with respect to redundant paddy irrigation water. In addition to water stopping, the impacts of a new water-saving rice genotype are analyzed. To calculate rainfall.runoff, the Sugawara tank model was utilized. The tank model quantified runoff discharges from forest, upland, paddy field, and urban areas by incorporating each land type into every mesh for a distributed rainfall-runoff model. This quantified the rainfall-runoff characteristics for each land use. Agricultural ponds and irrigation canals were allocated to each corresponding mesh to model irrigation management practices in the watershed. Agricultural ponds, which have a significant effect on the water balance at the watershed scale, were detected by performing cluster analysis on the seasonal transition of the backscatter coefficient obtained from multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR images.Quantitative analyses of the impacts of water-conservation under various scenarios indicated that the early-stopping irrigation method reduced water consumption by 9.4%, compared to the conventional methods. The scenarios, which assumed the introduction of a new water-saving rice genotype, assumed regular irrigation intervals of one or two days and indicated 24.1% and 48.2% reductions, for water consumption, respectively, compared to conventional irrigation methods. Scenarios that implemented a new water-saving rice genotype, as well as the early-stopping irrigation method showed reductions of 30.7% and 53.2% in water consumption compared to the conventional irrigation method, for the one and two day irrigation periods respectively.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MYOLOGY

AB  - The functional state of RyR depends on the intracellular calcium concentration and on the oxidation state of its protein components in some particular sites and of some sentinel amino acids. In addition to the regulation of the RyR channel by exogenous substances (caffeine, ryanodine), ions environmental situations (oxidative state), other components, such as some endogenous proteins present in the sarcoplasm and/or in muscle membranes that are able to determine changes in Ca2+ channel activity. Among these, calmodulin and S-100A could determine modifications in the status of RyR channel in the skeletal muscle. The currently available data can be justified the use of a simplified S-100/CaM and RyR interaction model for the regulation of Ca-2+ release in skeletal muscle. Under resting conditions, the CaM/S100A1 binding domain on RyR1 is predominantly dependent on S100A1. Vice versa when the intracellular Ca2+ concentration becomes high as well as during repetitive (tetanus) stimulation, the Ca-CaM bond becomes dominant, shifting S100A1 from RyR1 and promoting channel inactivation. This may be one of the mechanism of muscle fatigue.

AB  - Bathymetry is required for coastal zone management; hence, it is important to be evaluated properly. Also, bathymetry is highly dynamic in nearshore zone, so, it needs continuous monitoring. The conventional method for bathymetry retrieval is based on sounding that requires intensive time, cost and calm sea conditions. Recently, remote sensing is commonly used to map the shallow water bathymetry since it is frequently captured. Adding up, satellite images may be attained freely with quietly high resolution like Landsat images; 30 m spatial resolution. Consequently, there is intensive research directed to correlate the reflectance/radiance to the water depths. Variable models either linear or nonlinear were developed while in this research, a nonlinear technique, Genetic Algorithm (GA), is introduced. GA was applied on data from multispectral Landsat images. Landsat images were geo-referenced, radiometrically calibrated and atmospherically corrected to attain the reflectance of different bands. GA was utilized to derive the bathymetry for a coastal stretch along the Egyptian Northern Coast (NC). Several trials have been investigated using a reflectance of a single band and a combination of bands, i.e., blue, green and red bands of Landsat 8. Bathymetry measurements at the study site have been used to calibrate the different models/trials. 70% of the data has been assigned to the training of models and the rest has been utilized in the testing process. Comparison of linear model, ratio transform model and GA has been performed. GA showed a comparable performance for estimating shallow water depths; R-squared= 0.95 and RMSE=0.59 m; while enhancements of the derived bathymetry can be achieved by clustering water depths with different assigned GA equations.

AB  - Approaches of geographic ontologies can help to overcome the problems of ambiguity and uncertainty of remote sensing data analysis for modeling the landscapes as a multidimensional geographic object of research. Image analysis based on the geographic ontologies allows to recognize the elementary characteristics of the alas landscapes and their complexity. The methodology developed includes three levels of geographic object recognition: (1) the landscape land cover classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifiers; (2) the object-based image analysis (OBIA) used for the identification of alas landscape objects according to their morphologic structures using the Decision Tree Learning algorithm; (3) alas landscape's identification and categorization integrating vegetation objects, territorial organizations, and human cognitive knowledge reflected on the geo-linguistic object-oriented database made in Central Yakutia. The result gives an ontology-based alas landscape model as a system of geographic objects (forests, grasslands, arable lands, termokarst lakes, rural areas, farms, repartition of built-up areas, etc.) developed under conditions of permafrost and with a high sensitivity to the climate change and its local variabilities. The proposed approach provides a multidimensional reliable recognition of alas landscape objects by remote sensing images analysis integrating human semantic knowledge model of Central Yakutia in the subarctic Siberia. This model requires to conduct a multitemporal dynamic analysis for the sustainability assessment and land management.

AB  - We used about 2000 Sentinel-1 SAR-C images of the Western Java Sea for statistical analyses of the marine oil pollution in that area. Our results demonstrate that most pollution was found along the main ship traffic routes, and further hot spots of oil pollution were found in offshore oil fields. Although the mean wind speed in the area of interest is generally low enough to support the visibility of oil spills on SAR imagery, we found a reverse correlation with the number of oil spills per SAR image. About 50% of the oil spills covered a sea surface area up to 0.5 km(2), and another 50% had an axes ratio up to 10, i.e., they were elliptical or quasi-circular. Comparing results obtained by different operators we found that the absolute numbers of oil spills differed, but the qualitative conclusions, regarding the location of pollution hot spots, are the same.

AB  - The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations predicts that in order to meet the needs of the expected 3 billion population growth by 2050, food production has to increase by 60%. Therefore, monitoring and mapping crops accurately is essential for estimating food production during each crop growing season across the globe. Traditionally, multispectral remote sensing imagery has been widely used for mapping crops worldwide. However, single date imagery does not capture temporal characteristics (phenology) of growing crops, leading to imprecise crop maps and food estimates. On the other hand, purely temporal classification approaches also produce inaccurate crop maps as they do not account for spatial autocorrelations. In this paper, we present a multimodal deep learning solution that jointly exploits spatial-spectral and phenological properties to identify major crop types. Using a two stream architecture, spatial characteristics are captured via a spatial stream consisting of very high resolution images (single date, 1m, 3-spectral bands, USDA NAIP) with a CNN and the phenological characteristics via a temporal stream images (biweekly, 250m, MODIS NDVI) with an LSTM. Experimental results show that the proposed multimodal solution reduces prediction error by 60%.

M3  - Article
AB  - A. V. Appolonov's article "On the Concepts of "the Secular" and "Religion" of Benedict de Spinoza in the Context of John Milbank's Hypothesis of the "Construction" of the Secular" is of a polemic character, which gives it a special acuity. At the same time, the author of the article does not fully recognise the presence in Spinoza's works of a conscious desire to form secular ideas. The idea of autonomy of natural law from the Divine subject had been invented long before Hugo Grotius, but it was Spinoza who made it clearly expressed in the formula Deus sive Natura. One can argue about a naturalisation of the image of God in Spinoza's reasoning, which was destructive for the orthodox Christian theology. It is probable that the process of secularisation, or deconsecration, of the Christian worldview in the European Enlightenment of the 17th century to a considerable extent originates from the naturalisation of divine functions or prerogatives, in particular from the mathematisation of God's creative potencies when shaping the world. However, Spinoza admits, alongside the predominantly naturalistic (geometrical and causal) scenario, two more scenarios, i.e. theological-religious and metaphysical. Though Spinoza argues about the "sacralisation of the supreme power", is it not possible to see in this process the objective realisation of a certain secular programme, part of which is the state as a secular institution? In order to consider universum from a naturalistic viewpoint, it is not necessary to see God having withdrawn from it; another thing is even more dangerous for the Christian idea of God, namely to be God oneself, being totally immersed in the world that is governed by natural laws. As for the scholastic formula etsi Deus non daretur, it can hardly be regarded as a mere example of a "mental experiment".

AB  - The satellite PSI Interferometry is a radar-based remote-sensing technique, which is capable of monitoring and measuring displacements with a high precision of the Earth's surfaces by means of multi-temporal acquisitions. These are collected without interfering in any way with the operating conditions of the transport infrastructure as opposed to the common non-destructive survey methodologies (e.g. GPS, accelerometer, total stations). Nowadays, the use of medium ground-resolution SAR-datasets, acquired by C-Band sensors (operating at a frequency of 5.4 GHz), allow to conduct computationally affordable analyses, detecting displacements with a centimeter accuracy of the measurement. Furthermore, the use of images acquired by the new generation of high-resolution X-Band radar sensors (operating at a frequency of 9.6 GHz), allow to increase the ground-resolution and achieve a millimeter displacement-resolutionThis study aims at demonstrating the potential of the PSI remote-sensing technique to develop and formulate an innovative health-monitoring methodology and approach for structural assets such as bridges, using a multi-frequency satellite resolution. For this purpose, in this study C-Band Sentinel-1A SAR products provided by the European Space Agency (ESA), and X-Band COSMO-Skymed products provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) were acquired and processed. Furthermore, a PSI analysis was developed to monitor and detect structural displacements of a bridge of historical values. Outcomes of this investigation outlined the presence of various PS over the inspected bridge, which were proven useful to achieve a more comprehensive health monitoring and the assessment of the structural integrity of the bridge. This research paves the way for the development of a novel interpretation approach relying on the integration between remote-sensing data and non-destructive information collected on-site (e.g., GPR surveys and Laser Scanner), to improve and optimize current maintenance process of transport assets.

AB  - Satellite Remote-Sensing has been successfully applied for detection of natural-hazards, (e.g. seismic events, landslides and subsidence) and transport infrastructure monitoring over the last few years. Persistent Scatterer SAR Interferometry (PSI), is a satellite remote sensing technique able to measure ground displacements over the time. More specifically, the PSI technique is an evolution of the DInSAR technique and it is based on a statistical multi-temporal differential interferogram analysis. This allows to determine coherent stable-pixels over a data-stack of SAR images, in order to identify potential ground displacements. This study aims at demonstrating the potential of the PSI technique as an innovative health-monitoring methodology for the structural integrity of bridges. For this purpose, X-Band COSMO-SkyMed images provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) were acquired and processed in order to detect structural displacements of the Rochester Bridge in Rochester, UK. Outcomes of this investigation outlined the presence of various PSs over the inspected bridge, which were proven useful to achieve a more comprehensive monitoring methodology and to assess the structural integrity of the bridge. This research paves the way for the development of a novel interpretation approach relying on the integration between remote-sensing technologies and on-site surveys to improve upon current maintenance strategies for bridges and transport assets.

AB  - This work is a part of the research aimed at developing a system of analysis of the risks of destruction of archaeological sites on the territory of the Republic of Tatarstan. Most of fortified settlements of the Volga-Bulgarian period (X-XIII centuries AD) are located on the small river banks. In order to identify the risk of archaeological sites transformation by fluvial processes, the river dynamics in the area of Lukovskoye, Bolsheklyarinskoye and Zelenovskoye fortified settlements was assessed. Field studies were conducted using UAV and GNSS techniques to describe the relief and current state of the site's territory. The measured data were analyzed using the GIS to evaluate intensity of bank erosion. Historical maps, archival remote sensing data and orthophotomaps compared to get quantitative characteristics of monument territory damage. In addition, as a result of photogrammetric image processing, the DEM of monuments territory were constructed and analyzed. As a result, maps of the river dynamics and quantitative characteristics of the intensity of the site's destruction were obtained. The main factors affecting bank erosion are the meandering of the riverbed, the height of the bank and its component rocks. The study showed the importance of using remote sensing and 3D-modelling methods to study and predict the dynamics of river processes as a factor in the destruction of archaeological sites. Results of the research will help to reveal tendencies in cultural heritage objects condition and to estimate risks of their destruction.

AB  - The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is analyzed using LANDSAT8 satellite data acquired on two episodes of heatwaves over Hong Kong and processed using the split-window algorithm to retrieve the Land Surface Temperature (LST) over this area. The in situ ambient air temperatures measured by a number of local weather stations of the Hong Kong Observatory were used to validate the acquired LST. Regional temperature changes for the Hong Kong area for the 21st century generated using the climate scenario generator tool MAGICC/SCENGEN and constrained to SRES A2AIM project a rise in temperatures of between +0.9 and + 5.4 degrees C. The results show the existence of severe UHI effects between urban and suburban localities during two severe heatwave events. Geospatial analysis of this local UHI problem quantifies how urban parks can minimize the UHI effect and a number of adaptation measures related to urban spatial planning are being recommended in view of a changing climate.

T2  - REVISTA TEFROS
M3  - Article
AB  - This text presents an ethnographic and ethnohistorical study on the worldview and rituals in a festival called the Tlahuanca. It aims at making contributions to the anthropological reflection of the religious festival in Mexico, as well as carrying out an analysis on the beliefs about death and its relation with fertility in San Pedro Cholula, Puebla.The symbolic link between death and agriculture in the Mesoamerican religion remains active in the Mexican societies of indigenous origin. The Tlahuanca, or the spiritual drunkenness, takes place on the fourth Monday of Lent in honour of San Pedro de Animas and the deceased mayordomos. Some of its main hallmarks are the consumption of pulque and the request of rain for the crops. The evidences presented show that all the sequences of the festive course embody a worldview where death is conceived as the giver of life. This offers findings, interpretations and reflections on this indigenous ritual as a syncretic phenomenon, produced by the historical configuration of different traditions such as the Mesoamerican and Catholic ones.

AB  - Satellite-derived data, including an estimation of the eruption rate, proximal volcanic deposits, lava flow morphometric parameters (area, maximum length, thickness, and volume) are here provided for the eruptions occurred at Mt Etna between January 2011 and December 2015. These eruptions took place at the New Southeast Crater (NSEC), the youngest of the summit craters of Etna. The time-series analysis of multispectral SEVIRI Unages(timeresolution of 15 min)provided an estimation of event magnitude and intensity of the effusive material erupted during effusive events, while tri-stereo Pleiades images (spatial resolution of 50 cm) gave the pre-eruptive topography and the topographic changes due to the volcanic deposits. The level of accuracy of these estimates suggests that the integration of multi platform remote sensing products represents a new potential of merging capabilities to enable a more comprehensive response to effusive crises.

TI  - How the variety of satellite remote sensing data over volcanoes can assist hazard monitoring efforts: The 2011 eruption of Nabro volcano
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is becoming an increasingly essential component of volcano monitoring, especially at little-known and remote volcanoes where in-situ measurements are unavailable and/or impractical. Moreover the synoptic view captured by satellite imagery over volcanoes can benefit hazard monitoring efforts. By monitoring, we mean both following the changing styles and intensities of the eruption once it has started, as well as nowcasting and eventually forecasting the areas potentially threatened by hazardous phenomena in an eruptive scenario. Here we demonstrate how the diversity of remote sensing data over volcanoes and the mutual interconnection between satellite observations and numerical simulations can improve lava flow hazard monitoring in response to effusive eruption. Time-averaged discharge rates (TADRs) obtained from low spatial/high temporal resolution satellite data (e.g. MODIS, SEVIRI) are complemented, compared and fine-tuned with detailed maps of volcanic deposits with the aim of constraining the conversion from satellite-derived radiant heat flux to TADR. Maps of volcanic deposits include the time-varying evolution of lava flow emplacement derived from multispectral satellite data (e.g. EO-ALI, Landsat, Sentinel-2, ASTER), as well as the flow thickness variations, retrieved from the topographic monitoring by using stereo or tri-stereo optical data (e.g. Pleiades, PlanetScope, ASTER). Finally, satellite-derived parameters are used as input and validation tags for the numerical modelling of lava flow scenarios. Our strategy is applied to the first historic eruption of Nabro volcano (Eritrea), occurred in June 2011. This eruptive event was characterized by the extraordinary quantity of SO2 emitted into the atmosphere and the extent of the long lava flows, which had a significant impact on the inhabitants of the Eritrea-Ethiopia border region despite the low population density. Because of its remote position, little was known about this eruption regarding the quantity of volcanic deposits and the timing and mechanisms of their emplacement. We found that the total volume of deposits, calculated from differences of digital elevation models (DEMs), is about 580 x 10(6) m(3), of which about 336 x 10(6) m(3) is the volume of the main lava flow that advanced eastward beyond the caldera. Multi-spectral satellite observations indicate that the main lava flow had reached its maximum extent (similar to 16 km) within about 4 days of the eruption onset on midnight 12 June. Lava flow simulations driven by satellite-derived parameters allow building an understanding of the advance rate and maximum extent of the main lava flow showing that it is likely to have reached 10.5 km in one day with a maximum speed of similar to 0.44 km/h.

AB  - The increasing population of a country has an impact on the number of energy needs that must be provided. Therefore, alternative sources of energy need to be developed to meet those needs. Indonesia is known as The Ring of Fire has very high geothermal resource potential. A study of geothermal mapping technology needs to be done to optimize the utilization of this energy. This study aims to recognize the relation between temperature and surface roughness on an up-flow zone of geothermal system and identify the steam spots at surface. We used a high resolution ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images to obtain surface roughness and ASTER images to obtain a corrected Land Surface Temperature (LST). The study was conducted in an open area Papandayan Crater, Garut, West Java (Indonesia). Data pre-processing including atmospheric and geometric corrections were applied following an image processing to obtain the surface roughness and the corrected LST by estimating non-unique surface emissivity, pixel fitting between measured surface temperature and roughness at field, and identifying the steam spots of the geothermal system using binary logistic regression method. Equally good models of co-polarization and cross-polarization obtained because of the high correlation between co-polarization and cross-polarization surface roughness. There was a positive relationship between land surface temperature and surface roughness in the manifestation area of geothermal resources and surface roughness known more dominant in determining the manifestations of geothermal resources than surface temperature.

AB  - This paper implements a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with adversarial training and infused pixel information to classify multi-spectral data into 4 LULC classes and cloud. The network is capable of classifying the image on a real-time basis at acquisition time in pixel level by considering the various spectral band values at the pixel and a spatial region around the pixel to collect the spatial features. This way, both spatial information, and spectral information are considered to classify the image. This novel GAN architecture named RTC-GAN is generalized over all the satellites that have their sensors in and around standard NIR, R and G spectral bands while being able to classify the images in real-time. This network is realized and tested on data obtained from satellites Landsat 8 Sentinel2 and Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites like Cartosat-2S, Resourcesat-2/2A. The dataset is not open-sourced and hence very minimal information is provided regarding the IRS data.

AB  - Indian Himalayan region has warmed significantly in last few decades. Winter precipitation has become more variable with increase in liquid precipitation except in Karakoram Himalaya. There has been significant increase in winter seasonal precipitation in last three decades in Lower Himalayan regions whereas Higher Himalaya has shown decrease. The snow cover area has decreased everywhere in Indian Himalaya except in Karakoram where it has increased marginally. The increase in liquid precipitation in place of snow, may prove disastrous in some regions where regolith is loose and dry. The rapid erosion from mountain slopes would give rise to many other hazards downstream. Extreme winter precipitation events may produce extensive avalanches, which may travel kilometers to cause extensive damage in hitherto safe areas. All these changes coupled with the increase in number of extreme precipitation events in past few decades have brought in a new climatic shift, which may have far reaching consequences on geopolitical situation in Indian Himalayan region in near future.With all these changes the accessibility to the remote regions may ease, which may help in efficient management of border regions. However, what would be the consequence of such a situation when extended in future, though modeled by climate scientists, has yet to be evaluated geopolitically. While some efforts on modelling have been attempted, the scientific validation from ground has yet not been done properly. Remote sensing data has helped to some extent, yet there is a need to augment and evaluate it with ground data.There is a need to prepare for worst case scenarios, given the current geopolitical situations that are already showing signs of bursting at seams. Predicting and diffusing extreme weather events will continue to be the future research area in Himalaya. Simultaneously, every drop of precious snow and glacier melt water has to be counted for by construction of many small reservoirs in Himalaya for the purpose of harvesting snow melt and rain water with a strong regulation on its consumption and usage. A comprehensive plan on monitoring cryospheric region of Himalaya with dense network of automatic observatories and with dedicated crysopheric satellite observation system is the need of hour. UAVs, with better sensors maybe put to use at many places for collection of data from remote regions of Himalaya. A geopolitical assessment of current situation and modeled situation with projection of different scenarios is required to be taken up earnestly.

TI  - Radiometric Cross-Calibration of GF-4/VNIR Sensor With Landsat8/OLI, Sentinel-2/MSI, and Terra/MODIS for Monitoring Its Degradation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical satellite sensor generally suffers from drifts and biases relative to their prelaunch calibration, caused by launch and the space environment. Radiometric cross-calibration is valuable for calibrating sensors without coincident surface measurements through transferring radiometric values between satellite sensors via a stable target. The data quality of visible and near-infrared (VNIR) sensor onboard Gaofen-4 (GF-4) satellite seriously depends on vicarious calibration, which is performed once every year, thus, a cross-calibration approach is proposed for monitoring its radiometric performance much more frequently. In this study, the GF-4/VNIR is cross-calibrated by Landsat8/OLI, Sentinel-2/MSI, and Terra/MODIS with the aid of the tandem scenes during 2017 and 2018 after correcting the discrepancy on viewing geometries and spectrum. The results show that there is test site dependency and sensor dependency, and cross-calibration coefficients in the four bands roughly have similar variation trend as a sinusoidal function during 2017 and 2018, varying from 0.00023 to 0.00079. Furthermore, uncertainty analysis of the cross-calibration is carried out to analyze the uncertainty contributions affecting the cross-calibration accuracy. Note that the calibration accuracy of referenced sensors, the uncertainty of the MODTRAN model, BRDF uncertainty are the three main factors affecting the cross-calibration accuracy, the total uncertainty is approximately 3.9%-6.64%.

TI  - Semantic Segmentation of Marine Remote Sensing Based on a Cross Direction Attention Mechanism
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of remote sensing technology, the semantic segmentation and recognition of various things in the ocean have become more and more frequent. Due to the wide variety of marine things and the large differences in morphology, it has brought greater difficulties to the recognition of marine remote sensing images. In order to obtain better segmentation results of ocean remote sensing images, this paper proposes an cross attention mechanism(Horizontal and Vertical) of exponential operation combined with multi-scale convolution algorithm. Among them, the cross attention mechanism and expanded distribution weight coefficient mentioned in this paper are first proposed. First, Input the marine remote sensing image features into an cross attention mechanism algorithm of exponential operation to obtain feature weight coefficients and joint weight coefficients in multiple directions; Then, the features with weight coefficients are input into the multi-access convolutional layer and the multi-scale dilated convolutional layer respectively for deep feature mining; Then the above steps are repeated twice, and finally the semantic segmentation of marine remote sensing images is achieved by fusing multiple deep-level features afterwards. Experiments were conducted on three public marine remote sensing data sets, and the results proved the effectiveness of our proposed cross attention mechanism of extended operation algorithm. The F values of the MAMC model on Beach, Island and Sea ice data sets have reached 99.4%, 91.25%, 87.08% respectively. Compared with other models, the effect is significantly improved, and proved the powerful performance of the algorithm in the semantic segmentation of marine remote sensing images.

AB  - The Fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) absorbed by vegetation is the important biophysical variables of the most climate, hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological models. In this paper, the simulative surface reflectance and FPAR were used to train the artificial neural network, which retrieved the FPAR value using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance in visible spectrum. The retrieval results were comprehensively evaluated using MODIS LAI/FPAR products and available field measurement data. Compared with the ground measurement FPAR, the correlation coefficient (R) is 0.727, the relative average error (RMB) is 1.62, the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.16, the mean relative error (MRE) is 0.896, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.214.The R of MODIS FPAR products was 0.850, the RMB was 1.715, the MAE was 0.197, the MRE was 1.046, and the RMSE was 0.263.The comparison results show that retrieval FPAR can be performed effectively in the ground site area without the type of vegetation.

TI  - Cloud Removal with Fusion of High Resolution Optical and SAR Images Using Generative Adversarial Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The existence of clouds is one of the main factors that contributes to missing information in optical remote sensing images, restricting their further applications for Earth observation, so how to reconstruct the missing information caused by clouds is of great concern. Inspired by the image-to-image translation work based on convolutional neural network model and the heterogeneous information fusion thought, we propose a novel cloud removal method in this paper. The approach can be roughly divided into two steps: in the first step, a specially designed convolutional neural network (CNN) translates the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images into simulated optical images in an object-to-object manner; in the second step, the simulated optical image, together with the SAR image and the optical image corrupted by clouds, is fused to reconstruct the corrupted area by a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a particular loss function. Between the first step and the second step, the contrast and luminance of the simulated optical image are randomly altered to make the model more robust. Two simulation experiments and one real-data experiment are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method on Sentinel 1/2, GF 2/3 and airborne SAR/optical data. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms that also employ SAR images as auxiliary data.

TI  - Remote sensing algorithms for estimation of fractional vegetation cover using pure vegetation index values: A review
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Green fractional vegetation cover (f(c)) is an important phenotypic factor in the fields of agriculture, forestry, and ecology. Spatially explicit monitoring of fc via relative vegetation abundance (RA) algorithms, especially those based on scaled maximum/minimum vegetation index (VI) values, has been widely investigated in remote sensing research. Although many studies have explored the effectiveness of RA algorithms over the past 30 years, a literature review summarizing the corresponding theoretical background, issues, current state-of-the-art techniques, challenges, and prospects has not yet been published. The overall objective of the present study was to accomplish a comprehensive and systematic review of RA algorithms considering these factors based on the scientific papers published from January 1990 to November 2019. This review revealed that the key issues related to RA algorithms is the determination of the appropriate normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values of the full vegetation cover and bare soil (denoted hereafter by NDVI infinity and NDVIs respectively). The existing methods used to correct for these issues were investigated, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed in depth. In literature trends, we found that the number of reported studies in which RA algorithms were used has increased consistently over time, and that most authors tend to utilize the linear NDVI model, rather than other models in the RA algorithm family. We also found that RA algorithms have been utilized to analyze the images with spatial resolutions ranging from the sub-meter to kilometer, most commonly, using images of 30-m spatial resolution. Finally, current challenges and forward-looking insights in remote estimation of f(c) using RA algorithms are discussed to guide future research and directions.

AB  - Recent progress in quantum algorithms and hardware indicates the potential importance of quantum computing in the near future. However, finding suitable application areas remains an active area of research. Quantum machine learning [1] is touted as a potential approach to demonstrate quantum advantage within both the gate-model [2, 3] and the adiabatic [4, 5] schemes. For instance, the Quantum-assisted Variational Autoencoder (QVAE) [6] has been proposed as a quantum enhancement to the discrete VAE [7]. We extend on previous work and study the real-world applicability of a QVAE by presenting a proof-of-concept for similarity search in large-scale high-dimensional datasets. While exact and fast similarity search algorithms are available for low dimensional datasets, scaling to high-dimensional data is non-trivial. We show how to construct a space-efficient search index based on the latent space representation of a QVAE. Our experiments show a correlation between the Hamming distance in the embedded space and the Euclidean distance in the original space on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset. Further, we find real-world speedups compared to linear search and demonstrate memory-efficient scaling to half a billion data points.

Bundle block adjustment model is established by these two models on the basis of the rigorous geometric model for ZY-3 panchromatic imagery.

AB  - Time series data have been applied for forest disturbance detection. The validation of detected changes is challenging partially because the validation data are often not readily available. Unlike multi-temporal change analysis, time series analysis not only detects areas of change but also reports time of change. Both spatial and temporal accuracy are therefore important for the accuracy assessment. Ayuquila River Basin (ARB) is one of the early action areas in Mexico for the implementation of REDD + initiatives under UNFCCC. In ARB, shifting cultivation and cattle grazing often take place, resulting in degraded forestland. Sub-annual forest disturbance detection and estimation contribution to the improved local forest management and REDD + implementation. Landsat-based NDVI time series data covering 1999-2018 were analysed using linear regression and the breakpoints of change and the magnitude of change were detected. Breakpoints with magnitude of change ranging from (-0.05) to (-0.2) were verified during a field campaign in October 2018. Here the magnitude of change is related with NDVI differences. Areas with magnitude of change higher than (-0.2) were identified as false changes. Verification data were generated by visually interpreting time series Landsat images of 2016-2018. In this way, areas with forest loss were identified. By stratified random sampling, 683 points were applied for the verification including 511 points of forests and 172 points of forest loss. It yields 75.84% for the overall accuracy of the change detection; for the detected forest loss as a category, the user's accuracy is 88.89% and the producer's accuracy is 0.46%. A possible reason for the very low producer's accuracy is that the selected magnitude value (-0.2) is too low and some of the detected changes were filtered out.

AB  - Y This paper presents the results of a statistical study of forest inventory data for tropical dry forest in Ayuquila River Basin, Jalisco state, Mexico. The field inventory was carried out between May-June of 2019 which is at the end of dry season and the beginning of raining season. The field inventory data were collected in 43 plots of 500 m(2) each which were designed in a way to include tropical dry forests in two conditions: degraded and conserved. In each plot, the collected data include DBH, tree height, number of trees per plot, and the density of tree stems. A study was carried out to find out if there are statistically significant differences variables relating to forest structure between degraded and conserved status. The Mann-Whitney test shows that there is significant differences in canopy cover, biomass, tree height, and basal area. This information is important since it helps to understand whether and how forest degradation can be detected using remote sensing data.

TI  - The Performance Analysis of Downlink NOMA in LEO Satellite Communication System
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has the potential to provide higher throughput than conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA), which has been considered as a key technology for 5G. NOMA in satellite communication system can provide anytime, anywhere access with improved spectral efficiency and system capacity because of its ubiquitous coverage. However, the characteristics of the satellite channels are different from that of the terrestrial network, i.e., huge time delay and Doppler shift. In this paper, different from the existing works, which mainly focus on the performance of NOMA in static terrestrial base stations and Geostationary orbit (GEO) scenarios, we investigate the performance analysis of downlink NOMA in dynamic low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication system with Doppler shift considered. We combine NOMA and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for better spectral efficiency. Our channel model includes both small scale model and large scale model. For simplify, we only consider two users in one spot beam. Besides, we express the performance analysis of downlink NOMA in LEO satellite communication system, like ergodic capacity, outage probability (OP) and mutual information. However, in traditional NOMA scheme, the proceeding error decision of the high power user will cause the deterioration of the subsequent detection performance. Therefore, a symmetrical coding (SC) scheme for different modulation mode is proposed for low power users to get better performance. Finally, simulation results validate the performance of the NOMA scheme is better than that of the OMA scheme. The proposed SC scheme can achieve a prominent increase performance contrasted to the traditional NOMA scheme.

AB  - Palembang is the capital of South Sumatra Province with the development carried out through the diversion of land functions into built-up land causes an increase in surface temperature which triggers the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon. This study aims to discuss the phenomenon of UHI in Palembang City and its relation to land composition and population density on surface temperatures obtained from the processing of multi-temporal Landsat Images in 1989, 2001, 2018, with the specification of clear sky using the LST algorithm and guided classification. The distribution of the UHI phenomenon is obtained by classifying LST to obtain the UHI threshold. The value of the determinant coefficient (R2) between the relationship of changes in surface temperature which is directly proportional to the increasing population, the increase in the area of each open land and built-up land reached 62.6%, 86.3%, and 55.0%. Conversely, there is a negative link between surface temperature and dense vegetation with R2 reach 90.4%. The affected area of UHI is located in the centre of Palembang, reaching 33.5 km2 of the total area. It is necessary to have ideal city mitigation and arrangement by calculating the green area with the increasing population in Palembang City.

T2  - BOLETIN DE LA ASOCIACION DE GEOGRAFOS ESPANOLES
M3  - Article
AB  - The fast urban sprawl in recent decades is causing significant environmental aggressions, inherent to development, which causes considerable personal and socioeconomic damages. Therefore, a greater integration of urban spaces with their naturalized environment should be planned, generating less ecological footprint and greater resilience to catastrophic natural phenomena, which will increase according to the different climate change scenarios. The objective of the study is to analyze the ecological fragmentation in Madrid (Spain), and to expose the connectivity measures at different scales. The methodology used is easily updatable, thanks to free access to the Sentinel satellite images and the cartographic sources. In 2018, the conurbation of Madrid already consumed on average 18.5 % of their soils, with large spatial variations (13.33 % to the N and 41.41 % to the S), for which the mitigation measures proposed should also be different.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The population growth and consequent global rise in food demand require increasingly efficient agricultural solutions, in what is commonly called digital agriculture. Among promising initiatives, the use of remotely sensed data combined with machine learning algorithms enables handling faster agricultural operations with lower associated cost. One of the most important activities in digital agriculture is crop identification, which is fundamental for managing the inventory of a farm by producers and governmental authorities, and has been addressed by several prior works. In this article, we explore crop identification from a scalability perspective using the premise that data trained at a set of labeled geo-referenced regions in the agricultural pole at central western Brazil may be used for identifying crops at the entire municipality area. We propose to use convolutional long-short term memory networks for identifying crop types using a public labeled training set, and then apply the trained model for estimating crop area in a larger area involving the entire municipality unlabeled data. Our results were evaluated against governmental census data and report evidences that the tested crop identification network is able to successfully estimate crop area from much larger unlabeled data for different crop types.

TI  - Reading the classics in pedagogical training: a challenge for posthumanist times
T2  - ARS BREVIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reading has been a great human adventure since the advent of writing, a process that experienced a moment of extension with the invention of the printing press. The fact that the West has been a book culture favored literacy in the 19th and 20th centuries, behind campaigns that led to the schooling of new generations. Reading made it easier for the reading public to shape their worldview, although recently a phenomenon has been described by experts as "endangered readers". This situation, which has been aggravated by the emergence of cyberculture (1990), means that many of our university students who direct their training in the pedagogical field have abandoned the habit of reading, which is a basic tool for their personal growth and the development of their critical sense. Perhaps this is why the question of the classics has recently been raised and, in turn, the need to build a canon that brings together the essential works that must be read not only in terms of universal literature (Weltliteratur) but also in the field. of the sciences of education, so that any student in the pedagogical area achieves a basic knowledge beyond the instances and instrumental techniques of didactic nature, according to a competence vision that often forgets the global and integral formation of the humanist tradition.

TI  - Two ontologies of territory and a legal claim in the Ecuadorian Upper Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Secoya nation ( Siekopai) of the Ecuadorian Upper Amazon, in its request for recognition of indigenous territories in a protected area, has appeared before the Republic of Ecuador's conservation regime with arguments based on an administrative and physical concept of territory. The Secoya worldview and culture, however, supposes an ontology of territory in which the geographic space, updated rituals, and their relationship with nature converge. In this article we analyze this important ontological difference in detail. We compare the territorial subjectivation processes produced by both ontologies: a Cartesian conceptual framework in the case of the State's political geography, and the Secoya's phenomenological ecology. Since the Secoya include a management plan for the protected area in their petition, it would seem they have internalized the State's rule regarding the principle of sustainability within conservation. We argue that sustainability is incompatible with the presence of a phenomenological ecology that makes them political subjects, and therefore it is a strategic inclusion that does not respond to their socio-ecological reality.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse by satellite images, aerial photographs and images taken with a UAV (drone), a protected sector within the Guadarrama Regional Park (Madrid) affected by important degradation processes. This area is characterized by the presence of significant gullies that, although lacking vegetation for the most part, in some more stable points, support a dense Mediterranean forest. Human action has caused an important sealing of the soil with sitting residential areas nearby that increases the processes of runoff and, therefore, affects the evolution of the gullies. The objective of this paper is to make a detailed cartography of these degraded areas using available and updated sources: aerial photography, images of the Landsat, Spot and Sentinel satellites and images taken with a UAV with visible camera and near infrared. They are absolute novelty, the images taken by the Sentinel satellite and the UAV.

TI  - Management of the axilla in patients with breast cancer and positive sentinel lymph node biopsy: An evidence-based update in a European breast center
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - The surgical approach to the axilla in breast cancer has been a controversial issue for more than three decades. Data from recently published trials have provided practice-changing recommendations in this scenario. However, further controversies have been triggered in the surgical community, resulting in heterogeneous diffusion of these recommendations.The development of clinical guidelines for the management of the axilla in patients with breast cancer is a work in progress. A multidisciplinary team discussion was held at the research hospital Policlinico San Matteo from the Universita degli Studi di Pavia with the aim to update recommendations for the management of the axilla in patients with breast cancer. An evidence-based approach is presented.Our multidisciplinary panel determined that axillary dissection after a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy may be avoided in cN0 patients with micro/macrometastasis to < 2 sentinel nodes, with age >= 40y, lesions <= 3 cm, who have not received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and have planned breast conservation (BCS) with whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT). Cases with gross (>2 mm) ECE in SLNs are evaluated on individual basis for completion ALND, axillary radiotherapy or omission of both. Patients fulfilling the criteria listed above who undergo mastectomy, may also avoid axillary dissection after multidisciplinary discussion of individual cases for consideration of axillary irradiation. Women 70 years or older with hormone receptors positive invasive lesions <= 3 cm, clinically negative nodes, and serious or multiple comorbidities who undergo BCS with WBRT, may forgo axillary staging/surgery (if mastectomy or larger tumor, comorbidities and life expectancy are taken into account).

TI  - Conserving the Mesoamerican herpetofauna: the most critical case of the priority level one endemic species
T2  - AMPHIBIAN & REPTILE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Of significant biodiversity importance, the Mesoamerican herpetofauna now increases at a rate of approximately 35 species annually. As its size increases, however, the global problem of biodiversity decline continues to worsen with time. Recently, a set of conservation priority levels was established for individual species based on a combination of physiographic distribution and Environmental Vulnerability Score (EVS). The 18 such levels identified range from level one, encompassing species that occupy a single physiographic region and with a high EVS, to level 18, including species that inhabit six physiographic regions and have a low EVS. For the Mesoamerican herpetofauna, the greatest number of species is placed in level one, amounting to 970 taxa with documentable distributions. From one to 149 priority level one species are found in 20 of the 21 physiographic regions recognized in Mesoamerica. Slightly more than three-quarters of the priority level one species of anurans, salamanders, and squamates are found in the Baja California Peninsula and six montane regions in Mexico and Central America. Conservation biology, thus far, has not been successful at reversing the steady loss of biodiversity nor at placing biodiversity decline on the global agenda. In addition, humans are becoming increasingly divorced from contact with the natural world and, thus, less aware of the life-threatening impact they are having on the planet's life-support systems. Given this situation, the authors of this paper have become increasingly devoted to trying to understand why humans in general exhibit the highly dangerous anthropocentric worldview. As have other biologists, the authors ascribe this behavior to what is known as "the mismanagement of the human mind." This mismanagement of the human mind is believed to result from a cascade of psychological ailments giving rise to increasingly restrictive forms of centristic thinking. In the final analysis, these types of thinking appear likely to doom to failure any efforts to establish for perpetuity protected areas that can harbor the priority level one species identified in this and earlier papers. Until and unless the anthropocentric worldview can be transformed into a worldview consonant with the realities of how life operates on planet Earth, we humans are not only endangering ourselves but also all other life. This article discusses the implications of this worldview for the potential conservation of the priority level one endemic species of the Mesoamerica herpetofauna.

AB  - Quantifying wheat's production is essential to support food security management. It can be achieved with empirical models developed with the information provided by vegetation indices (VI). This work evaluated the performance of different time series of VI for the predictive modelling of wheat production and yield in Spain comparing two sources of cropland masks: wheat mask using Common Agricultural Policy declarations (CAP), and arable land from Corine Land Cover (CLC). Both sources were used to analyse the improvement derived from considering specific wheat masks.The wheat production and yield were modelled using time series of MODIS NDVI and EVI2 (2006 to 2016) from weekly surface reflectance products (MOD09Q1 v6) at 250 meters. The sum of VI values of one month after the maximum was used as this period is related with yield and production. VI indicators were filtered and aggregated to NUTS-3 level. The cropland masks were obtained either by combining the parcel boundaries with the CAP wheat reports, or from the CLC arable land category of 2006 and 2012 maps. Production (t) and yield (t ha-1) estimates were obtained from official statistics. Subsequently, different regression analyses were carried to build an overall model and single models for some NUTS2.Models using CAP wheat masks outperformed those of CLC, predicting more accurately production than yield. The best performance for production models using CAP was that of EVI2 in Castille and Leon (R-2=96% and Normalized Relative Error (NRE)=14.72%) and the best for CLC that of EVI2 in Spain (R-2=55% and NRE=58.01%). Regarding yield modelling, CAP with EVI2 in Aragon was the best (R-2=81% and NRE=10.57%) as well as CLC with EVI2 in Spain overall model (R-2=50% and NRE=22.34%). The findings of this work suggest that the use of specific crop masks is of paramount importance for the predictive modeling of crop production.

TI  - Classification of oil spill by thicknesses using multiple remote sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an operational tool for monitoring and assessment of oil spills. Satellite SAR has primarily been used to detect the presence/absence of oil, yet its ability to discriminate oil emulsions within a detected oil slick has not been fully exploited. Additionally, one of the challenges in the past has been the ability to deliver strategic information derived from satellite remote sensing in a timely fashion to responders in the field. This study presents methods for the rapid classification of oil types and estimated thicknesses, from which information about thick oil and oil emulsions (i.e., "actionable" oil) can be delivered in an operational timeframe to responders in the field. Experiments carried out at the OHMSETT test facility in New Jersey demonstrate that under specific viewing conditions, a single polarization satellite SAR image can record a signal variance between thick stable emulsions and non-emulsified oil. During a series of field campaigns in the Gulf of Mexico with in situ measurements of oil thickness, multiple satellite data were obtained including fully polarimetric C-band SAR imagery from RADARSAT-2 and multispectral imagery from ASTER and WorldView-2. One campaign included the airborne polarimetric UAVSAR L-band sensor. An oil/emulsion thickness classification product was generated based on RADARSAT-2 polarimetric imagery using entropy and the damping ratio derivations. Herein, we present the classification methods to generate oil thickness products from SAR, validated by sea-truth observations, the multispectral imagery, and the UAVSAR data. We tested the ability to deliver these products with minimum latency to responding vessels via NOAA. During field operations in the Gulf of Mexico, a satellite SAR-based product of oil delineation by relative thickness was delivered to a responding vessel 42 min after the RADARSAT-2 data acquisition. This proof-of-concept test using satellite SAR and multispectral imagery to detect emulsions and deliver a derived information product to a vessel in near-real-time points directly to methods for satellite-based assets to be used in the near future for oil spill tactical response operations.

TI  - Major ambulatory surgery in breast diseases
T2  - CIRUGIA ESPANOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The use of ambulatory surgery (AS) for breast pathology (BP) has increased. The objective of this study is to analyse a group of patients treated surgically for breast pathology in order to evaluate its quality and security in a MAS setting in 2017.Methods: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing breast surgery was conducted within an AS programme from January to December 2017 in Consorcio Hospital General Universitario of Valencia (CHGUV). The study analysed the number of patients, exclusion reasons, type of surgical procedures, evolution of substitution rate (SR), rate and causes of conversion to admission, postoperative complications, motives for not being included in the ambulatory programme and the satisfaction rate of the patients treated with ambulatory surgery. This has been compared with a 2013 group.Results: In 2017, 396 procedures for BP were performed: 170 for benign and 226 for malignant disease. The SR for the global mammary pathology was 72.8%. The SR for benign pathology was 93.4% and the SR for malignant pathology was 57.2%, which has increased in recent years from 45.4% in 2013. The unexpected hospitalization rate (HR) of malignant pathologies was 14.1%, while the HR in benign pathologies was 0.6%. Patients hospitalized for malignant pathologies presented higher complications (17%) than ambulatory patients (8.5%) and benign pathologies (6.5%).Conclusions: At the CHGUV, the SR has steadily increased in malignant pathologies. The unexpected hospitalization rate is determined by perioperative sentinel lymph node biopsy results. AS for the treatment of mammary pathology is efficient and safe. (C) 2019 AEC.

TI  - Changes in turbidity along Ganga River using Sentinel-2 satellite data during lockdown associated with COVID-19
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - India had announced the longest ever lockdown from 24 March 2020 to 14 April 2020 amid COVID-19 pandemic. It was reported that the water quality of the Ganga River has improved as compared to regular during this country-wide lockdown. In the present study, an attempt has been made to study the change in water quality of the river in terms of turbidity purely through remote sensing data, in the absence of ground observations, especially during this time period. The change in spectral reflectance of water along the river in the visible region has been analyzed using the Sentinel-2 multispectral remote sensing data at Haridwar, Kanpur, Prayagraj, and Varanasi stretches of the river. In the present study, it was found that the red and NIR bands are most sensitive, and can be used to estimate the turbidity. Further, the temporal variation in turbidity was also analyzed through normalized difference turbidity index at each location. It was observed that the turbidity in the river has reduced drastically at each stretch of the river. The study elicited that the remote sensing approach can be used to make qualitative estimates on turbidity, even in the absence of field observations.

AB  - The necessity and relevance of the practical use of the Antarctica coast mosaics is described. The key points related to the technology of preparation of the Sentinel-1 scenes for building the mosaic are presented. Sentinel-1 scene search services are listed, along with existing products that provide Antarctic mosaics. The geometrical boundaries of the selected Sentinel-1 radar scenes for the created multi-time Antarctic coast mosaics are presented. The sequence of steps for preprocessing Sentinel-1 radar products is described. The Antarctica coastal part mosaic is being built on their basis. The main provisions of the method for constructing a seamless mosaic image are outlined. The stitching method of the scenes into a mosaic is based on the geometric analysis process of location of pixels overlapping in the scenes. The main results of method implementation are shown in a fragment of the Antarctica coverage mosaic. Experiments show that the technology can achieve automatic panoramic mosaic of the survey area.

AB  - Introduction: Merkel cell carcinoma is a malign primary tumour that mainly affects regions that are exposed to solar radiation. Few cases have been reported in a region that is not exposed to the above mentioned risk factor, as the gluteal regions.The study aims to communicate the clinical case of a Merkel cell carcinoma of the gluteal region.Clinical case: 63-year-old male patient who consulted for a tumour with a 2cm diameter in the right gluteal region, rapidly growing, being completely resected in a cordinaterd surgery under anesthesia. Pathology study revealed that it was Merkel cell carcinoma. No distance dissemination was seen, and thus as per the TNM staging system it was classified as stage I. Therapy was completed with local radiotherapy, It is currently under follow up and asymptomatic.Discussion: Merkel cell carcinoma are highly aggressive tumours. Apart from solar radiation as a risk factor, it is worth mentioning immunodeficiency and a new polyomavirus, the Merkel cell polyomavirus.This condition can be seen as purple, rapidly growing tumours and they frequently involve synchronic or metachronic lymph node compromise. Surgical resection with sufficient margins and lymph node emptying, in the event of lymph node compromise or sentinel node biopsy is recommended. Prognosis depends on the stage and a 30% relapse has been reported after 2 years.

TI  - Use of Vis-NIR reflectance data and regression models to estimate physiological and productivity traits in lucerne (<i>Medicago sativa</i>)
T2  - CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lucerne (alfalfa, Medicago sativa L.) is grown extensively worldwide owing to its high forage biomass production and nutritional value. Although this crop is characterised as being tolerant to drought, its production and persistence are affected by water stress. Selection of genotypes of high yield potential and persistence after a long period of drought is a major objective for lucerne-breeding programmes in Mediterranean environments. This selection could be enhanced and accelerated by the use of physiological and productivity traits and their estimation through remote-sensing methods. A set of nine cultivars of lucerne from Australia and the USA were assessed in four locations in Mediterranean central-south Chile. Several physiological and productivity traits were evaluated: forage yield (FY), stomatal conductance (gs), water potential (WP), leaf area index (LAI), nitrogen (N) content, and isotope composition (delta C-13 and delta O-18) of the dry matter. Spectral-reflectance data were used to estimate the traits through spectral-reflectance indices (SRIs) and multivariate regression methods. For the SRI-based estimations, the R-2 values for each assessment were <0.65. However, traits such as LAI, WP, gs, and N content showed higher R-2 values when data from the different assessments were combined. Regression-based estimation showed prediction power similar to or higher than the SRI-based approaches. The highest R-2 value was for delta C-13 (0.78), but for most traits the combination of data from different assessments led to higher trait estimation, with respective R-2 values for LAI, FY, WP and gs of 0.67, 0.71, 0.63 and 0.85. Among regression methods, the best estimation was achieved by using support vector machine regression. The use of spectral-reflectance data collected at field level and multivariate regression models has great potential to estimate physiological and productivity traits in lucerne under water deficit and could be useful in lucerne-breeding programmes.

T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXVI
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVI
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - In this work, we make use of an unsupervised procedure for the spatial decorrelation of fully-developed speckle. The goal is evaluating the impact of a preliminary spatial decorrelation of the noise on the accuracy of temporal change detection between two single-look images of the same scene taken at different times. In a likely simulated scenario, we optionally introduce a spatial correlation of the noise in the synthetic complex data by means of a 2D separable Hamming window in the Fourier domain. Then, we remove such a correlation by using the whitening procedure, take the modulus of the SLC images, apply change detection algorithms suitable for detected data, and compare the geometric and radiometric accuracy of the estimated change maps for the three following cases: uncorrelated noise, correlated noise, and decorrelated noise. Several change detection methods are considered: from the simple Log-Ratio operator preceded by despeckling, to more advanced parametric or nonparametric methods based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence or on the mean-shift clustering of the bivariate scatterplot. Simulation results show a consistent improvement of performance, notably the geometric accuracy of changes, but also their global extent.

TI  - Local industrial pollution induces astrocyte cytoskeleton rearrangement in the dice snake brain: GFAP as a biomarker
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was designed to evaluate the responsiveness of modulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) content and its fragmentation in the snake brain as a biomarker of local industrial pollution of aquatic ecosystems. Despite GFAP being a well known cytoskeleton marker of astrocytes' reactivity in the brain of vertebrates, its expression in the snake brain remains insufficiently described. The GFAP expression and its fragmentation were detected using the immunoblot method in the snake brain. ROS level was determined with dichlorofluorescein diacetate fluorescence. The content of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) of filament (cytoskeleton) and soluble (cytosol) fractions in the brain of dice snake Natrix tessellata from three ecosystems with different rates of industrial pollution were studied (two polluted and one clean control site). Characteristic increase in GFAP fragmentation was noted for the snakes from both the researched polluted sites. Significant increase in the content of the GFAP cleaved polypeptide fragments induced by industrial pollution exposure was confirmed in the snakes' brains. Meaningful GFAP fragmentation was determined in snake brain astrocytes as an increase in cleaved fragments of 47-35 kDa molecular weight for both soluble and cytoskeletal GFAP fractions. We found significant abnormality in the ratio of the GFAP soluble fraction to the cytoskeletal one in contaminant-exposed dice snakes. It should testify to significant metabolic disturbance in nerve cells of the dice snakes. Furthermore, growth of reactive oxygen species level as the main cause of oxidative stress was determined in brains of the snakes exposed to environmental toxicity. Thus, astrocyte cytoskeleton disorders are associated with pollutant-induced redox imbalance in the snake brain. Despite the limited data on glial cell biology in the reptilian brain, the observed results prove that snake astrocytes can respond to the environmental toxicity using typical astroglial response. The presented results evidence that monitoring of molecular characteristics of glial cytoskeleton in dice snakes could be used as reliable biomarker of neurotoxicity and adverse effects of industrial pollution. Further studies are required to elucidate the role of astrocyte cytoskeleton in the response against neurotoxic contaminants.

TI  - Targeted axillary dissection with preoperative tattooing of biopsied positive axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer
T2  - NEOPLASMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has emerged as an alternative to axillary lymph node dissection during breast cancer surgery during the last 2 decades. However, there are several controversies regarding the indication of the sentinel node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy which can convert positive lymph nodes to negative. The false-negative rate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is unacceptably high. This high false-negative rate can be decreased by marking of the positive lymph nodes and removal during sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure in addition to the sentinel lymph nodes. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of carbon tattooing of the positive sentinel lymph nodes before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In 2016, a prospective protocol was launched investigating the black carbon tattooing procedure of the suspective and positive axillary lymph nodes by injecting 0.1-0.5 carbon ink in normal saline under ultrasound guidance. All patients underwent black carbon tattooing of the suspected or positive axillary lymph nodes before the chemotherapy or one week before the primary surgery when chemotherapy was not indicated in the neoadjuvant setting. Sentinel lymph nodes together with lymph nodes marked by the black carbon ink were removed and histologically evaluated. So far 27 patients were treated under this protocol. Breast saving surgery was performed in 22 cases and mastectomy in 5 cases. All patients had invasive ductal carcinoma. In 20 patients neoadjuvant chemotherapy was indicated and in 7 patients primary surgery was performed. All lymph nodes marked by black carbon ink were successfully identified and removed. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 8 cases and sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by axillary dissection in 15 cases. Axillary dissection alone was performed in 4 cases. In 19 cases, the black carbon ink was present in the sentinel lymph node at the same time and in 4 cases carbon dye was present in other lymph nodes than the lymph node identified during SLNB, which corresponds to 17.4%. In the group of patients undergoing primary surgery, in one case from six, the sentinel lymph node was negative and the lymph node marked with carbon ink positive which represents false-negative lymph node and failure of the SLNB procedure. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, there was no false-negative lymph node identified, but the conversion of the positive lymph nodes to negative was present in 10 cases (50%). There were no complications attributed to carbon ink tattooing. The results of positive sentinel lymph nodes tattooing have confirmed that this method is safe and allows a decrease in the false negativity rate during the sentinel node biopsy procedure.

T2  - EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and responsible for the current pandemic. Recent SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility studies in cats show that the virus can replicate in these companion animals and transmit to other cats. Here, we present an in-depth study of SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease and transmission in domestic cats. Cats were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal and oral routes. One day post challenge (DPC), two sentinel cats were introduced. Animals were monitored for clinical signs, clinicopathological abnormalities and viral shedding. Postmortem examinations were performed at 4, 7 and 21 DPC. Viral RNA was not detected in blood but transiently in nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as well as various tissues. Tracheobronchoadenitis of submucosal glands with the presence of viral RNA and antigen was observed in airways of the infected cats. Serology showed that both, principals and sentinels, developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. All animals were clinically asymptomatic during the course of the study and capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to sentinels. The results of this study are critical for understanding the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 in a naturally susceptible host species, and for risk assessment.

TI  - Gulf of St. Lawrence (4RST) Greenland Halibut Stock Status in 2018: Commercial Fishery and Research Survey Data.
T2  - Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Research Document
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gulf of St. Lawrence Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) stock (NAFO Divisions 4RST) is assessed and managed on a two-year cycle. The indicators used for this assessment are taken from fishery statistical data, sampling of commercial catches and research surveys. This document presents the data, techniques, analyses and results used in a peer review meeting held on February 20 and 21, 2019 at the Maurice Lamontagne Institute. The directed Greenland halibut fishery developed in the late 1970s. Since the closure of the mobile gear fishery in 1993, this fishery has been carried out almost exclusively with gillnets. Fishing effort is deployed in three main sectors: the western Gulf of St. Lawrence, the area north of Anticosti Island and Esquiman Channel. During the 2000-2018 period, the proportion of the effort expended in each of these three sectors was 67%, 6% and 24% respectively. The total allowable catch (TAC) remained fixed at 4,500 t between the management years 2004-2005 and 2017-2018. Landings have declined since the 2011-2012 season. In 2018, following a comprehensive interim-year assessment of the stock, the TAC was reduced by 25% for the 2018-2019 fishing season. Preliminary landings in that year totalled 1,496 t, the lowest value in the last 16 years. The commercial fishery performance index shows a downward trend, with a 48% decrease in 2018 from the 2014-2016 peak, reaching the low values observed in 1999-2000. The biomass indices for fish over 40 cm-based on fishery independent data obtained from DFO's mobile gear surveys and the sentinel fisheries program-also point to a declining trend over the last ten years or so, with decreases of 62% and 77% respectively from the peak observed in the mid-2000s. The Gulf of St. Lawrence ecosystem has undergone significant changes in recent decades. Warming and oxygen depletion of the deep waters of the Gulf could result in habitat loss and the degradation of habitat quality for Greenland halibut. Furthermore, the arrival of three exceptionally strong cohorts of redfish (2011 to 2013) could increase interspecific competition. These ecosystem conditions are not expected to change in the short term.

T2  - LESNOY ZHURNAL-FORESTRY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Well-timed and high-quality artificial reforestation is one of the main factors of sustainable forest management. Efficient forest stand formation is influenced by the right choice of the reforestation method and efficient planting material species. Longstanding research of pine crops' growth in the taiga zone of the Republic of Karelia was held according to the conventional methods. In order to confirm the objectivity of the obtained research results multi-time materials of remote sensing taken from the satellites of Landsat and Sentinel series were used for the first time. The presence of red and near infrared channels in the received data allows to calculate NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), which gives the opportunity to estimate the photosynthetic active biomass. The index is the difference between the reflected intensities in infrared and red channels divided by the sum of its intensities. The use of NDVI for the study of reforestation dynamics is of reserach interest. Forest live cover analysis has shown that the quota of cereals and fireweed has essentially decreased, while the quota of forest species has increased. It was found that the coniferous stand of the I and Ia quality classes with the stock not fewer than 29.2 m(3)/ha has developed after Scots pine crops' formation on the cultivated land of reedgrass meadow cuts by 2019.

AB  - Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification is the most commonly used scheme to analyze how local urban morphology affects the climate of local areas. Classification methods are often based on remote sensing data or on a fusion of several data sources. In this study, the effects of different fusion strategies of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data on the accuracy of LCZ classifications are investigated. The data processing is implemented with a convolutional neural network (CNN), where until a fusion layer, separate data sources are processed separately on branches. Strategies of splitting the data into branches and the effects of different fusion stages are compared, together with approaches based on sums of independent classifiers. For our setting, the stage of fusion does not seem to have a big influence on the accuracy. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of cooperative usage of multispectral and SAR data.

TI  - GWAS of Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
T2  - GWAS Central
M3  - Data study
AB  - A significantly higher proportion of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) who received obeticholic acid (OCA) had histological improvement relative to placebo in the FLINT (farnesoid X nuclear receptor ligand obeticholic acid for noncirrhotic, NASH treatment) trial. However, genetic predictors of response to OCA are unknown. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in FLINT participants to identify variants associated with NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement. Genotyping was performed using the Omni2.5 content GWAS chip. To avoid false positives introduced by population stratification, we focused our GWAS on white participants. Six regions on chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 7, 15, and 17 had multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with suggestive association (P<1* 10-4 ) with NASH resolution. A sentinel SNP, rs75508464, near CELA3B on chromosome 1 was associated with NASH resolution, improvement in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score, portal inflammation, and fibrosis. Among individuals carrying this allele, 83% achieved NASH resolution with OCA compared with only 33% with placebo. Eight regions on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 11, 13, and 18 had multiple SNPs associated with fibrosis improvement; of these, rs12130403 near TDRD10 on chromosome 1 was also associated with improvement in NASH and portal inflammation, and rs4073431 near ANO3 on chromosome 11 was associated with NASH resolution and improvement in steatosis. Multiple SNPs on chromosome 11 had suggestive association with pruritus, with rs1379650 near ANO5 being the top SNP. Conclusion: We identified several variants that may be associated with histological improvement and pruritus in individuals with NASH receiving OCA. The rs75508464 variant near CELA3B may have the most significant effect on NASH resolution in those receiving OCA.

TI  - Statistical Modeling of Urban Heat Island Intensity in Warsaw, Poland Using Simultaneous Air and Surface Temperature Observations
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) is one of the most distinctive characteristics of urban climate. The objective of this study is to apply a statistical modeling of the nocturnal atmospheric UHI based on the relationship between observed air temperature from ground stations and remotely sensed temperature of the urban surface. The goal of the approach is to limit input data for the developed modeling method in order to assure transferability of the methodology in different cities. Time series of surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index are obtained from the MODIS instrument for a 10-year period (2008-2017). The air temperature is collected from the in-situ observational network of 21 stations. The studies are conducted for different locations with gradual changes in urbanization in order to assess the impact of urbanization on the relationship between simultaneous air and surface UHI. The urbanization is described by commonly available land cover metrics. Results showed that the proposed approach provides satisfactory AUHI modeling results for the locations with the least degree of urbanization. The best results are obtained with a simple linear regression model with the iterative procedure to minimize the mean absolute gross error (MAGE). The lowest MAGE for modeled UHI is 1.18 degrees C with 69% of the variance explained. The strongest linear relationship between simultaneous SUHI and AUHI is noted for those station pairs whose surroundings have the highest differences in urbanization, and the highest UHI intensities are observed. The strength of the SUHI/AUHI linear relationship decreases gradually with the increasing urbanization of the stations' surroundings.

TI  - Radiolabeling nanomaterials for multimodality imaging: New insights into nuclear medicine and cancer diagnosis
T2  - BIOMATERIALS
M3  - Review
AB  - Nuclear medicine imaging has been developed as a powerful diagnostic approach for cancers by detecting gamma rays directly or indirectly from radionuclides to construct images with beneficial characteristics of high sensitivity, infinite penetration depth and quantitative capability. Current nuclear medicine imaging modalities mainly include single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) that require administration of radioactive tracers. In recent years, a vast number of radioactive tracers have been designed and constructed to improve nuclear medicine imaging performance toward early and accurate diagnosis of cancers. This review will discuss recent progress of nuclear medicine imaging tracers and associated biomedical imaging applications. Radiolabeling nanomaterials for rational development of tracers will be comprehensively reviewed with highlights on radiolabeling approaches (surface coupling, inner incorporation and interface engineering), providing profound understanding on radiolabeling chemistry and the associated imaging functionalities. The applications of radiolabeled nanomaterials in nuclear medicine imaging-related multimodality imaging will also be summarized with typical paradigms described. Finally, key challenges and new directions for future research will be discussed to guide further advancement and practical use of radiolabeled nanomaterials for imaging of cancers.

AB  - In this study, we assess the potential of long time series of Sentinel-1 SAR data in forest growing stock volume (GSV) estimation. The study site with 17,762 forest stands is located near the Hyytiala forestry field station in Finland and represents the boreal coniferous forest. Altogether 96 images spanning more than three years of observations have been studied using linear and random forest regression approaches. Our analysis demonstrates considerable decrease in the prediction errors of GSV as the the number of input scenes increases. The use of feature extraction and dimensionality reduction techniques allows to achieve to nearly optimal performance already with 10 scenes. While the GSV prediction errors using individual Sentinel-1 scenes varied considerably from 86 to 93 m(3)/ha, the prediction accuracy with combined scenes improved to 76 m(3)/ha (44.9%) RMSE.

M3  - Comment
AB  - In late December 2019, in Wuhan (China), health authorities reported several clusters of pneumo- nia of unknown cause, subsequently attributed to a novel coronavirus, identified as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2. Anosmia and dysgeusia have been reported as particular symptoms.4,5 Notably, these sensory symptoms seem to have a peculiar trend, such as usually precede the onset of respiratory symp- toms. So, they have been defined as "sentinel" symptoms. We presented a series of COVID-19 patients. Anos- mia and dysgeusia frequently preceded respiratory complaints. Anosmia and dysgeusia seem to be short-lived and self-resolving in COVID-19, thus a neurotoxic effect swiftly disappearing and/or cytopathic damage could be hypothesized similarly to other viral infections.

T2  - HIV AIDS-RESEARCH AND PALLIATIVE CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Integrating and scaling up tuberculosis (TB) and HIV services are essential strategies to achieve the combined goals ending both TB and HIV, especially in TB and HIV high burden countries. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of TB and HIV co-infection and the implementation of collaborative services in Ethiopia.Methods: We used a national sentinel surveillance TB/HIV co-infection collected between 2010 and 2015. The Ethiopian Public Health Institute collected and collated the data quarterly from 79 health facilities in nine regional states and two city administrations.Results: A total of 55,336 people living with HIV/AIDS were screened for active TB between 2011 and 2015. Of these, 7.3% were found co-infected with TB, and 13% TB-negative PLWHA were on isoniazid preventive therapy. Nine out of ten (89.2%) active TB patients were screened for HIV counselling and 17.8% were found to be HIV positive; 78.2% and 53.0% of HIV/TB co-infected patients were receiving cotrimoxazole preventive therapy and antiretroviral treatment, respectively.Conclusion: This study showed that the prevalence of TB and HIV co-infection failed to decrease over the study period, and that, while there was an increasing trend for integration of collaborative services, this was not uniform over time. Aligning and integrating TB and HIV responses are still needed to achieve the target of ending TB and HIV by 2030.

TI  - Effects of Surface Heterogeneity Due to Drip Irrigation on Scintillometer Estimates of Sensible, Latent Heat Fluxes and Evapotranspiration over Vineyards
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat fluxes and actual evapotranspiration (ET) are required for monitoring vegetation growth and improved agricultural water management. A large aperture scintillometer (LAS) was used to provide these estimates with the objective of quantifying the effects of surface heterogeneity due to soil moisture and vegetation growth variability. The study was conducted over drip-irrigated vineyards located in a semi-arid region in Albacete, Spain during summer 2007. Surface heterogeneity was characterized by integrating eddy covariance (EC) observations of H, LE and ET; land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from Landsat and MODIS sensors; LST from an infrared thermometer (IRT); a data fusion model; and a two-source surface energy balance model. The EC observations showed 16% lack of closure during unstable atmospheric conditions and was corrected using the residual method. The comparison between the LAS and EC measurements of H, LE, and ET showed root mean square difference (RMSD) of 25 W m(-2), 19 W m(-2), and 0.41 mm day(-1), respectively. LAS overestimated H and underestimated both LE and ET by 24 W m(-2), 34 W m(-2), and 0.36 mm day(-1), respectively. The effects of soil moisture on LAS measurement of H was evaluated using the Bowen ratio, beta. Discrepancies between H-LAS and H-EC were higher at beta <= 0.5 but improved at 1 >= beta > 0.5 and beta > 1.0 with R-2 of 0.76, 0.78, and 0.82, respectively. Variable vineyard growth affected LAS performance as its footprints saw lower NDVILAS compared to that of the EC (NDVIEC) by similar to 0.022. Surface heterogeneity increased during wetter periods, as characterized by the LST-NDVI space and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI). As TVDI increased (decreased) during drier (wetter) conditions, the discrepancies between H-LAS and H-EC, as well as LELAS and LEEC Re decreased (increased). Thresholds of TVDI of 0.3, 0.25, and 0.5 were identified, above which better agreements between LAS and EC estimates of H, LE, and ET, respectively, were obtained. These findings highlight the effectiveness and ability of LAS in monitoring vegetation growth over heterogonous areas with variable soil moisture, its potential use in supporting irrigation scheduling and agricultural water management over large regions.

T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focusses on mapping the seasonal and spatial variability of agricultural water productivity of sugarcane crop in three large irrigation schemes of Ethiopia (Wonji, Fincha'a and Metahara) from open source remote sensing data. The 100m spatial resolution of WaPOR data base was used to acquire the satellite data used for water productivity estimation. The average crop water productivity was 7.5kg/m(3) at Wonji, 7kg/m(3) at Fincha'a and 4.3kg/m(3) at Metahara irrigation schemes respectively during time period of January 1/2009 to June 30/2019. Some plots located at Dodota, Sodare and Wake-Tiyo of Wonji scheme show high water productivity during time period of January 1/2018 to June 30/2019. But the value of water productivity show decreasing at Wonji main scheme during time period of January 1/2012 to June 30/2013. At Fincha'a irrigation scheme the high-water productivity was observed at most plots located at northern part of East Bank site, northern part of West Bank site and southern part of Neshie site during the study period of January 1/2009 to June 30/2019. And low water productivity at Fincha'a was observed at plots located at northern part of Neshie site, southern part of East and West Bank site. At Metahara irrigation scheme, some plots located near Basaka lake and northern part of the scheme, show low water productivity and some plots located at southern part of the scheme show high water productivity.

TI  - Migratory Locust Habitat Analysis With PB-AHP Model Using Time-Series Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The outbreak of Oriental Migratory Locust(Locusta migratoria manilensis) causes devastating disasters to agriculture. With the impact of climate changes and human activities, the distribution of locust habitat (locust habitat is the environment in which locusts live and survive) in China is constantly changing. Monitoring and extracting locust habitat are of great significance for guiding large-scale agricultural production. The occurrence of the locust is closely related to their habitat. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of habitat factors that affect locust survival is carried out to monitor locust habitat distribution. Besides, the landscape structure also affects distribution. This study explored a model for analyzing multi-temporal Landsat and MODIS images, which combined multiple habitat factors and landscape structure to analyze locust habitat. The locust habitat near North Dagang Reservoir in Tianjin is the research object. First, the habitat factors that affect locust oviposition and growth were analyzed, and vegetation coverage, land cover class, soil moisture, soil salinity, and land surface temperature were selected as five habitat factors. The weights of five habitat factors were evaluated according to the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model. Then, considering the impact of landscape structure on locust habitat, a moving-window was used to correlate locust habitat factors at pixel scale with locust habitat at patch scale. Finally, the distribution map of the locust habitat at patch scale was generated. The Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP) was used to compare and test the results. Our research shows that the Patch based - Analytic Hierarchy Process (PB-AHP) can monitor locust habitat. The overall accuracy reached 88%, which is 10% higher than the result based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP). These results show that the Patch based - Analytic Hierarchy Process (PB-AHP) model has strong robustness and generalization ability in identifying locust habitat and can provide scientific guidance for locust monitoring and control.

TI  - Towards an Operational, Split Window-Derived Surface Temperature Product for the Thermal Infrared Sensors Onboard Landsat 8 and 9
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The split window technique has been used for over thirty years to derive surface temperatures of the Earth with image data collected from spaceborne sensors containing two thermal channels. The latest NASA/USGS Landsat satellites contain the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) instruments that acquire Earth data in two longwave infrared bands, as opposed to a single band with earlier Landsats. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) will soon begin releasing a surface temperature product for Landsats 4 through 8 based on the single spectral channel methodology. However, progress is being made toward developing and validating a more accurate and less computationally intensive surface temperature product based on the split window method for Landsat 8 and 9 datasets. This work presents the progress made towards developing an operational split window algorithm for TIRS. Specifically, details of how the generalized split window algorithm was tailored for the TIRS sensors are presented, along with geometric considerations that should be addressed to avoid spatial artifacts in the final surface temperature product. Validation studies indicate that the proposed algorithm is accurate to within 2 K when compared to land-based measurements and to within 1 K when compared to water-based measurements, highlighting the improved accuracy that may be achieved over the current single-channel methodology being used to derive surface temperature in the Landsat Collection 2 surface temperature product. Surface temperature products using the split window methodologies described here can be made available upon request for testing purposes.

AB  - In this paper we will analyze the poetry of Mapuche women, putting it in dialogue with key concepts of the Mapuche philosophy, recognizing that the work of indigenous women in general and, in our case, especially that of Mapuche women poets, forms a dynamic and critical struggle that constantly debates and reflects on the complex situation of indigenous peoples and their female groups in Latin American national societies. On the other hand, we seek to recognize and underline the lyrical elements that point to the visibility of historical problems of the Mapuche people and the way in which they are approached discursively by these poets. We propose that despite the difference in age and place of residence or birth, since in Chile around 50% of the Mapuche live or were born in cities far from their ancestral communities, Mapuche feminine poetry is nurtured, sometimes conflictingly, of related elements especially linked to their worldview.

AB  - The work is studying the distributed system of natural environment monitoring points. The purpose of the study is to solve two main problems of optimization: a) optimization of risks of emergency events; b) optimal cessation of environmental monitoring, which allows to reduce the costs of observation.Monitoring of the environment contaminated with petroleum products is relevant. Traditionally used methods and monitoring itself are expensive and technological complex mechanisms, often requiring satellite data.When studying environmental pollution, it is important to consider situational risks and stochastic irreversible changes in nature. For this purpose, it is necessary to apply the methods and methodology of the system approach, which are used in the article for analysis of complex data structures and entropy of the system. For the informativeness of less long monitoring, it's represented by four main subsystems (capture, operation, selection and decision-making) and evaluated using an information-entropy approach The work will solve the practical task of monitoring the contaminated environment.

TI  - Volume reduction of caudate nucleus is associated with movement coordination deficits in patients with hippocampal atrophy due to perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia
T2  - NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Acute sentinel hypoxia-ischaemia in neonates can target the hippocampus, mammillary bodies, thalamus, and the basal ganglia. Our previous work with paediatric patients with a history of hypoxia-ischaemia has revealed hippocampal and diencephalic damage that impacts cognitive memory. However, the structural and functional status of other brain regions vulnerable to hypoxia-ischaemia, such as the basal ganglia, has not been investigated in these patients. Furthermore, it is not known whether there are any behavioural sequelae of such damage, especially in patients with no diagnosis of neurological disorder. Based on the established role of the basal ganglia and the thalamus in movement coordination, we studied manual motor function in 20 participants exposed to neonatal hypoxia-ischaemia, and a group of 17 healthy controls of comparable age. The patients' handwriting speed and accuracy was within the normal range (Detailed Assessment of Speed of Handwriting), and their movement adaptation learning (Rotary Pursuit task) was comparable to the control group's performance. However, as a group, patients showed an impairment in the Grooved Pegboard task and a trend for impairment in speed of movement while performing the Rotary Pursuit task, suggesting that some patients have subtle deficits in fine, complex hand movements. Voxel-based morphometry and volumetry showed bilateral reduction in grey matter volume of the thalamus and caudate nucleus. Reduced volumes in the caudate nucleus correlated across patients with performance on the Grooved Pegboard task. In summary, the fine movement coordination deficit affecting the hand and the wrist in patients exposed to early hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury may be related to reduced volumes of the caudate nucleus, and consistent with anecdotal parental reports of clumsiness and coordination difficulties in this cohort.

AB  - First responders and recovery planners need accurate and quickly derived information about the status of buildings as well as newly built ones to both help victims and to make decisions for reconstruction processes after a disaster. Deep learning and, in particular, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches have recently become state-of-the-art methods to extract information from remote sensing images, in particular for image-based structural damage assessment. However, they are predominantly based on manually extracted training samples. In the present study, we use pre-disaster OpenStreetMap building data to automatically generate training samples to train the proposed deep learning approach after the co-registration of the map and the satellite images. The proposed deep learning framework is based on the U-net design with residual connections, which has been shown to be an effective method to increase the efficiency of CNN-based models. The ResUnet is followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implementation to further refine the results. Experimental analysis was carried out on selected very high resolution (VHR) satellite images representing various scenarios after the 2013 Super Typhoon Haiyan in both the damage and the recovery phases in Tacloban, the Philippines. The results show the robustness of the proposed ResUnet-CRF framework in updating the building map after a disaster for both damage and recovery situations by producing an overall F1-score of 84.2%.

AB  - The Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) proposes a new synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data mode called compact (hybrid or partial) polarimetry (CP) in a wide swath. Compact polarimetry maximizes the measurement potential if the multilook complex (MLC) coherence matrix of the SAR backscattered field is used. The MLC CP coherence matrix follows the Wishart distribution. In this paper, an unsupervised region-based semantic segmentation of the MLC CP coherence matrix data using the complex Wishart distribution is presented. The segmentation method is an extension of the iterative region growing with semantics (IRGS) to complex CP data. The proposed algorithm is called CP-IRGS and is formulated based on conditional random fields (CRFs) incorporating edge strength over the image. Applications of the algorithm are demonstrated using a simulated MLC CP data set and a real single-look complex (SLC) quadrature polarimetric (QP) SAR data set which is used to derive the MLC CP data.

TI  - Flash Flood Detection From CYGNSS Data Using the RUSBoost Algorithm
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods can cause massive damages because of their rapid evolution. To reduce or prevent harm caused by a flash flood, it is vital to have information about its formation and spread. Hence, providing real-time surveillance flood is essential. Considering Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma as two case studies, six different data preparation approaches (DPAs) for flood detection based on the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) data and the Random Under-Sampling Boosted (RUSBoost) classification algorithm are investigated in this article. Taking flood and land as two classes, flash flood detection is tackled as a binary classification problem. Eleven observables are extracted from the delay-Doppler maps (DDMs) for feature selection. These observables, alongside two features from an ancillary data, are considered in feature selection. All the combinations of these observables with and without ancillary data are fed into the classifier with 5-fold cross-validation one by one. Based on the test results, five observables with the ancillary data are selected as a suitable feature vector for flood detection here. Using the selected feature vector, six different DPAs are investigated and compared to find the best one for flash flood detection. Then, the performance of the proposed method is compared with that of a support vector machine (SVM) based classifier. For Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma, the selected method is able to detect89.00% and 85.00% of flooded points, respectively, with a resolution of 500m x 500 m, and the detection accuracy for non-flooded land points is 97.20% and 71.00%, respectively.

AB  - Timely monitoring of agricultural production and early yield predictions are essential for food security. Crop growth conditions and yield are related to climate variability and are impacted by extreme events. Remotely sensed time-series could be used to study the variability in crop growth and agricultural production. However, the choice of remotely sensed data and methods is still an issue, as different datasets have different spatiotemporal characteristics. Our primary goal was to test different algorithms and several remotely sensed time-series datasets for yield estimation in U.S. at county and field scale. For a county-level analysis, MODIS-based surface reflectance, Land Surface Temperature, and Evapotranspiration time series were used as input datasets. Field-level analysis was carried out using NASA's Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) product. For this purpose, 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) and CNN followed by long-short term memory (LSTM) were used. For county-level analysis, the CNN-LSTM model had the highest accuracy, with a mean percentage error of 10.3% for maize and 9.6% for soybean. This model presented robust results for the year 2012, which is considered a drought year. In the case of field-level analysis, all models achieved accurate results with R 2 exceeding 0.8 when data from mid growing season were used. The results highlight the potential of using satellite data for yield estimation at different management scales.

TI  - A Chelate-Free Nano-Platform for Incorporation of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Isotopes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Using our chelate-free, heat-induced radiolabeling (HIR) method, we show that a wide range of metals, including those with radioactive isotopologues used for diagnostic imaging and radionuclide therapy, bind to the Feraheme (FH) nanoparticle (NP), a drug approved for the treatment of iron anemia.Material and methods: FH NPs were heated (120 degrees C) with nonradioactive metals, the resulting metal-FH NPs were characterized by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and r(1) and r(2) relaxivities obtained by nuclear magnetic relaxation spectrometry (NMRS). In addition, the HIR method was performed with [Y-90]Y3+, [Lu-177]Lu3+, and [Cu-64]Cu2+, the latter with an HIR technique optimized for this isotope. Optimization included modifying reaction time, temperature, and vortex technique. Radiochemical yield (RCY) and purity (RCP) were measured using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and thin-layer chromatography (TLC).Results: With ICP-MS, metals incorporated into FH at high efficiency were bismuth, indium, yttrium, lutetium, samarium, terbium and europium (>75% @ 120 degrees C). Incorporation occurred with a small (less than 20%) but statistically significant increases in size and the r(2) relaxivity. An improved HIR technique (faster heating rate and improved vortexing) was developed specifically for copper and used with the HIR technique and [Cu-64]Cu2+. Using SEC and TLC analyses with [Y-90]Y3+, [Lu-177]Lu3+ and [Cu-64]Cu2+, RCYs were greater than 85% and RCPs were greater than 95% in all cases.Conclusion: The chelate-free HIR technique for binding metals to FH NPs has been extended to a range of metals with radioisotopes used in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Cations with f-orbital electrons, more empty d-orbitals, larger radii, and higher positive charges achieved higher values of RCY and RCP in the HIR reaction. The ability to use a simple heating step to bind a wide range of metals to the FH NP, a widely available approved drug, may allow this NP to become a platform for obtaining radiolabeled nanoparticles in many settings.

TI  - Spectroscopic measurements and imaging of soil colour for field scale estimation of soil organic carbon
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective measurement and management of soil organic carbon (SOC) are essential for ecosystem function and food production. SOC has an important influence on soil properties and soil quality. Conventional SOC analysis is expensive and time-consuming. The development of spectral imaging sensors enables the acquisition of larger amounts of data using cheaper and faster methods. In addition, satellite remote sensing offers the potential to perform surveys more frequently and over larger areas. This research aimed to measure SOC content with colour as an indirect proxy. The measurements of soil colour were made at an agricultural site of the Czech Republic with an inexpensive digital camera and the Sentinel-2 remote sensor. Various soil colour spaces and colour indices derived from the (i) reflectance spectroscopy in the selected wavelengths of the visible (VIS) range (400-700 nm), (ii) RGB digital camera, and (iii) Sentinel-2 visible bands were used to train models for prediction of SOC. For modelling, we used the machine learning method, random forest (RF), and the models were validated with repeated 5-fold cross-validation. For prediction of SOC, the digital camera produced R-2 = 0.85 and FtMSEp = 0.11%, which had higher R-2 and similar RMSEp compared to those obtained from the spectroscopy (R-2 = 0.78 and RMSEp = 0.09%). Sentinel-2 predicted SOC with lower accuracy than other techniques; however, the results were still fair (R-2 = 0.67 and RMSEp = 0.12%) and comparable with other methods. Using a digital camera with simple colour features was efficient. It enabled cheaper and accurate predictions of SOC compared to spectroscopic measurement and Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - Building Volume Per Capita (BVPC): A Spatially Explicit Measure of Inequality Relevant to the SDGs
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Building Volume Per Capita (BVPC - cubic meters of building per person) is presented as a proxy measure of economic inequality and a direct measure of housing inequality. Sustainable development goal 10 (SDG 10: reduced inequalities) is synergic for achieving SDG 11 on sustainable cities and communities. Access to safe and affordable housing, transport systems, and public spaces are some of the targets of SDG 11 that mostly link with reducing inequalities. The Habitat III New Urban Agenda sets equal access to urban spaces, infrastructures and basic services as crucial for developing sustainable cities. Earth Observation (EO) data including remotely sensed satellite data, airborne data, and model outputs, in combination with demographic, and other statistical data, have been gaining importance for monitoring progress of the SDGs. High spatial resolution building footprint data derived from aerial photographs, stereo imagery, and LIDAR data, obtained for the cities of California, between 2010 and 2015, were used in this study. These measures of building volume were rasterized and juxtaposed with (divided by) a variety of demographic data including vector-based census data of 2015 and LandScan raster data of population counts of 2015. The National Landcover dataset of 2011 was used to characterize the land cover variability of the cities. Using these datasets, the spatial pattern and distribution of BVPC for nine cities in California were studied. The results showed that BVPC was inversely related with intensity of development, and positively related with median household income within cities. A BV-GINI was also developed to characterize the variability of the BVPC at the census tract level and the pixel level. This measure of income inequality, housing and population density is objective and easily executable. It can be used in other cities and countries and may help overcome lack of data in SDG indicators.

T2  - PHRONIMON
M3  - Article
AB  - A global pandemic such as that of the 2020 Covid-19 corona virus, causing great suffering and loss of life, brings home the difficult conditions that make for our fragile human life. But the question that religious belief poses, about "natural evil" in a world created by a loving God, satirised by Voltaire in the 18th century, masks the more existential problem, the possibility of greater human solidarity. In the background is the Deist view of God complementing the "polite society" of mutual benefit and guaranteeing the latter's benevolent outcome. It is a worldview, as Charles Taylor (2007) explains, that has put aside the premodern idea of human transformation, that was symbolised by religious virtuosi, saints, theophanies, and so on, now looked upon with suspicion by modernity. But the possibility of transformation, of a generous human response to suffering, is what is called for in a pandemic. In Camus' novel, The Plague, we see the more authentic response that resists being boxed in by religious enthusiasts to a constricted and ideological affirmation of a cosmic picture that obscures the fault-lines of bourgeois society.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The existence of a plurality of ethical perspectives based on the presence of diverse religions and worldviews in contemporary society can make it hard to reach consensus on ethical issues in healthcare. Not only do religion and worldview influence attitudes, practices, and policies in healthcare. Racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious stereotypes and biases based on the assumption that people of a different social group are hard or even impossible to comprehend may obstruct dialogue and lead to inequalities and disparities in healthcare. In this context, moral relativism, which claims that, all moral viewpoints being equal, they can only be assessed from their own particular perspective, does not offer solutions and only reconfirms the impossibility of moral dialogue. The idea of common morality offers a way out of this deadlock by providing a common language on the basis of which normative ethical discussion in healthcare becomes possible. Differences may remain at the level of particular moralities. The common morality creates an atmosphere in which empathetic understanding of other ethical perspectives is enabled. In the case of ethical conflict, this offers an opportunity to search for creative solutions that are acceptable to all parties involved.

T2  - SKASE JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2nd Conference on Culture and Cognition in Language
CL  - Rzeszow, POLAND
AB  - This paper seeks to contribute to research into the relationship between language and culture. It tests correlations between the linguistic worldview (Bartminski 2007; 2009) which emerges from paremiological evidence and the findings of social psychology with reference to national cultures (Hofstede, Hofstede & Minkov 2010) which indicate that one of the top characteristics of Polish culture is restraint. Analysis of thematically selected Polish proverbs is carried out in relation to conceptualisations which include social hierarchy, gender roles, the importance of friendship, and the value of work. What emerges from the didactic message of proverbs is an image of community and its norms. Expressions of proverbial wisdom are discussed in relation to the Indulgence (vs. Restraint) Dimension (Hofstede, Hofstede & Minkov 2010) as one of the cultural parameters applied in the World Values Survey (WVS). With a distinctly low score of 29 (out of 100), Poland seems to be a restrained culture which favours control of desires and impulses, undervalues leisure, discourages freedom of speech, prescribes clearly cut social roles and imposes traditional norms in public life. Linguistic evidence seems to confirm the result: Polish proverbs advocating prudence, caution and reticence, favour rigid rules which define the roles and rights of individuals. A high premium is placed on friendship understood in terms of mutual trust and support, as previously noted in cross-cultural pragmatic research (Wierzbicka 1997). Overall, the linguistic material corroborates the findings from wave 6 of the WVS (2010-2014) which show the family-work-religion triad as top priorities, relegating indulgence to fifth position.

AB  - Large amounts of satellite data are now becoming available, which, in combination with appropriate change detection methods, offer the opportunity to derive accurate information on timing and location of disturbances such as deforestation events across the earth surface. Typical scenarios require the analysis of billions of image patches/pixels. While various change detection techniques have been proposed in the literature, the associated implementations usually do not scale well, which renders the corresponding analyses computationally very expensive or even impossible. In this work, we propose a novel massively-parallel implementation for a state-of-the-art change detection method and demonstrate its potential in the context of monitoring deforestation. The novel implementation can handle large scenarios in a few hours or days using cheap commodity hardware, compared to weeks or even years using the existing publicly available code, and enables researchers, for the first time, to conduct global-scale analyses covering large parts of our Earth using little computational resources. From a technical perspective, we provide a high-level parallel algorithm specification along with several performance-critical optimizations dedicated to efficiently map the specified parallelism to modern parallel devices. While a particular change detection method is addressed in this work, the algorithmic building blocks provided are also of immediate relevance to a wide variety of related approaches in remote sensing and other fields.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fingerprinting of the main lipid components of the digestive gland of the Icelandic scallop-Chlamys islandica-has been performed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with time of flight high-resolution mass spectrometry, UHPLC-HRMS/ToF. This method allowed the identification of 224 lipids, including phosphatidylcholines (PC), plasmanyl (PC-O)/plasmenyl (PC-P) phosphatidylcholines, lyso-phosphatidylcholines (LPC), and their plasmanyl/plasmenyl forms (LPC-O/LPC-P). Diacylglycerols (DG), triacylglycerols (TG), and cholesteryl esters (CE) were the neutral lipids (NL) analyzed. While all of the lipids showed a strong seasonal dependence in terms of quantity, only NLs presented significant qualitative changes. Principal component analysis (PCA) of TG and DG profiles evidenced a prevalence of low unsaturated TGs and DGs in spring, which were replaced by species with a higher degree of unsaturations in summer. In autumn, long and highly unsaturated TGs constitute the lipid fraction of the digestive gland of the scallop, while DG species offer a mixed profile. This study contributes to the characterization and the elucidation of the lipidome of Chlamys islandica and provides baseline data for further study of the effects of pollutants on the lipidome of the Icelandic scallop, often used as a sentinel species in biomonitoring programs.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions

AB  - Uncertainties in the retrieval of remote sensing reflectance, rsR, from Ocean Color (OC) satellite sensors have a strong impact on performance of algorithms for the estimation of chlorophyll-a concentrations and inherent optical properties (IOPs). Uncertainties are highest in the blue bands, especially in coastal waters with low blue-band Rrs values. We recently showed that the main uncertainty contributions when observing at sun glint-optimized geometries are due to two components: variability of in-water parameters and skylight reflected from the water surface. Sunlight propagates to the water and back to the top of the atmosphere (TOA), capturing the instantaneous state of in-water conditions and sky light reflected from the wind-roughened wave facets. Both processes are averaged with the spatial resolution of the sensor. This results in the satellite measured TOA radiance spectrum, which is typically different from vector radiative transfer simulations that are based on the mean values of sea surface reflectance coefficient. Preliminary analysis shows that these two uncertainty components are spatially highly variable. Using the recently released provisional Aquatic Reflectance product for Landsat 8, we analyzed spatial scales of these components for multiple scenes in the open ocean and coastal waters at spatial resolutions ranging from 30 m to several kilometers.

TI  - Bats in urbanising landscapes: habitat selection and recommendations for a sustainable future
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanisation is among the most ecologically damaging change in land use, posing significant threats to global biodiversity. Most bat species are threatened by urbanisation, although urban areas can also offer important roosting and foraging opportunities. Urban development should consider how bats are likely to respond to development, and take measures to minimise impacts. We used acoustic data from four years of citizen science monitoring (2013-2016) to quantify the importance of fine-scale habitat configuration and composition for bats in urban areas in eastern England. Bat distribution and activity were analysed in relation to remote sensing data representing impervious surface, waterbodies and tree-cover density. Furthermore, hypothetical future scenarios of urban development were considered, assuming an increase in impervious or woodland surface. Lakes and discontinuous woodland were the most selected habitats and urban areas were the least selected, with Barbastellus, Myotis and Plecotus species being the most vulnerable. Nyctalus, Pipistrellus and Eptesicus species were less influenced by the presence of urban areas. Our results suggest that urban growth should be sought through the expansion of existing urban blocks, rather than creating new urban patches, to minimise impacts on commuting or foraging sites. Creating bat-friendly habitat of an area at least equal to any new urban settlement could provide mitigation for negative effects of urbanisation. Opportunities to increase areas of discontinuous woodland should be encouraged, while preserving unmanaged areas within large plantations would likely support the exploitation of continuous woodland by bats.

TI  - Remote sensing applications in the Fars Region of the Zagros Mountains of Iran
T2  - FOLD AND THRUST BELTS: STRUCTURAL STYLE, EVOLUTION AND EXPLORATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Zagros Mountains in Iran are an active fold-and-thrust belt that contains world-class examples of folding and salt tectonics. The Fars Region is an excellent location for testing remote sensing methods and applications of satellite data due to its dry climate and superb exposure of geological features. Recent advances in satellite technology and image acquisition have resulted in high-quality global datasets at increasing resolution that provide a highly valuable source of data for structural analysis of fold-and-thrust belts. Oblique lineaments like the Razak Line in eastern Fars can be identified by changes in the dimensions of anticlines, presence of deflected folds, offsets in the alignment of structures, location of anticlinal plunges and exposures of salt. Drainage analysis can show propagation and coalescence of anticlines. We review several methods using optical data, digital elevation models and interferometric synthetic-aperture radar. We integrate those methods and generate detailed geological maps, structural cross-sections, identify structural steps and hidden basement features, and compare to seismological data and their effect on the exposed geology.

TI  - "Τα Μωμογερια" (Momogeria) - Pontic Greeks' Traditional Folk Theatre
T2  - BALKANISTIC FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of the paper is the recording and database set up on the folklore heritage of the Pontic Greeks living in Ajara with the purpose to study the Pontic Greeks lifestyle, worldview, and culture through the study of the collected empiric material. It is also important to throw light to the points of similarity and difference with the Georgian folklore."Kalanda Speech" was also adopted in the repertoire of other holidays, but according to the habit, it was performed mostly at New Year, Christmas, Christening. Kalanda (kappa alpha lambda alpha nu tau alpha) was a chant message related to the particular Orthodox Christian holidays, which was performed by a team of the volunteers, mainly children. In various other parts of Greece and Ponto as well, after migration to Ajara, this tradition was continued. Those who heard the Kalanda chants would give to the singers coins or sweets, to get blessing of the family from them and get them visit the family next year. The New Year Kalanda text demonstrates how much the Pontic Greeks, migrated in Ajara appreciated health and long, joyful life. They also paid attention to the importance of peace in the family and the state; therefore, we hear an address to the listener, to be grateful for all that they experienced in the passed year.The tradition of New Year and Christmas Kalanda chant is also associated with the "Tau alpha Mu omicron mu omicron gamma epsilon rho iota alpha" - a custom which is necessary to pay attention to the so called "Momogeria custom". The tradition of Momogeria was very popular in Ajara, and it is best described as Kalanda chant and begging for gifts or money by a group of masked and dressed in special disguising clothing, which could involve both old and young people. The Pontic Greeks who migrated in Ajara found the natural environment quite severe for their everyday life; however, they overcame it with dignity and got adapted to the local area. This tradition was kept by the Pontic Greeks in villages who lived in Greece after migration from Trabzon "Tau rho alpha pi epsilon zeta omicron upsilon nu tau alpha" in 1923. In December 2016 UNESCO enlisted it in the world heritage list.

T2  - VESTNIK PRAVOSLAVNOGO SVYATO-TIKHONOVSKOGO GUMANITARNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA I-BOGOSLOVIE-FILOSOFIYA-RELIGIOVEDENIE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article offers theoretical approaches to the analysis of the phenomenon of Soviet ideology and specifies the relationship between the processes of secularisation and sacralisation in Soviet society. The historical process of the 20th century led to a complex transformation of the worldview of the Soviet man. At the beginning of the Soviet period, there was a replacement of the Orthodox faith, the bearer of which was the peasant majority of the population of the USSR, with a Soviet ideological construction. In many ways, this construction falls under the concept of quasi-religion; it has its own doctrine, ideological narrative, proletarian morality, specific civil rites, party structure similar to the Church. A special Soviet culture was created, guided by the principles of socialist realism and having its own specific symbolism. A significant place in the Soviet quasi-religion was occupied by the cult of the leader. The main difference between Soviet ideology and traditional religion was a complete absence of a transcendental component which was replaced by the eschatologism of the beginning of a new historical aeon, the building of paradise on Earth. At the same time, there was a process of secularisation in consciousness of the Soviet people through an educational system in which they acquired a positivist picture of the world deprived of sacred features. This rationalisation of consciousness, as well as the political events of the 50s, led to a gradual loss of attractiveness of Soviet ideology for a large part of the population, but, on the other hand, intensified the spiritual quest of Soviet people in the post-war period of Soviet history. These quests were directed towards traditional Orthodoxy, towads various forms of esotericism, towards increased interest in paranormal phenomena. Following this, in the late Soviet period there appeared a worldview that can be characterised as inclined to all mysterious, unusual, miraculous. One can regard this as a manisfestation of the innate fondness for the transcendental, generally typical of people. It is possible to agree with N. Demerath who argued that secularisation and sacralisation are symbiotic processes. The rejection of a traditional religion (secularisation) led to uncritical acceptance of the Communist quasi-religious ideology (sacralisation), disappointment in it and acquisition of the positivist worldview (secularisation); this leads to a crisis and again pushes the person to religion in its more traditional understanding (sacralisation). Therefore, the current religious situation in Russia can be described as post-secular.

T2  - LAEKNABLADID
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE: As part of the implementation of quality registration in Iceland we used retrospective data to compare diagnosis and treatment of invasive breast cancer between Iceland and Sweden.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on all patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in Iceland 2016-2017 was obtained from the Icelandic Cancer Registry. Hospital records were used to register variables in an electronic form adapted from the Swedish quality registration. and compared with data from Sweden for the same period. A chi-square test was used to compare ratios.RESULTS: A total of 486 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in Iceland and 15.325 in Sweden. A lower proportion of 40-69 year old women were diagnosed within the screening programme in Iceland (46%) compared to Sweden (60%) 0)4.011. Multidisciplinary tumor board meetings held before and after surgery were less frequent in Iceland (92% vs. 96%) compared to Sweden (98% vs. 99%) in 2016 (p<0.01) but no difference was seen in 2017. A sentinel node surgery was done in 69% of the cases in Iceland compared to 94% in Sweden (p<0.01). For cancers <= 30mm breast conserving surgery was done in 48% cases in Iceland but 80% in Sweden (p<0.01). In Iceland 87% of the cases had radiation therapy after breast conserving surgery but 94% in Sweden (p<0.01). Among mastectomy patients with lymph node metastases. 49% received radiation therapy in Iceland compared to 83% in Sweden (p<0.01).CONCLUSION: Differences were seen in several areas of diagnosis and treatment of invasive breast cancer between Iceland and Sweden. With quality registration it will be possible to monitor and set goals for the diagnosis and treatment. with the aim of providing the best treatment to as many patients as possible.

AB  - Mount Okmok is an active volcano, located on the northeastern end of Umnak Island in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. It is a shield volcano with an approximately 10 km wide caldera, and has undergone several eruptions over the last decades, with the most recent one taking place in 2008. Presence of an underground magma reservoir is manifesting on the surface in form of terrain deformations, e.g. subsidence and uplift. Because of that, Okmok is one of the most thoroughly studied volcanoes in the Aleutian Islands. Its deformations have been examined in the past using field geodetic techniques, like GPS. Work has also been done to determine Okmok's surface displacements using SAR Interferometry. The article presents an approach of calculating terrain deformations with the differential SAR interferometry method, as well as a quality assessment of obtained results by a comparison with GPS data received from various stations located over the study area. The DInSAR calculations have been conducted on a set of radar images taken by the Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellites from tracks 44, 95 and 117, covering a period of time between years 2015 and 2018. Calculated LOS deformations show that there is a significant uplift in the area of volcano's caldera, in contrast to the rest of Mount Okmok's surface. The comparison with GPS time series shows that both methods bring similar results, meaning that Sentinel-1 imagery processed with the DInSAR method can successfully be used to determine ground surface deformations over large areas.

AB  - The complexity of modern data systems and applications greatly increases the challenge in understanding system behaviour and diagnosing performance problems. When these problems arise, system administrators are left with the difficult task of remedying them by relying on large debug log files, vast numbers of metrics, and system-specific tooling. We demonstrate the Sentinel system, which enables administrators to analyze systems and applications by building models of system execution and comparing them to derive key differences in behaviour. The resulting analyses are then presented as system reports to administrators and developers in an intuitive fashion. Users of Sentinel can locate, identify and take steps to resolve the reported performance issues. As Sentinel's models are constructed online by intercepting debug logging library calls, Sentinel's functionality incurs little overhead and works with all systems that use standard debug logging libraries.

TI  - Empirical Removal of Tides and Inverse Barometer Effect on DInSAR From Double DInSAR and a Regional Climate Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice shelves-the floating extensions of the Antarctic ice sheet-regulate the Antarctic contribution to sea-level rise by restraining the grounded ice flowing from upstream. Therefore, ice-shelf change (e.g., ice-shelf thinning) results in accelerated ice discharge into the ocean, which has a direct effect on sea level. Studying ice-shelf velocity allows the monitoring of the ice shelves' stability and evolution. Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) is a common technique from which highly accurate velocity maps can be inferred at high resolution. Because ice shelves are afloat, small sea-level changes-i.e., ocean tides and varying atmospheric pressure (aka inverse barometer effect) lead to vertical displacements. If not accounted for in the interferometric process, these effects will induce a strong bias in the horizontal velocity estimation. In this article, we present an empirical DInSAR correction technique from geophysical models and double DInSAR, with a study on its variance propagation. The method is developed to be used at large coverage on short timescales, essential for the near-continuous monitoring of rapidly changing areas on polar ice sheets. We used Sentinel-1SAR acquisitions in interferometric wide and extra-wide swath modes. The vertical interferometric bias is estimated using a regional climate model (MAR) and a tide model (CATS2008). The study area is located on the Roi Baudouin Ice Shelf in Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. Results show a major decrease (67 m.a(-1)) in the vertical-induced displacement bias.

TI  - Proinsulin-specific T regulatory cells may control immune responses in type 1 diabetes: implications for adoptive therapy
T2  - BMJ OPEN DIABETES RESEARCH & CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Here we looked for possible mechanisms regulating the progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). In this disease, autoaggressive T cells (T conventional cells, Tconvs) not properly controlled by T regulatory cells (Tregs) destroy pancreatic islets.Research design and methods We compared the T-cell compartment of patients with newly diagnosed T1DM (NDT1DM) with long-duration T1DM (LDT1DM) ones. The third group consisted of patients with LDT1DM treated previously with polyclonal Tregs (LDT1DM with Tregs). We have also looked if the differences might be dependent on the antigen specificity of Tregs expanded for clinical use and autologous sentinel Tconvs.Results Patients with LDT1DM were characterized by T-cell immunosenescence-like changes and expansion of similar v beta/T-cell receptor (TCR) clones in Tconvs and Tregs. The treatment with Tregs was associated with some inhibition of these effects. Patients with LDT1DM possessed an increased percentage of various proinsulin-specific T cells but not GAD65-specific ones. The percentages of all antigen-specific subsets were higher in the expansion cultures than in the peripheral blood. The proliferation was more intense in proinsulin-specific Tconvs than in specific Tregs but the levels of some proinsulin-specific Tregs were exceptionally high at baseline and remained higher in the expanded clinical product than the levels of respective Tconvs in sentinel cultures.Conclusions T1DM is associated with immunosenescence-like changes and reduced diversity of T-cell clones. Preferential expansion of the same TCR families in both Tconvs and Tregs suggests a common trigger/autoantigen responsible. Interestingly, the therapy with polyclonal Tregs was associated with some inhibition of these effects. Proinsulin-specific Tregs appeared to be dominant in the immune responses in patients with T1DM and probably associated with better control over respective autoimmune Tconvs.Trial registration number EudraCT 2014-004319-35.

AB  - Accurately mapping lithology and geological structures remains a challenge in rough terrain or in active mining areas. We propose that the integration of terrestrial and drone-borne multi-sensor remote sensing techniques can significantly boost the reliability, safety, and efficiency of geological activities in exploration and for the monitoring of mining activities. We have now developed a complete procedural chain to jointly and accurately process Structure-from-Motion Multi-View Stereo point clouds and hyperspectral data cubes in the visible to near-infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR), as well as long-wave infrared (LWIR) ranges acquired by terrestrial sensors. Hyperspectral data are processed using spectroscopic and machine learning algorithms to generate meaningful 2.5D (i.e., surface) maps that are available to geologists on the ground shortly after data acquisition. We classify the geological information content using innovative machine learning techniques. We validate the remote sensing data with in-situ mineralogical and structural measurements. Repeated acquisitions allow then to integrate a time component.

AB  - This paper presents an efficient GPU-based algorithm to perform histogram analysis of sub-images for change detection in SAR images. It is designed to use three-stage parallelisms: the SAR images are sub-divided and distributed to all the GPU devices; raster-scans for the sub-divided images are parallelized with many thread-groups inside each GPU; and 32 threads inside the group cooperatively compute the 32 statistical elements one by one by reusing the sub-histograms generated from the overlapped pixels until the dynamic range is modified. The analyzer with quad-GPU takes 1.7 s, which is 5.2 and 57.5 times faster than the conventional analyzer and that with 32-threaded dual-CPU, respectively, when applied to the problem of flood-water detection in ALOS-2 images with 37305x26811 pixels.

AB  - Weather satellites are vital tools for monitoring the global environment. They provide data that is used to deliver essential predictions and warnings, and to save lives. Space agencies have for years recognized the importance of sharing remotely sensed data for weather analysis and forecasting, climate analysis, and monitoring hazards worldwide. As a result, they operate under a policy of freely shared data. The U.S. Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS), a contributor to the global observing system, provides key observables that are crucial to obtaining continuity, global coverage, and filling data gaps. JPSS collaborates with national and international partners through the WMO and engages with multilateral organizations such as CGMS, GEO, and CEOS to develop requirements, establish best practices for combining measurements from multiple satellite sensors, and develop capabilities that enable communities worldwide to develop local solutions to address the challenges related to global atmospheric processes and their complex interactions.

TI  - Assessing OpenStreetMap Completeness for Management of Natural Disaster by Means of Remote Sensing: A Case Study of Three Small Island States (Haiti, Dominica and St. Lucia)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last few decades, many countries, especially islands in the Caribbean, have been challenged by the devastating consequences of natural disasters, which pose a significant threat to human health and safety. Timely information related to the distribution of vulnerable population and critical infrastructure is key for effective disaster relief. OpenStreetMap (OSM) has repeatedly been shown to be highly suitable for disaster mapping and management. However, large portions of the world, including countries exposed to natural disasters, remain incompletely mapped. In this study, we propose a methodology that relies on remotely sensed measurements (e.g., Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1) and derived classification schemes (e.g., forest and built-up land cover) to predict the completeness of OSM building footprints in three small island states (Haiti, Dominica and St. Lucia). We find that the combinatorial effects of these predictors explain up to 94% of the variation of the completeness of OSM building footprints. Our study extends the existing literature by demonstrating how remotely sensed measurements could be leveraged to evaluate the completeness of the OSM database, especially in countries with high risk of natural disasters. Identifying areas that lack coverage of OSM features could help prioritize mapping efforts, especially in areas vulnerable to natural hazards and where current data gaps pose an obstacle to timely and evidence-based disaster risk management.

TI  - N.V. Gogol and Russian Spiritual Culture: An Experience of Comprehension
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper examines the actual aspects of the problem "Gogol and Russian spiritual culture", presented in the reports of the participants of the scientific conference "19th International Gogol Readings" in Moscow and Jerusalem. The conference discussed the traditions of ancient Russian and patristic literature in the poetics of the writer, creative ties with outstanding spiritual writers and contemporaries, attitude to the ideological doctrines of the Slavophiles and Westerners. The speakers' attention was paid to the specifics of Gogol's Christian worldview, its evolution, and the forms of reflection in the ideological and figurative structure of the writer's artistic and journalistic works. "Selected places from the correspondence with friends" were discussed, such as Gogol's artistic preaching and spiritual testament, the writer's connection with the Russian homiletical tradition, Gogol's problem of man through the prism of Christian anthropology in a broad historical, literary and philosophical context (Skovoroda, Radishchev, Karamzin, Venevitinov, I. Kireyevsky, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Mandelstam, etc.), comparing the works of Gogol and the world spiritual culture (Confucius, Kierkegaard), comprehending the spiritual discourse of Gogol's works in the Russian religion and philosophical thought of the 20th century (V. Zenkovsky, Yu Govorukha-Otrok, V. Rozanov, N. Roerich, S. Averintsev and others). The important topics of the conference were Gogol's pilgrimage to the Holy Land and its role in the writer's creative biography, a phased reconstruction of Gogol's route through the Holy Land in 1848, its comparison with travelogues in Russian pilgrimage literature, the writer's circle of contacts during his journey, his assessment of the moral outcome of his trip. The conference demonstrated a diversity of modern approaches to the problem "Gogol and Russian spiritual culture", as well as the prospects for further academic research.

TI  - Using OCO-2 Satellite Data for Investigating the Variability of Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Concentration in Relationship with Precipitation, Relative Humidity, and Vegetation over Oman
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Recognition of the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration variations over time is critical for tracing the future changes in climate both globally and regionally. In this study, a time series analysis of atmospheric CO2 concentration and its relationship with precipitation, relative humidity (RH), and vegetation is investigated over Oman. The daily XCO2 data from OCO-2 satellite was obtained from September 2014 to March 2019. The daily RH and precipitation data were also collected from the ground weather stations, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was obtained from MODIS. Oman was studied in four distinct regions where the main emphasis was on the Monsoon Region in the far south. The CO2 concentration time series indicated a significant upward trend over different regions for the study period, with annual cycles being the same for all regions except the Monsoon Region. This is indicative of RH, precipitation, and consequently vegetation cover impact on atmospheric CO2 concentration, resulting in an overall lower annual growth in the Monsoon Region. Simple and multiple correlation analyses of CO2 concentration with mentioned parameters were performed in zero to three-month lags over Oman. They showed high correlations mainly during the rainfall period in the Monsoon Region.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, the author tries to understand the significance of "Science as a Vocation" for Max Weber's listeners: what goals and objectives did the speaker set, and what is the relevance of the lecture to understand science and scientists today? As a historical source, the autobiography of K. Levit is used, which recorded the listener's personal experiences from the speech. Referring to Schleiermacher's ideas, the author seeks to interpret Weber's speech as Lebenswerk. The author connects the ideas of the speech with the historical context of that time, as well as the philosophy of life and neo-Kantianism. The author believes that Weber's call for reflection is of key importance for understanding science as vocation. The author comprehends the significance of reflection not only for science, but also for the personality as a whole - for its self-identification and self-knowledge, orientation in the social space.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Modeling of Urban Growth Using Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a general framework for modeling the growth of three important variables for cities: population distribution, binary urban footprint, and urban footprint in color. The framework models the population distribution as a spatiotemporal regression problem using machine learning, and it obtains the binary urban footprint from the population distribution through a binary classifier plus a temporal correction for existing urban regions. The framework estimates the urban footprint in color from its previous value, as well as from past and current values of the binary urban footprint using a semantic inpainting algorithm. By combining this framework with free data from the Landsat archive and the Global Human Settlement Layer framework, interested users can get approximate growth predictions of any city in the world. These predictions can be improved with the inclusion in the framework of additional spatially distributed input variables over time subject to availability. Unlike widely used growth models based on cellular automata, there are two main advantages of using the proposed machine learning-based framework. Firstly, it does not require to define rules a priori because the model learns the dynamics of growth directly from the historical data. Secondly, it is very easy to train new machine learning models using different explanatory input variables to assess their impact. As a proof of concept, we tested the framework in Valledupar and Rionegro, two Latin American cities located in Colombia with different geomorphological characteristics, and found that the model predictions were in close agreement with the ground-truth based on performance metrics, such as the root-mean-square error, zero-mean normalized cross-correlation, Pearson's correlation coefficient for continuous variables, and a few others for discrete variables such as the intersection over union, accuracy, and the metric. In summary, our framework for modeling urban growth is flexible, allows sensitivity analyses, and can help policymakers worldwide to assess different what-if scenarios during the planning cycle of sustainable and resilient cities.

AB  - In general, the common problem consciousness of the postmodern philosophers was to restore the dignity and freedom of each individual who was buried in a collective and totalized society. Adorno urged the individual to be separated from the totalized society with critical reason. Levinas understood that an individual's self-identity is given from relations, and therefore insisted on giving up the pursuit of ontology and making ethics the first philosophy, which implies an exploration of relations. Derrida's case emphasized a kind of tolerance, which recognizes differences focusing on the differance between human concepts. And Foucault thought that social structure was the measure of truth because he regarded human nature itself as 'freedom' and that the regulation of man and the worldview of an age dependant on 'acceptance from the public'. Foucault therefore stressed the need to create a new social order through the solidarity of the masses against the totalitarian forces that oppress the masses.Kierkegaard's ideas share the problem consciousness of postmodernism, but they are completely different in their solutions. From Kierkegaard's point of view, the common error of Postmodernism is that the rule of self or the establishment of self is excluded. For Kierkegaard, the essential characteristic of the human mind is the ability to reflect. And when humans try to reflect on themselves, what can't be denied is that they have a relationship with the ‘beyond one (God).’ When it is so defined as the ground of one's being, it becomes the true self, the individual of true meaning. In order for human moral conduct, meaning autonomy, to be effective, we must start with the question of self (self-identity or self-identity). Thus, it is a limitation of Postmodernism to ask for moral orders without establishing true self-identity.

TI  - Annual maps of global artificial impervious area (GAIA) between 1985 and 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial impervious areas are predominant indicators of human settlements. Timely, accurate, and frequent information on artificial impervious areas is critical to understanding the process of urbanization and land use/cover change, as well as of their impacts on the environment and biodiversity. Despite their importance, there still lack annual maps of high-resolution Global Artificial Impervious Areas (GAIA) with longer than 30-year records, due to the high demand of high performance computation and the lack of effective mapping algorithms. In this paper, we mapped annual GAIA from 1985 to 2018 using the full archive of 30-m resolution Landsat images on the Google Earth Engine platform. With ancillary datasets, including the nighttime light data and the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data, we improved the performance of our previously developed algorithm in arid areas. We evaluated the GAIA data for 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, and the mean overall accuracy is higher than 90%. A cross-product comparison indicates the GAIA data are the only dataset spanning over 30 years. The temporal trend in GAIA agrees well with other datasets at the local, regional, and global scales. Our results indicate that the GAIA reached 797,076 km(2) in 2018, which is 1.5 times more than that in 1990. China and the United States (US) rank among the top two in artificial impervious area, accounting for approximately 50% of the world's total in 2018. The artificial impervious area of China surpassed that of the US in 2015. By 2018, the remaining eight among the top ten countries are India, Russia, Brazil, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, and Canada. The GAIA dataset can be freely downloaded from http://data.ess.tsinghua.edu.cn.

TI  - INTERCOMPARISONS OF PRECIPITABLE WATER VAPOUR DERIVED FROM RADIOSONDE, GPS AND SUNPHOTOMETER OBSERVATIONS
T2  - GEODETSKI VESTNIK
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric precipitable water vapour (PWV) plays a crucial role in the hydrological cycle and energy transfer on a global scale. Radiosonde (RS), sunphotometer (SP) and GPS (as well as broader GNSS) receivers have gradually been the principal instruments for ground-based PWV observation. This study first co-locates the observation stations configured the three instruments in the globe and in three typical latitudinal climatic regions respectively, then the PWV data from the three instruments are matched each other according to the observing times. After the outliers are removed from the matched data pairs, the PWV intercomparisons for any two instruments are performed. The results show that the PWV estimates from any two instruments have a good agreement with very high correlation coefficients. The latitude and climate have no significant influence on the PWV measurements from the three instruments, indicating that the instruments are very stable and depend on their performance. The PWV differences of any two instruments display the normal distribution, indicating non-systematic biases among the two PWV datasets. The relative differences between SP and GPS are the smallest, the middle between SP and RS, and those between GPS and RS are the largest. This study will be useful to promote GPS (GNSS) and SP PWV to be a substitute for RS PWV as a benchmark because of their high temporal resolutions.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing is a multi-dimensional information acquisition technology that combines imaging technology and spectral technology. It can obtain continuous and narrow band image data with high spectral resolution. Therefore, hyperspectral remote sensing has great potential in the identification of ground features and the classification of vegetation types. In this paper, GF-5 data was used as training data to classify forest types in Northeast China. Firstly, the water absorption bands and some noise bands were removed from the GF-5 hyperspectral image. Furthermore, the bands were grouped according to their correlation, and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on each group of bands. According to the band index, the bands with better quality were extracted from each group and combined with the bands obtained by PCA to reduce the dimension of hyperspectral data. Then the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used to extract the features of the processed image, and the extracted features were input into the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to obtain the forest vegetation type. By combining CNN and SVM, a hyperspectral forest classification model based on CNN-SVM fusion is constructed. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper performs best in forest type classification accuracy. The overall classification accuracy can reach 88.67%, and the Kappa coefficient can reach 0.84.

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Wildfire monitoring programs were first implemented in Mexico at the end of the last century; however, there are no studies that report their accuracy in detecting fires and hotspots.Objective: To evaluate the thematic accuracy of hotspots and wildfire records in a region of Michoacan de Ocampo, Mexico.Materials and methods: Rapid Eye high spatial resolution images were classified to detect fire scars. The images were crossed with hotspot maps from the MODIS sensor, processed by the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO), and from the MODIS, AVHRR and GOES sensors, processed by the National Meteorological Service (SMN), as well as with wildfire records from the National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR). Detection rates and confusion matrices were generated to assess accuracy.Results and discussion: The detection rate was higher with the CONABIO MODIS sensor (>75 %) in categories greater than 50 ha. The overall accuracy of hotspots was 62 %; however, the errors of omission (underestimation) and commission (overestimation) were 85 and 34 %, respectively. The fires reported by CONAFOR lack spatial coincidence with respect to scars, so the accuracy analysis was discarded.Conclusion: The use of hotspots, according to detection rates, is ideal for fires exceeding 50 ha. The thematic accuracy of hotspots and fire records should be evaluated at the beginning of a study.

TI  - The liberal peace fallacy: violent neoliberalism and the temporal and spatial traps of state-based approaches to peace
T2  - TERRITORY POLITICS GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The liberal worldview is founded on two interlinked promises: the inherent capacity of markets to deliver prosperity and development globally; and the increased prospects for peace in contexts of inter-state integration along liberal institutional and market lines. This paper takes issue with the latter, now often prescribed as a remedy against the geopolitical instability brought about by unpredictable 'populist' leaders. While decades of neoliberal integration have brought nation-states closer together and engendered degrees and forms of inter-state equality within world market capitalism, populations across the world have fallen prey to the violence of markets and growing intra-state inequalities. In such a context, the contemporary rise of nationalism and populisms across the world is not some liberal order antithesis emerging from a vacuum, but rather a logical consequence of this liberal order, constituting an often reactionary 'counter movement' that cannot be tackled with prescriptions for increased market globalization. A focus on the everyday forms of violence fomented beyond the inter-state level by processes of marketization demonstrates that neoliberalism's rescaling of violence and risk from the international stage down to the individual has resulted in the contemporary rise of illiberal politics and, indeed, new prospects for global peace.

TI  - Development of Methodological Approaches for the Assessment of the Status of Irrigated Lands in the South of the European Part of Russia Based on Space-Surveying Materials
T2  - ARID ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article outlines the main provisions of the methodological approach to the assessment of the condition of irrigated lands in the south of the European part of Russia based on satellite imagery from Landsat-8 satellite and ground-based observations. The visual and automated methods based on it were used to decipher irrigated lands from satellite images, and their possible determination with the use of the following indicators necessary for the monitoring the state of irrigated lands was considered: (1) the area of irrigated massifs, (2) the area of a long-term fallow in irrigated massifs, (3) the area of irrigated fields under different crops, (4) the genesis of the spotting of irrigated fields due to the state of cultivated crops and soil properties. The performed work is the first step towards the establishment of the monitoring of irrigated lands based on remote sensing. The article used the optimal type and dates of surveying satellite images, developed decryption features to assess the condition of crops and the properties of irrigated soils, and developed a technology for the automated decoding of satellite images to identify the spotting of irrigated fields based on the algorithm of decision trees.

TI  - Deep Neural Network Cloud-Type Classification (DeepCTC) Model and Its Application in Evaluating PERSIANN-CCS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing plays a pivotal role in characterizing hydrometeorological components including cloud types and their associated precipitation. The Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) on the Polar Orbiting CloudSat satellite has provided a unique dataset to characterize cloud types. However, data from this nadir-looking radar offers limited capability for estimating precipitation because of the narrow satellite swath coverage and low temporal frequency. We use these high-quality observations to build a Deep Neural Network Cloud-Type Classification (DeepCTC) model to estimate cloud types from multispectral data from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the GOES-16 platform. The DeepCTC model is trained and tested using coincident data from both CloudSat and ABI over the CONUS region. Evaluations of DeepCTC indicate that the model performs well for a variety of cloud types including Altostratus, Altocumulus, Cumulus, Nimbostratus, Deep Convective and High clouds. However, capturing low-level clouds remains a challenge for the model. Results from simulated GOES-16 ABI imageries of the Hurricane Harvey event show a large-scale perspective of the rapid and consistent cloud-type monitoring is possible using the DeepCTC model. Additionally, assessments using half-hourly Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor (MRMS) precipitation rate data (for Hurricane Harvey as a case study) show the ability of DeepCTC in identifying rainy clouds, including Deep Convective and Nimbostratus and their precipitation potential. We also use DeepCTC to evaluate the performance of the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) product over different cloud types with respect to MRMS referenced at a half-hourly time scale for July 2018. Our analysis suggests that DeepCTC provides supplementary insights into the variability of cloud types to diagnose the weakness and strength of near real-time GEO-based precipitation retrievals. With additional training and testing, we believe DeepCTC has the potential to augment the widely used PERSIANN-CCS algorithm for estimating precipitation.

TI  - THE GENRE AND THEMATIC FEATURES OF THE CRIMEAN MEDIA'S DISCOURSE
T2  - THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES OF JOURNALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - The topicality of the research is explained by the fact that media activity of any region has an immediate impact on forming public opinion and moral values, which, in their turn, are also reflected on the mass media agenda. Mass media as creators of information content provide for forming their consumers' positive or negativey attitude to events. The object of the study is the discourse of the regional media in the Crimea since it is correlated with that of the dominant Russian mass media and combines both local and national characteristics. The author focuses on the genre and thematic features of the media texts that enrich the regional worldview with content meaningful for the residents of the area. This content reflects culture-bound concepts and values of the society, and contains a special code, which is determined by local lifestyle and culture. The texts are composed in a way that they make the audience share these values and concepts and become committed to them.Having analyzed genre preferences of the Crimean and municipal press, the author notes that the prevailing ones are texts concerning politics, tourism, culture, economy and ecology. Besides, the Crimean mass media provide a platform for inter-cultural communication, which is particularly important for the multinational region.The author considers a complex inter-disciplinary research of the Crimean media landscape a good perspective of the study, which might help to develop a strategy of positioning the region among the other sub-federal entities, and determine trends and stereotypes in the sphere of social relation of the republic.

TI  - Using sentinel prey to assess predation pressure from terrestrial predators in water-filled tree holes
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree-related microhabitats are important for forest biodiversity. Water-filled tree holes are one such microhabitat and can be abundant in temperate forests. The arthropod community in this microhabitat not only contribute to forest biodiversity but also provides food for terrestrial predators such as arthropods, small mammals and birds. The extent of the threat of attack from terrestrial predators on insect larvae in this microhabitat, however, is poorly known. To measure predation in this microhabitat, we produced fake prey resembling insect larvae using white plasticine and exposed them at the aquatic-terrestrial habitat interface. We recorded: (1) which predators attacked the fake larvae, (2) the predation probability on the fake larvae after two days and after two weeks and (3) whether predation probability on fake larvae differed between managed and unmanaged forest zones in one of the last primeval beech forests, the Uholka division of the Carpathian Biosphere Reserve in the Ukrainian Carpathians. By addressing these questions, we aimed to quantify the predation pressure of terrestrial predators on insect larvae in tree-holes. The probability that a fake larva in a tree hole was attacked by predators ranged between 25-58% (95% CI) after two days and between 76-96% (95% CI) after two weeks. Overall, the highest attack rates were recorded for small mammals, followed by arthropods and birds. Arthropods took longer to detect potential prey items than small mammals and birds, and they were the only group that showed significant differences in attack rates between forest zones (unmanaged > managed). This study revealed that sentinel prey might be a suitable method for measuring the predation pressure from terrestrial predators on insect larvae in water-filled tree holes.

AB  - We report on a field trial of a new meteorological station concept for resource assessment at the site of a prospective utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) power plant to be developed by 7X Energy. Cost savings are achieved by substituting Atonometrics PV reference cells for thermopile pyranometers in a unique multi-reference-cell array configuration that allows accurate determination of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and by using advanced remote diagnostics to minimize the need for on-site visits for sensor cleaning. Reference data are also obtained from a second station at the site employing thermopile pyranometers and maintained through weekly site visits for pyranometer cleaning. Data from both stations are compared to industry-leading SolarAnywhere (R) satellite-derived irradiance measurements from Clean Power Research and are used for tuning of the satellite model for long-term irradiance prediction and site resource assessment. Results comparing the new station concept employing PV reference cells versus the traditional one based on thermopile pyranometers showed that both compared equivalently with the satellite data and tuning model within instrument uncertainties, although small bias differences require more investigation.

TI  - Francois Jullien's Innovative Concepts for Psychoanalysis in the Light of Chinese Thought Reflection
T2  - LOGOS-VILNIUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article explores developed by a French philosopher, sinologist Francois Julien psychoanalytic concepts, which are suggested to be used for a more accurate description of the logic of the psychoanalytical process and its components. This results in a deeper effect of the unthought-of (Fr. impense). The author explains S. Freud's theoretical psychoanalysis and its elements through the lens of extracts from Mencius, Confucius, Sunzi's and other thinkers' works, as well as images of the Chinese worldview. There, a greater emphasis is placed not on the "cold", rational origin, but on the processual emotional interpretation, characterized by its situativity, adaptation to the relativity of the situation, and decisions, often made based on the ongoing circumstances, without the declaration of the termination of the situation. Offered by F. Jullien concepts enrich psychoanalysis with a deeper and more nuanced specificity of treatment, as well as offer new valuable connotations to Freud's theoretical principles of psychoanalysis.

T2  - PACIFIC CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tagula butcherbird (Cracticus louisiadensis) is an endemic island species of butcherbird that has remained virtually unknown for over 130 years. The lack of information on the species has resulted in it being assigned to the Data Deficient category by BirdLife International and the IUCN, leaving its conservation status open to continuing speculation. This is an ongoing concern given the rapid environmental changes occurring in the region. Here, we describe the first observations of the habitat use, life history and ecology of the species. We also present information collected across the island distribution of the species, including density and population estimates. We found the Tagula butcherbird to be culturally important and relatively common in suitable habitats across four islands of the Louisiade Archipelago (Papua New Guinea). However, the species was absent from highly disturbed areas. We estimated this species' extent of occurrence to be similar to 1200 km(2) and area of occupancy to be less than 800 km(2). Population densities were estimated via pre-dawn assessments of singing birds and line transects. Density estimates were found to be between 0.14 and 0.53 individuals per hectare, with the highest density observed on Sabara Island. These densities were combined with remote sensing data to estimate the amount of available habitat and the species' population size, which was estimated to be between similar to 11500 and 23000 individuals. The species' dependence on forest habitat with a relatively intact canopy, combined with the likely continuing destruction of habitat on Junet and Panawina Islands, remains a conservation concern.

AB  - The study and comprehension of complex systems are crucial intellectual and scientific challenges of the 21st century. In this scenario, network science has emerged as a mathematical tool to support the study of such systems. Examples include environmental processes such as the wildfires, which are known for their considerable impact on human life. However, there is a considerable lack of studies of wildfire from a network science perspective. Here, employing the chronological network concept-a temporal network where nodes are linked if two consecutive events occur between them-we investigate the information that dynamic community structures reveal about the wildfires' dynamics. Particularly, we explore a two-phase dynamic community detection approach, i.e., we applied the Louvain algorithm on a series of snapshots, and then we used the Jaccard similarity coefficient to match communities across adjacent snapshots. Experiments with the MODIS dataset of fire events in the Amazon basing were conducted. Our results show that the dynamic communities can reveal wildfire patterns observed throughout the year.

AB  - The present study used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Modified Normalized Difference Impervious Surface Index (MNDISI) to determine the linear relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) distribution and these remote sensing indices under various spatial resolutions. Four multi-date Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) images of parts of Chhattisgarh State of India were used from four different seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter). The results indicate that LST established moderate to strong negative correlations with NDVI and weak negative to moderate positive correlations with MNDISI at various spatial resolutions (30-960 m). Generally, the coarser resolutions (840-960 m) possess stronger correlation coefficient values due to more homogeneity. The autumn or post-monsoon image represents the strongest correlation for LST-NDVI and LST-MNDISI at any resolution levels. The image of winter season reveals the best predictability of LST distribution with the known NDVI and MNDISI values.

AB  - Maintaining or increasing SOC concentration is fundamental for reducing the effects of global warming and increasing soil productivity. In this paper, a method based on Landsat 8 OLI products was developed for qualitatively monitoring in the Lake Valencia basin (Venezuela) the dynamic of SOC concentration between the years 2013 to 2018. The developed method uses the Green (B3), NIR (B5) and SW1 (B6) bands of Landsat 8 OLI sensor for detecting changes in the spectral signatures of bare soils that indicate possible variations in their concentrations of SOC. It was found that for the study period, the Lake Valencia basin soils do not present spectral features of significant variation in SOC concentration. An area of 8.61Km(2) (0.3% of the study area) was identified as a zone with a possible reduction of SOC concentration. In case of insufficient data for developing remote sensing based predictive models, the proposed method allows qualitatively monitoring and categorizing the dynamic of SOC concentration and identifying areas with spectral features of a possible variation in SOC concentration.

AB  - The use of satellite Earth Observation (EO) data to make important local, regional, and national decisions has become increasingly important as society works toward collective benefit through global sustainable development frameworks such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. While advancements have been made with respect to core satellite data management and analysis, less progress has been made on providing the broad range of EO stakeholders (including policy makers and citizens) with clear insight into this data and true understanding of the resulting analysis.This paper presents work toward a systematic approach to utilizing visualization inside the Open Data Cube ecosystem. This Open Data Cube Visualization Framework (ODC-Vis) and associated visualization applications can help bridge the gap between EO data, decisions, and development goals by helping viewers understand data and analysis on a more intuitive and engaging level. The ODC Visualization Framework seeks to increase the value of satellite data across the entire EO value-chain.Within the context of the ODC Visualization Framework this paper also presents several application examples catering to a range of stakeholders. These examples include: (1) ODC-Vis Explorer - an application for interactively exploring the data cube (2) ODC-Vis Story - an application for interactive storytelling, and (3) ODC-Vis VR - a Virtual/Augmented Reality application that supports interactive ODC analysis. As advanced visualization is more broadly used across the ODC community, improved analysis, greater insight, and better advocacy will result.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we assess the land cover changes in southwestern Lithuania from 1984 to 2018. These changes were examined using data derived from Landsat 5, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 multispectral images. The study area encompasses the Nemunas Delta, which is affected by river-induced floods leading to seasonal variations in water coverage. The water-covered area was found to be quite stable across the years during the dry seasons, i.e., in summer and early autumn. A significant increase in forested areas was observed during the study period (from 15.1% to 19.0% of the total area). During the examined period, the average size of agricultural parcels decreased several times (from approximately 35 ha to approximately 5 ha), which was caused by the transition from socialist to private ownership-based agricultural practices in the early 1990s. Almost all changes observed had rather positive environmental impacts (for biodiversity and maintenance of wildlife). Positive impacts included the establishment of several new protected territories between analysed periods. Negative impacts included the construction of wind turbines (approximately 50 in the area of study), which were not present at the beginning of the study period and may negatively affect the natural (agricultural and wetland) landscape of the region.

One of the strategies used to combat household- and individual-level food insecurity is food aid. Ensuring that food aid reaches the neediest people, however, is an ongoing challenge. In this chapter, we explore the use of geospatial technologies as part of a framework for improving food aid targeting in Bamako, Mali. We develop and apply quantitative models that rely on remotely sensed data and health survey data to highlight the importance of different aspects of demand for food aid in urban spaces. The results highlight the usefulness of this approach for food aid planning in urban areas where food need is unevenly distributed over a densely populated area.

AB  - Requirements for plant license renewal require the evaluation and management of time limited aging analyses for the period of extended operation. These include metal fatigue analyses, with additional consideration for the effects of the reactor water environment. Current license renewal requirements for evaluation of time limited aging analyses for fatigue have extended environmentally assisted fatigue (EAF) considerations to additional locations beyond the originally prescribed NUREG/CR-6260 locations. These requirements have resulted in implementation of a screening process to identify locations that are potentially more limiting for further evaluation of EAF. The screening process includes comparisons of fatigue locations within common bases, including consideration of applicable system transients, rigor of analysis methods, and material types. To date, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission has only accepted EAF screening evaluation results based on comparisons within similar material types. However, there are conditions under which a comparison of locations with different material types is valid. This paper presents a basis to compare locations having different material types, to potentially reduce the number of leading ("sentinel") locations in EAF screening evaluations. The methodology is described through a systematic approach and basis to determine when locations are more limiting with respect to EAF when different material types are compared.

TI  - PRF Selection in Formation-Flying SAR: Experimental Verification on Sentinel-1 Monostatic Repeat-Pass Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Formation-flying synthetic aperture radar (FF-SAR) enables new working modes and can achieve very high performance through a series of very compact, low-weight, satellite platforms thanks to passive operations of conveniently distributed formation-flying receivers. System timing is a crucial aspect of FF-SAR. The manuscript presents a novel approach to pulse repetition frequency (PRF) selection in order to obtain a uniform distribution of samples at given platform positions. A digital beamforming algorithm is applied on a stack of monostatic repeat-pass images collected by the Sentinel-1 system to test the validity of the PRF selection method. Processed images were thus properly selected to achieve the best merit index measuring the quality of samples distribution. The results show that: (a) the image resulting from beamforming features better azimuth ambiguity-to-signal ratio and (b) the proposed approach for PRF selection allows one to individuate a subset of the available images leading to uniform distribution of samples which can be used to support FF-SAR processing.

TI  - Sonoma County Complex Fires of 2017: Remote sensing data and modeling to support ecosystem and community resiliency
T2  - California Fish and Wildlife Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - In the western U.S., long-term fire suppression has led to a buildup of surface and ladder fuels, increasing the severity of fires. Coupled with increased home building in the wildland urban interface and global climate change, much of the western U.S. is facing unprecedented risk of catastrophic wildland fires. Given the almost 30 million acres of forestland in California, and the impacts to human community health and safety and natural systems that stem from uncontrolled fires, it is imperative that we understand the underlying processes and conditions in the landscape that determine fire impacts. In October of 2017, Sonoma County, California experienced three significant fires that resulted in loss of life and property, as well as impacts to natural systems. Sonoma County Ag + Open Space-with support from a team of technical consultants and in partnership with NASA and other experts-researched the impacts of the fires to woody vegetation within areas that burned during wind-driven and non-wind driven events. Using high-resolution aerial imagery, we mapped canopy condition of woody vegetation and used machine learning techniques to determine the importance of landscape measures of vegetation structure, land cover type, topography, climate and weather, and nearness to streams as predictors of woody canopy condition for areas that burned during the October 2017 fires. Across the landscapes, riparian and mesic vegetation types exhibited the least canopy damage, followed by upland hardwood forest types. Shrub and upland conifer types exhibited the most canopy damage. Measures of vegetation structure derived from lidar data are the most important predictors of post-fire woody canopy condition, in addition to slope-aspect, proximate vegetation community types, and distance to streams. In general, the higher the density of shrubs and fire-adapted vegetation types, the higher the density of ladder fuels, and the greater the distance from streams, the higher the canopy damage. This study emphasizes the value of high resolution airborne lidar for mapping vegetation type and structure and building locations at a scale large enough to inform local management decisions. The study also documents pre- and post-fire baseline conditions to support the long-term evaluation of vegetation impacts and provides remote sensing and analysis tools to better plan for, manage, and mitigate future extreme wildfire through the lens of climate and extreme event resiliency, community safety and ecosystem health.

TI  - WHEN IS A KICKBACK LIKE FULFILLING A VOW TO A SAINT? "POPULAR" RELIGIONS, DYADIC EXCHANGES, AND CORRUPTION IN BRAZIL
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL ENQUIRIES INTO POLICY, DEBT, BUSINESS AND CAPITALISM
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The second decade of the twenty-first century finds Brazil racked by a series of scandals that are extreme even by world standards. This chapter presents an explanation for one of the behaviors that have produced these scandals. Specifically, it is the offering of bribes to public officials by individuals or companies that stand to benefit from contracts to perform public services and, furthermore, the paying of kickbacks to the officials if the contract is awarded. I liken this behavior to the making of vows to the saints in the "popular" or "folk" form of Catholicism - and other popular religions that accept its basic premises - and the fulfillment of the promise if and when the otherworldly being provides what the petitioner requested. Part 1 of the chapter examines an election for mayor of the city of Fortaleza in 2012 in which the office was "bought" for what seemed to be an exorbitant amount of money. I hypothesize that this is to be explained by the anticipation of the city receiving government contracts to build a soccer stadium, a rail system, and other projects related to the 2014 World Cup. In Part 2, I examine Brazil's religions beginning with popular Catholicism, to show that the normative way of gaining something desired from a supernatural - be it the restoration of health or the recovery of a lost item - is to offer it something it values and then fulfilling the promise if and when the petitioner receives what was requested. I contend that this important religious pattern continues to provide the template for the secular behavior that is being judged to be corrupt by standards other than those found in the religiously based worldview of many Brazilians.

TI  - Harmful algal blooms: A climate change co-stressor in marine and freshwater ecosystems
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Review
AB  - Marine and freshwater ecosystems are warming, acidifying, and deoxygenating as a consequence of climate change. In parallel, the impacts of harmful algal blooms (HABs) on these ecosystems are intensifying. Many eutrophic habitats that host recurring HABs already experience thermal extremes, low dissolved oxygen, and low pH, making these locations potential sentinel sites for conditions that will become more common in larger-scale systems as climate change accelerates. While studies of the effects of HABs or individual climate change stressors on aquatic organisms have been relatively common, studies assessing their combined impacts have been rare. Those doing so have reported strong species- and strain-specific interactions between HAB species and climate change co-stressors yielding outcomes for aquatic organisms that could not have been predicted based on investigations of these factors individually. This review provides an ecological and physiological framework for considering HABs as a climate change co-stressor and considers the consequences of their combined occurrence for coastal ecosystems. This review also highlights critical gaps in our understanding of HABs as a climate change co-stressor that must be addressed in order to develop management plans that adequately protect fisheries, aquaculture, aquatic ecosystems, and human health. Ultimately, incorporating HAB species into experiments and monitoring programs where the effects of multiple climate change stressors are considered will provide a more ecologically relevant perspective of the structure and function of marine ecosystems in future, climate-altered systems.

AB  - Gender equality remains one of the most relevant and therefore most often discussed research subjects. Women's rights and opportunities for self-realization have expanded significantly in recent decades; however, gender discrimination is still encountered in nowadays culture. Various studies show stereotype threat as being one of the undeniable factors for shaping stereotype-based worldview. It is proven that any representation of gender in purely traditional roles not only shapes students' understanding of abilities and interests of their gender but also has a negative impact on tests' results of a negatively stereotyped group. The object of this study is to evaluate the content of mathematics teaching material used in Lithuanian high schools, and the aim is to investigate the manifestations of stereotyping threats in educational books with qualitative content analysis using an author's evaluation matrix. The article presents results that reflect stereotype threat in mathematics teaching materials for Lithuanian fifth grade students.

TI  - An original method for tree species classification using multitemporal multispectral and hyperspectral satellite data
T2  - SILVA FENNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes an original method for tree species classification by satellite remote sensing. The method uses multitemporal multispectral (Landsat OLI) and hyperspectral (Resurs-P) data acquired from determined vegetation periods. The method is based on an original database of spectral features taking into account seasonal variations of tree species spectra. Changes in the spectral signatures of forest classes are analyzed and new spectral-temporal features are created for the classification. Study sites are located in the Czech Republic and northwest (NW) Russia. The differences in spectral reflectance between tree species am shown as statistically significant in the sub-seasons of spring, first half of summer, and main autumn for both study sites. Most of the errors are related to the classification of deciduous species and misclassification of birch as pine (NW Russia site), pine as mixture of pine and spruce. and pine as mixture of spruce and beech (Czech site). Forest species are mapped with accuracy as high as 80% (NW Russia site) and 81% (Czech site). The classification using multitemporal multispectral data has a kappa coefficient 1.7 times higher than does that of classification using a single multispectral image and 1.3 times greater than that of the classification using single hyperspectral images. Potentially, classification accuracy can be improved by the method when applying multitemporal satellite hyperspectral data, such as in using new, near-future products EnMap and/or HyspIRI with high revisit time.

TI  - THE ROMANCE OF BUSINESS : AYN RAND ROMANTICISM
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The origins of a romantic worldview in the work of Russian-born American writer and philosopher Ayn Rand (Alisa Zinovievna Rosenbaum, 1905-1982) is studied in the article. The analysis is based on the Russian and American versions of the romantic trend in literature, which differ in the interpretation of the romantic hero. Ayn Rand formulates his own understanding of romanticism, in which the determining factor for a romantic hero is the presence of will in relation to his own character and being. Comparing the texts of Rand and the representatives of business romance S. Mervin and G.K. Webster, Calumet K (1901), it can be noted that their characters are outwardly similar (they are responsible, principled, they can inspire others), but they differ on a deeper level. It is shown that the fate of humanity lies at the center of the story of Rand's novels, and not just the comprehension of ways to solve another production problem. It is noted that her characters overcome contradictions, try to understand themselves. It is stated that Ayn Rand makes the task of his work precisely the overcoming of dualism, following the traditions of Russian literature on American ground: taking the efficacious man as a basis, she embodies in her heroes what the Russian romantics aspired to: create the ideal of a whole person who changes himself and the world around him.

AB  - The two Sentinel-2 satellites provide, since March 2017, high-resolution worldwide images every five days, freely distributed, generating terabytes of high-dimensional data. An intuitive manner to summarize the main characteristics of the data and gather knowledge is visual exploratory analysis, which is often based on dimensionality reduction methods to represent high-dimensional data. From previous research and the state-of-the-art literature, turned out that t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding is one of the most appropriate technique to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset, but it requires very high computational power. To overcome this inconvenience, we proposed two hybrid DR algorithms, which combine the DR with the nearest neighbour technique or random forest regression. The main conclusion is that our approaches reduce computational power without compromising the representation quality.

In this paper, we present the architecture of SVMIRE (SVM Image REtrieval with Relevance Feedback) which is a flexible, modular, and fast data mining system based on a relevance feedback approach that increases the performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The proposed system has the capability of storing and reusing the obtained classification model, and results. The functionalities of the SVMIRE system are tested on two datasets: one Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor) and one Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi-Spectral Instrument).

AB  - Wildfires become more frequent in the context of global warming and severe drought in several parts of the globe. Earth observation data can be used to provide information in such cases, but sometimes, when using optical satellite imagery, the evaluation of the effects produced by ongoing large scale forest fires, can be impeded by smoke. It can reduce the accuracy of the information required by disaster management authorities when allocating resources. To improve both the usability of optical remote sensing data and the quality of the obtained information we compare multiple feature extraction, classification, and visual enhancement methods and algorithms for land cover mapping of smoke covered Sentinel-2 data. The demonstration is performed for the 2019 forest fires in Australia.

TI  - Multispectral Data Analysis for Semantic Assessment-A SNAP Framework for Sentinel-2 Use Case Scenarios
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 satellites provide systematic global coverage of land surfaces, measuring physical properties within 13 spectral intervals at a temporal resolution of five days. Computer-based data analysis is highly required to extract similarity by processing and to assist human understanding and semantic annotation in support of mapping Earth's surface. This article proposes a data mining concept that uses advanced data visualization and explainable features to enhance relevant aspects in the Sentinel-2 data and enable semantic analysis. There is a two-stage process. At first, spectral, texture, and physical parameters related features are extracted from the data and included in a learning process that models the data content according to statistical similarities. In parallel, the second processing stage maximizes the data impact on the human visual system to help image understanding and interpretation. Target classes are subject to exploratory visual analysis, such that both visual and latent characteristics are revealed to the user. The concept is further implemented as Sentinel-2 dedicated data analysis (DAS-Tool) plugin for the Sentinel Application Platform and deployed as an open-source tool empowering the Earth observation community with fast and reliable results. Accommodating multiple solutions for each processing phase, the plugin enables flexibility in information extraction and knowledge discovery that will bring the best accuracy in mapping applications. For demonstration purposes, the authors focus on a detailed benchmark against reference data (ground truth) for the Southern region of Romania, then use the selected algorithms in a forest fires scenario analysis for the Sydney region in Australia. The processing involves full-size Sentinel-2 images.

AB  - In this paper we present a novel hypertemporal unsupervised sequential classification algorithm. We illustrate the usefulness of this algorithm at the hand of a case study. For our case study, we consider a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer dataset containing two prominent South Afrcian land cover classes, namely natural vegetation and settlement. For the case study we considered in this paper, the proposed sequential classification approach performed on average 1.33 times better than conventional k-means.

AB  - Nonlinear effects in hyperspectral (HS) remote sensing data, caused by shadows, varying illumination conditions, as well as by directional reflectance variations, may lead to inaccurate land cover classification. Including additional features of a simultaneously collected digital elevation model (DEM) generally improves the results. In this paper, we apply the Nonlinear Feature Normalization (NFN) to a weighted concatenation of HS channels and different sets of features derived from DEMs to improve the classification accuracy. The evaluation is performed on two data sets, where, the labeled data for one of them was derived using an interactive approach based on unsupervised classification. Using sensor data fusion and NFN transformation improved classification accuracy from a Cohens kappa of 0.6 to values over 0.8.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The paper presents an automatic algorithm tackling the problem of ship detection in situations where the ship signature itself is not visible. At this purpose, the algorithm proposed uses a combination of image processing techniques in order to identify ships exclusively by detecting the wakes they leave behind. Once a ship is identified, its position in the image, its heading and its speed are determined. The algorithm was developed and tested on SAR imagery from the European Space Agency (ESA) mission Sentinel-1. Here the algorithm's design and testing results are presented and its performance discussed with regard to the overall ship detection and the wake's components recognition. The algorithm resulted in a correct ship detection in 95% of the cases tested and in a correct recognition of the wakes' components in more than 80% of the cases analysed.

TI  - Field-Validated Burn-Severity Mapping in North Patagonian Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Burn severity, which can be reliably estimated by validated spectral indices, is a key element for understanding ecosystem dynamics and informing management strategies. However, in North Patagonian forests, where wildfires are a major disturbance agent, studies aimed at the field validation of spectral indices of burn severity are scarce. The aim of this work was to develop a field validated methodology for burn-severity mapping by studying two large fires that burned in the summer of 2013-2014 in forests of Araucaria araucana and other tree species. We explored the relation between widely used spectral indices and a field burn-severity index, and we evaluated index performance by examining index sensitivity in discriminating burn-severity classes in different vegetation types. For those indices that proved to be suitable, we adjusted the class thresholds and constructed confusion matrices to assess their accuracy. Burn severity maps of the studied fires were generated using the two most accurate methods and were compared to evaluate their level of agreement. Our results confirm that reliable burn severity estimates can be derived from spectral indices for these forests. Two severity indices, the delta normalized burn ratio (dNBR) and delta normalized difference vegetation index (dNDVI), were highly related to the fire-induced changes observed in the field, but the strength of these associations varied across the five different vegetation types defined by tree heights and tree and tall shrub species regeneration strategies. The thresholds proposed in this study for these indices generated classifications with global accuracies of 82% and Kappa indices of 70%. Both the dNBR and dNDVI classification approaches were more accurate in detecting high severity, but to a lesser degree for detecting low severity burns. Moderate severity was poorly classified, with producer and user errors reaching 50%. These constraints, along with detected differences in separability, need to be considered when interpreting burn severity maps generated using these methods.

TI  - Improving Land Cover Change Detection and Classification With BRDF Correction and Spatial Feature Extraction Using Landsat Time Series: A Case of Urbanization in Tianjin, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the important coastal cities in China, Tianjin has been urbanized dramatically over the past 40 years, and the urbanization rate has been up to 83.15% by 2018. In this study, we used the continuous change detection and classification algorithm to comprehensively understand the urban expansion processes in Tianjin based on the Landsat time series from 1985 to 2018 with 30-m resolution. Specially, we applied the c-factor approach with the Ross Thick-LiSparse-R model to correct the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effect for each Landsat image and calculated a spatial line density feature for improving the change detection and the classification. Based on the study in Tianjin, we found that BRDF correction can substantially improve the change detection (9.00% higher overall accuracy) and classification (1.08% higher overall accuracy); and the line density is also beneficial to classification (0.48% higher overall accuracy), especially for impervious surface (1.70% less commission errors and 1.49 % less omission errors). By analyzing the imperious surface change processes, we observed that Tianjin has undergone rapid urban expansion in the past decades, and the urban area was mainly transformed from cropland around the central area before 2005 and later from the coast.

AB  - Optical remote sensing satellite usually adopts the method of photographing calibration field to achieve calibration of internal and external orientation elements of optical camera. However, as time goes on, or as the latitude changes, the accuracy of satellite positioning after calibration will decline. The traditional calibration method requires satellite passes calibration field and is difficult to achieve globally, so it's hard to be realized that keeping the global positioning accuracy high. The purpose of this study is to explore a more feasibility calibration method of interior orientation elements in optical satellites. That is, by photographing stars, the stars are used as control points to calibrate the camera's internal orientation elements. In this study, a camera calibration method based on multi-frame star map was proposed. The star maps were captured by the star camera of Ziyuan-3 02 (ZY-3 02). Final result proved to be efficient to offer sufficient information for interior orientation elements calibration purpose.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th International Conference on eDemocracy and eGovernment (ICEDEG)
CL  - Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA
AB  - In recent years, the estimation of biomass through the combination of field and remote sensing data has been gaining ground in several countries, as it becomes an option that reduces costs in addition to obtaining information in inaccessible areas. Despite the large amount of accessible spatial information, the subject of biomass estimation by remote sensing, especially radar remains a new and interesting topic in the application of forestry studies. We have used radar images and UAV in order to analyze the estimation of biomass. The study area has been performed in the Metropolitan Park "La Armenia" of Quito, central Ecuador, in which 13 plots have been established (1ha). The Forest Aboveground Biomass (FAB) has been estimated and therefore also its fixation of aerial carbon. The applied methodology included to develop the semi-empirical algorithms proposed for the estimation of biomass, in order to correlate the field data including estimation by allometry, with the digital levels of the radar image. Thus, we reached a coefficient of determination of 0.74, which provided a clear relationship between field data and the backscatter coefficients. Within the methodology used with the UAV, in the estimation of FAB by CMS (model 2) it has been adjusted to a logarithmic regression with a coefficient of determination r(2) = 0.67, while the obtaining of model 3 by green normalized vegetation index (GNDVI) has been adjusted to a quadratic regression, with a coefficient of determination r(2) = 0.57. The adjustment of the three models has been defined as a goodness of positive adjustment, concluding that model 1 is the better one. However, it has been necessary to indicate that model 1 does not conform to reality, since there is a great difference between the dates of taking the radar image versus the data acquired in the field. Therefore, model 2 represents reality better, since it has been able to best characterize abrupt changes in the tree height variable, due to anthropic or natural factors, such as felling, burning, lightning in the tree, among others, that model 3 lacked to perform. The estimation of biomass and carbon fixation based on direct observations of the territory through remote sensing techniques, may provide more reliable information for decision making in the development of policies related to sustainable forest management.

TI  - THE ROLE OF LANGUAGE IN REALIST TRADITION OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
T2  - POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY OF POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of language in political realism has been studied rather poorly. Moreover, in general researchers rarely pose such a question. Although there has recently been a tendency to revise the prevailing stereotypes that reduce realism to naive materialistic ontology, primitive correspondent epistemology and ethical cynicism, there are still few works aimed at analyzing the linguistic dimension of realism. Moreover, even in those works where this issue is touched upon, no attempts are made to identify certain general trends of this direction in the theory of international relations. Meanwhile, without taking into account this dimension and its historical modifications, it is hardly possible to fully comprehend this centuries-old tradition of political thought.To fill the gap, the authors turn to the analysis of the views of a number of major theorists of the realist school - from Thucydides and T.Hobbes to classical realists, neo-realists and neoclassical realists. Their research shows that language plays a significant (although not always clearly defined) role in realism, and it can be considered not only as a political tool, but also as the foundation of a specific community's worldview or as the footing of a scientific model. At the same time, the realist approach to language is not without its flaws that make it vulnerable to criticism. This is primarily about its inattention to the constructive relationships of linguo-political communities and the correlation between different scientific models or even the absolutization of their incommensurability. According to the authors, realism's inherent focus on pluralism and conflicts has linguistic reasons as well.

TI  - Features of plot building of the lyrical cycles of travels in Russian poetry of Mordovia of the late XX - early XXI centuries
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the article is devoted to the study of genre and aspect specifics of the travel lyric cycle as a major genre form in modern Russian poetry of Mordovia and it fits into the complex of research of Russian literary studies concerning the problem of genre synthesis. The subjects of the analysis are the features of plot building of the lyrical cycles of travels.Objective: to reveal the genre and problem-thematic originality of the lyrical cycles of travels in the works of modern poets of Mordovia.Research materials: cycles of travels of V. Gadaev, V. Yushkin, K. Smorodin.Results and novelty of the research: in modern Russian poetry of Mordovia large genre forms as the most flexible actively develop. Among them, a special place is occupied by lyrical cycles with diverse thematic lines. In this context, travel cycles that synthesize the features of genre forms of the cycle and travelogue are quite remarkable. The complex compositional structure marked by the presence of a real geographical route, the image of a traveler comprehending the cultural and historical atmosphere of the visited country / city, reflects the author's worldview, historiosophy, and the idea of the world space. In the works of V. Gadaev, V. Yushkin and K. Smorodin such cyclic forms carry out various creative objectives. For V. Gadaev, trip brings the opportunity to rethink the tragic moments of history, to understand the state of a person who is far from his homeland. The plot-forming beginning of his works is the opposition "native - alien", where the image of the Mordovian region turns out to be the semantic artistic center. In V. Yushkin's lyrical cycles, the traveler's route is connected with the comprehension of semantic codes of geographical space, contact with important cultural and literary places. In the K. Smorodin's center of attention is an image of a lyrical hero-traveler who is under the impression of the surrounding world's beauty. The motif of travel in the works of Russian poets of Mordovia is largely enriched by landscape and philosophical, love motifs, which indicates the synthetic nature of this genre-specific form. The scientific novelty of the work is connected with the fact that it represents the first experience of the comprehensive study of the features of the lyric cycle of travels in Russian poetry of Mordovia.

T2  - JOKULL
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe the changes of the Kviskerjajoklar outlet glaciers in SE Iceland (presently ranging 600-1600 in a.s.l.), from their Little Ice Age maximum (LIA(max)) to the present. We assume that glacier extent of the late 19th century approximately describes LIA(max) although the glaciers already reached their peak extent in the 18th century. The former glacier margins were delineated from moraines, historical descriptions, topographical maps, aerial and oblique photographs, Landsat images and a lidar DEM. Along the previous glacier margins, elevation differences with respect to the lidar DEM of 2011 were estimated and contour maps of the glacier drawn at selected dates, maintaining the shape of the glacier surface as available maps. During the period similar to 1890 to 2011, the outlets lost -0.4 in a(-1) water equivalent evenly distributed over their surface and their area was reduced by 37% (from similar to 10 km(2) to 6.4 km(2), 0.03 km(2) a(-1), 0.43 km(3) water equivalent in total, i.e. 0.003 km(3) we. a(-1)).

TI  - TOWARD A MULTIDISCIPLINARY STRATEGY FOR THE CLASSIFICATION AND REUSE OF IRON AND MANGANESE MINING WASTES
T2  - CHEMISTRY JOURNAL OF MOLDOVA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining and mineral-processing wastes have been giving a lot of concern in recent times. This paper has evaluated an integrated multidisciplinary strategy for mining wastes characterization, their possible recycling and reuse, and critical raw materials recovery. After the in situ sampling campaigns, mining wastes have been characterized and the acquired mineralogical, chemical and spectral information have been used to create a map of mining waste deposits by means of the new multispectral satellite Sentinel-2A classification. The use of Fe-Mn rich wastes in arsenic removal and phosphorus recovery from water was discussed. Furthermore, mycorrhizal-assisted phytoextraction of metals from contaminated soils classified as Class 1 to 4 by remote sensing showed a good potential for their possible recovery from biomass, and results indicated that the system was suitable for the uptake of several elements. Results are encouraging and the application of such approach can be important to develop a circular model for sustainable exploitation of mining wastes.

AB  - The present study focuses on the estimating land surface temperature (LST) of Raipur City in India emphasizing the urban heat island (UHI) and non-UHI inside the city boundary and their relationship with normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, normalized difference built-up index, and normalized multi-band drought index. The entire study has been performed on four multi-date Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor images taken from four different seasons; pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter in the same year. The UHI has mainly been developed along the northern and southern periphery of the city. The range of LST in the common UHI for four different seasons varies between 25.72 degrees C and 35.69 degrees C. The results present the strongest correlation between LST and the land use/land cover indices in monsoon and post-monsoon images while winter and pre-monsoon images show a comparatively weak correlation.

TI  - An investigation on seasonal variability between LST and NDWI in an urban environment using Landsat satellite data
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban landscape is considered the most complex and heterogeneous landscape among the different land surface features. It rises the land surface temperature (LST) to a large extent compared to the surrounding rural body. This investigation deals with the seasonal variability between LST and normalized difference water index (NDWI) on the different land surfaces in Raipur, India by using sixty-four Landsat images from 1991-92 to 2018-19. The results show that the post-monsoon season indicates the best correlation (0.42) between LST and NDWI, followed by the monsoon (0.34), pre-monsoon (0.25) and winter (0.04). The water bodies reflect a moderate negative correlation of LST-NDWI in all the four seasons (-0.49 in pre-monsoon, -0.33 in monsoon, -0.31 in post-monsoon and -0.45 in winter). On green vegetation, this LST-NDWI correlation is strongly positive in pre-monsoon (0.67) season, moderate positive in monsoon (0.43) and post-monsoon (0.50) seasons, and weak negative in winter (0.25) season. The built-up area and bare lands build a weak positive correlation of LST-NDWI in all the four seasons (0.24 in pre-monsoon, 0.21 in monsoon, 0.27 in post-monsoon and 0.15 in winter). This study can be beneficial for land use planning and management of any city under a similar physical environment.

TI  - Eigenvalue Statistical Components-Based PU-Learning for PolSAR Built-Up Areas Extraction and Cross-Domain Analysis
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) provides important support for the built-up areas (BA) information analysis, due to the ability of weather-independent imaging and sensitivity to targets scattering and geometric characteristics. However, PolSAR BA with large orientation angles is usually misdetected as vegetation, and labeled BA samples with special orientations are difficult to obtain. Furthermore, the labeled BA samples and trained models can hardly work well in the cross-domain PolSAR imagery BA analysis. This article presents a PolSAR BA extraction method based on eigenvalue statistical components (ESC) and PU-Learning (PUL), and it helps to realize cross-domain BA extraction by combining subspace alignment (SA). First, the roll invariance of coherency-matrix eigenvalues and building orientation effects are analyzed. Then, by adopting the eigenvalue-Wishart unsupervised classification, regional statistical information and rotation-invariant property are comprehensively utilized in ESC. Finally, the BA can be extracted by combining a PUL classifier with only positive samples at the same distinguishable orientation. Combined with SA, the novel ESC-PUL-SA domain adaptation facilitates a robust unsupervised cross-domain PolSAR BA analysis, reducing the differences caused by sensors and imaging scenes. The ESC-PUL BA extraction on seven PolSAR imageries showed that the accuracies reach 92%-98% with only a few positive samples (less than 0.65%). The ESC-PUL-SA performance was further validated by 14 unsupervised cross-domain BA analysis units among 10 datasets, including Radarsat-2, Gaofen-3, AirSAR, and UAVSAR images. With randomly selected positive samples from the source domain, the proposed ESC-PUL-SA achieved accuracies of all cross-domain BA extraction range from 89.64% to 95.53%.

AB  - In the event of an accidental oil spillage from buried pipelines, the leakage may be detected fairly late, sometimes months after it started, with economic and environmental impacts that are difficult to recover. An early detection is desirable but difficult to achieve when the pipelines are buried, hidden by thick vegetation or in quite isolated areas. If the extent of buried pipelines network is also considered the problem may appear cumbersome.Satellites may support an early detection and, a feasibility study proving so, is described in this paper. A controlled spillage exercise has been organized in the UK and satellite data acquisitions tasked. Synthetic Aperture Radar datasets have been acquired over the site, before and after the controlled spillage, in three different tests with different quantities of red diesel spilled. The design of the whole exercise is described in the paper in addition to the SAR data processing. Preliminary results show that a significant change in the mean backscattering coefficient (a decrease of about 1 dB) is appreciated in X-band SAR data when the volume of oil, spilled or poured, reaches values in the order of 160 gallons.

TI  - Emerging patterns in global and regional aerosol characteristics: A study based on satellite remote sensors
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the global distribution pattern of aerosol particles is of paramount importance as it has applications of many fields that include, but are not limited to energy and environment, the study of aerosol particles is building blocks for nanotechnology. Therefore, the keen observation of aerosols through satellite remote sensors namely: MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) is important. The newly launched MODIS collection 6.1 (C061) aerosol product are containing three different aerosol inversion algorithms such as the Dark Target (DT) algorithm for land, the DT algorithm for the ocean, and the Deep Blue (DB) algorithm for land. In this study, we have used a combined aerosol product based on DT and DB to present emerging patterns in global and regional aerosol characteristics over short-term (2001-2007) and long-term (2001-2018) observation periods. The CALIOP, a Lidar instrument on aboard of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite which presents the 3-dimensional view of aerosol climatology, is also used during special cases to investigate the aerosol distribution patterns. Based on MODIS observations the aerosol distribution patterns show strong seasonal differences. The seasonal characteristics vary with latitude and longitude across the globe. The regional characteristics clearly showed their region-specific behavior. Interestingly, MODIS observations captured high concentrations over the regions traced in the developing countries particularly South and East Asia, where observations show strong seasonality. The averaged MODIS AOD trend over global is found slightly negative. On regional scales, positive trends found over the Arabian Peninsula, Africa (Sahel), Eastern China, Northern part of India. These regions are next to major monsoon regions. The increasing concentration of aerosols over these regions may modulate the monsoon rainfall distribution pattern. In contrast, the negative trend observed over Eastern America, Europe, the southeast part of Africa as well as in the associated dust outflow over the North Atlantic.

M3  - Article
AB  - Systemic changes in the organization are inconceivable without an analytical understanding of the diagnosis of organizational culture. An analysis of changes in the configuration of organizational culture, which allows us to track the actual transformation of universities, is a competitive advantage not only in Russia but also in the international educational space. To work on organizational culture - ("an integral set of worldview axioms common to most organization employees, values, signs, interconnected and hierarchically structured" (E. Shane)) during the period of change is important as it allows us to treat to the declared changes consciously and to remind about history, culture, values and positive image of the future.For a comprehensive diagnosing of two universities of the Russian Federation at the stage of completion of the "5-100 program" (Tyumen State University and Tomsk State University), in all three groups of the university community (administration, faculty and students), the author used the following methods: 1) quantitative survey and building a framework for competing values (OCAI) according to C. Cameron and R. Quinn (n 180); 2) the method of self-diagnosis of A. I. Prigogine "Metaphor" presenting image data of the university (n = 180); 3) a semi-structured interview with leaders of the university community. The main task is to identify the unique configuration of culture, its "gaps", potential and dynamics options (recommendations) of changes under the influence of competing values. At the end of the study the author proposes recommendations for the improvement of managerial conditions.

AB  - Ground monitoring of soil massifs takes a lot of time, labor force and material resources, yet is the most accurate and detailed method. When implementing complex methods for monitoring the soil cover, inclusion of space technologies is necessary. Remote sensing data carry objective information over large areas, obtained in various spectral ranges. The article discusses the possibility of using remote sensing data for mapping and monitoring changes in the soil cover of Northern Kazakhstan. Based on thematic processing of remote sensing data of domestic satellites, spatial analysis of the content of main nutrients was executed in the sowing layer of soils, the relationship was revealed between fertility indicators and the value of vegetation indices for testing ground on the territory of Northern Kazakhstan.

AB  - Humanity is associated with the environment throughout all stages of mankind evolution. Ongoing processes occurring with forest resources are being investigated on the territory of Kazakhstan. In order to quickly obtain information on the state of forests, it is necessary to organize a multi-level monitoring system based on integration of ground-based data and remote observations using innovative capabilities of geographic information technologies. This article discusses issues related to the semi-automatic thematic processing of forest resources of the Republic of Kazakhstan based on GIS using Earth remote sensing data. In order to increase productivity the model has been created in the specialized ArcGIS software. Using the satellite remote sensing data set, the model enables semi-automatic processing for detection of forest areas that have undergone changes, in particular, forest logging, burned areas, etc. The studies were carried out on a scientific basis using image analysis methods, spatial data analysis of remote sensing, the latest achievements in the field of modern GIS technologies.

AB  - Remote sensing imagery in LAPAN has been managed and distributed through many media and device, like CCT, DCRSy, tape, CD, DVD, hard drive. The format is available from Quicklook data (in JPG or BMP), data RAW (in Gtiff or ground station data format). There also exist metadata that bring along in each remote sensing data like Landsat data, SPOT, Radar data, and High-resolution data. From that all collection then it would need some system that can arrange, keep and distribute data in a huge amount of number. Research on metadata structure and standard will be required in managing a large number of remote sensing data. Types and formats from those remote sensing data will be various but the raster format which most widely used is GeoTiff. Metadata for every raster data format is already standardized following the rule of ISO 19139 and 19115. SPACeMAP is a new web catalog system that uses the simplest and latest raster data format for displaying the mosaic image, data processing result, data raw format and etc. The structure of raster data format (like Gtiff and ECW) is very flexible although the format needs certain criteria. Metadata also treated the same as raster format, this treatment hopefully will minimize the error.

AB  - Acquisition of satellites images programming become an important issue in LAPAN, due to inaccuracy in acquiring image location. Clouds and smokes cause the low quality of the image and also different time acquisition could make a different synoptic view between different sensor. Some integration of three kinds of sensor has to be created for achieving good location with a high quality image. The other reason why the integration needed that because there is still no research about it. This research aim is to get the best acquisition plan by using three different sensors mechanism like SPOT 6/7, Pleiades and Terra SAR-X. This integration also helps Indonesia government in achieving Government National Program.

TI  - Detection model of soil salinization information in the Yellow River Delta based on feature space models with typical surface parameters derived from Landsat8 OLI image
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow River Delta, with the most typical new wetland system in warm temperate zone of China, is suffering from increasingly serious salinization. The purpose of this study is to utilize five typical surface parameters, including Albedo (the surface Albedo), NDVI (vegetation index), SI (salinity index),WI (humidity index), and (Iron oxide index), to construct 10 different feature spaces and, then, propose two different kinds of monitoring models (point-to-point model and point to line model) of soil salinization. The results showed that the inversion accuracy of the feature space detection index based on the point-to-point model was the highest with R-2=0.86. However, the inversion accuracy of Albedo-NDVI feature space detection index based on the point-to-point model is the lowest with R-2=0.72. This is due to the fact that NDVI is not sensitive enough to indicate the status of vegetation grown in the region with low (disturbance of soil background) and high (influenced by the saturation effect) vegetation coverage. The chemical weathering is also a primary cause of soil salinization, during which Fe2O3 is formed by the reaction of oxygen present in the atmosphere with primary Fe2+ minerals in the soil .Therefore, the feature space detection index based on the point-to-point model has a stronger applicability to monitor the information of soil salinization in the Yellow River Delta. This above point-to-point detection model can be utilized as a better approach to provide data and decision support for the development of agriculture, construction of reservoirs, and protection of natural ecological system in the Yellow River Delta.

TI  - An Optimal Monitoring Model of Desertification in Naiman Banner Based on Feature Space Utilizing Landsat8 OLI Image
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Current feature space models of desertification were almost linear, which ignored the complicated and non-linear relationships among variables for monitoring desertification. Fully considering the influencing factors of the desertification process in Naiman Banner, four sensitive indices including MSAVI, NDVI, TGSI, and Albedo have been selected to construct five feature spaces. Then, the precisions of different feature space models for monitoring desertification information (including non-linear and linear models) have been compared and analyzed. The non-linear Albedo-MSAVI feature space model for Naiman Banner has higher efficiency with the overall precision of 90.1%, while that of Albedo-TGSI had the worst precision with 0.69. Overall, the feature space model (non-linear) of Albedo-MSAVI has the highest applicability for monitoring the desertification information in Naiman Banner.

TI  - Soil Salizanation Information in the Yellow River Delta Based on Feature Surface Models Using Landsat 8 OLI Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS

AB  - Soil salinization as one of the major eco-environmental problems, has greatly restricted the regional development of Yellow River Delta. In this paper, five parameters that derived from Landsat images, including MSAVI, Albedo, SI, I-FE2O3, and WI have been utilized to establish ten feature spaces, and four categories of salinization detection model have been proposed. After analysis and comparison of inversion accuracy, the three typical surface parameters, including SI (R-2 = 0.85) I-FE2O3, (R-2 = 0.83) and WI (R2 = 0.83) are better indices to retrieve the salinization information and the WI-SI point to line (soil line) model (R-2 = 0.88) the Albedo-SI Point to line (Wet line) Model (R-2 = 0.87) and the Albedo-I-FE2O3, point to point model (R-2 = 0.86) have better applicability to monitor the salinization condition in the Yellow River Delta. The research results can provide technical method reference for salinization monitoring of other regions.

TI  - Responses of water use efficiency to phenology in typical subtropical forest ecosystems-A case study in Zhejiang Province
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem-scale water-use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator for understanding the intimately coupled relationship between carbon and water cycles in ecosystems. Previous studies have suggested that both abiotic and biotic factors have significant effects on WUE in forest ecosystems. However, responses of WUE to phenology in the context of climate change remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the sensitivity and response patterns of seasonal WUE to phenology in Zhejiang Province where typical subtropical forest ecosystems are located, and discussed potential causes of the changes of the sensitivity and response patterns along different climate gradient during 2000-2014. The results of interannual partial correlation analysis showed widespread negative correlations between WUE and the start of growing season (SOS) in spring. This is because the increase in gross primary product (GPP) is larger than that of evapotranspiration (ET), resulting from an advanced SOS. The positive correlation between WUE and SOS was widely observed in summer mainly because of water stress and plant ecological strategy. The autumn WUE enhanced with the delay in the end of growing season (EOS) mainly because of the increase in GPP meanwhile the decrease or steadiness in ET, resulting from a delayed EOS. In space, the sensitivity of spring WUE to SOS significantly decreased along the radiation gradient, which might be related to strong soil evaporation in high radiation area; the sensitivity of WUE to SOS in summer showed a positive correlation with precipitation and a negative correlation with temperature, respectively, which might be attributed to the compensation of GPP to the delayed SOS and water stress caused by high temperature. The sensitivity of WUE to EOS increased significantly along the radiation and precipitation gradients in autumn, which may be because the increase of radiation and precipitation provides more water and energy for photosynthesis.

TI  - Feature Dimension Reduction Using Stacked Sparse Auto-Encoders for Crop Classification with Multi-Temporal, Quad-Pol SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop classification in agriculture is one of important applications for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data. For agricultural crop discrimination, compared with single-temporal data, multi-temporal data can dramatically increase crop classification accuracies since the same crop shows different external phenomena as it grows up. In practice, the utilization of multi-temporal data encounters a serious problem known as a "dimension disaster". Aiming to solve this problem and raise the classification accuracy, this study developed a feature dimension reduction method using stacked sparse auto-encoders (S-SAEs) for crop classification. First, various incoherent scattering decomposition algorithms were employed to extract a variety of detailed and quantitative parameters from multi-temporal PolSAR data. Second, based on analyzing the configuration and main parameters for constructing an S-SAE, a three-hidden-layer S-SAE network was built to reduce the dimensionality and extract effective features to manage the "dimension disaster" caused by excessive scattering parameters, especially for multi-temporal, quad-pol SAR images. Third, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was constructed and employed to further enhance the crop classification performance. Finally, the performances of the proposed strategy were assessed with the simulated multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data for two experimental sites established by the European Space Agency (ESA). The experimental results showed that the overall accuracy with the proposed method was raised by at least 17% compared with the long short-term memory (LSTM) method in the case of a 1% training ratio. Meanwhile, for a CNN classifier, the overall accuracy was almost 4% higher than those of the principle component analysis (PCA) and locally linear embedded (LLE) methods. The comparison studies clearly demonstrated the advantage of the proposed multi-temporal crop classification methodology in terms of classification accuracy, even with small training ratios.

AB  - A series reflectance models for snow have been developed in recent years, but there is no trusted pure snow database to test the models yet. The Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) BRDF data have been widely used in quantitative remote sensing community, but the recent research has revealed that an obvious wrong classification has occurred in snow POLDER BRDF database. In this study, we propose a snow index (SI) to characterize the scattering feature of snow based on RTLSRS model and develop an effective method to identify the pure snow data in POLDER database. Finally, we build a snow database with higher purity, providing a data support for model validation in the future.

AB  - The traditional strategic thinking is based on mechanical worldview, which believed that as long as sufficient information is available, a formula can be used to predict the future development of the enterprise. However, in the era of big data, social development is involved with rapid-changed information and make mechanical thought invalid. By analyzing Taoist philosophy, this paper argues that tolerating the uncertainty is also a way to achieve the strategy, since an ambiguous strategy would be more appropriate in nowadays. Besides, finding the way in Taoism will provide a philosophical foundation for strategic management in the future.

AB  - With the continuous acceleration of urbanization, the construction land around Dianchi Lake has been expanded, which may result in serious surface deformation and produce adverse environmental impacts. To explore the influence of city expansion on ground subsidence in Kunming, in this paper, we used the SBAS-InSAR technique to invert the time series deformation velocity of Kunming by sentinel-1A datasets acquired from October 2018 to October 2019. The results showed that an average subsidence velocity up to -30mm/year at the north bank of Dianchi Lake. The deformation velocities extracted from descending and ascending datasets show similar results with R-2 equaling to 0.9677. The results showed the potentiality of SBAS-InSAR technology and provides a more effective monitoring method for surface subsidence in mountain areas.

TI  - Urban Impervious Surface Extraction Based on Multi-Features and Random Forest
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface data has become an indicator of the degree of urbanization and the environmental quality, which inspires the widely use of remote sensing technology in extracting impervious surface. In order to reduce the confusion between impervious surface and other landcover types, this paper proposed an effective urban impervious surface extraction method based on multi-features and Random Forest (RF). First, Sentinel-2 multispectral data and Luojia 1-01 images are employed to extracted multi-features, including spectral features, texture features and temporal features. Then, a feature selection method with null importance is proposed to remove irrelevant features. Finally, Probabilistic Label Relaxation (PLR) is introduced into RF to obtain the classification results and impervious surface. The main urban areas of Zhengzhou and Hangzhou are selected as study areas. The experiment results show that the integration of the multi-features can significantly improve the overall accuracy of classification and the extraction accuracy of impervious surface. And the classification accuracy can be further improved after the feature selection with null importance. Besides, the PLR method can effectively reduce the salt-and-pepper phenomenon of classification results using random forest, which presupposes the optimal number of iterations. The method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the estimation of impervious surface and provide an important reference for the extraction of impervious surface based on pixel level.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Green Chemical and Environmental Science (ICGCES)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - High-resolution remote sensing data play a very important role in agriculture. However, the major sources of high-resolution images are not owned by China. The Chinese "High Resolution Earth Observation Systems" was deployed in 2010, and several major projects have been implemented. The present study focused on assessing the feasibility of Gaofen (GF) multi-spectral data for monitoring bare soil organic carbon (SOC) at field and regional scales. The data sources are hyperspectra measured under laboratory conditions and simulated multi-spectral data from GF-1 remote sensing images. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to estimate SOC. At the field scale, the SOC hyperspectral prediction model produced better R-2=0.9688, RMSE=0.3818, and RPD=5.6393 than the simulated multi-spectral SOC prediction model (R-2=0.8179, RMSE=0.9913, RPD=2.3401). At a regional scale, the SOC hyperspectral prediction model also produced a better R-2=0.9319, RMSE=1.097, and RPD=3.8758 than the simulated multi-spectral SOC predicted model (R-2=0.8445, RMSE=1.6574, RPD=2.4228). For the simulated GF-1 multi-spectra model, regional scale predications had advantages over field scale predictions. The spatial distribution characteristics of SOC measurements and predictions from hyperspectral data and simulated GF-1 multi-spectral data were similar. Thus, satisfactory performance of the predictive and calibrated models validates the feasibility of these methods for rapid large-scale SOC monitoring.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & OPTIMIZATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last few decades, Renewable energy has received remarkable attention. This is partially because fossil fuels are depleting and the necessity for energy is rising because of the increasing population of the world. Among renewable sources of energy, solar energy is one such type that is becoming increasingly popular because it is inexhaustible, clean, and reliable. Solar radiation is obtained as heat and light that can be converted by solar thermal power generation into valuable thermal energy or electricity generation. With regard to efficiency and financial viability, the availability of trusted data on solar radiation is crucial to forecast the performance of solar power plants at different places in the country. This paper describes a general integrated structure for assessing land suitability for ideal positioning of photovoltaic solar energy panels based on a variety of geographic information system (GIS), remote sensing methods. The Location Viability Assessment, i.e. the areas appropriate for harvesting Solar Energy, is measured based on Global, Diffuse, Direct Solar Radiation Data that estimates the potential of the Solar Power Generation sites. Two interrelated steps were implemented in this study. First, Remote Sensing was used, including LANDSAT 8 satellite data, to extract the study area's land use/land cover map. Second, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used to model the research zone map of aspect angles and slope maps. These results indicate the potential sites for Solar Power Generation.

TI  - Self-discipline Practices in a Transitive Society: Stoic Renaissance and Scandinavization of Consumption
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY-JOURNAL OF THE HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The transdisciplinary approach is a methodology and practice that connects various aspects of research about a person and the transformations of his lifeworld. The transdisciplinary approach serves as a conceptual framework for the analysis of small cultural movements in which transformations of the subjectivity and lifestyles of contemporary human occur. The renaissance of the philosophy and practice of stoicism is discussed. It is proved that stoicism, neo-stoicism and the new (modern) stoicism are a constructive response to the crises of transitive society. Small cultural movements in transitive society become initiators of latent changes, creators of new values and normative models. As an example of such movements, stoicism and neo-stoicism are considered from the perspective of the subject's self-development and self-discipline practices which arose initially in the Hellenistic era and then revived in Dutch society of the 17th century. Focusing on the awareness and integrity of life, overcoming the fragmentation of worldview, the demand for justice, moral duty, self-creation and subjectivity in transitive society explain the relevance of the philosophical teachings of the Stoics today. Stoicism is characterized by practical effectiveness, helps to build meaningful life guidelines, helps harmonize the individual and social in a person, harmonizes personal and planetary identities. It is hypothesized that the current "scandinavianization" of consumption is a kind of cultural movement of the new Stoicism. It is argued that the trends of global changes that have become the focus of various sciences (from economics to philosophy) require reflection, firstly, from the side of psychology, and secondly, within the conceptual framework of the transdisciplinary approach. The first perspective allows us to focus precisely on changes in human subjectivity (missed by those sciences that observe transformations on the scale of institutions and structures), the second comprehends the ongoing processes from the perspective of the integrity and inclusion of these phenomena in their network and contextual relationships.

T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - In the bygone epoch, when Marxism-Leninism was considered "the only true" philosophical doctrine, the key philosophical question was what is prime: matter or consciousness? Nowadays it is often declared that no "key question" has ever existed; it being far-fetched, an ideological Soviet cliche or hopelessly obsolete at best. Whether it is so? Whether the philosophical question about the nature of the substance and ontological status of the transcendent reality and the correlation of the material and the ideal both in the world and in human life is obsolete? Whether the fundamental anthropological issue of psycho-physical dualism is obsolete? Finally whether the dispute between believers and atheists is obsolete? These are rhetoric questions. All the mentioned above never gets obsolete constantly forming sense-directing "poles" between which broadly speaking all the human spiritual culture is spreading around. The article attempts to demonstrate that the dispute between two main worldview answers to "the key philosophical question" i.e. materialism and idealism is tightly connected with ever-topical discussion between the representatives of atheism and theism, evolutionism and creationism, scientism and antiscientism, determinism and indeterminism, anthropological reductionism and antireductionism or existentialism, the proponents of life coming down to "panem et circenses" and their opponents. Finally all this variety of worldview oppositions leads to the issue of existence or non-existence of transcendent reality beside directly available material or natural world.

AB  - A modern media discourse of the XXIst century must be considered as the basis of human life in the era of digitalization of culture. The media discourse of the third millennium is a basic social institution that sets the vector for the development of social and individual consciousness, which determines the human mindset and behaviour. "Any social phenomena are determined by media discourse practices" [1]. This wide range of media discourse features is possible, due to individual and public consciousness, which is actively involved in building a media discourse, sharing media content and actively interacting in the media discourse space. The participants of the media discourse (or the media actors) set various psychological attitudes in their information exchange that contribute to the dissemination and popularization of certain ideas, opinions, events that can have a strong psychological impact on people at the local and global levels.Attitude is a willingness, a predisposition to perceive, understand, comprehend an object or act with it in a certain way, formed in experience [2]. A media discourse created in the media space with the right psychological attitude and a formulated goal, oriented to the selected audience of recipients, can have a strong impact on the cognitive, affective and behavioural spheres of the individual's consciousness of the information message.The purpose of this research is to analyze the phenomenon of the psychological attitude and how it may affect the development of human consciousness and, in particular, the young people's consciousness and their worldview. We focus on studying this specific age group because we hypothesize that the youth is the most sensitive towards the media discourse exposure and different psychological attitudes may be perceived by young individuals especially sharply.To estimate the working hypothesis several surveys were developed and conducted. We interviewed Russian university students aged 19 - 24 to analyze the correlation between their interaction with the new media discourse and various psychological attitudes perceived on different events, people and news. Factor analysis helped us to understand the inner reasons why young people may respond to a certain piece of information in the media discourse and completely ignore another one.Finally, conclusions were made about the importance to continue studying the problem of psychological attitudes in the present-day media discourse because it may help to tackle such social issues as teenagers' suicide, colour revolutions and rebellions across the world, terrorists' attacks and other important questions related to the life in the digital society of the XXIst century.

AB  - The article covers the problem of ecological neologisms which mostly appear in the present-day media discourse space and actively function there by making a significant impact on people's environmental worldview. Moreover, the research also raises the problem of neologisms as an effective educational instrument for raising human ecological awareness. A comparative analysis of the most popular neologisms circulated in the Russian, British and American media discourse space is introduced in the study. Finally, it is suggested that green neology in its close correlation with media ecology provide a foundation for building and developing a new ecosystemic society with more sustainable ideology towards the future of the planet.

AB  - The Community Satellite Processing Package (CSPP) is developed by the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS) at the Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC) at the University of Wisconsin to support Direct Broadcast (DB) communities in processing various remote sensing satellite data. Currently, there are eleven satellites and 25 instruments supported by fifteen CSPP packages. Some packages have dependency with another package when an output of a package become an input to another package. However, there is no document that describes relationships among input and output data of the packages. Each package is only accompanied by its installation instruction and user manual. Thus, a main document describing interdependency of the packages is required. This paper can act as the main document because it describes the current development of the CSPP packages and their interdependency among one another. Information was gathered through installation, user manual and literature (proceedings and journal articles) reviews. The results are illustrated in term of intuitive diagrams that are not available in the current instructions or manuals. Thus, the main document that is described in this paper can be utilized to identify gaps that should be taken into considerations when developing the existing system in the future.

AB  - Key parameters of the earth's surface through the exchange of energy and water with air are called the Land Surface Temperature (LST). This phenomenon is important to be monitored since LST can affect the global climate.LST is one of the parameters of energy balance on the surface by using the band 10, 5, and 4, resulting in the vegetation index (VI) green level parameter. It is done through satellite image analysis to calculate semi-emissivity using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) algorithm because NDVI is more sensitive to chlorophyll based on the contraction between the maximum absorption of chlorophyll, red wavelength, and maximum reflectance, infrared caused by leaf cell structure. So that the effect of the atmosphere does not have a major effect on chlorophyll scattering, the NDVI algorithm is combined with the value of the soil emissivity sensor to identify the Land Surface Temperature. The sampling method of LST is conducted by Taro Yamane on March 24, 2019 aimed to find the distribution of sample points to be carried out in the field regarding the results of the identification of LST Landsat 8 image data.Based on the LST Landsat 8 image in Batam Island on March 24, 2019, there were 6 populations spread over 36 sample points with the highest temperature of 33.49 degrees C, the lowest temperature of 18.23 degrees C and the average temperature of 28.62 degrees C. We found the correlation coefficient of 0.36263 for the relationship between identification of LST Landsat 8 images and the ground-measured LST as a validation, this value includes sufficient/moderate correlation in the Pearson product-moment.

AB  - Since the availability of petroleum and derivatives has great impact over the world economy, the oil industry lies in both the formation and the maintenance of modern industrial economy. Petroleum exploration, transport, distribution and storage activities can compromise water resources and provide serious consequences to exposed organisms due to the risk of accidental spillage of oil and refinery effluents. Perna perna mussels are acknowledged for their sentinel characteristics being affected by slight environmental changes and one of the promising species in the aquaculture world. Thus, this study aimed to demonstrate that the behavior of Perna perna mussels is a suitable biomarker of exposure to petroleum and derivatives. The present research proposes the construction of an online aquatic pollution biosensor based on the behavioral analysis of Perna perna mussels network. Thirty-nine mussels instrumented with Hall Effect sensors and magnets were exposed to 0 (control), 5%, and 20% of Water-Accommodated Fraction (WAF) of Diesel S-500 for up to 42 hours. The sensors network outputs were used to evaluate the behavioral parameters average amplitude, filtration activity, transition frequency, amount of motion reversals and weighted average of the ten largest Fourier magnitudes after the first 12 hours of experiment using 6-hours intervals. The employment of the behavioral parameters weighted average of the ten largest Fourier magnitudes and transition frequency provided greater efficacy in distinguishing groups of animals exposed to contaminants in relation to the control group with significant differences in at least 80% of the analyzed intervals.

AB  - This paper draws on the Seville satirical weeklies El Tio Clarin (1864) and El Padre Adam (1868) as sources to develop an historical-philosophical framework in which to analyse the cultural origins of gender based on the cross-links between three elements: the view as a disciplinary field, the modern attitude of illustrators and the characterisation of citizen as public. The aim of this approach is to examine the use of the satirical press with cartoons in the second half of the nineteenth century as a way, through the humorous representation of the present, of demystifying the ideology of progress and popularising the virtue of citizen around the role of spectator. This shows how the fringe view of illustrators at the time encapsulated a radical worldview.

TI  - Defining the characteristics of poverty and their implications for poverty analysis
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Literature on the characteristics or underlying qualities of the concept of poverty is extensive but fragmented and rarely discusses the influence of these characteristics on poverty analysis. This paper examines the characteristics of poverty and their implications for poverty analysis. It primarily made use of secondary data together with some primary data. Findings are that poverty characteristically has a language and is multidimensional, complex, individual- or context-specific and absolute or relative. The characteristics of poverty have significant implications for, and should therefore be taken into consideration in, poverty analysis. The language of poverty reveals the dimensions and severity of poverty faced by a given community. It also enables poverty analysts to uphold the dignity of people and minimise misconceptions about poverty in a society. Lastly, the language of poverty provides an understanding of the context-sensitive meaning of poverty. The multidimensional and complex nature of poverty guides in the selection of an appropriate poverty worldview for analysing poverty. Moreover, the individual- and context-specific characteristic of poverty reflects the variation in the nature and severity of poverty according to age, gender and context. Knowledge about the absolute or relative nature of poverty, furthermore, is essential for poverty classification. The findings of this paper could allow for a more holistic or effective analysis of poverty, which may contribute to policy building.

M3  - research-article
AB  - North Korea is uniquely known as the socialist nation that has North Korean style. It is the supreme leader-first policy, which any socialist countries never have experienced. At the heart of North Korean style of socialism is the view of supreme leader, who is the core in the revolution of socialism. Only he can lead the people for the socialist revolution and, on that condition, the revolution can succeed. The view of supreme leader produces images of the supreme leader, which was projected through the two period of the Japanese colonialism and the Korean war. During Japanese occupation period, North Korean art and literature made the supreme leader the father image. After the Korean War, North Korean government utilized art and literature to produce the image of a savior. May attributes are ascribed to these two images of the supreme leader. The father image has attributes of love and goodness. The savior image possesses godly attributes such as omnipotence, omniscience, eternity and so on. NorthKorean government used these images of the supreme leader to indoctrinate North Korean people by means of an educational system through nursery schools to higher educational institutes. Through the indoctrination process, North Koreans come to have the godly images about the supreme leader, which has come to pass down through the lineage of Kim Il-sung-Kim Jong-Il, and Kim Jong-Un. The current leader in North Korea, Kim Jong-Un, relies on the view and images of the supreme leader, which was made in the reign of his grand-father, Kim Il-Sung.

TI  - Evaluation of lymph node metastasis in a rabbit tumor model: correlations between contrast-enhanced ultrasound and pathologic findings
T2  - ULTRASONOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - y Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) with microbubbles to detect metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) for treatment planning and prognosis.Methods: For the metastatic LN model, ground VX2 tumor tissues were injected subcutaneously in 12 rabbits, just below the right hind limb. The rabbits were classified into three groups based on the LN area: group A (n=4, >1.9 cm(2)), group B (n=4, 1-1.9 cm(2)), and group C (n=4, <1 cm(2)). The LNs were monitored on CEUS for 10 seconds after injecting 2.5 mL of microbubbles. The percent area of metastatic LNs was calculated on pathologic images and compared with CEUS images.Results: In group A, the mean percent area of metastasis was 40.7%+/- 19.4%. In all cases of metastasis, round-shaped perfusion defects were clearly observed in CEUS images. The metastatic areas were strongly correlated with pathologic findings. The mean percent area in group B was 21.5%+/- 14.4%. The CEUS findings showed multiple nodular perfusion defects, clearly revealing the metastatic areas. In group B, the CEUS and pathologic findings were concordant for three of the four cases. The mean percent area in group C was 9.1%+/- 6.4%. However, in this group, CEUS only detected a small perfusion defect in one case.Conclusion: CEUS has the potential to depict characteristic imaging features of metastatic LNs but still has limitations in early detection.

AB  - This paper presents new approaches to forecast the plant growth based on statistical methods: autoregressive and Markov chain models, using a time series of the normalized different vegetation index. Here, a monthly normalized different vegetation index time series was derived from Sentinel-2 over Limaya olive tree fields from January 2016 to November 2019. To ensure consistent prediction, processing is done over homogeneous clusters of vegetation. Finally, the performance of our approach is evaluated by means of the root mean square error between the predicted and true values.

TI  - Phenology, variation in habitat use, and daily activity patterns of Eleonora's falcon overwintering in Madagascar
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context The vast majority of the global population of Eleonora's falcon overwinters in Madagascar, where the natural environment is threatened by human-induced habitat changes, particularly intensive forest degradation. Objectives We described Eleonora's falcon phenology and habitat use based on fine-scale telemetry data and field surveys, and investigated which environmental parameters shape the observed patterns, to obtain a better insight into the species' ecological requirements during the wintering season. Methods We used high resolution GPS telemetry and remotely sensed data to establish bird-habitat associations and investigate spatiotemporal activity. We also verified habitat composition through ground surveys. Results Eleonora's falcon exploits a variety of habitats, exhibiting a distinct phenological pattern in their use. The species exhibits high site fidelity, moving progressively from more open areas towards landscapes with denser tree cover, possibly as a response to spatiotemporal patterns in food abundance. Time budget analysis revealed that Eleonora's falcon dedicates just about 15% of its daily activity to foraging, which is performed almost exclusively during daylight hours, with a greater tendency to forage at higher elevations with denser tree cover. On-site assessment of habitat composition revealed that existing habitat maps overlook small fragments of habitat and land use. However, the species' overall preference for humid forest suggests ongoing deforestation would adversely affect the availability of preferred habitat. Conclusions Our findings suggest that GPS logger technology, when combined with ground surveys, can enhance our understanding of long-distance migratory bird species' ecology at finer and more ecologically relevant scales.

AB  - When commonly used Automated Identification System (AIS) data to monitor vessel traffic is unavailable, one can resort to other types of data such as remote sensing and open source data to improve detection and tracking in order to increase Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA). The paper proposes a method for fusion of soft open source data (e.g. Twitter, Farkwar and other), remote sensing (RADARSAT-2) and S/T-AIS (hard) data in application to maritime traffic monitoring in the coastal and the open waters. The method assumes modeling vessels' motion by the Integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The data fusion performance evaluation using real data is presented showing improved tracking for MDA especially in the absence of AIS data. The impact of inclusion of soft, in particular the Twitter data, into the fusion module is also discussed.

AB  - Tumpangpitu Mining Area was in Banyuwangi Regency, East Java, Indonesia. This area has potential of mineral resources, forests, plantations and agriculture. The potential for mineral resources was developed into the Tumpangpitu mining area. Geological structures as a controller of mineral resource potential can be observed through satellite imagery using lineament analysis. Furthermore, the lineament can be tested for its effect on land cover diversity through analysis of the vegetation index. Utilization of satellite imagery such as Landsat-8 and SRTM DEM can be used to determine the lineament and vegetation index. In this case, Landsat-8 is useful for knowing the vegetation index, while SRTM DEM can be used to determine lineament of the morphology and geological structures. The spatial characterization of lineament was obtained by measuring lineament density (intersection, number, and length) using modified Segmen Tracing Algorithm (mSTA). The measurement of vegetation index was processed using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). In this case, the vegetation index has a range of -0.48 to 0.87, with a mean of 0.48. This indicates that the study area was dominated by dense vegetation, especially on the northern part in the study area. Lineament density which includes intersection, number, and length of lineament have a positive correlation with vegetation index value. Thus, it could be concluded that the greater lineament density in a zone, the greater of the vegetation index.

AB  - This paper reports a novel telemetric smart bracket (TSB) for in vivo force/moment measurements during clinical orthodontic applications. The prototype implements a novel microcoil design resulting in a significant increase of the transmission distance compared to the previous state-of-the-art TSB. Using an automatic wirebonder, the microcoil is wound around an SU-8 post attached to the CMOS sensor wafer. For the first time, thus, 3D wirebonder-fabricated microcoils were integrated on a CMOS substrate, without compromising CMOS functionality. The augmented CMOS system serves here as a force/moment measurement device with six-degree-of-freedom (f(x), f(y), f(z),m(x),m(y), m(z)) functionality. The achieved transmission distance, i.e. coil-to-coil distance, was thereby increased by 80% compared to the best previous design to 5 mm, without the need for the system to exceed the severe size constraints of 2x2.8x1 mm(3) defined by the bracket dimensions. The increased transmission distance allows uncritical contactless system powering and readout.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This study investigates the problem of detecting the extent of inundation caused by flash floods following heavy rainfall and the transport of sediments that cause the overflow of waters of the wadi on the crest of the Sakia El Hamra dam, the opening of two breaches in the body of the dam. The study area is focusing on Laayoune city in Southern Morocco in the region of Laayoune-Sakia el Hamra. The geomorphology of the area and the formation of the drainage network caused the creation of flash floods which took place from October 27 to 28, 2016, following intense and heavy rain in the region. Seven satellite images (radar and optical) taken before and after this event were processed to extract the most useful information. To achieve our objectives, this study began by preprocessing the radar images (calibration, speckle filtering, Doppler ground correction) and optics images (atmospheric correction, calibration of the radiometric and correction of geometric and topographic distortions). In this study, four spectral indices were extracted, then the change of detection approach is used on multispectral diachronic images from three MSI Sentinel-2 images and two Landsat-8 OLI imageries of before and after the disaster event. Normalized Difference Water Index "NDWI," Normalized Difference Moisture Index "NDMI," Normalized Multi-band Drought Index "NMDI" and Albedo "Al" provide a two-dimensional spectral feature space resulted which gives a very good power of discrimination to monitor the spatiotemporal evolution of the different levels of soil moisture in the area after the floods. The application of the coregistration and segmentation methods on radar Sentinel-1 images before and after the event completes this work. The results obtained show the importance of the complementarity multisensor imagery for the dynamic mapping of floods.

TI  - Assessing the Changes in the Moisture/Dryness of Water Cavity Surfaces in Imlili Sebkha in Southwestern Morocco by Using Machine Learning Classification in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Imlili Sebkha is a stable and flat depression in southern Morocco that is more than 10 km long and almost 3 km wide. This region is mainly sandy, but its northern part holds permanent water pockets that contain fauna and flora despite their hypersaline water. Google Earth Engine (GEE) has revolutionized land monitoring analysis by allowing the use of satellite imagery and other datasets via cloud computing technology and server-side JavaScript programming. This work highlights the potential application of GEE in processing large amounts of satellite Earth Observation (EO) Big Data for the free, long-term, and wide spatio-temporal wet/dry permanent salt water cavities and moisture monitoring of Imlili Sebkha. Optical and radar images were used to understand the functions of Imlili Sebkha in discovering underground hydrological networks. The main objective of this work was to investigate and evaluate the complementarity of optical Landsat, Sentinel-2 data, and Sentinel-1 radar data in such a desert environment. Results show that radar images are not only well suited in studying desertic areas but also in mapping the water cavities in desert wetland zones. The sensitivity of these images to the variations in the slope of the topographic surface facilitated the geological and geomorphological analyses of desert zones and helped reveal the hydrological functions of Imlili Sebkha in discovering buried underground networks.

TI  - Automated Continuous Fields Prediction From Landsat Time Series: Application to Fractional Impervious Cover
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The characterization of fine temporal-resolution land surface dynamics from broadband optical satellite sensors is constrained by sparse acquisitions of high-quality imagery; interscene variation in radiometric, phenological, atmospheric, and illumination conditions; and subpixel variability in heterogeneous environments. In this letter, we address these concerns by developing and testing the automatic adaptive signature generalization and regression (AASGr) algorithm. Provided a robust reference map corresponding to the date of one image, AASGr automates the prediction of continuous fields maps from imagery time series that is adaptive to the spectral and radiometric characteristics of each target image and thereby requires neither atmospheric correction nor data normalization. We tested AASGr on a 22-year Landsat time series to quantify subannual impervious fractional cover dynamics in Houston, TX-an area characterized by a high degree of spatial heterogeneity in surface cover and high frequency in land cover change. The map time series achieved high accuracy in a three-part validation procedure and reveals spatio-temporal dynamics of urban intensification and extensification at a level of detail previously elusive in discrete classifications or coarse temporal-resolution map products. The automation of continuous fields time series is enabling a new generation of land surface products capable of characterizing precise morphologies along a continuum of spatio-temporal change. While AASGr was applied here to predict subpixel impervious fractional cover from Landsat imagery, the method is generalizable to a range of imagery and applications requiring dense continuous fields time series with uncertainty estimates of geophysical and biochemical characteristics, such as leaf area index, biomass, and albedo.

AB  - In Farta watershed, the impact of land use/land cover (LULC) change and climate variability on hydrological processes was simulated using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). The values of R-2, NSE, RSR and PBIAS were 0.79, 0.67, 0.82 and 4.8% throughout calibration and 0.61, 0.69, 0.69, and 5.2% throughout validation respectively. Climate trend were analysed in the study area by using Mann-Kendall (MK) test. Percentage change of 10.94%, 8.13% and 16.09% for average annual temperature, mean maximum temperature and mean minimum temperature were observed respectively. The four Landsat images (2000, 2005, 2010 and 2017) were classified into five major LULC classes and areal extent of each LULC were 9.2 Km(2) urban, 8.5 Km(2) plantations, 5.7 Km(2) waterbody, -22.3 Km(2) agricultural land and -1.0 Km(2) pastureland. The combined effects of LULC and climate variability in the study area should be taken into consideration for the water resources planning and management.

TI  - The t-SNE Algorithm as a Tool to Improve the Quality of Reference Data Used in Accurate Mapping of Heterogeneous Non-Forest Vegetation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supervised classification methods, used for many applications, including vegetation mapping require accurate "ground truth" to be effective. Nevertheless, it is common for the quality of this data to be poorly verified prior to it being used for the training and validation of classification models. The fact that noisy or erroneous parts of the reference dataset are not removed is usually explained by the relatively high resistance of some algorithms to errors. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the rationale for cleaning the reference dataset used for the classification of heterogeneous non-forest vegetation, and to present a workflow based on the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm for the better integration of reference data with remote sensing data in order to improve outcomes. The proposed analysis is a new application of the t-SNE algorithm. The effectiveness of this workflow was tested by classifying three heterogeneous non-forest Natura 2000 habitats: Molinia meadows (Molinion caeruleae; code 6410), species-rich Nardus grassland (code 6230) and dry heaths (code 4030), employing two commonly used algorithms: random forest (RF) and AdaBoost (AB), which, according to the literature, differ in their resistance to errors in reference datasets. Polygons collected in the field (on-ground reference data) in 2016 and 2017, containing no intentional errors, were used as the on-ground reference dataset. The remote sensing data used in the classification were obtained in 2017 during the peak growing season by a HySpex sensor consisting of two imaging spectrometers covering spectral ranges of 0.4-0.9 mu m (VNIR-1800) and 0.9-2.5 mu m (SWIR-384). The on-ground reference dataset was gradually cleaned by verifying candidate polygons selected by visual interpretation of t-SNE plots. Around 40-50% of candidate polygons were ultimately found to contain errors. Altogether, 15% of reference polygons were removed. As a result, the quality of the final map, as assessed by the Kappa and F1 accuracy measures as well as by visual evaluation, was significantly improved. The global map accuracy increased by about 6% (in Kappa coefficient), relative to the baseline classification obtained using random removal of the same number of reference polygons.

TI  - Improving the UAV-based yield estimation of paddy rice by using the solar radiation of geostationary satellite Himawari-8
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of this study were to improve the yield estimation of paddy rice based on the unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing (UAV-RS) and solar radiation data sets. The study used the UAV-RS-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at the heading stage, the solar radiation data of geostationary satellite Himawari-8 and the solar radiation data of polar orbiting satellite Aqua/MODIS. A comparison of two satellite-based solar radiation data sets (Himawari-8 and MODIS PAR) showed that the coefficient of determination (R-2) of estimated yield based on Himawari-8 solar radiation was 0.7606 while the R-2 of estimated yield based on the MODIS PAR was 0.4749. Additionally, the root mean square error (RMSE) of Himawari-8 solar radiation was 26.5 g/m(2) while the RMSE of estimated yield based on the MODIS PAR was 39.2 g/m(2) (The average observed yield was 489.3 g/m(2)). The Estimated yield based on Himawari-8 solar radiation, therefore, outperformed the MODIS PAR-based estimated yield. The improvement of the temporal resolution of the satellite-based dataset allowed by using the Himawari-8 data set contributed to the improvement of estimation accuracy. Satellite-based solar radiation data allow yield estimation based on remote sensing in regions where there are no ground observation data of solar radiation.

T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Determination of spatial and temporal patterns of urban growth has become one of the most significant challenges in monitoring and assessing current and future trends of the urban growth issue. Soran district has witnessed very rapid growth in the last two decades, mostly because of its economic, commercial and social attractions. The aim of this work is to study the growth and sprawl dynamics through the land use and land cover (LULC) maps for the area at three different periods (1998, 2008, and 2018) particularly in the urban areas employing GIS and RS techniques.Three Landsat images, Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus in the 1998, Thematic Mapper in the 2008 and Landsat Operational Land (LOL) in the 2018 were used to assess the changes of urban encroachment. A supervised classification technique by maximum likelihood classifier has been employed to create a classified image and has been assessed based on Kappa index. The results obtained showed that the urbanized area increased from 4.51 to 14.93 km(2) from 1998 to 2018. This study demonstrated that the substantial changes in LULC in Soran district since the end of 1990s are directly related to and influenced by the main and secondary roads development on spatial expansion and land use change.

AB  - During the last decades, Cheria basin which is karstic region located northeast of Algeria was subjugated to unrationalised high groundwater extraction. The extracted waters were mainly used by local farmers for agriculture and daily-life purposes. As results, underground cavities and sinkholes occurrence start to overwhelm the area due to the massive underground water extractions. Therefore, in this research we used Sentinel-1A SAR satellite images with a high spatial resolution to monitor and investigate the vertical movement of ground instability of two sinkholes have collapsed and created serious damages in the Cheria basin. The results of the interferograms generated from SAR images acquired at different timeframes through SNAP software, was the foundation for obtaining a time-series results for monitoring the overall land movement. The results show a displacement map with values ranging between -30 to -60 mm/year. Overall, the obtained results using InSAR techniques with a large scale and high accuracy monitoring can give information about earth surface deformation and therefore help decision makers in the process of reducing the damage created by Sinkholes.

AB  - Rice is considered the main food source for over 40% of the world population and plays a crucial role in countries' food security, food management, and economic aspects. The value of SAR remote sensing in agricultural studies has its source of illumination and not limited to cloud cover. This makes it highly preferable over optical sensors in cloud-shrouded countries. The objective of the study is to assess the capability of Sentinel-1 data for determining paddy planting methods, identifying unhealthy paddy and an attempt made to differentiate rice varieties through correlation of in situ measurements and temporal variation of SAR backscattered signals. Six Sentinel-1 images are stacked to cover the entire paddy lifecycle. The correlated field data and plant backscatter showed that transplanted paddy has backscatter higher than broadcasted paddy. Two drops of paddy backscatter coefficient occurred, the first one, at the reproductive stage when paddy was attacked by bacteria and the second drop was at the ripening stage due to the attack of pests. The five rice varieties planted in Seberang Perak, Malaysia had the backscatter with insignificant differences that cannot confirm the Sentinel-1 capability to differentiate planted rice varieties. According to the obtained results, the time series of Sentinel-1 data has the capability for paddy rice growth monitoring.

TI  - Use of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes and Rates of Diabetic Ketoacidosis
T2  - DIABETES CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE To estimate real-world off-label use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with type 1 diabetes, estimate rates of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and compare them with DKA rates observed in sotagliflozin clinical trials. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We identified initiators of SGLT2 inhibitors in the Sentinel System from March 2013 to June 2018, determined the prevalence of type 1 diabetes using a narrow and a broad definition, and measured rates of DKA using administrative claims data. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated using age- and sex-specific follow-up time in Sentinel and age- and sex-specific DKA rates from sotagliflozin trials 309, 310, and 312. RESULTS Among 475,527 initiators of SGLT2 inhibitors, 0.50% and 0.92% met narrow and broad criteria for type 1 diabetes, respectively. Rates of DKA in the narrow and broad groups were 7.3/100 person-years and 4.5/100 person-years, respectively. Among patients who met narrow criteria for type 1 diabetes, rates of DKA were highest for patients aged 25-44 years, especially females aged 25-44 years (19.7/100 person-years). More DKA events were observed during off-label use of SGLT2 inhibitors in Sentinel than would be expected based on sotagliflozin clinical trials (SIR = 1.83; 95% CI 1.45-2.28). CONCLUSIONS Real-world off-label use of SGLT2 inhibitors among patients with type 1 diabetes accounted for a small proportion of overall SGLT2 inhibitor use. However, the risk for DKA during off-label use was notable, especially among young, female patients. Although real-word rates of DKA exceeded the expectation based on clinical trials, results should be interpreted with caution due to differences in study methods, patient samples, and study drugs.

AB  - Within the current context of availability of Earth Observation satellites at high spatial and temporal resolutions, mapping large areas become doable. To this end, supervised classification of remote sensing images is the commonly adopted approach. Having a high-quality and representative training set is always the key to a successful classification result. However, this is often a tedious task that involves samples gathering from field surveys or photointerpretation. The larger the area to map, the more challenging this exercise becomes. In this letter we present an active learning-based technique to address this issue by optimizing the training set required for classification while providing a generic classifier suitable for large scale. Experiments were carried out to identify poplar plantations in France using Sentinel-2 time series. The results are promising and show the good capacities of the proposed approach to be adapted at the national scale.

AB  - Permafrost in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has seasonal dynamic changes and annual degradation trends that could affect the stability of artificial infrastructures such as the Qinghai-Tibet Railway (QTR). In this paper, the seasonal surface deformation along the QTR in Wudaoliang permafrost area is detected by the StaMPS-InSAR method using long-term Sentinel-1 images from March 2017 to June 2018, and the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of the surface deformation are further analyzed. The beginning of thawing or freezing stages are different between the northeastern section and southwestern section of the QTR in the study area. The results with distinct seasonal trend indicate that the maximum thawing subsidence of the QTR, at about 12.8 mm, happened in earlier September 2017. In addition, the maximum freezing uplift happened in January next year and may reach to about 7.2 mm. Also, the difference between maximum thawing subsidence and freezing uplift could show the annual degradation trend. This application demonstrates InSAR is a promising tool for monitoring surface deformation over wide permafrost areas.

TI  - Prediction of Winter Wheat Yield Based on Multi-Source Data and Machine Learning in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat is one of the main crops in China, and crop yield prediction is important for regional trade and national food security. There are increasing concerns with respect to how to integrate multi-source data and employ machine learning techniques to establish a simple, timely, and accurate crop yield prediction model at an administrative unit. Many previous studies were mainly focused on the whole crop growth period through expensive manual surveys, remote sensing, or climate data. However, the effect of selecting different time window on yield prediction was still unknown. Thus, we separated the whole growth period into four time windows and assessed their corresponding predictive ability by taking the major winter wheat production regions of China as an example in the study. Firstly we developed a modeling framework to integrate climate data, remote sensing data and soil data to predict winter wheat yield based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results show that the models can accurately predict yield 1 similar to 2 months before the harvesting dates at the county level in China with an R-2 > 0.75 and yield error less than 10%. Support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and random forest (RF) represent the top three best methods for predicting yields among the eight typical machine learning models tested in this study. In addition, we also found that different agricultural zones and temporal training settings affect prediction accuracy. The three models perform better as more winter wheat growing season information becomes available. Our findings highlight a potentially powerful tool to predict yield using multiple-source data and machine learning in other regions and for crops.

TI  - Cohesion Intensive Deep Hashing for Remote Sensing Image Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the demand for remote sensing image retrieval is growing and attracting the interest of many researchers because of the increasing number of remote sensing images. Hashing, as a method of retrieving images, has been widely applied to remote sensing image retrieval. In order to improve hashing performance, we develop a cohesion intensive deep hashing model for remote sensing image retrieval. The underlying architecture of our deep model is motivated by the state-of-the-art residual net. Residual nets aim at avoiding gradient vanishing and gradient explosion when the net reaches a certain depth. However, different from the residual net which outputs multiple class-labels, we present a residual hash net that is terminated by a Heaviside-like function for binarizing remote sensing images. In this scenario, the representational power of the residual net architecture is exploited to establish an end-to-end deep hashing model. The residual hash net is trained subject to a weighted loss strategy that intensifies the cohesiveness of image hash codes within one class. This effectively addresses the data imbalance problem normally arising in remote sensing image retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we adopted a gradualness optimization method for obtaining optimal model parameters in order to favor accurate binary codes with little quantization error. We conduct comparative experiments on large-scale remote sensing data sets such as UCMerced and AID. The experimental results validate the hypothesis that our method improves the performance of current remote sensing image retrieval.

AB  - Recently, the Korean government has announced the “Korea Version New Deal Policy” as an important national policy related to the environment. This means that the breadth and impact of the change is affecting the overall state affairs so that the basic policy of the country to cope with climate change is innovative, unlike the previous point of view. a prerequisite for achieving the green transition, the constitutional values based on existing capitalism must be converted into green values.. However, the change of values contrary to the dignity and values of human beings stipulated in the current constitution inevitably leads to numerous social debates and conflicts. The composition of the contents of the green transition should be approached in a range that does not damage anthropocentrism, and on the contrary, human dignity and values should be interpreted more flexibly in line with new social changes. It is necessary to promote the legislative strategy of the green transformation in a fundamental Principle manner because the content that the green transformation is pursuing can be realized to the maximum extent that is practical as well as legally feasible. In other words, although it is difficult in reality to realize the perfect green transformation, the value for green transformation at the constitutional level must be accepted in the constitutional principle through constitutional amendment. However, the environmental state principle for green transformation needs to be newly established as a fundamental principle in the constitution so as to break away from the traditional meaning of “environment,” based on a mechanistic worldview based on the modern industrial society, and fit new values. What is important is not just to make a constitutional principle for a green transformation, but a solid legal system to realize a green transformation. In other words, in order to realize a green transformation, it is necessary to reorganize the existing Fundamental laws for Green Growth, as well as the current related legal systems such as the Sustainable Development Act, the Energy Act, and the Fundamental Environmental Policy Act. In addition, as the most important legislative task, the tentatively named “Fundamental Law for Green Transformation” should be enacted, and its contents include the vision and fundamental direction of the future Korean society, clarification of reduction targets for climate change response, and categories of climate adaptation policies. Expanding the scope and substantialization of climate adaptation policies, setting and implementation plans for each industry sector by government department, preliminary education for inclusive green transformation, global ecosystem values and conservation, and establishment of a green transformation committee should be stipulated.

AB  - In recent years, with the frequencies and intensities was increasing in environmental issues, much more attentions were focus on sandstorm in the fields of natural science and social science research. The geostationary satellite imagery can continuously observe the surface of the earth in a short period of time, and has a good monitoring advantage for the sanddust, which has a fast-moving target. Based on the geostationary meteorological satellite data of Himawari-8(H8) at 4:00 on May 3, 2017, the results of remote sensing retrieval of sand-dust intensity are compared by using a variety of exist sanddust identification models. The results show that the multi-channel threshold method has the best effect on sand-dust identification, the reflected radiation dust index method is the second, and the infrared split window channel difference method and the infrared split window channel ratio method have the worst identification effect. Single channel threshold method, infrared multi-channel threshold method, infrared split window channel difference method and infrared split window channel ratio method have poor distinction between cloud layer and sand dust, multi-channel threshold method and reflected radiation dust index method are poor distinguished between low temperature zone and the sand-dust.

TI  - Automatic Terrain Debris Recognition Network Based on 3D Remote Sensing Data
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
M3  - Article
AB  - Although predecessors have made great contributions to the semantic segmentation of 3D indoor scenes, there still exist some challenges in the debris recognition of terrain data. Compared with hundreds of thousands of indoor point clouds, the amount of terrain point cloud is up to millions. Apart from that, terrain point cloud data obtained from remote sensing is measured in meters, but the indoor scene is measured in centimeters. In this case, the terrain debris obtained from remote sensing mapping only have dozens of points, which means that sufficient training information cannot be obtained only through the convolution of points. In this paper, we build multi-attribute descriptors containing geometric information and color information to better describe the information in low-precision terrain debris. Therefore, our process is aimed at the multi-attribute descriptors of each point rather than the point. On this basis, an unsupervised classification algorithm is proposed to divide the point cloud into several terrain areas, and regard each area as a graph vertex named super point to form the graph structure, thus effectively reducing the number of the terrain point cloud from millions to hundreds. Then we proposed a graph convolution network by employing PointNet for graph embedding and recurrent gated graph convolutional network for classification. Our experiments show that the terrain point cloud can reduce the amount of data from millions to hundreds through the super point graph based on multi-attribute descriptor and our accuracy reached 91.74% and the IoU reached 94.08%, both of which were significantly better than the current methods such as SEGCloud (Acc: 88.63%, IoU: 89.29%) and PointCNN (Acc: 86.35, IoU: 87.26).

AB  - Using Landsat 5/TM and Landsat 8/OLI images in 2000 and 2017, based on remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) model, combined with meteorological observation data and socio-economic data in Nanjing from 2000 to 2017, we analyzed and evaluated the ecological environment changes and the characteristic ecological areas in Nanjing. The results showed that the average RSEI of Nanjing decreased from 0.626 to 0.618 during 2000-2017. The RSEI values could be divided into five grades: bad, poor, fair, good and excellent. The proportion of area above good grade decreased from 61.0% to 57.1%, while that below poor grade increased slightly. Compared with 2000, the proportion of areas with improved ecological environment quality was 34.5%, 34.7% area had deteriorated, and 30.8% area remained unchanged in 2017. Among them, the ecological quality of main urban area had significantly improved, and the area with improved ecological quality exceeded that of deterioration. The ecological quality of new urban area and suburbs had deteriorated. The area with poor ecological environment exceeded the area of improvement. Among the three ecological protection areas, the ecological quality of Zijin Mountain was significantly better than that of Laoshan Mountain and Jiangxinzhou. The urbanization rate was negatively correlated with RSEI, with a correlation coefficient of -0.91. The urbanization process would have negative impacts on the ecological environment in general. However, strict protection and management measures could maintain the good ecological environment even improve it.

TI  - Robust goal programming for multi-objective optimization of data-driven problems: A use case for the United States transportation command's liner rate setting problem
T2  - OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Robust goal programming (RGP) is a recently developed, powerful new optimization modeling technique that conjoins two widely accepted operations research disciplines: robust optimization (RO) and goal programming (GP). In lieu of applying a probability distribution over possible outcomes, an approach considered by stochastic programming, RO utilizes uncertainty sets to account for data uncertainty. This characteristic of RO is an important attribute because identifying such a probability distribution is challenging, at best. Given this RO context, RGP additionally incorporates GP, traditionally a deterministic procedure, to address optimization problems having multiple objectives. As such, RGP has potential to help address a wide array of data-driven applications, ranging from financial management to engineering design.As a motivating use case for the utility of an RGP approach, this paper demonstrates the applicability of RGP by way of the data-driven United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) liner rate setting problem. USTRANSCOM is responsible for the technical direction and supervision of over $7 billion [1] of annual passenger, cargo, mobility, and personal property movements in support of the Department of Defense (DoD). Transporting people and material with both organic and contracted assets, USTRANSCOM supports DoD organizations and agencies on a reimbursable basis, annually setting and charging rates for air and liner (i.e., sea) transport for their customers and reimbursing the transportation providers accordingly. The Cost Recovery Branch within TCJ8, the Financial Management and Program Analysis staff organization for USTRANSCOM, annually sets liner shipping rates specific to each combination of origin, destination, commodity type, booking terms, and container size for the upcoming fiscal year (FY). As a government entity, USTRANSCOM seeks to neither make a profit nor operate at a loss in any given FY. The current rate setting methodology assumes existing data is deterministic, resulting in process inaccuracies that contribute to unexpected surpluses or deficits each FY. Moreover, the current method fails to consider an additional USTRANSCOM objective: meeting customer's expectations that liner rates will change annually in accordance with industry-specific inflation. Considering the different goals and inherent parametric variance, the use case herein incorporates a decision maker's risk preference regarding parametric variability via a priori analysis to inform RGP techniques and improve the USTRANSCOM liner rate setting process.

TI  - Biblical hermeneutics in Galileo's "Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina" <i>On the issue of negative theology</i>
T2  - STUDIA THEOLOGICA-NORDIC JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Florentine mathematician and philosopher Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) has been honoured as one of the founding fathers of the modern scientific revolution. Although such a view corresponds to a widely used description of the intellectual heritage of Galileo, one exciting - but least recognized - aspect of Galileo's work is his interest in and challenge to biblical hermeneutics. The aim of this article is to explore whether and how Galileo's reflections on biblical hermeneutics, as instantiated in his Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina of Tuscany (1615), may offer us a way to think his scientific worldview together with the Holy Scriptures. On this basis, I discuss what I call "conjectural epistemology" in order to review Galileo's contribution to the elucidation of a negative theology.

AB  - Throughout the 20th to the beginning of the 21st century, Nam Dinh coastline, located in the Red river delta, is vulnerable to serious erosion and loss by level sea rise as well as land subsidence. There have been numerous research studies conducted to find out the original causes generating erosion problem. This paper aims to detect and analyze the surface displacements that occurred in this area based on Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) methods. In order to retrieve the most recent ground deformation patterns, Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) technique and specialized software GMTSAR have been exploited in this study. Based on this time-series technique we processed 26 C-band Sentinel-1 SAR images from March 2017 to October 2018 to extract information of land subsidence in whole Nam Dinh coast. The result shows that the displacements calculated in the form of satellite Line of Sight (LOS) are varied from -21 to +2.5 mm/yr. The coastal region where majority of land subsidence occurs along the Red river to Ba Lat mouth, whereas the uplift appears at southern part of the study site, where is the area along the lower Day and Ninh Co rivers.

AB  - The eastern coast waters of North Sumatra is a fishing ground with a high level of exploitation. One of commodity catches in the eastern coast of Sumatra is mackarel (Rastrelliger kanagurta). By understanding the parameters of oceanography, especially sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a, it can help to predict fishing area which are used as a guide for the purpose of fishes catching or exploitation. One of the satellites that can detect sea water temperature and chlorophyll-a is Aqua (EOS PM) with a moderate resolution imaging spectro radiometer sensor (MODIS). Mackerel catch data were obtained from ocean fishing port in Belawan. Sea surface temperature eastern coast of North Sumatra based on Aqua MODIS image analysis ranged from 29.55-31.66 degrees C, and chlorophyll-a distribution has a range of 1.56-4.65 mg/m(3). Mackerel catches fluctuations every month. The highest average catch is 232.174 tons which occurred in February. While the lowest catch is 201.457 which occurred in May. The results of the correlation between catching mackerel and sea surface temperature of -0.337 have a weak and not direct relationship. Relationship of chlorophyll -a with catches obtained a positive correlation value of 0.660 which indicates that between chlorophyll -a and catches has a strong and direct relationship.

AB  - The article discusses the role of values in political determination of parties and voters in Croatia on the example of elections for the European Parliament 2019. The article offers an overview of political determination, goals, and values of clubs of parties in the European Parliament and parties in Croatia that have managed to win more than 1% of votes at the election for the European Parliament 2019. After that, the author compares results of Croatian value study with results of the election for the European Parliament according to regions in Croatia. The author concludes that clubs of parties in the European Parliament and parties in Croatia are similarly politically determined according to values that they declare to hold. There are also other similarities that point towards the probability that decisions of voters at state elections are based on similarity of values between those who vote and those declared by parties and candidates.

AB  - Effective grassland management practices require a good understanding of soil and vegetation properties, that can be quantified by farmers' knowledge and remote sensing techniques. Many systems have been proposed in the past for grassland monitoring, but open-source alternatives are increasingly being preferred. In this paper, a system is proposed to process data in an open-source and automated way. This system made use of Sentinel-2 data to support grassland management at Haus Riswick in the region around Kleve, Germany, retrieved with help of a platform called Sentinelsat that was developed by ESA. Consecutive processing steps consisted of atmospheric correction, cloud masking, clipping the raster data, and calculation of vegetation indices. First results from 2018 resembled the mowing regime of the area with four growing cycles, although outliers were detected due to a lack of data caused by cloud cover. Moreover, that year's extremely dry summer was visible in the time-series pattern as well. The proposed script is a primary version of a processing chain, which is suitable to be further expanded for more advanced data pre-processing and data analysis in the future.

AB  - This paper presents experimental results of the 3-D characterization of alpine snowpacks, obtained using a low complexity portable MIMO radar system that operates at C-band. Different types of snow at different altitudes and seasons are studied. The acquired datasets are processed using the Back Projection Algorithm and the resulting tomograms are compared to Meteo France ground measurements (Snow Micro Pen transects, density and stratigraphy profiles and liquid water content). The obtained tomograms show that the system mostly detects melt forms and faceted crystals. These measurements provide 3-D electromagnetic ground truth that can be used to confirm the results obtained by Sentinel-1.

AB  - The Children's New Ecological Paradigms scale was originally developed for children ages 10-12 and was presented as valuable for comparing that age group with older participants. This study uses cognitive interviews and measurement invariance testing to investigate how well the scores maintain the same meaning between these two age groups. The qualitative and quantitative results were consistent in revealing that at least 20% of the items function differently than expected when we use it for this purpose. The findings revealed similarities with critiques of the adult NEP and questioned the validity of the use of this instrument in its present form.

AB  - The objective of this study is to make weekly mean sea surface temperature (SST) from SNPP-VIIRS satellite data. The data used were SST data every afternoon pass, from 13 to 19 May 2019. The data were obtained from Remote Sensing Technology and Data Center, LAPAN. From 12 samples data used showed that pixel size of each data are different, with range between 0.006737548 - 0.006858158 degree. The pixel size should be exactly the same to do data overlay. Then, the pixel size was resized become 0.00675 degree. This process was carried out using Reprojection Menu in QGIS software. The next process was calculating weekly mean SST every pixel. The mean SST was calculated only on pixels that have SST values. The calculation was not carried out on cloud, cloud shadow, land, and out of coverage data. The tolerance of coordinate position between pixels are less than 0.5 of pixel size. Weekly mean SST calculation process was executed using mean function in R software. The result of mean SST showed some possible error SST values. The errors were found in these conditions: 1) in coastal areas where possible mixed pixels of land and water 2) near cloud, where possible mixed pixel of cloud, cloud shadow, and water, 3) pixels with (extremely) high SST values near clouds. To overcome these conditions, some median type filters were applied. Therefore, weekly mean SST from SNPP-VIIRS data that smooth and minimum cloud cover can be obtained.

AB  - The agricultural lands are an important source for the recovery of the economy system southern of Iraq. The neglect, lack of interest, and the wars in recent years are affecting on the soil quality of these lands. There are a few techniques are developed to detect and monitor the toxic minerals in soil of the agricultural lands south of Iraq. The integration of remote sensing data and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques with the developed of mathematical equations were as a powerful tool to monitor spatial distribution and change detections the concentrations values for zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) in soil of the agricultural lands during winter and summer seasons in year 2018. The concentrations values for (Zn) and (Pb) in soil have been lowest in winter and highest in summer season. The change detection of spatial distribution area for (Zn) between two seasons was by range (45.06) km2 with the change ratio (37%), while the change detection of spatial distribution area for (Pb) between two seasons was by range (29.82) km2, with the change ratio (25%). In conclusion, the developed systematic and generic approach may constitute a basis for determining the soil minerals in the agricultural lands worldwide.

AB  - Water table is the equilibrium mechanism for surface and ground water flows. Addition of the surface water and hindrance of the natural drainage adds to ground water resulting in rising water tables. Introduction of the modern perennial canal irrigation induces positive net recharge to alluvial aquifer forcing a rise in the water table until an increased evapotranspiration establishes a new equilibrium level (O' Mara, 1988). Rising trends in the average level of water tables may provide an early indication of an increased land salinity risk in catchments. Similarly, falling water table levels may be an indicator of the effectiveness of mitigation strategies (Coram et al, 2000). Rising water level causes water logging and soil salinity. Moreover, the combined effect of water logging and salinity was found more harmful to crop yield than the individual effect of water logging (Kahlown and Azam, 2002). Prediction of irrigation water volumes needs advanced tools of crop area estimation that combine a ground survey with satellite data to produce statistics of crop areas. Therefore, a spatial approach is particularly appropriate (Knox and Weatherhead, 1999). Spatial approaches also necessary for assessing water table development, salinity development and for reclamation of saline and water logging condition in the irrigation projects. Remote sensing and GIS tools assist in mapping sensitivity of these agro-hazards subsequently in formulation of the reclamation strategy (Miles and Ruston, 1983).

AB  - Mangroves are recognized as an ecosystem that grow and dominate the coastal areas of tropical and sub-tropical regions across the world. They not only provide ecological and socio-economic support, but also play a pivotal role in offsetting an excess of carbon from the atmosphere. Despite the crucial roles provided by mangroves, the ecosystem has degraded at an alarming rate mainly due to anthropogenic activities. Remote sensing technology provides a new dimensional perspective in monitoring and estimating tree biomass and carbon stocks. Therefore, this study aimed at (1) estimating the carbon stocks of mangroves in Kedah, Malaysia, (2) investigating the relationships between mangrove stand parameters with spectral reflectance recorded from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data, and (3) developing predictive models for estimating the carbon stocks of mangroves by combining the ground and Landsat 8 (OLI) data. For the purpose of this study, a total of 81 mangrove stand data sets measuring at 100 m x 100 m were collected throughout Kedah, Malaysia. Within the stand, seven randomly selected plots were established and all individual mangroves parameter (diameter at breast height (DBH) and height) were measured. The 81 stands were split into two independent data sets for developing and validating the models (56 and 25 stands, respectively). Multiple regression technique with least square approach was used in the model development process. From several good candidate models, a model consists of four predictive variables (bands 3 and 6, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and simple ratio seems to be predicting reasonably well based on its simplicity and practicality (p <= 0.001, R-2 = 0.56). Validation of the model has resulted in Mallow's prediction criterion (Cp) value of 4.28 and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.11 Mg/ha. The information from this study may provide useful input for future research and can be crucial tools for the government and stakeholders in future decision making for the sustainability of mangrove resources.

AB  - We extended the MODIS 17 algorithm to hourly Gross Primary Product (GPP) estimation for Australia in 2018. AHI 1-km data are available at NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) facility. The high-frequent observation of Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) enabled us to calculate hourly GPP, which is corresponding to ground observation of carbon flux measured by TERN OzFlux. We interpolated the weather observation data to 1-km grid over Australia ingesting AHI reflectance and radiometric temperature data (NEX-Gridded Hourly Meteorology (NEX-GHM)). Then, we applied MODIS 17 algorithm to each grid with optimized climate regulation functions. The estimation of climate and GPP were well correlated with OzFlux ground observation data.

AB  - This paper presents the analysis of IRS LISS III satellite image based on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) for extracting the crop pattern of rabi season of Kangsabati commanded area located at Bankura district of West Bengal, India. NDVI was calculated through creation of FCC (False Colour Composite) followed by supervised classification by applying ground truth data obtained after physical survey on three districts, covered under Kangsabati reservoir commanded area. Final crop map is generated to extract different crop classes from which crop sown in rabi season is estimated. It has been found that potato crop is sown on much more area than rice. Finally, accuracy is checked, and 87% accuracy was achieved after successful identification of crop. This study suggest that this approach will be effective with an acceptable accuracy for crop map generation to classify the different crops and thereby calculate the actual crop water demand of commanded area of Kangsabati reservoir and thereby evaluate the performance of the canal system in near future.

AB  - In this work, we present a methodology for correcting the major dominating errors in SAR interferograms. Ionospheric effect, orbital and tropospheric errors can lead to a serious damage the interferometric phase; and case a limitation for the retrieval of land displacement information carried by the SAR phase. To reduce the effect of these errors on an interferogram, a combined correction is applied, the Split-Spectrum Algorithm (SSA) is used for the correction of Ionospheric effect, in addition, the GACOS data is employed for tropospheric error, and finally, to quantify orbital contribution, a nonlinear model is used. This methodology is applied to a set of Sentinel-1 data; the preliminary results show an improvement of the information after the application of this joint correction.

AB  - Forest degradation and deforestation is crucial to be monitored. Thus, aggressive sustainable forest management is needed. Tree species composition estimations at large spatial scale is crucial to achieve sustainable forest management and monitor forest degradation and deforestation occurrences. Thus, monitoring by using remotely sensed data would be helpful to cover large spatial extend of tropical rainforest. However, due to coarse spatial resolution the estimation of tree species composition nearly impossible due to mixing pixel problem. Nonetheless, utilizing modified Canopy Fractional Cover (mCFC) would help to overcome mixing pixels in coarse spatial resolution satellite data. Accuracy of the results suggest that mCFC is suitable to be utilized for estimating relative abundance of Chengal at large extend area.

TI  - HUMAN AS A CARRIER OF THE WORLDVIEW: INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE DIMENSIONS
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The purpose of the study is to outline the links between individual and collective dimensions of the human worldview. This purpose requires solving two tasks: to update philosophical ideas formed by reflection on human and community worldview; to identify and generalize the relationship of singular and general in the context of the problem of human worldview. Theoretical basis. The study is based on philosophical reflections about manifestations of singular and general worldviews. Such reflections appeared in European philosophy quite a long time ago (Dilthey, Rickert, Jaspers). Ukrainian and foreign philosophical discourse considers both measures of the worldview. And a role of the carrier of worldview plays either human or society. We can see that in researches of S. Krymskyi, I. Nadolniy, V. Popov, N. Rozhanska, V. Tabachkovskyi, V. Shynkaruk, V. Poythress, D. Rousseau, D. Billingham, C. Gianolla and others. However the links between individual and collective dimensions of worldview are not clearly outlined. It is possible to note the research of V. Popov who focuses on the problem of socio-collective and individual dimensions of worldview. But the scientist focuses more on the use of the concept of worldview in these two meanings. Human as a social being interacts with worldviews of other individuals. That is why we can speak of two dimensions of the worldview function: individual and collective. This problem became topical due to acuteness of the links between human and society in modern life. Originality. The author outlined key links between individual and collective dimensions of human worldview functioning. The study identified a role of human as a carrier of the worldview in formation of collective worldview. Conclusions. Human as a worldview carrier plays a key role in formation of collective worldview. In philosophical discourse thoughts about links between individual and collective worldviews are different and sometimes conflicting. We have a discussion problem of uniformity and diversity of collective worldview. Collective worldview is showed as a circulation of different ideas and views of individuals. But collective worldview is showed as a whole system of individual views too. Collective worldview manifests as integrated phenomenon because it is based on common worldviews of individuals. At the same time the human is influenced by collective worldview in particularly as a past generation heritage.

T2  - MICROFOUNDATIONS OF INSTITUTIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The authors explore self-identity construction as a mechanism of institutionalization at the individual level. Building on in-depth analysis of life stories of yoga practitioners who are at different stages of practice, the authors found that as yoga practitioners are more exposed to the yogic institution, yogic meanings gradually infuse their general worldview and self-concept. The authors follow the line of research which focuses on professional identity construction as institutional work, yet, opening the "black box," the authors argue that institutional meanings take root at the individual level beyond the institutional context and beneath the explicit level of identity.

TI  - Soviet Feature Films about Children in the War and It's Use in the Training of Future Teachers
T2  - MEDIA EDUCATION-MEDIAOBRAZOVANIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article gives the theoretical justification of a professionally oriented approach to the analysis of the film and its application in the educational process. The main category of professionally-oriented approach is the pedagogical analysis of the film, which is understood as a set of targeted intellectual actions to identify and substantiate the socio-psychological, historical, moral and ethical problems of the film, educational situations, factors that create conditions for the development of personal qualities of children and youth, their worldview and behavior patterns. The pedagogical essence of Soviet cinema as a means of personality formation is disclosed. It is noted that the Soviet feature film about children in the war reveals the features of the socio-psychological and ideological conditions for the development of the child's personality, shows the circumstances that contribute to the unity of young citizens with the adult world and increase the effectiveness of education. The main thematic lines of Soviet films about children in the war are highlighted. The results of the study of the potential of Soviet feature films about children in the war as a means of moral and civic education and the ideas of future teachers about the conditions and ways of using these films in educational work are analyzed. The specific elements of methodological support for preparing students for the use of Soviet films about children in the war in the educational process are described.

AB  - This paper focuses on the evaluation of FY-3C MWHTS in terms of the calibration/validation exercise and initial assimilation trials in extreme weather. The observations are qualified for atmospheric profile retrievals and data assimilation by monitoring the on-orbit specifications of MWHTS. Experiments based on WRFDA were carried on and a case study is provided with track and intensity analysis. The discussion shows that the impact of MWHTS observations in assimilation trials over tropical cyclone Rammsun is significantly positive in the short range over the Western Ocean. The results of this paper suggest that MWHTS provides additional information of 118GHz, which is firstly used in meteorological satellite, also shows positive impact in the assimilation system.

TI  - Objective detection of gravity waves in Himawari-8 imagery in support of aviation forecasting
T2  - METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the applicability of an objective gravity wave detection method based on Gabor filter plus grating cell operators to Himawari-8 geostationary satellite imagery is investigated for the visible, water vapor and infrared window bands. The method was originally developed for imagery of the Meteosat Second Generation geostationary satellite programme; as Himawari-8 satellite data have higher spatial resolution, some adaptation efforts to find proper values for pixel-size-related parameters were undertaken, for each band individually. With the resulting slight modifications, it shows that the technique identifies gravity waves satisfactorily also in Himawari-8 imagery. By comparing two variants of the grating cell operator that were previously applied in the Meteosat application, it is confirmed that the more recent version consistently yields results closer to subjective recognition.

AB  - Geological remote sensing information extraction of the lithology has always been the hotspot and difficulty in remote sensing applications. Carbonate rocks covered more than 3.4 million km(2) in China. The study area is located around Stone Forest, which is World Natural Heritage. Sedimentary rocks distributes mainly in the area, and their spectral characteristics are complex and difficult to be recognized by remote sensing. Landsat OLI data was selected as the information source. The false color synthesis, principal component change, band ratio and other processing technologies of OLI data were applied to the lithological enhancement identification of carbonate rocks. Selected information will be used to improve the quality of the land-use planning.

TI  - Coseismic Rupture Geometry and Slip Rupture Process During the 2018 Mw 7.1 Anchorage, South-Central Alaska Earthquake: Intraplate Normal Faulting by Slab Tear Constrained by Geodetic and Teleseismic Data
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mw 7.1 Anchorage earthquake on 30 November 2018 beneath the south-central Alaska is a rare intermediate-depth event larger than Mw 7 that occurred in a complex subduction region, where the young Yakutat oceanic terrane wedges in the continental-oceanic plate collisional region between the Pacific oceanic plate and the North American plate. We use both ascending and descending Sentinel-1 satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images to construct the coseismic displacement associated with this earthquake, which shows a nearly circular deformation pattern with a subsidence of 4 cm in line of sight direction. Combining coseismic GPS data, we determine the focal mechanism of this event dominated by normal faulting with N-S striking of 186 degrees and westward dipping of 64 degrees by using a uniform slip model. Then we find a preferred slip model with both geodetic data and teleseismic data, suggesting the main slips are concentrated on a depth of 55-75 km. The total released moment of our preferred slip model is 5.32 x 10(19) N center dot m, equivalent to Mw 7.1. The rupture process includes two peaks terminating at about 18 s and indicates a unilateral rupture with its front propagating northwestward direction at an average speed of 2.5 km/s. In comparison with the detailed seismic image in this region, this event just occurred in the Yakutat terrane beneath a low velocity zone, suggesting it was caused by slab tear but not slab boundary breaking and determining the lower boundary of shallow thrust-slip in the Alaska subduction zone.

AB  - This letter proposes a new semantic segmentation network called IGFUnet to map the urban areas from large scale SAR images. The network is based on U-net structure which is especially suitable for semantic segmentation of small data set. Inception module is adopted as the encoder to extract rich and dense features. We develop a global feature attention module (GFA) as a channel attention module to perform feature correction on each decoding layer. Combing the inception module and GFA module can take full use of the feature map and efficiently integrate features from different scales. Qualitative and quantitative experiments based on Sentinel-1A have proved the effectiveness of our IGFUnet model.

TI  - Inundation Analysis Method for Urban Mountainous Areas Based on Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) Model Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding and waterlogging are frequent disasters that pose serious threats to the safety of human lives and infrastructure. We propose a method of estimating the inundation area in urban mountainous zones based on the soil conservation service curve number (SCS-CN) model. Remote sensing data are used to localize parameters and ensure model accuracy, and are combined with topographic maps to determine land-use type, slope, and waterlogged ground. Watershed analysis based on the SCS-CN model is performed to obtain rainfall-runoff data. The inundation area is then estimated from the rainfall data, and the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of the flood inundation area are analyzed from the perspective of land use. Experimental results from a case study in Mingxi, China, verify the effectiveness of this method for the analysis of flood inundation in urban mountainous areas.

AB  - Based on high resolution satellite images (ZY3, GF1) and Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+ data, the spatial and temporal variation of mangroves in Jiulong River estuary, Fujian from 1978 to 2018 were extracted by combining spectral prior knowledge and visual interpretation. The results showed that the area of mangrove forests has experienced three stages, respectively, slow increase (1980-1990), rapid expansion (1990-2013) and the rate of growth slowdown (2013-2018). In 1978, the area of mangrove resources was only 98.09 hectares, and it increased to 404.85 hectares in 2018. The constant combination of artificial planting and natural recovery was the main reason for maintaining the steady growth of mangrove areas. Meanwhile, land use policies, human activities, and ecological factors also exerted influence on the variation of mangrove in Jiulong River estuary.

AB  - Accurate mapping of paddy rice planting area is important for rice yield prediction. Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data is suitable for rice growth monitoring in cloudy and foggy weather. The potential of using quad-pol PolSAR parameters for rice area mapping needs exploration in detail. In this study, multi-temporal C-band quad-pol RADARSAT-2 datasets and random forest classification algorithm were used to identify the rice planting area in Meishan City, China in 2016. The backscatter coefficients, polarimetric variables and decomposition parameters were extracted and divided into groups as the inputs of random forest classifier. The decomposition parameters derived from single-day PolSAR data during the rice reproductive period were found the most practicable for rice area mapping, with the overall accuracy of 95.94% and kappa coefficient of 0.92.

TI  - Predicting Forest Cover in Distinct Ecosystems: The Potential of Multi-Source Sentinel-1 and-2 Data Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fusion of microwave and optical data sets is expected to provide great potential for the derivation of forest cover around the globe. As Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 are now both operating in twin mode, they can provide an unprecedented data source to build dense spatial and temporal high-resolution time series across a variety of wavelengths. This study investigates (i) the ability of the individual sensors and (ii) their joint potential to delineate forest cover for study sites in two highly varied landscapes located in Germany (temperate dense mixed forests) and South Africa (open savanna woody vegetation and forest plantations). We used multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and single time steps of Sentinel-2 data in combination to derive accurate forest/non-forest (FNF) information via machine-learning classifiers. The forest classification accuracies were 90.9% and 93.2% for South Africa and Thuringia, respectively, estimated while using autocorrelation corrected spatial cross-validation (CV) for the fused data set. Sentinel-1 only classifications provided the lowest overall accuracy of 87.5%, while Sentinel-2 based classifications led to higher accuracies of 91.9%. Sentinel-2 short-wave infrared (SWIR) channels, biophysical parameters (Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR)) and the lower spectrum of the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series were found to be most distinctive in the detection of forest cover. In contrast to homogenous forests sites, Sentinel-1 time series information improved forest cover predictions in open savanna-like environments with heterogeneous regional features. The presented approach proved to be robust and it displayed the benefit of fusing optical and SAR data at high spatial resolution.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we propose a new semisupervised method to detect the changes occurring in a geographical area after a major damage. We detect the changes by processing a pair of optical remote sensing images. The proposed method adopts a patch-based approach, whereby we use a Siamese convolutional neural network (S-CNN), trained with augmented data, to compare successive pairs of patches obtained from the input images. The main contribution of this work lies in developing an S-CNN training phase without resorting to class labels that are actually not available from the input images. We train the S-CNN using genuine and impostor patch-pairs defined in a semisupervised way from the input images. We tested the proposed change detection model on four real datasets and compared its performance to those of two existing models. The obtained results were very promising.

AB  - This study was to investigate the effect of SSI writing program on pre-service biology teachers’ perception for SSI-related ‘character and values’ and ‘SSI teaching’. The subject of this study was 28 pre-service biology teachers at J University's College of Education. As a result of the analysis, there was a significant difference in character and value between the pre-test and post-test. In addition, the ecological worldview, social and moral empathy, and social responsibility showed significant differences between the pre-test and post-tests. These results indicated that the SSI writing program has a positive effect on improving the character and values of proe-service biology teachers. In addition, it was analyzed whether there was any change in perception of SSI teaching before and after the application of the SSI writing program.There was a significant difference between pre-test and post-test in the perception of SSI teaching. The results of this study revealed that the SSI writing program has a positive effect on pre-service biology teachers’ perceptions for ‘character and value’ and SSI teaching. Therefore, efforts to introduce the SSI writing program into the teacher education curriculum are needed to cultivate character and values, and to raise perception of SSI teaching.

AB  - This paper analyzes the worldviews of Haruki Murakami's short story Barn Burning and the movie Burning directed by Lee Chang Dong and presents the worldview of those works. In doing so, it attempts to derive the point that this worldview depends on the historical values ​​of the time. This is especially true in the case of Burning, which is a meta narrative; in this story, Jongsu wrote a novel not because of truth, but because of anger, which I consider a point of violence.The novel Barn Burning is a work on whether a novelist, the main character ‘I’, can accept the world parallel world. On the other hand, the movie Burning shows that there are multiple facts by recognition, and it is about a meta novel in which Jongsu, aspiring to be a novelist, writes novels. Jongsu feels that the world is a mystery, but with the disappearance of Hemi, he recognizes one fact and finally completes the novel. And it was the anger by the class differences that prompted the writing of Jongsu’s novel.The novel Barn Burning depicts multiple existing worlds, including a parallel world that reflects the postmodernism of the 1980s. On the other hand, Burning depicts the process of completing a novel by selecting one of several facts that exists for Jongsu, who aspires to be a novelist. Jongsu wrote the novel as a sign of anger in the class society, which reflects the reality of South Korean youth.

AB  - This study analyzed Kim Il-yeop’s (1896-1971) poetry using the perspective of the healing thoughts of Nietzsche and Buddhism. It is an attempt to examine the process in which the poet overcomes her inner pained heals her self by investigating the healing mechanism in the thought of Nietzsche and Buddhism, as expressed in her poetry. Kim Il-yeop is a reputed early modern female writer in Korean literary history, as well as a religionist, she insisted on the reform of women’s consciousness, advocating for a modern women’s movement by starting the publication of women’s magazine New Woman in February 1920. Subsequently, she became a Buddhist monk and died as a Zen monk. Her life is often compared to a lotus, blooming in hardship and pain, from her childhood when she experienced her mother’s death and her brothers’ successive deaths in her youth filled with love and partings to repeated marriages and divorces in the prime of her life. Thus, the thoughts guiding Kim Il-yeop’s life, such as subjectivity, positive worldview, love of fate (Amor Fati), self- salvation, and the absence of worldly desires, are present in the same context as the healing thoughts of Nietzsche and Buddhism, and are analyzed in this study.Although Kim Il-yeop witnessed the deaths of her mother, brothers, father and stepsister during her childhood and experienced hardships later in life, she accepted the moments of pains as they were and expressed them through poetry, a language of her own. This is connected to Nietzsche’s healing thought, that is, search for oneself through the love of fate. Kim Il-yeop who obtained the identity of the independent self, got over hardship by writing poetry using healing language based on the fact that nature and the universe operate according to the principle of creation. Through her experience of hardship, the poet achieves the absence of the worldly desires through the unity of the body and the mind and overcomes her self through the purification of the mind to achieve the introspection of freedom from all thoughts and ideas, turning to Buddhism and continuing asceticism.

AB  - Reservoir storage and water level information is essential for accurate drought monitoring and prediction. In particular, the agricultural drought hasincreased the risk of agricultural water shortages due to regional bias in reservoirs and water supply facilities, which are major water supply facilitiesfor agricultural water. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the available water capacity of the reservoir, and it is necessary to determine the watersurface area and water capacity. Remote sensing provides images of temporal water storage and level variations, and a combination of both measurementtechniques can indicate a change in water volume. In areas of ungauged water volume, satellite remote sensing image acts as a powerful tool to measurechanges in surface water level. The purpose of this study is to estimate of reservoir storage and level variations using satellite remote sensing imagecombined with hydrological statistical data and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). Water surface areas were estimated using the Sentinel-2satellite images in Seosan, Chungcheongnam-do from 2016 to 2018. The remote sensing-based reservoir storage estimation algorithm from this studyis general and transferable to applications for lakes and reservoirs. The data set can be used for improving the representation of water resourcesmanagement for incorporating lakes into weather forecasting models and climate models, and hydrologic processes.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the urban spaces described in the novels Hon and Isangchon written by Jeong Yeon-gyu (1899–1979) and published by Hansung Book Co., Ltd. during the eras of colonial capitalism and socialism. In Hon, the author depicts Gyeongseong’s spaces being eroded by money because of colonial capitalism in 1921, while in Isangchon, he depicts Gyeongsung in 2023, 102 years later.Both these works deal with two separate eras, but they share a single worldview, and Hon is one in the content, and Isangchon is a sequel.The protagonist of Isangchon is the author, Jeong Yeon-Gyu, himself.In Hon, Jeong Yeon-kyu depicts the Gyeongseong of the 1920s that witnessed accelerated modernization due to colonial capitalism. In the 1920s, as observed by Jeong Yeon-gyu, Gyeongseong was a dark city where materialism was rampant, and it was difficult to receive human treatment without money. Each of the four sisters appearing in Hon is a victim of capitalism who yearns to escape from the system.Each part of Gyeongseong, which is revealed in Hon and Isangchon, can be examined by categorizing it into closed, open, and trapped spaces.This can be said to be closely related to the “city with harmonious nature” mentioned in Kim Mi-yeon’s recent research. Jeong Yeon-gyu describes the Gyeongseong of 1921 as “the Sakhaman world in the black smoke,” which means Gyeongseong is dominated by capital.However, Gyeongsangseong in “Isangchon,” where capitalism has disappeared, is described as “Best Yucheonji with a good landscape.” It can be said that Kyungsung is finally free from capitalism and ultimately returns to nature. In the end, for the author Jung Yeon-gyu himself, Kyungsung in Horn is described as a capitalist dystopia, while Gyungsung in Isangchon is a socialist utopia.

AB  - During recent years, the heat environment and particulate matter (PM10) have become serious environmental problems, as increases in heat waves due to rising global temperature interact with weakening atmospheric wind speeds. There exist urban heat islands and urban pollution islands with higher temperatures and air pollution concentrations than other areas. However, few studies have examined these issues together because of a lack of micro-scale data, which can be constructed from spatial data. Today, with the help of satellite images and big data collected by private telecommunication companies, detailed spatial distribution analyses are possible. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the spatial distribution patterns of urban heat islands and urban pollution islands within Busan Metropolitan City and to compare the distributions of the two phenomena. In this study, the land surface temperature of Landsat 8 satellite images, air temperature and particulate matter concentration data derived from a private automated meteorological observation system were gridded in 30m × 30m units, and spatial analysis was performed. Analysis showed that simultaneous zones of urban heat islands and urban pollution islands included some vulnerable residential areas and industrial areas. The political migration areas such as Seo-dong and Bansong-dong, representative vulnerable residential areas in Busan, were included in the co-occurring areas. The areas have a high density of buildings and poor ventilation, most of whose residents are vulnerable to heat waves and air pollution; thus, these areas must be considered first when establishing related policies. In the industrial areas included in the co-occurring areas, concrete or asphalt concrete-based impervious surfaces accounted for an absolute majority, and not only was the proportion of vegetation insufficient, there was also considerable vehicular traffic. A hot-spot analysis examining the reliability of the analysis confirmed that more than 99.96% of the regions corresponded to hot-spot areas at a 99% confidence level.

AB  - Droughts have turned out to be a standout amongst the most discussed natural hazards in the recent past due to its adverse impacts on humankind. The effects of drought differ from region to region and time to time. Unlike, the other cataclysmic events, a drought is a mind-boggling phenomenon due to its longer propagation time and the effects being long-lasting. This study focuses on analysing the spatial and temporal variations of the drought in the Kirindi Oya basin which lies in the intermediate, dry and arid climatological zones. Daily remotely sensed precipitation data for a span of 37 years from 1979-2017 has been used with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees. Several drought indices, namely Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Deciles, Percent of Normal, Rainfall Anomaly Index and Z index have been considered. A comparative analysis of the applicability of each drought index along with the validation by ground reality is presented.The results of the study imply the importance of conducting a study at the sub-basin scale for the river basins lying in several vastly different climatological regions. The Kirindi Oya basin that is considered, lies in three different climatological regions, where the upper Kirindi Oya subbasin is in the intermediate zone, the lower Kirindi Oya in the arid zone and the rest in the dry zone. The results indicate that the effects of drought can vary even within a river basin and a sub basin scale analysis of drought gives a comparatively accurate interpretation of the variation of drought within the basin. Furthermore, the recent findings confirms that the drought prediction at a sub basin scale is more effective for river basins which lie in several climate zones.

TI  - CContextualizing Colonial Connections: Reevaluating Takekoshi Yosaburo's <i>Japanese Rule in Formosa</i>
T2  - JAPAN REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1907, Japanese Rule in Formosa was published in London. It was the English translation of Taiwan tochi shi (1905), a book about Japan's colonization of Taiwan by Japanese popular historian and liberal politician Takekoshi Yosaburo. Japanese Rule in Formosa proved remarkably influential, both at the time and in postwar historiography. Although isolated quotes from the 1907 work are frequently used by present-day historians, little attention has been granted to the political context in which it was published or the accuracy of the translation. The fact that Takekoshi advocated an unambiguous form of colonial rule in which the Japanese constitution would not apply in Taiwan placed him at odds with other leaders of his liberal Seiyukai party who wanted Taiwan to be merged into Japan's administrative and legal structures. Takekoshi's stance reveals that colonial debates did not always match up with other political or philosophical fault lines. His ideas were, however, consistent with his liberal worldview, and engaged in global, trans-imperial dialogue about assimilation and association in a colonial administration. This article will position Takekoshi's work within the contemporaneous Japanese debate over Taiwan's legal status and argue that, although the timing of its publication meant that it had little influence in Japan, it had a significant effect on the attitudes of colonialist scholars in Europe and America towards Japanese imperialism.

T2  - NORDIC JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Jurgen Habermas's recent work deserves critical engagement from scholars who study religion. His analysis of the religious heritage of the modern Western world identifies important sources, topics, and challenges to modern societies that have distanced themselves from a metaphysical and religious worldview. Taking his point of departure in the axial age and its universalist tendencies, he shows that this development caused changes in religion and society that still are relevant if one wants to understand the role of religion in contemporary society. Nevertheless, it can be critically argued that Habermas's work would have benefited from more direct engagement with empirical studies of contemporary religion, and that this would have led to a more informed understanding of religion in contemporary life-worlds.

AB  - Forest and land fire is one of the causes of peatlands deforestation. Forest and land fire occurred at the beginning of land clearing activities for land conversion known as Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). Spatio-temporal data mining technique can be used for estimation of deforested peatland area and its association with forest and land fire. The previous study has compared two classified Landsat 8 images in order to estimate the land cover change in Rokan Hilir district, Riau Province. This research aims to develop an application to automate peatland deforestation estimation due to the forest and land fire using the Shiny framework in R programming language. The data used are Landsat 8 images in 2014 and 2016 of Riau Province and MODIS burned area data product (MCD64A1) image in 2015 of Riau Province. The system was developed using Adaptive Software Development (ASD) method. The main features of the system are land cover area comparison and land cover changes due to forest and land fire calculation. The testing results show that both of the features are successfully implemented. With the automation system in estimating deforestation of peatlands due to forest and land fire, the proses of estimating deforestation levels in peatlands in relation to forest and land fire can easily be done.

AB  - The study about land-use changes, especially in conserved forests, is necessary to determine the processes of management and protection of the area. This study aimed to detect land-use changes between 2000, 2008, and 2016 and predict the situation in the year 2024 in the Doi Suthep-Pui National Park, Chiang Mai province. Landsat-5TM (2000) and Landsat-8TM (2008 and 2016) satellite images were analyzed to predict the land-use changes around 2024 combined with an analysis between geographic information system (GIS) and CA-Markov model using the geospatial monitoring and modeling program. Temporary plots of 30 m x 30 m size (similar to satellite image resolution), were established in each land-use type to check the ground accuracy. The results showed that the forest area in Doi Suthep-Pui National Park decreased during the study period (16 years). Through the first period (2000-2008), 2.19 km2 and second period (20082016), 5.05 km2 of forest changed to either agriculture or urban lands, especially mixed deciduous forest and lower montane forest. There was a similar trend in the 2024 prediction, showing an effect on the distribution of forest patches. A habitat loss would be expected to result in a biodiversity, thus, a management plan in the future should be developed to practice sustainable land-use changes.

M3  - Article
AB  - Mythology is an essential part in the worldview of the human race. It is here where the basis of the original peoples and their evolutionary development are found: in the symbolic universe that concentrates its paradigms. In this sense, this article is part of the findings of the thesis work entitled: "Local worldviews: traditions, customs and oral literature in the cofradias (brotherhoods) from Izalco", to obtain the Bachelor's degree in Anthropology from Universidad Tecnologica de El Salvador. One of the specific objectives was to infer the presence of the foundational myths on human creation through the oral literature from Izalco around linguistic relativism, as found in the indigenous cofradias in this city. This thesis work was conducted between march and November 2018, in the urban area of the city of Izalco. In order to collect qualitative data, the following techniques from the ethnographic method were used: the rapport, interviews--both guided and not guided--. These instruments were used with the mayordomos (religious administrator) Alonso Garcia, from the "Padre Eterno" cofradia ("Eternal Father brotherhood), and Don Lipe Pilia Chile, from the San Francisco de Asis cofradia (Saint Francis of Assisi brotherhood); they were also used to interview Miguel Angel Palma Gomez, tour operator in Izalco.

AB  - A collection of functions used in remote sensing analysis (e.g., conversion from digital numbers to radiance, reflectance, and temperature). It includes several algorithms to calculate the albedo: Liang (2000) , Silva et al. (2016) , Tasumi et al. (2008) , among others; and include functions to derive several spectral indices. Although the current version implements basic functions, it will be expandable to a more robust tool for water cycle modeling (e.g., to include surface runoff and evapotranspiration calculations) in the near future. This package is under development at the Institute about Natural Resources Research (INIRENA) from the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo. Copyright: GPL (= 3)

TI  - Inventory and mapping of forest variables through remote sensors in Quintana Roo state, Mexico
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensors in combination with information derived from forest inventories estimate variables of interest with precision and low cost. The objective was to estimate the basal area (AB), timber volume (VTA) and aboveground biomass (B) in different forest ecosystems using Landsat ETM information and National Forest and Soil Inventory (INFyS) in Quintana Roo, Mexico. A correlation matrix was generated between INFyS data and spectral information, and later, a multiple linear regression model. With the selected equations, spatial distribution maps of AB (m(2) ha(-1)), VTA (m(3) ha(-1)) and B (Mg ha(-1)) were generated. The total inventory was estimated using three approaches: i) Reason Estimators (ERaz), ii) Regression Estimators (EReg), and iii) Estimators of Random Simple Sampling. The first two approaches correspond to the alternative inventory using remote sensors and the third corresponds to the traditional inventory. The correlation coefficient IN as greater than the normalized difference index with 0.35, 0.39 and 0.39 for AB, VTA and B. The regression models had adjusted determination coefficients of 0.28, 0.32 and 0.32 to estimate AB, VTA and B, respectively. The three estimators are statistically different and show that the EReg is the most conservative and with precision in AB, VTA and B of 2.73%, 2.92% and 2.71%, respectively, in addition to confidence intervals of smaller amplitude than the MSA and ERaz. By updating the inventory using remote sensors, the process of evaluating forest resources and their planning is improved.

TI  - MAPPING A SUITABLE HABITAT FOR MONTEZUMA QUAIL (<i>Cyrtonyx montezumae</i>) IN CENTRAL MEXICO
T2  - AGROCIENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Montezuma quail (Cyrtonyx montezumae) is a small endemic bird in the southwestern USA and southeastern Oaxaca, Mexico. Populations of this game species are in danger, mainly due to anthropogenic activities that have fragmented their habitat; however, information on its distribution and abundance is scarce. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify a suitable habitat for the Montezuma quail in Estado de Mexico, Mexico, with remote sensing and field records modeled by geographic information systems. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify a suitable habitat for Montezuma quail in northwestern Mexico. Altitude, slope, aspect, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and six spectral bands of Landsat 7 ETM+ 2000 were used in this study. The analysis was based on the Mahalanobis statistical distance combined with a Geographic Information System (GIS) and required information on the species presence within the study area. The study generated a probability map of the suitable habitat for Montezuma quail with p>0.50. The p classes considered were 0.50-0.60, 0.60-0.70, 0.70-0.80, and 0.80-1.0. As the probability increased, the size of the area defined as an adequate habitat for Montezuma quail decreased. The sizes of the areas by probability classes were 601, 228, 62, and 9 km(2), respectively. The model detected 900 km(2) of suitable habitat for Montezuma quail in the study area, which was distributed in different locations.

TI  - An Assessment of Surface Water Detection Methods for Water Resource Management in the Nigerien Sahel
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is a scarce, but essential resource in the Sahel. Rainfed ephemeral ponds and lakes that dot the landscape are necessary to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and pastoralists who rely on these resources to irrigate crops and hydrate cattle. The remote location and dispersed nature of these water bodies limits typical methods of monitoring, such as with gauges; fortunately, remote sensing offers a quick and cost-effective means of regularly measuring surface water extent in these isolated regions. Dozens of operational methods exist to use remote sensing to identify waterbodies, however, their performance when identifying surface water in the semi-arid Sahel has not been well-documented and the limitations of these methods for the region are not well understood. Here, we evaluate two global dynamic surface water datasets, fifteen spectral indices developed to classify surface water extent, and three simple decision tree methods created specifically to identify surface water in semi-arid environments. We find that the existing global surface water datasets effectively minimize false positives, but greatly underestimate the presence and extent of smaller, more turbid water bodies that are essential to local livelihoods, an important limitation in their use for monitoring water availability. Three of fifteen spectral indices exhibited both high accuracy and threshold stability when evaluated over different areas and seasons. The three simple decision tree methods had mixed performance, with only one having an overall accuracy that compared to the best performing spectral indices. We find that while global surface water datasets may be appropriate for analysis at the global scale, other methods calibrated to the local environment may provide improved performance for more localized water monitoring needs.

TI  - A method for estimating the socioeconomic impact of Earth observations in wildland fire suppression decisions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for estimating the socioeconomic impact of Earth observations is proposed and deployed. The core of the method is the analysis of outcomes of hypothetical fire suppression scenarios generated using a coupled atmosphere-fire behaviour model, based on decisions made by an experienced wildfire incident management team with and without the benefits of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite observations and the WRF-SFIRE wildfire behaviour simulation system. The scenarios were based on New Mexico's 2011 Las Conchas fire. For each scenario, fire break line location decisions served as inputs to the model, generating fire progression outcomes. Fire model output was integrated with a property database containing thousands of coordinates and property values and other asset values to estimate the total losses associated with each scenario. An attempt to estimate the socioeconomic impact of satellite and modelling data used during the decision-making process was made. We analysed the impact of Earth observations and include considerations for estimating other socioeconomic impacts.

AB  - The overall aim of this work is to provide land-use and land-cover change information as part of the KULUNDA project to develop sustainable land management policies and practices to stabilize agricultural yields and minimize ongoing degradation and desertification processes. The area under investigation comprises around 80,000 km(2) and belongs to what is thought of as Russia's granary, an essential area in ensuring adequate food supply. Inadequate and outdated cultivation and agricultural management practices have caused ecological and socio-economic problems including soil degradation, desertification and yield losses. The focus of this work is the quantification and assessment of land-use and land-cover changes over time. Multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite data and historical topographic maps were used to detect changes of specific land-use and land-cover classes. The present work utilizes pixel-based data classification approaches as well as object-based concepts and uses Landsat MSS, TM5, ETM and RapidEye data. For the 1950s, a GIS map layer-based approach is used and calibrated with panchromatic airphotograph data mosaics. Results of the land-use change mapping show an increase in cropland until 1989 of nearly 1 mio ha and a decrease until 2013/2014 of 500,000 ha directly connected to a decrease in grassland and steppe area until 1989 and an increase in grassland until 2013/2014. This study for the first time quantifies the land-cover change over 60 years in the Kulunda steppe region of Russia.

AB  - Forest fires have been a severe hydrometeorological hazard during the dry season in Indonesia. Pulang Pisau Regency in Central Kalimantan has become one of the most forest fires affected areas during the 2015 El Nino event. Based on MODIS data, more than 120.000 hotspots have been recorded between 2014 and 2019. Previous studies concluded that peatlands act as contributing factor to forest fires in this country. This study proposed the peat-effect on the development of machine learning models for forest fire susceptibility (FFS), which can be alternative tool to support forest fire disaster management. In addition to the peat effect, such as elevation, slope, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), rainfall, distance from the road network, and distance from the residents also analyzed. Those variables were divided into training (2014 - 2018) and testing (2019). Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Classifications (SVC), and Gradient Boosting Classification (GBC) models were used to build the FFS map. The experiment results showed an increase in Area Under Curve (AUC) from 0.84 - 0.87 to 0.87 - 0.88 with the addition of the peat depth variable. The complete test resulted in the highest accuracy of 0.80 in the RF and SVC.

AB  - This study aims to estimate potential fishing zones by estimating the abundance of skipjack fish in the Makassar Strait using satellite data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques. The data used consists of catch coordinates, skipjack catches, oceanographic data from satellite imagery with high-resolution Spectra-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua data (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a), Etopo1 for depth, and Aviso for the current speed. The prediction of skipjack tuna abundance is calculated by the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) prediction function to determine the best parameters seen from the AIC and GCV value, then mapped using geographic information system techniques by using the multi-regression formula. The results showed that the most potential fishing ground for skipjack tuna in the Makassar Strait was in March 2018 with an estimated abundance of more than 477 fish km(-2) at coordinates 118.1297 east longitude and -3.3814 southern latitude. We suggest that efforts to catch Skipjack Tuna are directed to this area for more profitable catches.

TI  - The terror management effects of a disaster song
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF MUSIC
M3  - Article
AB  - Following terror management theory (TMT), we hypothesized that listening to a disaster song could increase cultural worldview defenses in a manner similar to the mortality-stimulating essay typically used in TMT research. Participants were divided into four groups. Two of the groups received death-related themes: one wrote an essay about dying and the other group heard a song about men who died in a shipwreck. The other two groups received pain-related stimuli: one wrote an essay about dental pain and the other heard a song about a migrant worker's painful separation from family. Dependent variables examined pro-social behavior, ranking one's country, children, and emotions. Results showed similar effects for the mortality-stimulating essay and the disaster song on two variables: ranking one's country in the world and the importance of having children. In addition, compared to the pain-of-separation song, the disaster song produced significantly more negative and less positive emotion ratings; the emotion ratings of the essay groups did not differ significantly. Results show that a disaster song can produce effects similar to those that have been observed for a mortality-stimulating essay. Further, the effects of disaster songs may extend to strengthening cultural worldview defenses.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes the application of machine learning techniques to develop state-of-the-art detection and prediction system for spatiotemporal events found within remote sensing data; specifically, harmful algal bloom (HAB) events. We propose HAB detection system based on a ground truth historical record of HAB events, a novel spatiotemporal datacube representation of each event (from MODIS and GEBCO bathymetry data), and a variety of machine learning architectures utilizing the state-of-the-art spatial and temporal analysis methods based on convolutional neural networks, long short-term memory components together with random forest, and support vector machine classification methods. This work has focused specifically on the case study of the detection of Karenia brevis algae (K. brevis) HAB events within the coastal waters of Florida (over 2850 events from 2003 to 2018; an order of magnitude larger than any previous machine learning detection study into HAB events). The development of multimodal spatiotemporal datacube data structures and associated novel machine learning methods give a unique architecture for the automatic detection of environmental events. Specifically, when applied to the detection of HAB events, it gives a maximum detection accuracy of 91% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.81 for the Florida data considered. A HAB forecast system was also developed where a temporal subset of each datacube was used to predict the presence of a HAB in the future. This system was not significantly less accurate than the detection system being able to predict with 86% accuracy up to 8 d in the future.

Bandung is located at a basin-shaped area and has a variety of land cover, natural and man-made. The diversity of land cover is indicated to have an effect on the characteristics of the land surface temperature recorded by satellite sensing sensor. This assumption then examined by considering the land cover type and the value of land surface temperature as its parameters. This research aims to: 1) Estimating the land surface temperature with digital image processing, 2) Visual interpreting of land cover type based on land surface temperature similarity, and 3) Analyze the level of land surface temperature with a variation of land cover type in the south-western part of Bandung Basin. The visual interpretation method was used to obtain a land cover type with high-resolution image. Whereas the transformation of the Landsat 8 thermal band index is used to acquire the land surface temperature. An analysis was carried out to observe the results of land surface temperature estimation and land cover based on land surface temperature resemblance. Then it is expected to be a consideration in terms of determining policies regarding conversion of land cover from natural to artificial forms indicated as a contributing factor to rising land surface temperatures.

TI  - A Framework for Multiple Ground Target Finding and Inspection Using a Multirotor UAS
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Small unmanned aerial systems (UASs) now have advanced waypoint-based navigation capabilities, which enable them to collect surveillance, wildlife ecology and air quality data in new ways. The ability to remotely sense and find a set of targets and descend and hover close to each target for an action is desirable in many applications, including inspection, search and rescue and spot spraying in agriculture. This paper proposes a robust framework for vision-based ground target finding and action using the high-level decision-making approach of Observe, Orient, Decide and Act (OODA). The proposed framework was implemented as a modular software system using the robotic operating system (ROS). The framework can be effectively deployed in different applications where single or multiple target detection and action is needed. The accuracy and precision of camera-based target position estimation from a low-cost UAS is not adequate for the task due to errors and uncertainties in low-cost sensors, sensor drift and target detection errors. External disturbances such as wind also pose further challenges. The implemented framework was tested using two different test cases. Overall, the results show that the proposed framework is robust to localization and target detection errors and able to perform the task.

TI  - 'Devi Needs those Rituals!' Ontological Considerations on Ritual Transformations in a Contemporary South Indian srividya Tradition
T2  - RELIGIONS OF SOUTH ASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Negotiations between continuity and discontinuity have characterized srividya traditions for centuries; these are primarily studied through texts or the juxtaposition of textual prescriptions with observed practices, leaving the process of how srividya practitioners negotiate esoteric and orthodox tendencies unexplored. Building on extensive fieldwork among practitioners of a contemporary South Indian srividya tradition, I present the dynamics animating such transformations. Focusing on kalavahana, one of the tradition's central rituals aimed at identifying with Devi, I trace the underlying forces that gradually replace its most esoteric aspects (centred around the body and pleasure) with conventional worship (external or meditative practices), refashioning the tradition as part of mainstream saktism. While some practitioners conform to the new canon, others, for whom the changes diminish ritual efficacy, secretly continue embodied practices. Through a Foucauldian archaeologico-genealogical analysis, I investigate which regimes of truth and ontological coordinates allow the ritual to change, and which diminish its efficacy. While at first negotiations between continuity and discontinuity appear driven by socio-political motives, ultimately they are governed and legitimized by fundamentally diverging modes of being. A pre-objectified worldview demands embodied experiences (including unconventional practices invoking pleasure) while a dualistic framework endorses representational practices (such as meditation and idol-worship).

AB  - In this paper, the characteristics and the efficiency of several existing open format specifications for PPP/PPP-RTK services are analyzed, and a general message format for satellite-based open PPP/PPP-RTK services to maximize their interoperability is proposed. The interoperable format is defined as an extension of Compact SSR, a highly efficient RTCM-compatible open format applied for QZS CLAS. The format needs to support the global-scale PPP service as well as nation-wide PPP-RTK service using the constellation of MEO/IGSO/GEO satellites. To support global PPP using a multiple satellite data link and multiple generations of GNSS constellations efficiently, the satellite grouping using multiple satellite masks is introduced. The consistency and the resilience of the SSR correction messages under the condition of partial loss of messages are discussed. For the case study, the format is applied to a global PPP service using MEO constellation and a nation-wide PPP-RTK service using IGSO/GEO and analyzed.

TI  - Evaluation of the influence of disturbances on forest vegetation using Landsat time series; a case study of the Low Tatras National Park
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is focused on the evaluation of forest vegetation changes that took place between 1992 and 2015 in the Low Tatras National Park in Slovakia, using time series on Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 data. Time-series analysis was performed by evaluating the development of six vegetation indices in nine different localities selected based on the type of damage. The CDR (Climate Data Records) of the Landsat data was first normalized using the PIF method, and the trajectories of the used vegetation indices were compared with in-situ data. The area was damaged by both wind and bark beetles that significantly affected the forest vegetation in the Low Tatras National Park at the beginning of the 21st century. The results confirmed the excellent predictive abilities of vegetation indices based on SWIR bands (e.g. NDMI) for the purpose of evaluating the individual stages of a disaster. The use of the Landsat data CDR in the research of long-term forest vegetation changes is of high relevance and perspective owing to the free availability and distribution of the corrected data. Finally, several applications of remote sensing data are proposed for the management and the protection of national parks.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This article aims to examine the poetic world of Dunheon Yim Byeong‐chan, a bureaucrat and head of Uibyeong (civil army) who worked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Yim Byeong‐chan(林炳瓚) started Uibyeong with Choi Ik‐hyeon(崔益鉉) in Taein(泰仁) in 1906, and he worked at the Headquarter of Korean Independence Righteous Civil Army after Imperial Japan’s forced merger of Korea.The poems of Yim Byeong‐chan rarely include works of Eumpungnongwolryu (category of poetry enjoying leisurely nature/吟風弄月類). The sincerity coming from the life of patriotism is consistent with his works. Sincerity is different from weak feelings and somatic feelings. It has the power to rebound even in times of despair and never gives up on a positive future. His poems can be divided into three periods such as Taein Uibyeong period~sushima(對馬島) exile period; after returning home~Headquarter of Korean Independence Righteous Civil Army period; and Geomundo(巨文島) exile period. The works of the first period emphasize the enhancement of good cause, which is Taein Uibyeong’s goal, and the righteousness not yielding to the pressure of Imperial Japan flows to the bottom of his works. In the second period, there are various emotional reactions to Imperial Japan’s forced merge of Korea appearing in his works, but it can be seen that he was not buried by such feelings and worried about the direction of the new anti‐Japan movement. The characteristic is the appearance of various forms related to “Yimunjemu (forestalling a sword with a pen/以文制武).” In the third period, although Geomundo’s natural objects confirm his values ​​and refine his mental attitude, he overcame private feelings and in a public dimension his concerns are seen in the state and people. The life of Yim Byeong‐chan is summarized in patriotism and love of the people, and it is a process of realizing his beliefs armed with righteousness. However, he knew how to handle the situation and coped flexibly in terms of anti‐Japan methods. As seen in the name of Bugwae(復卦) that often appears in his works, he had a conviction that light would come again there one day. The core of Yim Byeong‐chan’s poems can be the indomitable righteousness and the optimistic attitude toward the world.

TI  - Mapping and Analyzing the Evolution of the Butangbunasi Landslide Using Landsat Time Series with Respect to Heavy Rainfall Events during Typhoons
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Large rainfall-induced landslides are among the most dangerous natural hazards in Taiwan, posing a risk for people and infrastructure. Thus, better knowledge about the evolution of landslides and their impact on the downstream area is of high importance for disaster mitigation. The aim of this study is twofold: (1) to semi-automatically map the evolution of the Butangbunasi landslide in south-central Taiwan using satellite remote sensing data, and (2) to investigate the potential correlation between changes in landslide area and heavy rainfall during typhoon events. Landslide area, as well as temporary landslide-dammed lakes, were semi-automatically identified using object-based image analysis (OBIA), based on 20 Landsat images from 1984 to 2018. Hourly rainfall data from the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (CWB) was complemented with rainfall data from Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) to examine the potential relationship between landslide area changes and rainfall as a triggering factor. The OBIA mapping results revealed that the most significant landslide extension happened after typhoon Morakot in 2009. We found a moderate positive relationship between the landslide area change and the duration of the heavy rainfall event, whereas daily precipitation, cumulative rainfall and mean intensity did not present strong significant correlations.

AB  - Fire dynamics in the Brazilian Savannas (Cerrado) is related to climatic conditions and management interventions by human activities. Thus, the fire occurrence in conservation units (UCs) may be different when compared with their buffer zones. Our results, obtained by burned area analysis, demonstrate that buffer zones have the most significant variation in the burned area over the years when compared to the burned area inside the UC, such as the Jalapao State Park. In contrast, when the buffer zone presents agricultural activities, as occurs in the Chapada dos Veadeiros and Chapada das Mesas National Parks, or urban occupation, such as the Brasilia National Park, the proportions of burned area are lower than found inside the UCs, according to data obtained from the MODIS MCD64A1 product from 2001 to 2018 years.

AB  - Gypsum-rich material covers the hillslopes above similar to 1000 m of the Atacama and forms the particular landscape. In this contribution, we evaluate random forest-based analysis in order to predict the gypsum distribution in a specific area of similar to 3000 km(2), located in the hyperarid core of the Atacama. Therefore, three different sets of input variables were chosen. These variables reflect the different factors forming soil properties, according to digital soil mapping. The variables are derived from indices based on imagery of the ASTER and Landsat-8 satellite, geomorphometric parameters based on the Tandem-X World DEM (TM), as well as selected climate variables and geologic units. These three different models were used to evaluate the Ca-content derived from soil surface samples, reflecting gypsum content. All three different models derived high values of explained variation (r(2) > 0.886), the RMSE is 4500 mg-kg-t and the NRMSE is similar to 6%. Overall, this approach shows promising results in order to derive a gypsum content prediction for the whole Atacama. However, further investigation on the independent variables need to he conducted. In this case, the ferric oxides index (representing magnetite content), slope and a temperature gradient are the most important factors for predicting gypsum content.

AB  - During February 2018-January 2019, we conducted large-scale surveillance for the presence and prevalence of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and louping ill virus (LIV) in sentinel animals and ticks in the United Kingdom. Serum was collected from 1,309 deer culled across England and Scotland. Overall, 4% of samples were ELISA-positive for the TBEV serocomplex. A focus in the Thetford Forest area had the highest proportion (47.7%) of seropositive samples. Ticks collected from culled deer within seropositive regions were tested for viral RNA; 5 of 2,041 ticks tested positive by LIV/TBEV real-time reverse transcription PCR, all from within the Thetford Forest area. From 1 tick, we identified a full-length genomic sequence of TBEV. Thus, using deer as sentinels revealed a potential TBEV focus in the United Kingdom. This detection of TBEV genomic sequence in UK ticks has important public health implications, especially for undiagnosed encephalitis.

AB  - In the 1960s and 1970s, the ideology and zeitgeist of politics, society and culture could be summed up as nationalism with a new state construction above any value. The Park Chung-hee administration, which was established after the May 16 military coup, established a strong centralized system by presenting various ideologies to establish a regime. The culture and arts policy also encouraged internalization of national ideology through various performance laws, revision of performance laws, and censorship systems as an extension of the powerful centralized system. Therefore, writers find a detour that criticizes reality in historical material. In this topography, the aspects of historical material plays were found to be a national ideology or nationalism. At this time, writers take an attitude of resisting ideology by repeating it by transferring the nation’s ruling ideology or portraying pessimistic and critical people.This article focuses on Yoon Dae-sung and Noh Kyung-sik, who depict the lives of the Korean people against the backdrop of the war disaster, and selects Yoon Dae-sung’s “Mangnani” (1969) and Noh Kyung-sik’s “Moon-house” (1971) as the subjects of analysis. The two works were first created after the revision of the Second Act in 1966, and were performed at the National Theater of Korea after passing the script review. Both films shed light on the “survival” of the characters who went through hardships. Yoon Dae-sung and Noh Kyung-sik went through the mouths of Chen-su of “Mangnani” and Gan-nan of “Moon-house” respectively. reveal the sorrow of the ruling class, who silently continue their livelihoods, not the cause and cause for the nation and the people for the sake of the nation and the people who are not related to ideology, and the survival itself of the people who are devastated by war. Survival, of course, is a human instinct, but the way it survives depends on human will. At this point, the way of survival depends on the author’s worldview and the author’s perception of reality.Recalling that full-fledged discussions on the people have been active since the 1970s in Korea, the two authors’ works can be meaningful in that they have described the lives of the people and, although they are single, presented the people’s images due to their contemporary perception of reality.

AB  - Land cover maps are derived from satellite and aerial images by the Ministry of Environment for the entire Korea since 1998. Even with their wide application in many sectors, their usage in research community is limited. The main reason for this is the map compilation cycle varies too much over the different regions. The situation requires us a new and quicker methodology for generating land cover maps. This study was conducted to automatically generate land cover map using aerial ortho-images and Landsat 8 satellite images. The input aerial and Landsat 8 image data were trained by Residual U-Net, one of the deep learning-based segmentation techniques. Study was carried out by dividing three groups. First and second group include part of level-II (medium) categories and third uses group level-III (large) classification category defined in land cover map. In the first group, the results using all 7 classes showed 86.6 % of classification accuracy The other two groups, which include level-II class, showed 71 % of classification accuracy. Based on the results of the study, the deep learning-based research for generating automatic level-III classification was presented.

AB  - Like other Austronesians, the native Taiwanese people had headhunting customs, which lasted until the early twentieth century. It is known that the headhunting was an active and widespread custom among Taiwan’s Tsou People, whose traces can still be found in the various music, dance, and rituals that are performed during their annual Mayasvi Festival to this day.Tsou myths that deal with the origin of headhunting custom have a number of distinct characteristics that are different from those of other tribes. First, flood is always set as the background, against which the headhunting initially occurs in the Thou myths. People who fled to high mountains to escape the flood commit the initial violence of headhunting. Oftentimes, they were not committed as part of hunting that serves the purpose of collecting food, but as sheer violence that contributes to human pleasure and entertaining purposes. In some myths, the ultimate sacrifice is described as the grandmother who raised the agents of this violence, in which case the entertainment evokes the most extreme level of excitement and ecstasy.When these Tsou people came down from the mountain and scattered to different villages after the flood was gone, they missed the ecstasy of this sheer violence that they felt on the mountain that they went onto conduct the headhunting custom to cut the heads of those from other tribes. How are we to understand this violent narrative, which was motivated by sheer entertainment and pleasure, and not for either revenge or practical purpose such as collecting food? And what mechanism lies behind this violent memory serving as the center of their identity, culture and religion of this community? Using these questions as the starting point, this paper categorizes the types of headhunting myths of Taiwan’s Tsou People and conducts structural analysis. In doing so, it unfolds that the violence, in fact, brings about the reversal of nature and culture through the greatest sacrifice of the agents of violence. Also, it also reveals that the headhunting myths are rooted in the ecological ethics and worldview that treats human beings as an extension of the wildlife or livestock in a world which encompasses the worlds of gods, the deceased, and spirits all as a whole.

Historically, co-presentational media such as dance, drama, music, and theatre have been closely intertwined. However, more recent trends see them increasingly separating into "bounded categories." This article reviews pre-"music and dance" terminology to highlight the significance of integrated sonic and movement systems. A range of classical Balinese performing arts are analysed to see if practitioners continue to embrace intertwined traditions or if contemporary artists create artworks that stand on their own. I call this a phenomenon of "ontological drift" where a discord occurs between artistic process and creative concept. I argue that although separating intertwined media into music and dance mimics an "art for art's sake" worldview, Balinese performing arts also negotiate pre-modern ontologies found in the socio-religious context of their creation.

AB  - Geodetic measurements of crustal deformation rates provide important information on earthquake hazard, indicating that strain is accumulating either faster or slower than the rate suggested by known earthquakes. With the COMET-LiCSAR InSAR processing system, which performs large-scale automated processing and timeseries analysis of Sentinel-1 data, we aim to generate strain rate maps for the entire Alpine-Himalayan Belt, and use these to investigate seismic hazard. In this paper we will present results for Anatolia.Deformation is also a key indicator of volcanic unrest, and is often associated with the flow of magma to shallower depths. The operational nature of Sentinel-1, with frequent revisits and rapid data delivery, makes it suitable for monitoring subaerial volcanoes globally. In order to deal with the large quantity of new data that is continuously being generated, we have developed machine learning approaches to flag when either a new deformation pattern emerges, or an existing deformation pattern changes rate.

TI  - Monitoring the incidence of <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i> infection in olive orchards using ground-based evaluations, airborne imaging spectroscopy and Sentinel-2 time series through 3-D radiative transfer modelling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Outbreaks of Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) in Europe generate considerable economic and environmental damage, and this plant pest continues to spread. Detecting and monitoring the spatio-temporal dynamics of the disease symptoms caused by Xf at a large scale is key to curtailing its expansion and mitigating its impacts. Here, we combined 3-D radiative transfer modelling (3D-RTM), which accounts for the seasonal background variations, with passive optical satellite data to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of Xf infections in olive orchards. We developed a 3D-RTM approach to predict Xf infection incidence in olive orchards, integrating airborne hyperspectral imagery and freely available Sentinel-2 satellite data with radiative transfer modelling and field observations. Sentinel-2A time series data collected over a two-year period were used to assess the temporal trends in Xf-infected olive orchards in the Apulia region of southern Italy. Hyperspectral images spanning the same two-year period were used for validation, along with field surveys; their high resolution also enabled the extraction of soil spectrum variations required by the 3D-RTM to account for canopy background effect. Temporal changes were validated with more than 3000 trees from 16 orchards covering a range of disease severity (DS) and disease incidence (DI) levels. Among the wide range of structural and physiological vegetation indices evaluated from Sentinel-2 imagery, the temporal variation of the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) and Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) showed superior performance for DS and DI estimation (r(VALUES)(2) > 0.7, p < 0.001). When seasonal understory changes were accounted for using modelling methods, the error of DI prediction was reduced 3-fold. Thus, we conclude that the retrieval of DI through model inversion and Sentinel-2 imagery can form the basis for operational vegetation damage monitoring worldwide. Our study highlight the value of interpreting temporal variations in model retrievals to detect anomalies in vegetation health.

TI  - Phenology of nocturnal avian migration has shifted at the continental scale
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change affects the timing of bird migration, which can lead to mismatch with resource availability. Migration occurred earlier in spring and autumn in the United States during the past 24 years; warming led to later arrival in the western Unites States and earlier arrival in the rest of the country.Climate change induced phenological shifts in primary productivity result in trophic mismatches for many organisms(1-4), with broad implications for ecosystem structure and function. For birds that have a synchronized timing of migration with resource availability, the likelihood that trophic mismatches may generate a phenological response in migration timing increases with climate change(5). Despite the importance of a holistic understanding of such systems at large spatial and temporal scales, particularly given a rapidly changing climate, analyses are few, primarily because of limitations in the access to appropriate data. Here we use 24 years of remotely sensed data collected by weather surveillance radar to quantify the response of a nocturnal avian migration system within the contiguous United States to changes in temperature. The average peak migration timing advanced in spring and autumn, and these changes were generally more rapid at higher latitudes. During spring and autumn, warmer seasons were predictive of earlier peak migration dates. Decadal changes in surface temperatures predicted spring changes in migratory timing, with greater warming related to earlier arrivals. This study represents one of the first system-wide examinations during two seasons and comprises measures from hundreds of species that describe migratory timing across a continent. Our findings provide evidence of spatially dynamic phenological shifts that result from climate change.

TI  - World Theater as a Tragic Mode Heinrich Heine's Epoch Experience
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR RELIGIONS-UND GEISTESGESCHICHTE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is something miraculous about the reception of Heinrich Heine in Germany: One might call him the best-known unknown writer. Critics from Heinrich von Treitschke to Theodor W. Adorno accused him of ruining German poetic language by accommodating his style to journalism. Yet others, like Friedrich Nietzsche and Hannah Arendt saw him as an early "post-modernist", insofar as he was insulting deep-rooted traditions of German idealism. His innovative poetry was carnivalesque, leading to a multi-perspective tragicomic worldview without inner reason or center, always on the edge of an open and unfinished present. Deeply influenced by Hegel, he never became an orthodox Hegelian, partly because of his heterodox Spinozism. Influencing the " revolutionary break" in 19th century worldviews, he developed an elucidated view on the tragicomic dialectics of European enlightenment, the modern subject and the age of revolutions.

AB  - The Gobi Desert in Mongolia is characterized by sparse and patchy vegetation, interspersed with essentially bare areas. The vegetation pattern is typically formed by perennial shrubs, grasses or annually-herbaceous plant overlying a matrix composed of bare soil. Vegetation patterns, most broadly, refer to the spatial organization of vegetation in a landscape. However, since the plants in the Gobi Desert are sparsely distributed over a vast bare field, it is extremely difficult to accurately observe from satellite imagery. This is because reflectance of dry soil is very high and the reflectance of slightly distributed plants is eliminated by soil reflection. This study solves this problem by using field surveys and methods for combining different satellite sensor data and spectral un-mixing analysis. As a result, the pixel NDVI value of desert plants shows a smaller value than the ground measurement. It is shown that the fraction of the vegetation endmember after pixel un-mixing has a remarkably high correlation with the field measured values (where, R2=0.51 between NDVI of Landsat 8 imagery original pixels and un-mixed pixels and R2=0.79 between plants coverage of field measurement and un-mixed pixels percentage of vegetation endmembers).

AB  - In this study, double-bounce parameter derived from Sentinel-1 was integrated with Difference vegetation index (DVI) derived from Landsat-8 for prediction of soybean yield at field level over central Argentina. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was trained using time series of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical features during the growing season. For comparison of SAR versus optical versus their integration for soybean yield prediction, the ANN model was trained and tested for three scenarios of SAR-only, optical-only and SAR-optical integration. Accuracies of yield prediction including correlation of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are 0.80, 0.589 t/ha, 0.445 t/ha for SARonly; 0.65, 0.800 t/ha, 0.546 t/ha for optical-only; and 0.85, 0.554 t/ha, 0.389 t/ha for SAR-optical integration scenarios, respectively. These accuracies demonstrate of high potential of SAR and SAR-optical integration for soybean yield prediction at field level.

In this study, polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) parameters derived from dual-polarization Sentinel-1 sensor have been tested for harvest monitoring over corn and soybean fields. Intensity at VH polarization, volume scattering derived from M-Chi decomposition and So and Si elements of Scattering Matrix have been tested. Harvest maps derived from SAR have been compared with the results derived from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which was extracted from Sentinel-2 imageries. Very promising and close results derived from both optical and SAR sensors. This study demonstrated that combination of SAR and optical sensors could be used to produce dense time-series of crop harvest maps.

TI  - Integration of synthetic aperture radar and optical satellite data for corn biomass estimation
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - Effort s to use satellites to monitor the condition and productivity of crops, although extensive, can be challenging to operationalize at field scales in part due to low frequency revisit of higher resolution space-based sensors, in the context of an actively growing crop canopy. The presence of clouds and cloud shadows further impedes the exploitation of high resolution optical sensors for operational monitoring of crop development. The objective of this research was to present an option to facilitate greater temporal observing opportunities to monitor the accumulation of corn biomass, by integrating biomass products from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical satellite sensors. To accomplish this integration, a transfer function was developed using a Neural Network algorithm to relate estimated corn biomass from SAR to that estimated from optical data. With this approach, end users can exploit biomass products to monitor corn development, regardless of the source of satellite data.The Water Cloud Model (WCM) was calibrated or parametrized for horizontal transmit and horizontal received (HH) and horizontal transmit and vertical received (HV) C-band SAR backscatter using a least square algorithm.Biomass and volumetric soil moisture were estimated from dual-polarized RADARSAT-2 images without any ancillary input data.A feed forward backpropagation Neural Network algorithm was trained as a transfer function between the biomass estimates from RADARSAT-2 and the biomass estimates from RapidEye.

AB  - Aerosol distributions may change at fine spatial scales in urban areas due to building and transport infrastructure and human population density variations. The recent availability of Sentinel-2 satellite data provides the opportunity for aerosol optical depth (AOD) estimation at higher spatial resolution than provided by other satellites. In this study, a novel high-spatial-resolution AOD retrieval algorithm for bright unban surfaces was developed based on the Sentinel-2 images. The surface reflectance for AOD retrieval was estimated from the image that has the minimal aerosol contamination in a temporal window. Validation of the Sentinel-2 AOD retrievals was conducted against four Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites located in Beijing. The results show that the Sentinel-2 AOD retrievals are highly consistent with the AERONET AOD measurements ( R = 0.9424 ), with 85.56% of them falling within the Expected Error (EE). The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) are 0.0688 and 0.0882, respectively. These results suggest that our high-resolution AOD retrieval algorithm is robust and useful to retrieve high-resolution AOD over bright urban surfaces based on Sentinel-2 images.

TI  - Estimation of Surface Downward Shortwave Radiation over China from Himawari-8 AHI Data Based on Random Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Downward shortwave radiation (R-S) drives many processes related to atmosphere-surface interactions and has great influence on the earth's climate system. However, ground-measured R-S is still insufficient to represent the land surface, so it is still critical to generate high accuracy and spatially continuous R-S data. This study tries to apply the random forest (RF) method to estimate the R-S from the Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data from February to May 2016 with a two-km spatial resolution and a one-day temporal resolution. The ground-measured R-S at 86 stations of the Climate Data Center of the Chinese Meteorological Administration (CDC/CMA) are collected to evaluate the estimated R-S data from the RF method. The evaluation results indicate that the RF method is capable of estimating the R-S well at both the daily and monthly time scales. For the daily time scale, the evaluation results based on validation data show an overall R value of 0.92, a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 35.38 (18.40%) Wm(-2), and a mean bias error (MBE) value of 0.01 (0.01%) Wm(-2). For the estimated monthly R-S, the overall R was 0.99, the RMSE was 7.74 (4.09%) Wm(-2), and the MBE was 0.03 (0.02%) Wm(-2) at the selected stations. The comparison between the estimated R-S data over China and the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Energy Balanced and Filled (EBAF) R-S dataset was also conducted in this study. The comparison results indicate that the R-S estimates from the RF method have comparable accuracy with the CERES-EBAF R-S data over China but provide higher spatial and temporal resolution.

AB  - In this paper we develop a deep learning model to distinguish dust from cloud and surface using satellite remote sensing image data. The occurrence of dust storms is increasing along with global climate change, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions. Originated from the soil, dust acts as a type of aerosol that causes significant impacts on the environment and human health. The dust and cloud data labels used in this paper are from CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) satellite. The radiometric channels and geometric parameters from VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) satellite sensor serve as features for our model.We trained and tested our deep learning model using 10,000 samples in March 2012. The developed model has five hidden layers and 512 neurons in each layer. The classification accuracy on the test set is 71.1%. In addition, we performed a shuffling procedure to identify the importance of features, which is calculated as the increase in the prediction error after we permute the feature's values. We also developed a method based on genetic algorithm to find the best subset of features for dust detection. The results show that the genetic algorithm can select a subset of features that have comparable performance as that of a model with all features. The shuffling procedure and the genetic algorithm both identify geometric information as important features for detecting mineral dust. The chosen subset will improve computational efficiency for dust detection and improve physical based methods.

TI  - Feasibility of Replacing the Range Doppler Equation of Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Considering Atmospheric Propagation Delay with a Rational Polynomial Coefficient Model
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Usually, the rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) model of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is fitted by the original range Doppler (RD) model. However, the radar signal is affected by two-way atmospheric delay, which causes measurement error in the slant range term of the RD model. In this paper, two atmospheric delay correction methods are proposed for use in terrain-independent RPC fitting: single-scene SAR imaging with a unique atmospheric delay correction parameter (plan 1) and single-scene SAR imaging with spatially varying atmospheric delay correction parameters (plan 2). The feasibility of the two methods was verified by conducting fitting experiments and geometric positioning accuracy verification of the RPC model. The experiments for the GF-3 satellite were performed by using global meteorological data, a global digital elevation model, and ground control data from several regions in China. The experimental results show that it is feasible to use plan 1 or plan 2 to correct the atmospheric delay error, no matter whether in plain, mountainous, or plateau areas. Moreover, the geometric positioning accuracy of the RPC model after correcting the atmospheric delay was improved to better than 3 m. This is of great significance for the efficient and high-precision geometric processing of spaceborne SAR images.

At present, there are relatively few studies focusing on the inversion of FPAR using Chinese autonomous satellites. This work intends to investigate the inversion of the FPAR obtained from the FengYun-3C (FY-3C) data of domestic satellites by using the PROSAIL model and the look-up table (LUT) algorithm for different vegetation types from various places in China. After analyzing the applicability of existing models using FY-3C data and MOD09GA data, an inversion strategy for FY-3C data is implemented. This strategy is applied to areas with various types of vegetation, such as grasslands, croplands, shrubs, broadleaf forests, and needleleaf forests, and produces FPAR products, which are cross-validated against the FPAR products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro Radiometer (MODIS), Geoland Version 1 (GEOV1), and Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS). Accordingly, the results show that the FPAR retrieved from the FY-3C data has good spatial and temporal consistency and correlation with the three FPAR products. However, this technique does not favor all types of vegetation equally; the FY-FPAR is relatively more suitable for the inversion of grasslands and croplands during the lush period than for others. Therefore, the inversion strategy provides the potential to generate large-area and long-term sequence FPAR products from FY-3C data.

AB  - Cameron Highlands has witnessed multiple land encroachment activities as well as repeated deforestation leading to extensive land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) over the last 6 decades. This is due to the heightened increase in demand for urban growth as well as agricultural activities and tourism industries. This study aims to identify land cover classes and assess their changes in Cameron Highlands between 2009 and 2019. Geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques were used to process and analyse Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imageries with the Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) classification technique. The result showed that the study area experienced large changes in both agriculture and urban, as well as primary forests. LULC change for agriculture nearly tripled in 10 years from 4.93% in 2009 to 12.63% in 2019. Moreover, urban development increased from 7.48% in 2009 and 9.12% in 2019. However, the expense of this is at the cost of primary forests declining by 59.44 km(2) (8.87%) of total land area from 2009 until 2019. The overall accuracy of the classification achieved 94.6%. This study would be able to provide suggestions and a basis for LULCC as well as forest monitoring in other mountainous regions of the world.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Landsat Data Automatic Cloud Removal Using Poisson Blending
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud and cloud shadow are common issues in optical satellite imagery, which greatly reduce the usage of data archive. As for the Landsat data, great advances have been made on detecting cloud and cloud shadow. However, few studies were performed on Landsat cloud removal for large areas. To facilitate land cover dynamics studies with high temporal resolution, we present an automatic cloud removal algorithm in this paper. Specifically, For Landsat Collection 1 Level-1 surface reflectance products, the algorithm first builds a cloud mask from the Quality Assessment (QA) band, and then reconstructs cloud-contaminated portions based on multi-temporal Landsat images with temporal similarity. To further eliminate radiation differences between cloud-free and reconstructed regions, a Poisson blending algorithm is adopted. Besides, the efficiency of gradient-domain compositing is accelerated by the quad-tree approach. Experiments have been performed to process more than 50,000 Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images covering China from 2013 to 2017, which yield promising results in terms of radiometric accuracy and consistency for experimental images with cloud coverage less than 80%. The produced Landsat time series images with cloud removal can be further used for analyzing land cover and land change dynamics in China, and the proposed algorithm should be easily employed to produce cloud-free Landsat time series for other areas.

AB  - Sentinel-1 SAR Wave Mode (WV) contributes to the global ocean wave (wind sea and swell) measurements upon the ERS-1&2 and Envisat ASAR. It is a wave product that contains image and ocean spectra, as well as certain wave parameters, which is valuable observational data for global ocean wave studies. In this study, we focused on the characteristics of ocean swell generated by the Tropical Cyclone (TC) and their relations with TC properties. To this end, the Firework method was adopted to track the TC generated swells. Swell data with low quality or unmatched with the expected waves are filtered out. This quality control procedure was performed for each acquired track and relied on the expected swell consistency between successive acquisitions along any given track. The preliminary analysis involves LANE TC cases and S 1A&B WV observations were collected. The results showed clear swell asymmetry emerging at the front and the rear of TCs. The wavelength asymmetry at forwarding propagation discretion and the opposite direction was determined by wave development in the front area. Maximum wavelength asymmetry could be found in the medium intensity and translation speed TCs. The data confirm the previous measurement that fetch-law could be used to the represent such wavelength asymmetry.

AB  - The accurate information on intensity and location of tropical cyclones (TCs) is essential for weather forecasting and warning. With atmosphere thermal profiles retrieved from microwave sounding instruments, the intensity and location of two major hurricanes are estimated based on the atmospheric hydro-static balance equation. Results show that the use of ATMS products derived from the scene-dependent one-dimensional variation (SD1DVAR) could reduce the errors in estimating the location and intensity of tropical cyclones by 52.79% and 36.91%, respectively, compared with the use of NOAA's operational products. Also, using a combined sounding data from FY-3D MWTS with MWHS that has 118 GHz channels could reduce the intensity estimation error by 37.2%. Moreover, SD1DVAR performs very well for both ATMS and MWTS/MWHS. More instruments will be tested to generate a global TC dataset with high temporal resolution.

TI  - Assessing the Effect of Land Use Change on Surface Runoff in a Rapidly Urbanized City: A Case Study of the Central Area of Beijing
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The change in land use during the process of urbanization affects surface runoff and increases flood risk in big cities. This study investigated the impact of land use change on surface runoff in Beijing's central area during the period of rapid urbanization from 1984 to 2019. Land use maps of 1984, 1999, 2009, and 2019 were generated by image classification of Landsat images. Surface runoffs were calculated with the Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) model. Correlation analysis was used to identify the dominant factor of land use change affecting surface runoff. The result showed that the variation trend of surface runoff was consistent with the trend of impervious land in Beijing's central area, which increased during 1984 similar to 2009 and decreased during 2009 similar to 2019. Correlation analysis showed that changes in surface runoff were most strongly correlated with changes in impervious surfaces when compared with the correlation of runoff with other types of land use. The results of this study may provide a reference for city flood control and urban planning in fast growing cities worldwide, especially in developing countries.

TI  - Automatic Extraction of Water Inundation Areas Using Sentinel-1 Data for Large Plain Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately quantifying water inundation dynamics in terms of both spatial distributions and temporal variability is essential for water resources management. Currently, the water map is usually derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with the support of auxiliary datasets, using thresholding methods and followed by morphological operations to further refine the results. However, auxiliary datasets may lose efficacy on large plain areas, whilst the parameters of morphological operations are hard to be decided in different situations. Here, a heuristic and automatic water extraction (HAWE) method is proposed to extract the water map from Sentinel-1 SAR data. In the HAWE, we integrate tile-based thresholding and the active contour model, in which the former provides a convincing initial water map used as a heuristic input, and the latter refines the initial map by using image gradient information. The proposed approach was tested on the Dongting Lake plain (China) by comparing the extracted water map with the reference data derived from the Sentinel-2 dataset. For the two selected test sites, the overall accuracy of water classification is between 94.90% and 97.21% whilst the Kappa coefficient is within the range of 0.89 and 0.94. For the entire study area, the overall accuracy is between 94.32% and 96.7% and the Kappa coefficient ranges from 0.80 to 0.90. The results show that the proposed method is capable of extracting water inundations with satisfying accuracy.

TI  - Estimating Forest Stock Volume in Hunan Province, China, by Integrating In Situ Plot Data, Sentinel-2 Images, and Linear and Machine Learning Regression Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest stock volume (FSV) is one of the key indicators in forestry resource assessments on local, regional, and national scales. To date, scaling up in situ plot-scale measurements across landscapes is still a great challenge in the estimation of FSVs. In this study, Sentinel-2 imagery, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform, three base station joint differential positioning technology (TBSJDPT), and three algorithms were used to build an FSV model for forests located in Hunan Province, southern China. The GEE cloud computing platform was used to extract the imagery variables from the Sentinel-2 imagery pixels. The TBSJDPT was put forward and used to provide high-precision positions of the sample plot data. The random forests (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and multiple linear regression (MLR) algorithms were used to estimate the FSV. For each pixel, 24 variables were extracted from the Sentinel-2 images taken in 2017 and 2018. The RF model performed the best in both the training phase (i.e., R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 35.13 m(3) ha(-1), n = 321) and in the test phase (i.e., R-2 = 0.58, RMSE = 65.03 m(3) ha(-1), and n = 138). This model was followed by the SVR model (R-2 = 0.54, RMSE = 65.60 m(3) ha(-1), n = 321 in training; R-2 = 0.54, RMSE = 66.00 m(3) ha(-1), n = 138 in testing), which was slightly better than the MLR model (R-2 = 0.38, RMSE = 75.74 m(3) ha(-1), and n = 321 in training; R-2 = 0.49, RMSE = 70.22 m(3) ha(-1), and n = 138 in testing) in both the training phase and test phase. The best predictive band was Red-Edge 1 (B5), which performed well both in the machine learning methods and in the MLR method. The Blue band (B2), Green band (B3), Red band (B4), SWIR2 band (B12), and vegetation indices (TCW, NDVI_B5, and TCB) were used in the machine learning models, and only one vegetation index (MSI) was used in the MLR model. We mapped the FSV distribution in Hunan Province (3.50 x 10(8) m(3)) based on the RF model; it reached a total accuracy of 63.87% compared with the official forest report in 2017 (5.48 x 10(8) m(3)). The results from this study will help develop and improve satellite-based methods to estimate FSVs on local, regional and national scales.

TI  - Detecting Forest Disturbance and Recovery in Primorsky Krai, Russia, Using Annual Landsat Time Series and Multi-Source Land Cover Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution and dynamic changes of the forests in Primorsky Krai, Russia, are of great significance for regional ecological security and sustainable economic and societal development. With the support of the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform, we first synthesized yearly Landsat surface reflectance images of the best quality of the research area and then used the random forest method to calculate the forest classification probability of the study area year by year from 1998 to 2015. Furthermore, we used a time-series segmentation algorithm to perform temporal trajectory segmentation for forest classification probability estimation, and determined the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and change laws of the forest. We extended the existing algorithms and parameters of forest classification probability trajectory analysis, achieving a high overall accuracy (86.2%) in forest change detection in the study area. The extended method can accurately capture the time node information of the changes. In the present research we observed: (1) that from 1998 to 2015, the forest area of the whole district showed a net loss state, with a loss area of 0.56 x 10(6) ha, of which the cumulative forest disturbance area reached 1.12 x 10(6) ha, and the cumulative forest recovery area reached 0.55 x 10(6) ha; and (2) that more than 90% of the forest change occurred in areas with a slope of less than 18 degrees, at a distance of less than 20 km from settlements, and at a distance of less than 10 km from roads. The forest disturbance monitoring results are consistent with the changes in official statistical results over time, but there was a 20% overestimation. The technical method we extended in this study can be used as a reference for large-scale and high-precision dynamic monitoring of the forests in Russia's Far East and other regions of the world; it also provides a basis for estimating illegal timber harvesting and determining the appropriate amount of forest harvested.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - As aerospace technology, computer technology, network communication technology and information technology become more and more perfect, a variety of sensors for measurement and remote sensing are constantly emerging, and the ability to acquire remote sensing data is also continuously enhanced. Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) technology greatly expands the function and application field of imaging radar. Differential InSAR (DInSAR) developed based on InSAR technology has the advantages of high precision and all-weather compared with traditional measurement methods. However, DInSAR-based deformation monitoring is susceptible to spatiotemporal coherence, orbital errors, atmospheric delays, and elevation errors. Since phase noise is the main error of InSAR, to determine the appropriate filtering parameters, an iterative adaptive filtering method for interferogram is proposed. For the limitation of conventional DInSAR, to improve the accuracy of deformation monitoring as much as possible, this paper proposes a deformation modeling based on ridge estimation and regularization as a constraint condition, and introduces a variance component estimation to optimize the deformation results. The simulation experiment of the iterative adaptive filtering method and the deformation modeling proposed in this paper shows that the deformation information extraction method based on differential synthetic aperture radar has high precision and feasibility.

TI  - Habitat suitability of Pacific saury (<i>Cololabis saira</i>) based on a yield-density model and weighted analysis
T2  - FISHERIES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) supports one of the most important pelagic fisheries in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean. However, changing oceanographic conditions could result in difficulties in predicting fishing grounds and fishery management. We combined a yield-density model and weighted statistical analysis to develop a habitat suitability index (HSI) model to identify the relationship between oceanographic variables and potential habitat. This approach was applied to fishing data from the Chinese saury fishery during the main fishing season (June-November) from 2013 to 2015. The oceanographic variables considered included sea surface temperature (SST), horizontal sea surface temperature gradient (SSTG) and sea surface height (SSH). The HSI model was validated using fishery and oceanographic data for 2016. This study indicated that (1) the yielddensity model can be reliably used to fit a curvilinear relation between the suitability index (SI) and SST, SSTG, and SSH, and the optimal habitat conditions for the three variables were obtained; (2) weighted analysis-based boosted regression trees revealed that SSTG had the most important influence on SI each month, followed by SST and SSH; and (3) approximately 70% of the fishing effort occurred in the areas where HSI > 0.5 in each month. Results of this study could help to further understand the effects of oceanographic conditions on habitat distribution and provide a way to forecast saury fishing grounds.

AB  - Spatially distribution information on wheat yield forecasting at the large regional scale is important for market forecast and agricultural sustainable development. Assimilating remote sensing information into the crop growth model has demonstrative to be the effective approach for crop yield prediction. However, it remains a challenge to determine the crop growth model of input parameters and initial conditions at the spatial regional scale. In the paper, we proposed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and 4DVAR hierarchical data assimilation scheme, which enables the winter wheat yield forecasting at the 500 m grid size ahead of harvest time in Henan province. This approach applies data assimilation algorithms at two spatial scales. At the county scale, the MCMC algorithm was used to recalibrate the uncertain and sensitive parameters of the WOFOST model using the county-level statistical yield. Then, we assimilated time-series MODIS reflectance into WOFOST-PROSAIL coupled model using the 4DVAR method for each 500 m pixel across the entire Henan province of China The results show that the simulated yield was strong positive correlated with the statistical yield at county-level scale with R-2 = 0.81 and RMSE = 877 kg/hm(2), which demonstrated the potential usage of the MCMC-4DVAR based large area yield estimation with remote sensed data and yield statistics.

In this paper, eleven TerraSAR-X images and five Radarsat-2 images covering the 52304 working face in the Daliuta mining area were used to obtain the time-series line-of-sight (LOS) direction deformation and azimuth direction deformation based on different SAR platforms by application of the small baseline subset (SBAS) pixel offset tracking method. According to the three-dimensional solution principle of multiplatform SAR images and 72 GPS points, the accuracy of deformation in the east-west direction is 0.22 m, while the accuracy in the north-south direction is 0.21 m, with an accuracy of subsidence of 0.34 m.

AB  - Total suspended matters (TSM) play a significant role in water quality assessment and resource management of coastal waters as it has a direct influence on many aquatic processes. This paper discovers dynamic spatial-temporal TSM patterns in coastal waters by using the self-organizing map (SOM), an unsupervised machine learning method on the 19 years Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m imagery data. The paper found that the SOM of 2 x 3 grid is suitable to the Yellow River estuary, which shows six different patterns from winter to summer Characteristics and factors affect the variability of the identified TSM patterns were also discussed. This study also demonstrated a general approach to apply SOM to identify TSM patterns in coastal waters.

AB  - Nighttime satellite imagery has been applied in a wide range of fields. However, our limited understanding of how observed light intensity is formed and whether it can be simulated greatly hinders its further application. This study explores the potential of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) in translating multispectral imagery to nighttime imagery. A popular cGAN framework, pix2pix, was adopted and modified to facilitate this translation using gridded training image pairs derived from Landsat 8 and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The results of this study prove the possibility of multispectral-to-nighttime translation and further indicate that, with the additional social media data, the generated nighttime imagery can be very similar to the ground-truth imagery. This study fills the gap in understanding the composition of satellite observed nighttime light and provides new paradigms to solve the emerging problems in nighttime remote sensing fields, including nighttime series construction, light desaturation, and multi-sensor calibration.

TI  - Deep Domain Adaptation based Cloud Type Detection using Active and Passive Satellite Data
T2  - 2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Domain adaptation techniques have been developed to handle data from multiple sources or domains. Most existing domain adaptation models assume that source and target domains are homogeneous, i.e., they have the same feature space. Nevertheless, many real world applications often deal with data from heterogeneous domains that come from completely different feature spaces. In our remote sensing application, data in source domain (from an active spaceborne Lidar sensor CALIOP onboard CALIPSO satellite) contain 25 attributes, while data in target domain (from a passive spectroradiometer sensor VIIRS onboard Suomi-NPP satellite) contain 20 different attributes. CALIOP has better representation capability and sensitivity to aerosol types and cloud phase, while VIIRS has wide swaths and better spatial coverage but has inherent weakness in differentiating atmospheric objects on different vertical levels. To address this mismatch of features across the domains/sensors, we propose a novel end-to-end deep domain adaptation with domain mapping and correlation alignment (DAMA) to align the heterogeneous source and target domains in active and passive satellite remote sensing data. It can learn domain invariant representation from source and target domains by transferring knowledge across these domains, and achieve additional performance improvement by incorporating weak label information into the model (DAMA-WL). Our experiments on a collocated CALIOP and VIIRS dataset show that DAMA and DAMA-WL can achieve higher classification a ccuracy i n p redicting c loud types.

TI  - Exploring Spatial and Temporal Connection Patterns among the Districts in Chongqing Based on Highway Passenger Flow
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating regional connections and their influencing factors from the perspective of "flow" space is one of the foundations of promoting regional development. In this article, the data we used includes actual highway passenger flow data, National Polar-orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP/VIIRS) nighttime light remote sensing data, and socioeconomic data. We analyzed the spatial distribution pattern, connection intensity and spatial autocorrelation of highway passenger flow in Chongqing during the working day, weekend and May Day and revealed the influencing factors by means of a geographic detector. Three key conclusions resulted from this research. First, highway passenger flow in Chongqing districts exhibits spatial agglomeration that is clearly higher in western Chongqing than in eastern Chongqing and forms an obviously dual-core "star" structure, with the main urban area and Wanzhou serving as the core. Second, a factor detector notes that the nighttime light area index (0.9251, 0.9512, 0.9541) has the strongest explanatory power for the spatial differentiation of passenger traffic in Chongqing districts, which is the key factor. Third, interaction detection shows that the interaction between the two factors displays an enhancement effect at different times. The nighttime light area index shows the strongest explanatory power under the synergy of tourist attractions, which are 0.9850, 0.9903 and 0.9908. But the per capita GDP and highway mileage have the most obvious enhancement effect after interaction (0.9544, 0.9661, 0.9652). Therefore, in future planning and development, we should pay attention to cooperation and exchanges between districts and use the nighttime light area index as an important reference factor to provide a scientific basis for the construction of public transport and economic construction in Chongqing.

TI  - A Method for the Optimized Design of a Rain Gauge Network Combined with Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A well-designed rain gauge network can provide precise and detailed rainfall data for earth science research; meanwhile, satellite precipitation data has been developed to generate more real spatial features, which provides new data support for the improvement of ground station network design methods. In this paper, satellite precipitation data are introduced into the design of a rain gauge network and an optimized method for designing a rain gauge network that comprehensively considers the information content, spatiotemporality, and accuracy (ISA) of the data is proposed. After screening the potential stations, the average spatial information index of the rain gauge network, which is calculated from remote sensing data, is used to address the shortcomings of applying spatial information from single-use measurement data. Then, the greedy ranking algorithm is used to rank the order in which the rain gauges are added to the network. The results of the rain gauge network design in the upper reaches of the Chaobai river show that compared with two methods that do not consider spatiality or use only measured data to consider spatiality, the proposed method performs better in terms of the spatial layout and accuracy verification. This study provides new ideas and references for the design of hydrological station networks and explores the use of remote sensing data for the layout of ground-based station networks.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring of Vegetation Dynamic Changes after Fire in the Greater Hinggan Mountain Area: The Algorithm and Application for Eliminating Phenological Impacts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires are frequent in boreal forests affecting forest areas. The detection of forest disturbances and the monitoring of forest restoration are critical for forest management. Vegetation phenology information in remote sensing images may interfere with the monitoring of vegetation restoration, but little research has been done on this issue. Remote sensing and the geographic information system (GIS) have emerged as important tools in providing valuable information about vegetation phenology. Based on the MODIS and Landsat time-series images acquired from 2000 to 2018, this study uses the spatio-temporal data fusion method to construct reflectance images of vegetation with a relatively consistent growth period to study the vegetation restoration after the Greater Hinggan Mountain forest fire in the year 1987. The influence of phenology on vegetation monitoring was analyzed through three aspects: band characteristics, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and disturbance index (DI) values. The comparison of the band characteristics shows that in the blue band and the red band, the average reflectance values of the study area after eliminating phenological influence is lower than that without eliminating the phenological influence in each year. In the infrared band, the average reflectance value after eliminating the influence of phenology is greater than the value with phenological influence in almost every year. In the second shortwave infrared band, the average reflectance value without phenological influence is lower than that with phenological influence in almost every year. The analysis results of NDVI and DI values in the study area of each year show that the NDVI and DI curves vary considerably without eliminating the phenological influence, and there is no obvious trend. After eliminating the phenological influence, the changing trend of the NDVI and DI values in each year is more stable and shows that the forest in the region was impacted by other factors in some years and also the recovery trend. The results show that the spatio-temporal data fusion approach used in this study can eliminate vegetation phenology effectively and the elimination of the phenology impact provides more reliable information about changes in vegetation regions affected by the forest fires. The results will be useful as a reference for future monitoring and management of forest resources.

AB  - Deep learning based patch-wise Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image classification usually requires a large number of labeled data for training Aiming at understanding SAR images with very limited annotation and taking full advantage of complex-valued SAR data, this paper proposes a general and practical framework for quad-, dual-, and single-polarized SAR data. In this framework, two important elements are taken into consideration: image representation and physical scattering properties. Firstly, a convolutional neural network is applied for SAR image representation. Based on time-frequency analysis and polarimetric decomposition, the scattering labels are extracted from complex SAR data with unsupervised deep learning. Then, a bag of scattering topics for a patch is obtained via topic modeling. By assuming that the generated scattering topics can be regarded as the abstract attributes of SAR images, we propose a soft constraint between scattering topics and image representations to refine the network. Finally, a classifier for land cover and land use semantic labels can be learned with only a few annotated samples. The framework is hybrid for the combination of deep neural network and explainable approaches. Experiments are conducted on Gaofen-3 complex SAR data and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

TI  - Contribution of SPOT-7 multi-temporal imagery for mapping wetland vegetation
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the fine-grained pattern of vegetation is critical for assessing the functions and conservation status of wetlands. Although satellite time-series images can accurately model vegetation, the spatial resolution of these data is generally too coarse (> 6 m) to capture the fine-grained pattern of wetland vegetation. SPOT-7 satellite sensors address this issue since they acquire images at very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) with a potential high frequency revisit. While the ability of SPOT-7 images to discriminate wetland vegetation has yet to be assessed, this study investigates the contribution of SPOT-7 multi-temporal images for mapping the fine-grained pattern of 11 vegetation classes in a 470 ha fresh marsh (France). Random forest modeling, calibrated and validated using 170 vegetation plots, was conducted on four SPOT-7 pan-sharpened images collected from April-July 2017. The results highlight that (1) the wetland vegetation was accurately modeled (F1 score 0.88), (2) near-infrared spectral bands acquired in the spring are the most discriminating features, (3) the fine-grained pattern of vegetation plant communities is mapped well, and (4) model uncertainties reflect floristic transition, unconsidered classes or areas of shadow.

AB  - Cimandiri Fault is one of the faults that have high tectonic activity. Several earthquake events around the Cimandiri Fault have caused impacts and losses on humans. Efforts to detect earthquake events need to be done as disaster mitigation. Detection of earthquake events in this study by looking at deviations in surface temperature. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between changes in land surface temperature (LST) in relation to the earthquake that occurred on 7 July 2018 (M-L = 4.73) and 11 October 2018 (M-L = 3.77). Landsat 8 satellite imagery are used in this study to get the value of the land surface temperature using the LST algorithm. To find out the deviation that occurred researchers used a statistical test x +/- sigma with a 66% confidence level and compared with the average LST for five years. The results of the study are an increase in land surface temperature due to the earthquake occurrence on July 7, 2011, an increase in surface temperature of land was 6.56 degrees C on the day before the earthquake, and October 11, 2011, there was an increase of 7.02 degrees C the day before the earthquake.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing technologies are currently tested and suggested as a tool in REDD+ (MRV, Measurement Reporting, and Verification). SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) has got an extensive application in the estimation of biomass due to its all-weather capabilities. L band radar signals penetrate the canopy more efficiently when compared to C band. Scientific biomass study using SAR has not been conducted in Para in spite of extensive field datasets being freely available under CMS (Carbon Monitoring System) project. This study aims in using various polarization combinations like HH + HV, HH - HV, HH + HV/HH - HV and vegetation index such as NDVI from the optical data. ALOS-PALSAR and Landsat 7 data acquired over Paragominas in Brazil, where field samples were collected in the form of transects. Regression analysis was performed using backscatter coefficients and field collected Above Ground Biomass (AGB). Semi-empirical model was developed to model AGB using various polarization combinations and NDVI as predictor variables. Combination gave higher R-2 value of 0.657 for biomass prediction. Multiple linear regression using NDVI and HH + HV as variables yielded R2 of 0.73 during calibration and 0.363 during validation. There is future scope to use other vegetation indices such as RVI, EVI, etc., along with increased number of samples, which may yield more robust models with acceptable level of accuracy for practical application.

TI  - Inter-Seasonal Time Series Imagery Enhances Classification Accuracy of Grazing Resource and Land Degradation Maps in a Savanna Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In savannas, mapping grazing resources and indicators of land degradation is important for assessing ecosystem conditions and informing grazing and land management decisions. We investigated the effects of classifiers and used time series imagery-images acquired within and across seasons-on the accuracy of plant species maps. The study site was a grazed savanna in southern Kenya. We used Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery due to its high spatial (10-20 m) and temporal (five days) resolution with support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers. The species mapped were important for grazing livestock and wildlife (three grass species), indicators of land degradation (one tree genus and one invasive shrub), and a fig tree species. The results show that increasing the number of images, including dry season imagery, results in improved classification accuracy regardless of the classifier (average increase in overall accuracy (OA) = 0.1632). SVM consistently outperformed RF, and the most accurate model and was SVM with a radial kernel using imagery from both wet and dry seasons (OA = 0.8217). Maps showed that seasonal grazing areas provide functionally different grazing opportunities and have different vegetation characteristics that are critical to a landscape's ability to support large populations of both livestock and wildlife. This study highlights the potential of multi-spectral satellite imagery for species-level mapping of savannas.

AB  - Cloud mask products are essential for the retrieval of aerosol and cloud properties as well as in understanding the impacts of clouds on the Earth's radiation budget and global climate change. This paper evaluates the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud mask products through comparison with four years of ground-based radar data over Beijing. Different data collocation schemes are applied to analyze and thoroughly understand the differences between the MODIS and the radar. Comparison results show that the agreement of cloud mask between the MODIS and radar is 84%. There are 11% comparisons of which the MODIS is cloudy while radar is clear because of their different field of view. It is found that the missed thin clouds by MODIS account for 5% of the disagreement and discrepancies are mostly due to thin clouds.

AB  - Lakes are extremely touchy and dynamic parts of the earth and have a pivotal part in the farming, environment, industrial and domestic purposes. In Central Africa, Lake Chad Basin (LCB) has observed an uninterrupted decrease in its water level for the past decades as a result of certain variables such as climate change and over-abstraction, and likewise part of dry spells. The aforementioned challenges have serious effects on the standard living of the people in a particular area as well as the lake natural resources. The current study was planned to assess the changes of a lake for the past three epochs, then the Lake Chad satellite imageries include OLI, ETM+, and TM were evaluated with a view to came up with some land cover changes throughout these epochs: 1985, 2000, and 2015. All the scenes were subjected to the pre-processing stage to ensure the originality of the information, and "supervised classification was implemented for land cover change analysis. Then the overall accuracies of the classification of Landsat-TM is 93.80, Landsat-ETM+ is 90.80, and Landsat-OLI is 86.20 respectively. The outcome demonstrates that there is a continuous decline of water bodies, barren land, and shrub, with a rapid increment of farmland and gallery forest".

TI  - Land use/land cover change along the Eastern Coast of the UAE and its impact on flooding risk
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the spatiotemporal changes of land use/land cover (LULC) along the eastern coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over a 20-year period using an integration of remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems techniques. The impact of land use change on flooding potential was also investigated through hydrologic model simulations. Landsat images of the years 1996, 2006 and 2016 were processed and analyzed. Change detection was carried out to assess changes in the built-up areas. Furthermore, the impact of urbanization on flooding was assessed using a hydrologic model in two major watersheds of Fujairah Emirate. It was observed that for the period 1996-2006 the vegetation and the built-up areas had increased at a rate of 11.23% and 24.56%, respectively. For the period 2006-2016, this expansion more than doubled in terms of the vegetation class (27.51%) and slightly increased for the built-up class (28.98%). The change detection analysis revealed that urbanization has mostly occurred along the coastal boundary. Hydrologic model simulations quantified the role of urbanization in increasing the flooding potential. The increase depends on watershed characteristics and the rate of change in urbanization and the magnitude of the rainfall event.

TI  - Multispectral Remote Sensing Utilization for Monitoring Chlorophyll-a Levels in Inland Water Bodies in Jordan.
T2  - TheScientificWorldJournal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This study focuses on the utilization of multispectral satellite images for remote water-quality evaluation of inland water body in Jordan. The geophysical parameters based on water's optical properties, due to the presence of optically active constituents, are used to determine contaminant level in water. It has a great potential to be employed for continuous and cost-effective water-quality monitoring and leads to a reliable regularly updated tool for better water sector management. Three sets of water samples were collected from three different dams in Jordan. Chl-a concentration of the water samples was measured and used with corresponding Sentinel 2 surface reflectance (SR) data to develop a predictive model. Chl-a concentrations and corresponding SR data were used to calibrate and validate different models. The predictive capability of each of the investigated models was determined in terms of determination coefficient (R 2) and lowest root mean square error (RMSE) values. For the investigated sites, the B3/B2 (green/blue bands) model and the Ln (B3/B2) model showed the best overall predictive capability of all models with the highest R 2 and the lowest RMSE values of (0.859, 0.824) and (30.756mg/m3, 29.787mg/m3), respectively. The outcome of this study on selected sites can be expanded for future work to cover more sites in the future and ultimately cover all sites in Jordan.

AB  - This study explores the artistic consciousness of Kim Yong-jun who was a painter and writer based on his essays. Kim Yong-joon actively performed in literary history during the modernization period, but no independent research has been conducted on his essays.Essays directly reveal the author's consciousness. In this sense, Kim Yong-joon's essay reveals his artistic consciousness as a painter and artist. From his art-based attitude of treating art as an art, to the upright attitude that an artist should have, to the art of orientalism that our artist should pursue, we can see his worldview encompassing the world of art.Therefore, taking a look at Kim Yong-joon's essay provides a glimpse into the artistic consciousness of Kim Yong-joon, as well as into the concerns of artists during the modernization period, which has been marked by concerns about the identity of our art. We look forward to expanding the appearance of our literary artist Kim Yong-joon as a writer.

AB  - Noh Cheon Myeong has an important meaning in the history of poetry in the 1930s as the emergence of “the first full-fledged female poet”. Unlike the scarcity and the “talkiness” left behind by their unconventional and tragic lives and deeds of the female poets that appeared in the 1920s, this means the emergence of confident female poets in both quality and quantity of their works. In particular, Noh Cheon Myeong established herself as a “poet”, not a “female poet,” by securing a sense of distance from the poetic object, and by showing a unique perspective of women through restrained emotions and language.However, the discussion of Noh Cheon Myeong’s poetry world is focused on several topics in the first collection “Sanhorim” and second collection “Changbyeon,” as the subject and just limited to a criticism of pro-Japanese poems and patriotic war poems, which is an obvious mistake. Therefore, in order to explore essentially about the poetry world of Noh Cheon Myeong the “first full-dressed female poet,” it is necessary to take an in-depth look at the two collections poems of the first half period, which can be called the essence of Noh Cheon Myeong’s literature. Because it is reasonable to place their position by considering the essential aspects of these works, such as their poetic characteristics, orientation, and literary achievements. And by looking at her awareness of the reality and worldviews as a noticed female poet of the colony, the roots and background of pro-Japanese poetry, and patriotismㆍwar poetry need to be checked which are the main targets of criticism.To do so, this article examined the self-awareness of Noh Cheon Myeong as a new women, characteristics of hometown and pungmul poetry, and her awareness of the reality and worldview as a colonial female poet, one by one.

T2  - Life and Word

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the way in which Reformed Theology should respond to the challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Humanity is entering the Fourth Industrial Revolution, with exponential changes in the way we live, work and relate to one another. The primary issue regarding the Fourth Industrial Revolution goes beyond the economy or industrial structure - it is a matter of world view. Changes in industry have led to changes in the social order and in the structure and style of individual lives. Klauss Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, argues that the Fourth Industrial Revolution affects human value systems beyond the economic system of simple manufacturing and service convergence. In the past, value systems influenced the material world, but now the material world boldly declares that it can influence value systems. Humanity has become a matter of the material, not of the mind.How should the Church respond to these challenges? It is said that the best way to predict the future is to invent it. 500 years ago, the Reformers kicked off a new era by presenting new standards when that of the Middle Ages reached their limits. In the face of an indeterminate future, we must continue the spirit of the Reformation that created a new order distinct from the Middle Ages, and take part in the ongoing creation of a era with a new Biblical Reformist worldview.We should preach that the Gospel is the answer, as did the Reformers who preached that God was the answer 500 years ago. We must take a three-pronged approach to educating home, church and school, just as the Reformers did. To do this, we must first carefully observe the discourse of the world and fill it with a Biblical worldview. As Paul said in Areopago Square, we must show the world that “this is the unknown future you speak of.” Unfortunately, we have only been saying no to what the world has been offering. We have not been able to show people an alternative - the kind of world we want to create and live in. The church should not only say no to a world in ruin but also be able to clearly show what an alternative could be, as the Reformers did 500 years ago. The church needs to enable the next generation to shape the world towards a Biblical worldview, by teaching them in our homes, schools and churches.

AB  - A mass of seawater with similar properties in the ocean is called a water mass, and the front is a sea area where two masses of different properties meet. The gradient algorithm is a method of extracting where the sea water temperature pixel changes rapidly assuming that the slope is large, and the place with the large slope is assumed to be a front. This method is able to process large amounts of satellite data at once. Therefore, in this study, we tried to find the front lines in the sea area around the Korean Peninsula by using a gradient algorithm. The study data used gridded sea surface temperature satellite data. The resolution was 1/4Â°, and the monthly average data from January 1993 to December 2018 were used. There were major five fronts representatively, China Coastal Front, South Sea Coastal Front, Kuroshio Front/ Kuroshio Extension Front, Subpolar Front and the Subarctic Front. As a result of comparing the distribution of front by season, more types of front were distributed in winter and spring than in summer and autumn, and the distribution range was wider.

This study analyzed how idol groups, enter�tainment companies, and fandoms interacted and used cros-me�dia strategies from the perspective of information management until BTS became a globaly influential human brand.BTS' suces was posible because of the strong global fandom and cros-media strategy of entertainment companies that ac�tively utilized not only excelent musical elements but also the rapidly changing media environment.BTS's record-breaking news from abroad, including Bilboard, was reported through domestic media, which in turn formed a mechanism for the continued spread of isues through online por�tals and strengthening of awarenes.Also, the BTS Worldview, organicaly conected to various me�dia, has built up the image of young people as an idol group with god influence, and fandom ARMY has created a strategic human brand as an information watcher who manages the star crisis while showing loyalty to reproduce and share more content in var�ious media spaces based on content provided by entertainment companies.As such, the cros-media strategy of utilizing traditional media and social media in the entertainment industry, partnership com�munication with fandom has become a model for K-pop, which has shown the potential of a global human brand.K-pop, the wel-known music brand of the Korean Wave, has now become an actively managed information industry and a genre of entertainment culture. In result, BTS as the human brand wil play significant roles in the global cultural environment.

AB  - Purpose: This study evaluated the efficiency of preoperative ultrasound (US)-guided tattooing of the axillary lymph nodes with activated charcoal and the correlation between sonographically suspicious nodes and final histologic results by node-to-node analysis. The concordance rate between the tattooed nodes and sentinel nodes was also determined.Methods: US-guided tattooing of sonographically suspicious axillary nodes was performed preoperatively by an injection of activated charcoal. The identification of black pigment and the concordance between the sentinel and tattooed nodes was evaluated.Results: Regarding node-to-node analysis, the false-negative rate of US-fine needle aspiration (FNA) was 43.3%. The sensitivity and negative predictive values were 56.7% and 81.7%, respectively. The specificity and positive predictive values were 100%. The accuracy of US-FNA was 85.2%. In the final pathology, 45/125 patients (36.0%) had positive nodes, including two micrometastases. The false-negative rate of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was 4.0%, but there were no skip metastases. The sensitivity and specificity of SLNB were 95.6% and 100%, respectively. The negative predictive value was 97.6%, and the positive predictive value was 100%. The accuracy of SLNB was 98.4%. In 117 of 125 patients (93.6%), there was concordance between the charcoal tattooed axillary lymph nodes and SLNs.Conclusion: SLNB, in conjunction with US-guided tattooing of sonographically suspicious axillary lymph nodes, is a useful procedure to reduce the false-negative rate of SLNB and improve the accuracy of an intraoperative evaluation of axillary nodes in breast cancer patients. This paper proposes the concept of targeted axillary node biopsy with preoperative US-guided tattooing for the most accurate axillary staging in patients with breast cancer.

We used Sentinel-2 images for detecting forest fire area. We adjusted four cases for train model based on the dNBR severity level classes. We used 4 SVM kernels, because the accuracy may vary depending on the structure of the data to learning. The training results showed that in all four cases, the SVM RBF model showed the highest accuracy. The SVM RBF model with the highest training accuracy was used in the test area classification process. During the verification process, we created 300 GTP using KOMPSAT-3 for verification. Verification results show that the test results using the SVM RBF model classified (82.67%) was more affected than dNBR classification result (80.67%). The results of the study suggested a direction to incorporate mechanical learning in the analysis process for detecting and classifying forest fire damage areas.

AB  - Drought events are not clear when those start and end compared with other natural disasters. Because drought events have different timing and severityof damage depending on the region, various studies are being conducted using satellite images to identify regional drought occurrence differences. Inthis study, we investigated the applicability of drought assessment using the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) based on Moderate Resolution ImagingSpectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images. The ESI is an indicator of agricultural drought that describes anomalies in actual and referenceevapotranspiration (ET) ratios that are retrieved using remotely sensed inputs of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Leaf Area Index (LAI). However,these approaches have a limited spatial resolution when mapping detailed vegetation stress caused by drought, and drought hazard in the actual cropcultivation areas due to the small crop cultivation in South Korea. For these reasons, the development of a drought index that provides detailed higherresolution ESI, a 500 m resolution image is essential to improve the country’s drought monitoring capabilities. The newly calculated ESI was verifiedthrough the existing 5 km resolution ESI and historical records for drought impacts. This study evaluates the performance of the recently developed500 m resolution ESI for severe and extreme drought events that occurred in South Korea in 2001, 2009, 2014, and 2017. As a result, t he two E S Isshowed high correlation and tendency using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis. In addition, it will provide the necessary informationon the spatial resolution to evaluate regional drought hazard assessment and and the small-scale cultivation area across South Korea.

AB  - The dreaminess of the show appearing in Manboksajeopogi and Hasaenggiwoojeon contributes to the fantasy of these works. The desire of a contemporary person to look at the lives of beings beyond the real world appears in a way that solidarity the lives of the living and the dead.Both works also solidarity with life in terms of restoration and gaze of maternal love. The cause of absolute loneliness of male protagonists comes from the sense of loss due to the absence of mother who is the object of love. The desire to find the direction of life by restoring and gazing at the absolute solitude that will offset absolute solitude is a divisive connection between the life of the living and the dead.Furthermore, through the overthrow of wounds and healing spaces, we also carry out the solidarity of life. The overthrow of wounds and healing spaces is prominent in 'Manboksa', 'Naktakyo', and 'Tomb of female ghosts'. The wounds of desire that have collapsed in real space are healed in fantasy space, and Again, the reason that I realized there is to replace the sublime value of the real world space. So the intention to reveal the essence of coexistence appears as the solidarity of life.The solidarity of life in <Manboksajeopogi> and <Hasaenggiwoojeon> follows the ideology of the real world and It is the result of the 'exploration of the protagonist of the novel' which expresses the instinctive desire honestly. It also embodies the inclusion of a worldview to acknowledge 'win-win and extinction'. The principle of coexistence works on the principle of covering the living and the dead. It is because the successors of the male protagonist who negotiated with the world of death in <Choi Chihwon> repeatedly appear in <Manboksajeopogi> and <Hasaenggiwoojeon>. The order of extinction also works on the principle of the real world and the fantasy space. The fact that the male protagonists actively sympathize with the reincarnation and resurrection of female ghosts is a result of meeting the order of this extinction.

TI  - Vessel Tracking Datasets For Monitoring Canada's Conservation Effectiveness
T2  - Canadian Technical Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying indicators for monitoring the effectiveness of Canada's conservation areas is a key next step following the recent expansion of marine and coastal protection. Levels of compliance with protected area restrictions and the extent and intensity of other ongoing human pressures are fundamental measures to include in monitoring programs as they facilitate interpretation of trends in ecological data and inform the need for adaptive management and regulations. Human pressures within Canada's marine conservation areas are often associated with vessel traffic through fishing activities or vessel-related impacts. The Government of Canada has been collecting a variety of vessel tracking data for several years that to-date have largely been used for real-time maritime awareness or compliance purposes. The benefits of such data for measuring long-term vessel impacts and monitoring conservation areas is becoming increasingly recognized worldwide. To take better advantage of these data in the future requires understanding what data are available, their access and use restrictions, how they are collected and stored, the spatial and temporal resolutions, and benefits and challenges associated with various data types. We provide these details for Automatic Identification Systems, Vessel Monitoring Systems, aerial surveillance, RadarSat II, and violation records as an initial step towards applying vessel tracking data as an indicator for monitoring conservation areas in Canada, with a focus on measuring fishing activities and fishing non-compliance.

TI  - Multitemporal Mosaicing for Sentinel-3/FLEX Derived Level-2 Product Composites
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of remote sensing data raises important challenges in terms of operational data provision and spatial coverage for conducting global studies and analyses. In this regard, existing multitemporal mosaicing techniques are generally limited to producing spectral image composites without considering the particular features of higher-level biophysical and other derived products, such as those provided by the Sentinel-3 (S3) and Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) tandem missions. To relieve these limitations, this article proposes a novel multitemporal mosaicing algorithm specially designed for operational S3-derived products and also studies its applicability within the FLEX mission context. Specifically, we design a new operational methodology to automatically produce multitemporal mosaics from derived S3/FLEX products with the objective of facilitating the automatic processing of high-level data products, where weekly, monthly, seasonal, or annual biophysical mosaics can be generated by means of four processes proposed in this work: 1) operational data acquisition; 2) spatial mosaicing and rearrangement; 3) temporal compositing; and 4) confidence measures. The experimental part of the work tests the consistency of the proposed framework over different S3 product collections while showing its advantages with respect to other standard mosaicing alternatives. The source codes of this work will be made available for reproducible research.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) aboard a satellite irradiates observation microwave pulse toward the earth and the microwave pulse arriving at the earth's surface scatters every direction. The backward scattering component of it is received on the antenna of the satellite. The satellite SAR allows us to observe the earth during 24 hours without being influenced by the weather because of this observation principle. On the other hand, since the satellite needs to irradiate the earth's surface not vertically downward but obliquely downward with the observation microwave pulse, radar-shadow area, at which the observation microwave pulse does not arrive due to obstruction of the other higher place, appears depending on geographical features. However, since the observation data of the satellite SAR is recorded in order of arrival at the receiver, in other words in order of distance from the emitter, it is quite difficult to extract the radar-shadow area directly from the observation data. Therefore, when we use the satellite SAR image to detect occurrence of a natural disaster, we might carry out useless calculation about a steep valley bottom region which has a higher possibility of occurrence of the land slide. This is because the steep valley bottom region is often included in the radar-shadow area, that is the no-data area. If we can know about the radar-shadow area corresponding to the latest observation data, improvement of the estimation precision of occurrence of a natural disaster by using satellite SAR image can be expected. Furthermore, since the SAR satellite flies on a fixed orbit, the information of the radar-shadow area is suitable to construct its database for permanent use. In this paper, we propose a method for efficiently constructing a database for radar-shadow cast by ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 (a satellite operated by JAXA) by using high resolution (5 meters mesh) DEM data as a pre-process.

AB  - This paper presents the assessment of the advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) altimetry waveforms over the largest archipelagos in the Southeast Asia. The results identify that the major waveform classes in that region are ocean-like waveform (91%), recorded at location beyond 500 m from the coastline. However, along the satellite tracks that are parallel to the coastline, there is evidence of non-ocean waveforms are within 7 km from the coastline. Three major classes have been identified, specifically ocean-like waveforms (Class 1), multi-peak waveforms (Class 2) and quasi specular waveforms (Class 3). The finding from this study suggest that the need of a retracking optimized for SAR coastal waveforms.

TI  - Weakly Supervised Learning for Land Cover Mapping of Satellite Image Time Series via Attention-Based CNN
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The unprecedented possibility to acquire high resolution Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) data is opening new opportunities to monitor the different aspects of the Earth Surface but, at the same time, it is raising up new challenges in term of suitable methods to analyze and exploit such huge amount of rich image data. One of the main tasks associated to SITS data analysis is related to land cover mapping. Due to operational constraints, the collected label information is often limited in volume and obtained at coarse granularity level carrying out inexact and weak knowledge that can affect the whole process.To cope with such issues, in the context of object-based SITS land cover mapping, we propose a new deep learning framework, named TASSEL (aTtentive weAkly Supervised Satellite image time sEries cLassifier), to deal with the weak supervision provided by the coarse granularity labels. Our framework exploits the multifaceted information conveyed by the object-based representation considering object components instead of aggregated object statistics. Furthermore, our framework also produces an additional outcome that supports the model interpretability. Quantitative and qualitative experimental evaluations are carried out on two real-world scenarios. Results indicate that not only TASSEL outperforms the competing approaches in terms of predictive performances, but it also produces valuable extra information that can be practically exploited to interpret model decisions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of terrain globally gained much importance in recent years due to its potential in assessing changes over a period of time. Remote sensing provides a major scope in this regard, especially after the launch of space-borne SAR satellites. These sensors are boon to the highly improved global imaging and mapping of terrestrial covers. This in turn requires exploration of the existing methods. In recent years the potential of decision tree classification are identified and research work undertaken towards analyzing and developing new algorithms for it. Decision tree classifiers can perform automatic feature selection and complexity reduction, while the tree structure gives easily understandable and interpretable information regarding the predictive or generalization ability of the data. Hence, the objective of the study is to investigate the existing classification techniques and critically analyze and compare the results with the proposed decision tree algorithm. The study area has chosen to be Roorkee city in India due to its assorted landscape. ALOS PALSAR L-band level 1.1 data has been used in this study. The DTC algorithm for terrain classification has accuracy of 92%, this work is mainly carried out in ENVI (Environment for Visualising Images) software.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Rapidly developing modern science & technology have a profound impact on Christians and pastoral work. Recently, the 4th Industrial Revolution has induced lots of discussions in the field of church and theology, and artificial intelligence (AI) has become an important issue in many ways. Nevertheless, there is a lack of empirical research on how the AI would affect church and pastoral work. This study examined and analyzed the theological students' perception of AI. A survey was conducted on the perception of seven sub-areas of 220 male and female theological students at major seminaries in Korea. The seven sub-areas were including the degree of interest in AI, social influence, AI’s alternative influence, and AI’s church influence. The results showed that theological students generally agree with the academic relevance of AI or the need for education on AI. However, it presented a low perception of the impact of AI on the church. Such recognition may reflect the following belief. Students are aware that the AI is a necessary and important part of social and general education, but at the same time, they think the AI may not significantly threaten the church. Therefore, we suggest that considering a response of Christian education to raise the perception of theological students of AI, courses related to science and technology should be organized in the curriculum of seminaries at various levels from the perspective of the Christian worldview.

AB  - Surface deformations in Bolvadin town without any devastating earthquakes have been observed in the last 10 years. In this study, ground deformation analysis of Bolvadin region was performed by Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and multi-temporal SAR interferometry (InSAR) method. Sentinel-1 images obtained between October 2014 and October 2018 in ascending and descending orbits were processed with SNAP and StaMPS softwares. Deformation velocity maps and vertical displacement time series were produced and compared with geology and groundwater level of the region. Deformation velocity maps show significant subsidence in the region. The most severe subsidence, up to 35 mm/year, was found in the southern part of Bolvadin which is characterized by the presence of soft alluvial deposits. Both in long and short term, there was a strong correlation between the subsidence and the groundwater level. As a result, the high correlation of the vertical deformation velocity with lithological units and groundwater level indicates that subsidence in the region is probably due to the excessive use of groundwater.

AB  - The rapid urban expansion will drive land-use conversion and cause substantial environmental and ecological impacts. The ability of remote sensing to record spatial and temporal data on the land surface with complete coverage has been proven effective for recognizing spatiotemporal changes in the regional eco-environment quickly. This study utilized Landsat TM / ETM + and Landsat-8 OLI remote sensing data to assess the effect of urban expansion intensity on the urban ecological status with the study area in Semarang, Indonesia. The method to measure urban expansion uses the urban expansion intensity index and to assess the urban ecological status using an integrated ecological index (IEI). The IEI generated from four parameters which include the degree of greenness ( i.e. the soil adjusted vegetation index, SAVI), the moisture degree (i.e. the normalized difference moisture index, NDMI), dryness degree (i.e. the normalized difference soil index, NDSI) and built-up aggregation degree (i.e. the normalized difference built-up index, NDBI). Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to compress the four indicators to construct the index of ecological status and Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the effect of urban expansion intensity on urban ecological status. The result showed that the urban land area increased by 38.98 km2 with an average expansion area of 3.9 km2 y-1 from 2005 to 2015. The index of urban expansion intensity during 20112015 increased about 2.1 times from 2005-2011. The pattern of deteriorating urban ecological status of the city of Semarang spreading towards the west, south, southeast, and east. The lowest integrated ecological index is in the central and northern parts of the city of Semarang. The extent of good and excellent urban ecological status continues to decline in a decade, on the contrary, the urban ecological status of poor and extremely poor increased. The negative linear relationship of the index of urban expansion intensity and urban ecological status shows that the intensity of urban expansion influences the urban ecological status in Semarang city.

AB  - The sustainability of a city will be greatly influenced by its urban ecological status. Remote sensing technology is very supportive for understanding the urban ecological status with advantages in terms of timely, precise and objective, so that has become an increasing concern in the world. In this paper, urban ecological status of Semarang city was analysed by an image of Landsat-8 OLI was acquired in a different season. The urban ecological status is integrated by two main components that are assumed that forming urban land, that is the primary land surface component (i.e. built-up area and vegetation area) and the climate (i.e. land surface humidity and dryness degree). These components are divided into four indicators obtained from the transformation of remote sensing data, which is the NDBI (normalized difference build-up index) for built areas representing the resident aggregation degree, SAVI (soil adjusted vegetation index) for greenness degree, NDMI (normalized difference moisture index) for land surface moisture and NDSI (normalized difference soil index) for the dryness degree. Principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to compress the four indicators into one to construct the index for assessing overall urban ecological status. The results showed that there were differences in the urban ecological status in different seasons. Urban ecological conditions in the dry season are more varied than in the rainy season. Overall urban ecological conditions in the rainy season are better than the dry season.

AB  - Speckle is noise found in SAR data that will affect the image interpretation process. To reduce the presence of speckle in SAR data, a speckle filtering process is needed. This study will evaluate the multi temporal speckle filtering for Sentinel-1 image, VH polarisation. The data used in this study are 30 SENTINEL-1 images recorded in different seasons in 2018. The methods applied for multi temporal speckle filters are Boxcar, Frost, Lee, Gamma Map and Lee Sigma with window sizes of 5x5 and 7x7. The quality test for speckle filter results will be done qualitatively (by looking at the visual appearance of the filter results) and quantitatively (Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Normalized Mean ( NM). The best qualitative and quantitative multitemporal speckle filter results are obtained from the Frost Filter 5x5 with a minimum of 3 scene data.

AB  - Today, drought has become part of the identity as well as the fate of many countries. In fact, drought is considered among the most damaging natural disasters. The severe consequences resulting from drought affect the nature and society at different levels. Proper and efficient management is not possible without accurate prediction of drought and the identification of its various aspects. Thus, the existence of a considerable body of literature on drought monitoring. However, significant growth of remote sensing databases as will an increased amount of available data related to drought have been detected. Therefore, a more adequate approach should be developed. During the past decades, Data Mining (DM) methods have been introduced for drought monitoring. According to the best of our knowledge, a review of drought monitoring using remote sensing data and DM methods is lacking. Thereby, the purpose of this paper is to review and discuss the applications of DM methods. This paper consolidates the finding of drought monitoring, models, tasks, and methodologies.

AB  - The total area and spatial distribution of paddy fields greatly affect the regional budget of methane (CH4), the second most influential greenhouse gas contribute to global warming after CO2. Therefore, reliable broad-scale paddy field maps are essential for improving the accuracy of regional methane budget estimations. Here, using two types of satellite images, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical images, we developed a broad scale paddy field map for eastern part of Asia in 2018 with a 30 m spatial resolution. The method used in this study combines the robustness of Sentinel-1 SAR images to cloud cover with the high accuracy of Sentinel-2 optical images in extracting irrigated paddy fields. By comparing with statistic values of paddy field areas and existing paddy field maps, our paddy field map shows a great potential for reproducing paddy field areas at country scale.

AB  - Pine Wilt Disease is one of the forest pests with high destructive potential, due to its random spreading and the fast evolution of the symptoms. The correct identification of infected trees is critical for the containment of the pest in affected areas. This paper exploits the capabilities of Random Forest classification algorithms designed to spot the infected trees based on remote sensing images. We use as input both multi- and hyperspectral imagery with high spatial resolution, acquired via remotely piloted airborne systems in infected Portuguese forests. For both imagery types, the classification schemes achieve accuracies higher than 0.91. We conclude that Random Forest classification is a feasible method to detect the Pine Wilt Disease in spectral images acquired over wild forests, even at early stages of the infestation.

AB  - Updated information on the spatial distribution of mangrove forests is of high importance for management plans. Yet, access to mangrove distribution maps is limited, even-though remote sensing data is currently freely available and deep learning algorithms score high performances in automatic classification tasks. The methodologies developed in this paper are based on a deep convolutional neural network and have been tested on WorldView 2 and Sentinel-2 images. The obtained results are highly satisfactory and open perspectives for automatically mapping mangrove distribution over large areas.

TI  - Student Perceptions of Their Gains in Course-Based Undergraduate Research Abilities Identified as the Anticipated Learning Outcomes for a Biochemistry CURE
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) is a teaching approach aimed at developing students' ability to conduct novel research. Although students' perceptions of their learning during CUREs may not reflect actual student learning, such surveys provide a convenient and useful metric for course evaluation. Instructors can use survey findings both to improve instruction and to identify areas of student difficulty. Although various reports have presented data on student perceptions of CUREs, these have not delved deeply into students' perceived knowledge, experience, and confidence (KEC) regarding specific research abilities that instructors anticipate students will develop. This study addresses this issue by investigating changes in students' perceived KEC regarding previously identified anticipated learning outcomes (ALOs) for the biochemistry authentic scientific inquiry laboratory (BASIL) CURE. The following research questions were addressed: How do students' perceptions of KEC for specific ALOs change during a BASIL CURE course? How do student perceptions of their KEC regarding specific BASIL ALOs vary across different implementations of BASIL CURE courses? To answer these questions, a participant perception indicator (PPI) survey was used to measure students' KEC for the BASIL ALOs. Participants were students in one of 10 courses implementing the BASIL CURE at seven different academic institutions. Student pooled response data across all implementations showed significant gains in their KEC, with large effect sizes. Furthermore, differences in students' KEC were detected between course implementations. These findings will provide instructors of the BASIL CURE and potentially other CUREs with a useful framework for the focus of assessment design and the consequent identification and remediation of student difficulties related to the various research abilities or ALOs.

TI  - The Involvement of Students in the Protest Movement in Russia at the turn of the XIX-XX centuries
T2  - BYLYE GODY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using ego-documents as the base, the authors are trying to study the process of opposition formation in students of the late-imperial Russia, focusing on the identification of what had inspired the protest actions, as well as methods and techniques employed by representatives of revolutionary parties to target young people.The main reasons for the involvement of Russian students in active protest at the turn of the XIX-XX centuries included their lack of rights, financial constraints, being not only actual, but also clearly recognized by young people. This made the harsh school regime even more severe, thus leading to strengthening the influence of revolutionary parties in young people. Among the factors shaping the young people's worldview was the modernist family and its environment that included e iled revolutionaries as well. Active reading and the joint singing of revolutionary songs contributed to embracing lofty ideals and formed the spirit of camaraderie especially in conditions of crowded living in private apartments and boarding schools, participation in the work of revolutionary circles.The revolutionary parties clearly recognized these factors, having developed a set of measures to involve students in the protest movement as well as in their ranks. Starting from conversations on abstract topics that included young people's everyday hardships, the revolutionaries' leaders, being attractive due to their set of moral principles and sometimes appearance, proceeded to proposals for building a new world after overthrowing the current regime, and from that they would turn to involving young people directly in supporting underground activities.

TI  - Predictive assessment on landscape and coastal erosion of Bangladesh using geospatial techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Coastal erosion, land use and land cover (LULC) changes analysis using remote sensing is a dynamic, relatively low cost based precise method using now a day. Coastal districts of Bangladesh occupied by naturally grown mangrove forest which are susceptible to rapid land cover (LC) changes and natural erosion. Barguna and Patuakhali districts of Bangladesh deserve special attention for conserving coastal mangrove forest named Tengragiri Wildlife Sanctuary and variety of human forces income. The core objective of this research is to analyze the LULC change along with coastal erosion analysis from 2000 to 2017. Combination of four years Landsat satellite image analysis, primary field data, geo-tag photography, secondary information, utilization of forest carbon inventory 2015 data, and semi-structured questionnaire are the key approaches adopted in the study. K-means cluster based unsupervised and maximum likelihood supervised classification by using ERDAS Imagine 2014 found the total study area is 33,361 ha. Random sampling (40 points/class) based accuracy assessment and verification by google earth pro 7.1 found overall accuracy 88.15% and Kappa coefficient is 0.867. Python coding program and overlay operation tested for conversion analysis any found weighted overlay provide best results. An intensive RS analysis of 33,564 ha mangrove forest and community landscapes generated six (6) distinct land cover class and sub-classes, e.g. Forest, agriculture & grassland, plantation, sandbar, settlement and waterbody. During 2000-2017, agriculture and grassland were decreasing 23 ha/year. Out of 11,831 ha (in 2000) Agri-grass land 9,326 ha remained intact while remaining 2,246 ha converted to settlement mixed with homestead plantation class. This study also presents the landscape erosion-accretion due to natural, quasi-natural and anthropogenic interventions which shows that, along the river flow and at the confluence at the Nishanbaria Union (local name Khouttar Char & Fakir hat) to lower side of the Tengragiri WS locations are susceptible to high trend of land erosion whereas accretions are prominent on the reverse sides named Baliatali Union, Barabagi Union and so on. These results of the study and developed maps will be helpful for the community people, line departments, national and international policy maker and the researchers' community for monitoring coastal geomorphology including erosion and accretion of this landmass.

T2  - ELEKTRONIKA IR ELEKTROTECHNIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - DMM (Distributed Mobility Management) is a present elective worldview for creating a mobility management scheme to discourse the centralized issues in present IP-based mobile environments. The main reason is to enable these schemes to adapt to the present increment in the number of mobile operators, as well as mobile information traffic size, just as the pattern in the mobile Internet towards Industry 4.0 in a flat architecture. Until this point, the advancement of schemes dependent on the DMM-based method is still at fundamental phases in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), as well as there is no present standard set up. With the point of taking advantage of utilizing different interfaces all at once, this paper proposes an enhanced Flow-enabled Proxy NEMO scheme in a Distributed Mobility Anchoring (FPNEMO-DMA) environment. Besides, a mathematical approach is advanced to assess the performance of the proposed FPNEMO-DMA scheme and benchmark with the existing Nemo Basic Support Protocol (NBSP) and Proxy NEMO.

TI  - Semantics and etymology of substrate hydronyms of the Lower Konda
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: hydronyms due to their specificity have a high linguistic and cultural significance. They reflect different aspects of human society. Semantic and etymological analysis is a necessary stage in the development of regional toponymy and an effective way to obtain diverse information leading to an understanding of the cultural code of the nation.Objective: semantic and etymological description of the substrate hydronyms of the Lower Konda.Research materials: names of water geographical objects identified in written sources, geographical maps.Results and novelty of the research: as a result of the study, it was found that the substrate hydronymy of the Lower Konda includes russified names of Khanty and Mansi origin with the absolute predominance of the Khanty names. The polylinguality of toponymy is determined by the ethnic composition of the population of the Lower Konda.The semantics of hydronyms reflected the worldview of the indigenous ethnic groups. The principles of nomination of the onyms are typical: according the properties of geographical object, related objects, and connections with people. They reflect a universal feature of human thinking to identify the typical and the unique in an object, to perceive the totality of names as a system, to see their connections and relationships. The specifics are the semantic content of onyms, the presence of hybrid lexemes, and names with double motivation.The scientific novelty of the work consists in the fact that for the first time the hydronymy of the Lower Konda is subjected by complex semantic and etymological analysis, and its specific features are revealed.

AB  - There are many factors that contribute to urbanization such as natural increase in population and migration from rural to urban areas. Failure to regulate sustainable urban growth management will arise significant issues for instances depletion of natural resources, urban sprawl, and environmental pollution. This paper is geared towards investigating and mapping land use land cover (LULC) changes in Iskandar Malaysia, specifically in Iskandar Puteri and western gate development. The satellite images from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Sentinel 2A for the year of 2007 and 2017 were deployed in the process of quantification of changes detection by using the Supervised Classification technique. Then, the magnitude of the changes was determined. IDRISI Terrset software was used in order to predict the future expansion of the study area until 2030. Finally, this paper proposed the delineation of urban growth limit as a sustainable strategy to direct further geographical development. The modelling of urban growth limit was based on the socio-economic and bio-physical factors. The findings and analysis in this paper have proven how prominent geospatial technology can be deployed in implementing sustainable development. The generated results have important policy implication for urban planners, stakeholders, and industrial players.

AB  - Mapping and investigating land use land cover (LULC) changes over a particular region is crucial for resource management, sustainability development, and holistic planning. An increasing rate of urban growth and urban sprawl could induce changes in land use as well as land transformation. However, accurate and up-to-date information about LULC is required for providing better understanding and assessing the environmental consequences of such changes. In this study, the 2017 image from the Sentinel-2A Satellite was utilized to demonstrate the land cover classification analysis in Iskandar Malaysia. Usually, land use classification analysis is conducted through proprietary GIS software. However, this decade shows the advancement in software development, thus the emerging of free/open source software in the geospatial world. Hence, to execute land cover analysis using the Unsupervised Classification technique, the proprietary GIS software (ArcGIS) and free/open source software (QGIS) were deployed. Then, the examination of accuracy assessment was carried out for the selected software. The sum of 250 random points was established for the assessment purpose. The results showed the overall accuracy for ArcGIS and QGIS were 82.80% and 80.40% respectively. The kappa coefficient for ArcGIS was 0.7395, while kappa coefficient for QGIS was 0.7094. Besides that, ArcGIS demonstrated better producer's accuracy in the forest and agriculture land covers classification. Meanwhile, QGIS exhibited better producer's accuracy in the built-up and water features classification. To summarize, ArcGIS and QGIS software are reliable to be used in the land cover classification.

AB  - Land and forest fires smoke has been regularly revealed over Sumatera and Borneo Islands for past two decades. Various sector have been severely impacted, including air transportation. Air obscurity caused by smoke reduce horizontal visibility and profoundly affects aviation regularity, efficiency and safety. The study aimed to develop a visibility estimation of an orbital satellite using remote sensing and observation data. Orbital satellite is one of the technological advances that have potentials for supporting and improving the ability of meteorological service provider to meet user's needs related to adverse weather. The Automatic smoke detection using classification tree analysis was used as the first step. Then backward elimination for multiple regression was used to produce visibility estimation based on Himawari_8 satellite-smoke-detection and actual observation of visibility in airports. The results showed that the correlation between the estimated visibility in satellite-detected smoke and observed visibility was high (R-2= 0.68). This approach very sensitive to thick smoke with horizontal visibility of shorter than 2000 meters.

TI  - Post-Soviet Reindeer Herders: Between Family and Collective Herding
T2  - REGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Reindeer herding constitutes the basis of the traditional economy and culture of many indigenous peoples of Eurasia. This paper discusses the diverse trajectories reindeer herding in Russia has taken in different areas of Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It is shown that three regional trajectories of reindeer-herding development can be distinguished: (1) the northeastern/taiga trajectory, characterized by a collapse of Soviet-era state farms (sovkhozes) and a dramatic decrease of reindeer herding; (2) the west Siberian trajectory, characterized by a collapse of sovkhozes and a boom in private reindeer herding; (3) the European (Barents Region) trajectory, characterized by a relative stability in the number of farms, reindeer, and reindeer herders. This diversity can be explained by three factors: the degree to which local reindeer herding has been "modernized"in the Soviet era, the legal status of the herders, and, most importantly, the worldview of "sovkhoism" as a complex of informal practices that manipulate collective property for personal advantage and communal security.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications in Urban Environments V held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) is the capital city of Thailand In recent years, city surface has been changed greatly by rapid urbanization. Many green spaces in the urban area are destroyed and replaced with the commercial area. It can have effect on the climate and weather that could lead to the Urban Heat Island (UHI). This research analyzes the correlation between Urban Green Spaces (UGS) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) using quantitative remote sensing technology in BMA. More than five years of Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 images are used to study urban temperature. The LST, UGS and their correlation of whole area of BMA are analyzed. The LST is retrieved from mono-window algorithm, which used only one thermal band. Several indices of UGS, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and measurement of vegetation cover percentage are also used to study on UGS. The result showed that from 2008 to 2018 LST is increased while UGS is decreased. In addition, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is used to analyze the linear correlation between UGS and LST. The correlation between LST and NDVI indicates the negative correlation. The average correlation coefficient is -0.44. That can imply that the higher vegetated area, the LST was lower. To get more detail relationship between LST and UGS, three typical regional areas are selected to study. LST contour is used to analyze LST and HERCULES system is used to classify land cover. The result showed that firstly, the density of tree affect LST. Secondly, the location of the public park is important. Thirdly, water bodies help to decrease LST. The results of this study have key implications for BMA sustainable urban planning and development; to mitigate UHI effects it is important to not only increase canopy cover or the size of UGS, but also to optimize their spatial configuration.

AB  - Present paper consists of laboratory measurements of complex dielectric properties of bare/uncovered soil and soil covered with vegetation (dry and green grass) at C-band microwave frequency at 30 degrees C. The soil sample was collected from Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India. The Von Hippel method is used to measure complex dielectric properties using an automated C-band microwave bench set-up. The least square fitting technique is used to calculate dielectric constant e., dielectric loss e.. and errors in their measurements. From measured dielectric properties, emissivity and brightness temperature are estimated at different angles of incidence using Fresnel equations. The comparative study of complex dielectric properties of bare/uncovered soil and soil covered with vegetation (dry and green grass) is a unique effort. This study provides useful information for interpretation of microwave remote sensing data of soil moisture under vegetation cover (grass).

TI  - ADAPTATION OF THE METHOD OF STRUCTURAL-MORPHOMETRIC ANALYSIS TO THE GIS ENVIRONMENT FOR PALEOGEOMORPHOLOGICAL STUDIES OF THE KANIV DNIEPER
T2  - VISNYK OF TARAS SHEVCHENKO NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF KYIV-GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Kaniv Dnieper area is a unique region that has evolved through the Neogene-Quaternary phase. The application of geological and geomorphological methods, remote sensing data and GIS made it possible to identify the genetic relationship between the processes of geomorphogenesis and tectogenesis within the Kaniv Dnieper region, to build a number of geological and geomorphological models. The methodology of structural-morphometric analysis is adapted to the GIS and the process of cartometric constructions is automated. An algorithm for creating order maps of valleys and basal surfaces has been developed. Basal surfaces are complex surfaces that combine local erosion bases and express the total movements of the earth's crust over various time intervals. A study of the morphogenesis and tectogenesis of the territory of the Kaniv Dnieper region showed that the neotectonic movements within this region had a differentiated character. Five stages of tectonic evolution were determined during the Neogene-Quaternary stage of its development. Hypsometry of basic surfaces of five orders was investigated, and a detailed comparison of the morphology of single-order surfaces has been made. On the basis of the obtained data on the nature of the surfaces, absolute and relative elevations, the nature of the isobasite pattern, the geomorphological structure of each stage has been analyzed in detail. The conducted studies revealed a regular relationship between the relief and tectonics.

M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated assessment and analyses of gravitational geological processes impact on the technogene objects is based on a systematic approach to the analysis of the geological environment; creation of geological, mathematical and spatial models of the geological environment, development of analytical tools. The complex application of geological and geomorphological methods (structural-morphometric analysis, comparative tectonics and structural analysis), remote sensing data and GIS technologies made it possible to identify the relationship between the processes of geomorphogenesis and tectogenesis within the Middle Dnieper area, identify the causes of gravitational geological processes, and build a series of spatial models. These models describe the impact of geomorphological and tectonic processes on the natural hazards. Based on the analysis of structural and morphometric indices, the tectonic structures, which are most elevated in relief, were recorded. Using the residual relief map, located above the baseline surfaces of the respective orders, structural zones are highlighted, reflecting the relationship of tectonic and erosion and reservoir erosion processes. Digital models of base surfaces and residual topography are aimed at the detection of local structures and the study of slope processes of the territory. Neotectonic movements of not only local but also regional character were allowed to follow. The residual relief outlines the positive forms of relief confined to anticlinal folds, which refer to the positive anomalies of gravity.

TI  - Spiritualization of Power and Service in Late Gogol: Motive Sources
T2  - IMAGOLOGIYA I KOMPARATIVISTIKA-IMAGOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In his report at the Lotman Readings at the Russian State University for the Humanities (2019), M. Velizhev showed that the testament that opens Gogol's Vybrannye mesta iz perepiski s druz 'yami [Selected Passages from Correspondence with Friends, 1847] bears signs of a notarial will. This reflects the counter spiritualization of the power and service in Correpondence, so its motivation that can clarify the logic of Gogol's artistic evolution. All power positions in Gogol's book are sacred, being created by the "government foresight" inspired by heaven. Consequently, Lord signifies Himself in the authority ladder. Therefore, the semantic elevation of love to God follows the same hierarchy of the civil service - to the monarch who transfers it to God. This makes the service hierarchy the main target of the human enemy who invades the world in the form of a doppelganger-official, eroding the meanings of administrative positions and replacing the "divine service" ladder with an antipode doublet. Gogol's equations of "sacra" and service caused his movement to St. Petersburg (1828), equally alien to the traditional culture of both Little Russia and Russia. In this alienness, Gogol, who preserved the folklore worldview, saw the same daemonic trickery as in Dykanka. It appears as a general hoax in the finale of Nevsky Prospekt, and gets apocalyptic proportions in the first edition of The Portrait. However, in the capital of the empire, which includes the church in itself, Gogol tied the religious principle to the imperial one, which split the meaning of the Petersburg power into "heavenly" and daemonic. The consistent implementation of these meanings forms the plot of The Inspector General - with the visits of Khlestakov and the real inspector. In letters to S.T. Aksakov (1844), to N.F. (1849) Gogol endowed the devil with Khlestakov's characteristics on the one hand, and on the other, explained the gossip about Khlestakov - "inspector" as the devil's trick. Khlestakov's chimericity is noted by Khlestakov's servant Osip ("a general, only the other way round) and Shpekin ("He's neither one thing nor another. The devil knows what he is"). Khlestakov not only confirms it, introducing himself as the author of "another 'Yuri Miloslaysky'", but in drunken boast endows a demonic background ("I am everywhere, everywhere!"). The Governor translates it from the subtext into the text, congratulating his wife, ". . . to marry into a family of such a devil." The capital he personifies is also illusory, being a "black hole" in Osip's praises. The real auditor presents Petersburg as a source of just imperious punishment, which the "silent scene" endows with the symbols of the Last Judgment, since in the Governor's appeal to the public ("You are laughing at yourself, oh you!") the bureaucratic vices can be interpreted as panhuman. In Razvyazka "Revizora" [The Resolution of The Government Inspector. 1846], the state is shown equal to the human soul, where officials are "passions"; Inspector is conscience "at death's door"; Khlestakov is a "secular conscience" with which a person conforms every day. A person equal to the world carries within himself the potentials of all vices, and the death of the soul marks the death of the world. In Correspondence Gogol endowed himself with such a universal "I" creating the potential for spiritual crisis. The inexplicable divergence of Russian reality with the ideal appeared to him as the death of his soul, and with it - of the great world equal to it.

TI  - MAPPING CROPLANDS WITH A LONG HISTORY OF CROP CULTIVATION USING TIME SERIES OF MODIS VEGETATION INDICES
T2  - UCHENYE ZAPISKI KAZANSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA ESTESTVENNYE NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - In the study, a method of automated detection of croplands and natural grasslands using multi-year time series of the vegetation indices was developed and implemented. The methodology is based on a new recognition feature enabling identification of all lands cultivated over a long period. The new recognition feature was calculated from time series of the MODIS vegetation indices. It takes into account both intraseasonal and interannual characteristics of the vegetation period for arable lands with spring and winter crops, as well as for natural grasslands. The methodology determines: the procedure of obtaining time series of the NDVI and EVI vegetation indices for the period from March to November in the given years; generalization of the time series by land cover categories and agro-climatic zones; dates for calculating the recognition feature in each zone; calculation of the recognition feature; adaptation of the decision rules to the regional environmental conditions (threshold values for the agroclimatic zones); procedure of classification into croplands and grasslands. Croplands within the territory of the European part of Russia were mapped for the period from 2000 to 2016. The assessment of recognition accuracy and comparison of the results with the existing products confirm that the developed recognition feature can be successfully used for cropland detection and can improve the accuracy of data interpretation when applied along with other features.

TI  - Intraoperative imprint cytology of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients: comparation with frozen section
T2  - VOJNOSANITETSKI PREGLED
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has been established as the standard of care for axillary staging in patients with invasive breast carcinoma and clinically negative lymph nodes. Intraoperative assessment of sentinel lymph nodes might be done by frozen section (FS), touch imprint cytology (TIC) and one step nucleic acid amplification. The aim of this study was to review our institution's results with SLN biopsy using TIC and FS technique as intraoperative diagnostic tool for breast cancer patients. Methods. SLNs from 101 patients were examined intraoperatively by frozen hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) stain and by touch imprint cytology. Results of TIC were compared with FS and permanent histology sections. Results. The total number of dissected SLNs was 163 with a mean of 1.6 (1-4) per patient. The permanent H&E identified 19 (19%) patients with a sentinel lymph node metastasis and 82 (81%) patients with tumor-free sentinel nodes. The sensitivity/specificity rates were 73.7%/99.3%, respectively for TIC and 84.2%/100%, respectively for FS. Relevant positive/negative predictive values were 93.3%/96.6%, respectively for TIC and 100%/97.9%, respectively for FS. Conclusion. Our experience with TIC and FS for the intraoperative evaluation of SLNs is similar to the findings from previously reported studies. We detected the high specificity for both methods, but TIC technique appeared to be less sensitive than FS in detecting SLN metastases in breast cancer patients. TIC could be recommended as reasonable alternative to frozen section due to its simplicity and low cost.

TI  - BERDYAEV'S "NEW MIDDLE AGES" CONCEPT
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to analyze N.A. Berdyaev's "New middle Ages" conception through the methodology of interdisciplinary synthesis developed by the Tomsk historiographic school led by B.G. Mogilnitsky. This makes N.A. Berdyaev's works a historiographic fact, reflecting the historical context, author's ideological, political and academic preferences, his belonging to a certain course of intellectual history. The main author's objective was to study evolution of Berdyaev's "New Middle Ages" concept, reflecting his thoughts on the world history and European culture fates in the twentieth century.In result, the author made the following conclusions:The religious historiosophy was the foundation of N.A. Berdyaev's worldview and historiographic attitudes, determined his assessment of world history's key events, characters and processes. Berdyaev's ideas about Christianity as a "revolutionary religion of freedom" formed his understanding of world history as the co-creation of God and man in the process of transforming the world. Thus, the Russian thinker created a new interpretation of Christianity as a messianic-eschatological and at the same time humanistic religion, embodying the great truth of history and the personal destiny of man, designed to free humanity from all bonds of natural and social slavery.The concept of the "New Middle Ages" reflected the existential nature of the historical and political discourse of the Russian thinker, whose personal experience contained the perceptions of two world wars, revolutions in Russia, Europe and Asia, totalitarianism, globalization.The symbolism of the "New Middle Ages" contained the basic sociocultural and political intentions of the Russian religious Renaissance: Christian humanism, personalism, liberal socialism.This N.A. Berdyaev's concept also combined two basic Slavophile' s and Westernism historiographic doctrines: liberal modernism, Christian universalism and messianism, characteristics of Russian Europeanism as a whole. The synthesis of Christian universalism and liberal socialism has given the "New Middle Ages" concept features of a perspective utopia.The "New Middle Ages" concept reflected such original N.A. Berdyaev's historiographical constructs as "the end of Europe", "awakening of the East", "the old world of the New Age", "the failure of history", "the era of uncertainty", "new barbarism", "new creative era".The author believes that Berdyaev' s "New Middle Ages" concept was a continuation and creative development of Russian religious Renaissance intellectual tradition with its desire to search a new language of historical narrative towards synthesis of historical comparative studies, historiosophy, psychohistory and cultural anthropology.

The functioning of the NSV was one of the most important social programs carried out in the framework of the National Socialist social policy. The organization's mission was to provide material assistance to needy compatriots who included exclusively "full-fledged" racial representatives of the German population, carriers of the national socialist worldview. The activities of the NSV, along with other areas of Nazi social legal policy contributed to the consolidation of society around the Nazi regime and legitimized its institutions.

TI  - MODIS-based land surface temperature for climate variability and change research: the tale of a typical semi-arid to arid environment
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to (1) determine the seasonalities and spatial and temporal rates of change of MODIS-based daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST) for the last 19 years from 2000 to 2018 and (2) investigate whether these rates are induced by natural (represented by elevation) or anthropogenic (represented by population counts) forcing. The study area is Jordan - a typical Middle Eastern semi-arid to arid country. Time-series additive seasonal decomposition and simple linear regression produced the following results. (1) For both daytime and nighttime the highest LST values were observed in June while the lowest LST values were observed in December. (2) No significant linear rates of change of LST were noticed in daytime, while significant linear rates of increase of LST, which varied from 0.041 degrees C/year to 0.119 degrees C/year, were observed in nighttime in about one-third of the area of the country mainly in the western parts. (3) The significant linear rates of increase of nighttime LST increased significantly by 0.005 degrees C/year for every 1,000 m increase in elevation and by 0.003 degrees C/year for every 1,000 people increase in population counts. (4) Both natural and anthropogenic factors affected LST in nighttime; however, anthropogenic factors seemed to be more important than natural factors.

TI  - SPATIAL VEGETATION GROWTH AND ITS RELATION TO SEASONAL TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION IN BAGHDAD
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND STATISTICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the seasonal variations of the urban vegetation is important to mitigate increased urban heat island intensification whereas green areas are found to be the most effective for urban cooling. Based on air temperature, precipitation, and Landsat satellite imagery data for the year 2019, this research studies the variations in urban vegetation growth of Baghdad during the four seasons of this year. Spatial digital maps of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were presented when NDVI e >= 0.2. The vegetation growth patterns show a significant seasonal cycle with the largest area of NDVI observed in summer (263.8 km(2)) in which the highest value of NDVI (0.81) was found. Correlations for NDVI versus temperature as well as NDVI versus precipitation were also investigated to determine the seasonal responses of urban vegetation cover to temperature and precipitation. The results show that NDVI at any season was affected by these variables observed at a time lag of one season. However, NDVI was linearly correlated with air temperature and inversely with cumulative precipitation for this study.

TI  - Sentinel-1 InSAR Coherence for Land Cover Mapping: A Comparison of Multiple Feature-Based Classifiers
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates and demonstrates the suitability of the Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence for land cover and vegetation mapping. In addition, this study analyzes the performance of this feature along with polarization and intensity products according to different classification strategies and algorithms. Seven different classification workflows were evaluated, covering pixel- and object-based analyses, unsupervised and supervised classification, different machine-learning classifiers, and the various effects of distinct input features in the SAR domain-interferometric coherence, backscattered intensities, and polarization. All classifications followed the Corine land cover nomenclature. Three different study areas in Europe were selected during 2015 and 2016 campaigns to maximize diversity of land cover. Overall accuracies (OA), ranging from 70% to 90%, were achieved depending on the study area and methodology, considering between 9 and 15 classes. The best results were achieved in the rather flat area of Donana wetlands National Park in Spain (OA 90%), but even the challenging alpine terrain around the city of Merano in northern Italy (OA 77%) obtained promising results. The overall potential of Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence for land cover mapping was evaluated as very good. In all cases, coherence-based results provided higher accuracies than intensity-based strategies, considering 12 days of temporal sampling of the Sentinel-1 A stack. Both coherence and intensity prove to be complementary observables, increasing the overall accuracies in a combined strategy. The accuracy is expected to increase when Sentinel-1 A/B stacks, i.e., six-day sampling, are considered.

TI  - Shelf-Break Upwelling and Productivity Over the North Kenya Banks: The Importance of Large-Scale Ocean Dynamics
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The North Kenya Banks (NKBs) have recently emerged as a new frontier for food security and could become an economically important fishery for Kenya with improved resources providing better accessibility. Little research has been done on the mechanisms supporting high fish productivity over the NKBs with information on annual and interannual environmental variability lacking. Here we use a high-resolution, global, biogeochemical ocean model with remote sensing observations to demonstrate that the ocean circulation exerts an important control on the productivity over the NKBs. During the Northeast Monsoon, which occurs from December to February, upwelling occurs along the Kenyan coast, which is topographically enhanced over the NKBs. Additionally, enhanced upwelling events, associated with widespread cool temperatures, elevated chlorophyll, nutrients, primary production, and phytoplankton biomass, can occur over this region. Eight such modeled events, characterized by primary production exceeding 1.3 g C/m(-2)/day, were found to occur during January or February from 1993-2015. Even though the upwelling is always rooted to the NKBs, the position, spatial extent, and intensity of the upwelling exhibit considerable interannual variability. The confluence zone between the Somali Current and East African Coastal Current (referred to as the Somali-Zanzibar Confluence Zone) forms during the Northeast Monsoon and is highly variable. We present evidence that when the Somali-Zanzibar Confluence Zone is positioned further south, it acts to enhance shelf-edge upwelling and productivity over the NKBs. These findings provide the first indication of the environmental controls that need to be considered when developing plans for the sustainable exploitation of the NKB fishery.Plain Language Summary The North Kenya Banks (NKBs) have recently emerged as a region capable of sustaining a rich fishery, which would boost Kenya's economy. Little research has been conducted on the environmental controls that affect these fisheries and whether there is annual variability over multiple years. Here an ocean model is used, with satellite remote sensing data, to investigate how the ocean influences this region. Specifically, the convergence of two currents during the Northeast Monsoon, the Somali Current and the East African Coastal Current, which meet near the NKBs and flow away from the coast. This induces the upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich waters, which are brought up from depth to the surface, resulting in the NKBs being a highly productive area. The confluence of these two currents forms from December to February and its position along the Kenyan coast varies from year-to-year. This leads to considerable variability in the intensity, position, and spatial extent of productive waters. Productivity is enhanced over the NKBs when the confluence of the two currents is generally positioned further south. These findings provide the first indication of the environmental controls that need to be taken into account when developing plans for sustainable exploitation of the fisheries resources.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Humanity is faced with a climate emergency that global warming has brought about. This is an ecological natural disaster caused by the human unilateral conquest of nature. The ecological perception found in folktales can elicit greater sympathy and action than the scientific awareness of the ecological crisis. Therefore, overcoming the ecological crisis with the natural perception of folktales can be a humanistic alternative to the climate crisis.The perception of natural life in folktales consists of several layers from the creation of the universe to mutual communication. First, the energies of yin and yang, like human men and women, interact with each other and create the universe, from which all creatures are born. Second, natural life, living and breathing like humans, exerts mysterious power to human life. Third, nature, as a personal being, interacts with humans on an equal basis. Fourth, natural life is superior to humans in morality. Fifth, some outstanding humans can commune with nature. In this world of folktales, nature is recognized to have influence on human life and is perceived as a higher being than humans who interacts and communicates with each other.To put into action the ecological worldview shown in folktales, it is necessary to innovate all the existing scientific technologies, academic research, and literary creation practice. The scientific community needs to invent a translator that enables people to communicate with natural life, and the folktale researchers are required to conduct studies to reinterpret folktales from an ecological perspective, breaking away from the human-centered conventional interpretation. For a transition in the worldview, there is a need for the re-creation of the existing folktales or the creation of their sequels based on ecologism. As a practice of such approach, this study attempted to reinterpret and re-create Korean folktales such as “The Magpie Who Returned the Favor,” “The Trial of the Tricky Hare,” and “The Tortoise and the Hare.” To find a humanistic alternative to overcome the ecological crisis, approaches to dismantle stereotypes are required. In other words, it is crucial to reinterpret and re-create folktales in order to reverse the existing narrative structures and overcome human-centered values. Folktale researchers should recreate existing stories like writers, and writers should present new interpretations like scholars based on rewriting work. The scholar and the writer are two but one, and one but two. The ecological worldview is about forming a holistic relationship from a segmental relationship.

AB  - This paper proposes a precise drone-positioning technique using a differential global positioning system (DGPS). The proposed system consists of a reference station for error correction data production, and a mobile station (a drone), which is the target for real-time positioning. The precise coordinates of the reference station were acquired by post-processing of received satellite data together with the reference station location data provided by government infrastructure. For the system's implementation, low-cost commercial GPS receivers were used. Furthermore, a Zigbee transmitter/receiver pair was used to wirelessly send control signals and error correction data, making the whole system affordable for personal use. To validate the system, a drone-tracking experiment was conducted. The results show that the average real-time position error is less than 0.8 m.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Traditional field-based methods of measurement of biomass and carbon storage face difficulty in collecting time-consuming and expensive, suggests the use of remote sensing-based techniques. It estimates the economic value of the aboveground biomass (AGB) using satellite remote sensing across the Hyrcanian forests of Iran. Methods: The Landsat-8 OLI sensor data were combined with field-based allometric information of 186 circular sample plots. The AGB was calculated at the plot level using the collected data and specific volumetric mass for species in the studied area. It was followed by calculating the carbon storage using a 50% carbon coefficient and the photosynthesis equation at the forest parcel level. Model results using the random forest and support vector machines. The carbon sequestration value was calculated with USD 25.3 as a shadow value of carbon in 2014 and using the replacement cost approach. Results: The highest performances achieved by RF for biomass, carbon storage and the carbon storage value (Iranian Rials of 0.67% and 16%, respectively). The value was derived once at the plot level of 12.22 million IRR (370.43 USD) per ha. In addition, at the parcel level, which resulted in an estimated value of 12.87 million IRR (390.24 USD) per ha.

TI  - Inverse Coefficient of Variation Feature and Multilevel Fusion Technique for Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisource remote sensing data contain complementary information on land covers, but fusing them is a challenging problem due to the heterogeneous nature of the data. This article aims to extract and integrate information from hyperspectral image (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data for land cover classification. As there is a scarcity of a large number of training samples for remotely sensed hyperspectral and LiDAR data, in this article, we propose a model, which is able to perform impressively using a limited number of training samples by extracting effective features representing different characteristics of objects of interest from these two complementary data sources (HSI and LiDAR). A novel feature extraction method named inverse coefficient of variation (ICV) is introduced for HSI, which considers the Gaussian probability of neighborhood between every pair of bands. We, then, propose a two-stream feature fusion approach to integrate the ICV feature with several features extracted from HSI and LiDAR data. We incorporate a fusion unit named canonical correlation analysis as a basic unit for fusing two different sets of features within each stream. We also incorporate the concept of ensemble classification where the features produced by two-stream fusion are distributed into subsets and transformed to improve the feature quality. We compare our method with the existing state-of-the-art methods, which are based on deep learning or handcrafted feature extraction or using both of them. Experimental results show that our proposed approach performs better than other existing methods with a limited number of training samples.

AB  - Limited fore-knowledge of the impending ignition potential is one of the main causes of not-so-effective forest-fire management in India. The present study is an approach to link forest fire trends and the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) for assessing forest fire forewarning. Fire trends were analyzed based on forest fire incidents detected by MODIS remotely-sensed data in the Shivalik forest tracts of Uttarakhand State of India over a period of 16 years to identify the vulnerable window of most-prone weeks. The study further uses KBDI to calculate the drought build-up in an area based on which the severity of impending forest fires can be predicted. This is one-of the first attempts for the inclusion of KBDI in understanding forest fire regime in Indian conditions.Based on the weekly-trends obtained from forest fire points during 2001-2016 affirm the most vulnerable time period for the occurrence of forest fire in the study region is from week 14 to week 22. The performance of KBDI proved to be a valid parameter in forecasting the severity of forest fire as its pattern over three years of study period (2014-2016) showed the same dynamics. The minimum value of KBDI i.e. the 'dip' value is significant for its use as a predictor to the severity of the fire season in the ensuing summer a full 10 weeks in advance.The findings of the present study pave the path for identifying the high-risk areas and severity of possible fires in the following fire season by correlating remote sensing and GIS techniques with Fire trends, peak period and Keetch Byram Drought Index. This study has a potential for adoption in countries like India for modern forest fire preparedness and management in a cost-effective manner.

AB  - The early and accurate detection of floods from satellite imagery can aid rescue planning and assessment of geophysical damage. Automatic identification of water from satellite images has historically relied on hand-crafted functions, but these often do not provide the accuracy and robustness needed for accurate and early flood detection. To try to overcome these limitations we investigate a tiered methodology combining water index like features with a deep convolutional neural network based solution to flood identification against the MediaEval 2019 flood dataset. Our method builds on existing deep neural network methods, and in particular the VGG16 network. Specifically, we explored different water indexing techniques and proposed a water index function with the use of Green/SWIR and Blue/NIR bands with VGG16. Our experiment shows that our approach outperformed all other water index technique when combined with VGG16 network in order to detect flood in images.

AB  - Speckle in SAR images makes it difficult to interpret the image thus reducing the effectiveness of image processing. In remote sensing, image scene classification is an elementary problem which aims to label an image automatically with a specific semantic category. The classification performance of SAR data with speckle is inadequate for many applications. Thus, speckle removal becomes an important pre-processing step for SAR data classification. This study investigates the impact and importance of speckle filtering for classification using ALOS-PALSAR-2 data on San Francisco area. Wishart classifier is chosen for classification of filtered and unfiltered SAR data. The influence of DFT based speckle reduction framework is investigated in terms of classification accuracy.

AB  - This study analyzed the spatio-temporal change pattern of greenhouse areas for Sangnam-myeon and Samrangjin-eup of Miryang-si in Gyeongnam,which is one of major greenhouse area. First, in order to overcome the lack of statistical data of the distribution of greenhouses, aerial and satelliteimages were interpreted from 1987 to 2018, and the spatial distribution of the greenhouse parcels which has continuously increased was mapped basedon the digital cadastral map. Next, through the emerging hot spot tool in ArcGIS Desktop, the spatio-temporal change in transition from open-fieldto greenhouse cultivation was classified into 9 clusters. About 67.7% of the target area was categorized as a hot spot, and the p attern o f New hot spot,which were recently converted to greenhouse parcels, covered about 34.1%. While, about 11.3% of parcels were expected to keep the existing open-fieldcultivation practice for a while. Overall, the greenhouse parcels have been densely developed along a river and were lately expanding even to the farneighbor. It implied that, in the future, the competition of water intake among farms would be more serious and the environmental responsibility inconsideration of water quality as well as quantity would be getting strengthened due to increasing pollution loads and river intake.

AB  - Purpose: In this study, a model was developed to estimate the storage in Cheonan reservoir using images taken by Sentinel-1 satellite. Method: A total of three reservoirs were studied. All three reservoirs are small reservoirs whose water level is being measured. The preprocessing of Sentinel-1 images was done using SNAP distributed by the European Space Agency(ESA), and the storage was estimated by classifying water surface by the threshold classification method. The estimated reservoir area was compared with satellite and drones images taken on the same day. The correlation was derived by comparing the estimated reservoir area with the actual measurement. Results and Conclusions: The storage values ​​estimated by satellite image analysis showed similar values ​​to the actual measurement data. However, because of the underestimation of the reservoir area due to green algae and Epilithic diatom of summer reservoirs and the low resolution of satellite images, it is dificult to detect reservoir area by satellite images less than 10,000m2.

AB  - A feasibility modeling for potential hydroelectric dam site selection was suggested using 1 sec ASTGTM (ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model) and Terra/Aqua MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived land use (MCD12Q1) data. The modeling includes DEM pre-processing of peak, sink, and flat, river network generation, watershed delineation and segmentation, terrain analysis of stream cross section and reservoir storage, and estimation of submerged area for compensation. The modeling algorithms were developed using Python and as an open source GIS. When a user-defined stream point is selected, the model evaluates potential hydroelectric head, reservoir surface area and storage capacity curve, watershed time of concentration from DEM, and compensation area from land use data. The model was tested for 4 locations of already constructed Buhang, BohyunMountain, Sungdeok, and Yeongju dams. The modeling results obtained maximum possible heads of 37.0, 67.0, 73.0, 42.0 m, surface areas of 1.81, 2.4, 2.8, 8.8 km2, storages of 35.9, 68.0, 91.3, 168.3×106 m3 respectively. BohyunMountain and Sungdeok show validity but in case of Buhang and Yeongju dams have maximum head errors. These errors came from the stream generation error due to ASTGTM. So, wrong dam watershed boundary limit the head. This study showed a possibility to estimate potential hydroelectric dam sites before field investigation especially for overseas project.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the viewpoints of Christian teachers in South Korea concerning Christian teaching. For analysis, the study used the Q methodology and derived 33 statements, which were selected through a comprehensive review and revision process. 29 Christian teachers were selected for the P sample. The results of this study revealed four viewpoints concerning Christian teaching. Teachers of Type 1 perceived Christian teaching as studying and teaching academic disciplines based on biblical worldview. Type 2 viewed Christian teaching as permeating biblical worldview into every educational activity and program. Type 3 focused on modeling of Christian teachers and transforming students lives. Finally, the teachers of Type 4 recognized Christian teaching as teaching while living as Christian. This study demonstrates how Christian teachers perceive Christian teaching, what elements are considered important in Christian teaching, and what Christian teachers do and what kinds of hindrance exist when they implement Christian teaching in classrooms. These findings will deliver more effective and practical ideas to develop educational training programs for Christian teachers.

T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Social prescribing aims to address social determinants of health, which account for 80%-90% of health outcomes, but the evidence base behind it is limited due to a lack of data linkingsocial prescribing activity and outcomes. Methods and analysis The objective of the quantitative component of this feasibility studyisto identify the characteristics of individuals who receive social prescriptions and describe the use and estimate the impact of social prescribing; the latter will be done on a homeless subgroup. We will use the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) primary care sentinel network, whose general practicescover a population of over 4 000 000 patients. Social prescribing data will be extracted onall recorded patients for 5 years up to 31 January 2020. The objective for the qualitative component of the study isto explore approaches to understand the contextual factors that will have influenced our quantitative findings to identify mechanisms to encourage adoption of social prescribing in primary care while improving data quality. Itwill comprise up to three 90-120 minute advisory group meetings for six to eight participants. Participants will be recruited based on their experience of delivering primary care within Oxfordshire and Surrey. The advisory group outputs will be analysed using framework analysis and will be used to create a survey instrument consisting of statements that surveyees, who will consist of primary care practitioners within the RCGP RSC, can agree or disagree with. Ethics and dissemination All RCGP RSC data are pseudonymised at the point of data extraction. No personally identifiable data are required for this investigation. This protocol follows the Good Reporting of a Mixed Methods Study checklist. The study results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and the dataset will be available to other researchers.

TI  - Obesity as a risk factor of in-hospital outcomes in patients with endometrial cancer treated with laparoscopic surgical mode
T2  - GINEKOLOGIA POLSKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Obesity has been suggested to have a negative influence on procedural outcomes of endometrial cancer laparoscopic treatment. Obesity and other possible risk factors of laparoscopic endometrial cancer treatment has not been precisely described in the literature. The aim of the study is to determine the factors that have the greatest influence on the course of laparoscopic surgery for endometrial cancer, with particular emphasis on the influence of obesity.Material and methods: The study included 75 females who were treated for endometrial cancer by laparoscopic surgery. Preoperative body-mass index (BMI), waist circumference(WC), waist to hip ratio(WHR), and selected anatomical indices were measured. The duration of surgery and hospitalization stay, loss of hemoglobin, and procedural-related complications served as parameters of in-hospital outcomes.Results: Multiple linear regression analysis indicate the body mass as most sensitive parameter of obesity which influence in-hospital outcomes in patients treated with laparoscopic procedure. Procedural-related complications occurred in the group of patients with significantly greater WC and BMI. Multiple linear regression indicates also histological grading (G1-G3), external conjugate, intertrochanteric distance as significant risk factors. The multiple linear regression analysis confirmed also that implementation of sentinel lymph node procedure is related with decreased hemoglobin loss in patients with cancer of endometrium compare to lymphadenectomy without sentinel node biopsy(Est.: 0.488; 95% CI: 0.083-0.892, p = 0.018).Conclusions: The most sensitive risk factor of in-hospital outcomes in laparoscopic treatment of endometrial cancer is body mass. The implementation of the sentinel node procedure is associated with reduced surgery time and reduced hemoglobin loss.

AB  - The watershed Ouergha River located in the north of Morocco suffer from vegetation cover degradation, this geographic entity is experiencing intense water erosion linked to the combination of several natural factors, such as the roughness and abundance of rainfall and the predominance of soft geological formations. Human intervention in this vulnerable environment accentuates its fragility by the clearing and degradation of the vegetation cover and the cultivation of land with a steep slope.This work aims to map the spatiotemporal evolution of this degradation by using the spot and Landsat images and the Radar image over a period from 1990 to 2014 data and aims to model its processes of erosion. In fact, the analysis of satellite data identified six main types of land use (eau, foret, reboisement...). It has also shown that the most degraded soils aren't necessarily those with the greatest erosion rates over the past 15 years and that some soils that have developed well over time have become major exporters of sediments after clearing and cultivation.The comparison of the results of land use has highlighted the harmful impact of human practices on the acceleration of soil degradation.Human intervention, coupled to frequent and severe drought periods, remain the most important factors in the weakening and increasing vulnerability of soils to degradation.The results obtained by this approach made it possible to identify and monitor vulnerable areas at Ouergha watershed where interventions are needed to limit the processes of degradation of the soil and the natural environment.

AB  - The city of Baghdad has witnessed an urban and industrial expansion with an increase in population, especially since 2003. Air pollution sources have multiplied by the increase in the number of vehicles and electricity generators, causing the emission of large quantities of hydrocarbon gases, including carbon dioxide, CO2. The discharge of such gases into the atmosphere and large amounts, will surely have a role in contributing to global warming. Therefore, it will have prominent adverse effects in influencing the rise in temperatures in the city. The research aimed to show the applied aspect of remote sensing and geographic information systems techniques in estimating the CO2 and its relationship to thermal balance for Baghdad city through fifteen stations distributed throughout the city. Remote sensing data adopted from US Geological and the European Centre, in addition to CO2 data for the Atmospheric Infrared sounder (AIRS) from Giovanni for the extended period (2003-2018), were used. Processing and statistical analysis were performed on data using GIS 10.6 and Origin 2018 software. The monthly rates of CO2 showed seasonal fluctuations between winter and summer, where the highest value of CO2 in July and the lowest value in February. Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) technology was used to represent the spatial distribution of CO2 concentrations in the city. Residential and industrial regions experienced higher levels compared to agricultural areas. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to find out the relationship between carbon dioxide and temperatures. The correlation coefficient showed a high positive relationship between increased gas concentrations and high temperatures for all study stations over the entire study period. It can be concluded the concentration of carbon dioxide differs locally in regions of Baghdad, such as residential, commercial, traffic, industrial, and rural areas, as well as during the months of the year.

AB  - Near surface air temperature (T air) is a descriptor of terrestrial environment conditions and one of climatic variables that most widely used in climate change studies. In this search, the worker suggested a high-resolution air temperature estimation from integrating Iraqi Agrometeorological network daily (T air) and land surface temperature (LST) that derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) or from Landsat8. The objective of this search is to find model to estimate high spatial resolution air temperature for any region based on satellite images and climate datasets. The data of air temperature used for modelling is collected by four weather stations located in Babylon Governorate from December 2016 to March 2017.The standard error for MODIS winter model is 1.55 and RMSE for landsat8 winter model is 1.3.

TI  - Urban expansion of Baghdad city and its impact on the formation of Thermal Island based upon Multi-Temporal Analysis of satellite images

AB  - The research deals with the thermal island in Baghdad city and the effect of urban expansion on it. Cities are suffering from a marked rise in temperature, compared with the surrounding rural areas, this problem occurs in most cities of the world. The reason for their formation is the increasing of human activity in the form of city components, such as buildings and roads that replace green spaces and open spaces. This means that most of these materials have the ability to absorb solar radiation and convert it into heat energy that increases the heat of their environment. Remote sensing technique is used to determine the thermal island through using Landsat satellite images as well as the use of GIS technology in mapping and analysis of spatial variation for thermal island. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is calculated to extract vegetation cover from 2003 to 2018. The land surface temperature is estimated from the thermal band of satellite images for the same period. The change in vegetation cover is linked to the change in land surface temperature to determine the effect of vegetation cover degradation on surface temperature, also to determine the relationship between thermal island and land uses. The values of NDVI was high in 2003 and it ranged from (-0.714 - 0.693); this indicates a high vegetal cover, while its value is decreased to (-0.22 - 0.509) in 2018, pointing out to the significant deterioration of vegetation cover in 15 years. The land surface temperature is increased from (10.93-36.26) in 2003 to (22.62-50.29) in 2018; all this at the expense of converting the green, open and agricultural areas to residential, commercial and industrial uses as well as the large number of random settlements that appeared in Baghdad after 2003.

AB  - We investigate ground deformation that occurred on national road infrastructure in North Buton Regency, South East Sulawesi, Indonesia. This research conducted to obtain spatial information about ground deformation occurred. Road infrastructure plays an important role in economic and transportation particularly in North Buton. Road damage will cause losses both economically and security. The method of the research was Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). InSAR uses two SAR Images from two different acquisitions to generate interferogram and then ground deformation parameter. We used Sentinel-1 images acquisition years of 2015 and 2017. We found that the ground deformation occurred between -118 to +20 millimeters during the year of 2015 and 2017 acquisition or about -59 to +10 millimeters per year and its direction from north to south of the road body. The movement of ground deformation is dominated downward movement which it is estimated strength affected by the presence of faults near the location.

AB  - This study is based on remote sensing tools and landscape change indicators. It produced a mapping of landscape dynamics in Mogods between 2000 and 2015. Landscape dynamics are addressed through the decision tree of J. BOGAERT et al. (2004). Dissection and perforation of the maquis have led to fragmentation and reduced spatial connectivity. The appropriation of new agricultural land is effected by the opening of clearings and the nibbling of wooded areas. In this respect, fire is an effective and highly used means. The diachronic study, however, is partially distorted by the improvement of the resolution of the Landsat images since 2013.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a potential application of remote sensing to geological and hydrometeorological hazards. This paper presents sustainability strategies for smart cities: the use of SAR Sentinel-1 for monitoring flood inundation and landslide hazards in Aceh Province, Indonesia. In this study, for flood detection, we attempt to uses Sentinel-1A (S-1A) in the same direction and acquisition through polarization of Vertical transmit and Vertical received (VV) - Vertical transmit and Horizontal received (VH) with a temporal baseline of 6 days. Those data were then analysed using the SNAP Toolbox. The results showed that the S-1A was successfully for detecting a flood inundation in which VH polarization is more sensitive than VV. For landslide monitoring, we apply multitemporal SAR images, where one of them is the Quasi-Persistent Scatterers (Q-PS) technique. Using ascending and descending orbit pass results in a better velocity map where both sides of the slope are detected due to the different sensor angle of both orbital passes. This technique has resulted in the undulating areas being monitored well and this will also fill the gap of layover and shadowing phenomena of the slant range SAR image. The Q-PS combinations were very effective to identify the deformation features associated with the land movement. For a smart city, natural hazards such as landslides and floods require continuous monitoring to ensure the potential as well as management and mitigation of natural hazards. Therefore, the InSAR technique is one of the effective ways for doing this strategy.

AB  - Gayo plateau, Aceh-Indonesia is an urbanized areas affected by tectonic phenomena due to the presence of the Great Sumatran Fault, which extends from the north in Aceh to the south in Lampung. This area was affected by strong seismic phenomena (Gayo plateau earthquake on 2 July 2013, MW 6.3) which induced landslide and deformation. InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) application using Sentinel-1 times series with Terrain Observation Progressive Scans (TOPS) mode has permitted a short acquisition repetition cycle, an extremely large coverage, a high spatial resolution with respect to the covered area and a small baseline separation particularly suited for interferometry application. All of those characteristics suggest an intensive exploitation of these data through the use of the interferometry technology and in particular the stacking interferometry for monitoring ground surface displacement. Persistent Scatterer (PS) and Quasi - PS (Q-PS) techniques were used in this research. The results of PS, Q-PS and combination of both techniques with ascending and descending of Sentinel-1A were presented in this paper. The SARPROZ software which PS and Q-PS technique seems to be the best candidate for this application relative to the morphology and large extension of the Lut Tawar Lake in the Gayo plateau. SAR images since 2017 were downloaded over the Lut Tawar Lake. This allows taking into measures for seismic hazard mitigation widely in Gayo plateau. Based on the result processing the Gayo Plateau is movement with 20 mm/year.

AB  - An updated information of flood mapping that recently occurred in South Sulawesi is an important necessity for site policy makers. Mapping of flood area during or soon after the flooding event is tremendous hardwork. However using active-remote sensing namely InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) technique can overcome these limitatations. To achieve it, at least two radar images have to be obtained which is 1 image before and 1 image during/after flood event. We selected 2 images Sentinel-1A GRD (Ground Range Detected) data for the same pass direction and the same time acquisitation with polarization VH (Vertical-Horizontal), 12 days of temporal baseline. The images were then processed by SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform) Toolbox. The results show that Sentinel-1A succeeded in detecting and monitoring flood event, where inundated of water in Tallo River is clearly visible in VH polarization.

AB  - This article presents the results of a study of the dynamics of the surface water area of the Studena dam using satellite images from Sentinel 2A and 2B. The period considered is from the beginning of 2019 to January 2020. The collected 35 cloud-free images from a total of 80 captured are organized in a spatial database in a GIS environment. A water index - MNDWI (Modified Normalized Difference Water) was used to determine the boundary of the water surface. The calculated areas for all images and their trends are analyzed by graph. For about seven months from the maximum annual area (0.91 km(2)) in June, a rapid decrease of 0.10 km(2) per month is observed until the beginning of 2020, when the lowest value was measured - 0.23 km(2).

T2  - Agronomy Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of agricultural crops with the help of remote and proximal sensors during the growing season plays important role for site-specific management decisions. Winter wheat, winter rape and poppy are representatives of typical agricultural crops from the family Poacea, Brassicaceae and Papaveraceae, growing in relative dry area of Rakovnik district in the Czech Republic. Ten Sentinel 2 satellite images acquired during vegetation season of the crops were downloaded and processed. Crops were monitored with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) equipped with consumer grade Red Green Blue (RGB) camera and multispectral (MS) MicaSense RedEdge MX camera. In-field variability was assessed by computing RGB-based vegetation indices Triangular Greenness Index (TGI), Green Leaf Index (GLI) and Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI) and commonly used vegetation indices as Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green NDVI (GNDVI). The results derived from satellite and UAV images were supported with in-situ measurements of hand-held GreenSeeker and Chlorophyll Meter Content sensors. The study showed the usability of individual vegetation indices, especially the TGI index for chlorophyll content estimation, and VARI index for green vegetation fraction detection and leaf area index estimation, in comparison with selected hand-held devices. The results showed as well that leaf properties and canopy structure of typical characteristics of selected families can significantly influence the spectral response of the crops detected in different phenological stages.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL AGROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of climate and topography on crop condition and yield estimates is most effectively monitored by non-invasive satellite imagery. This paper evaluates the efficiency of free-access Sentinel 2 and Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite images scanned by different sensors on wheat growth and yield prediction. Five winter and spring wheat cultivars were grown between 2005 and 2017 in a relatively small 11.5 ha field with a 6% slope. The normalized difference vegetation index was derived from the satellite images acquired for later growth phases of the wheat crops (Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessorenamt and Chemical industry 55 - 70) and then compared with the topography wetness index, crop yields and yield frequency maps. The results showed a better correlation of data obtained over one day (R-2 = 0.876) than data with a one-day delay (R-2 = 0.689) using the Sentinel 2 B8 band instead of the B8A band for the near-infrared part of electromagnetic spectrum in the normalized difference vegetation index calculation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current evidence indicates that children are relatively spared from direct COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality, but that the indirect effects of the pandemic pose significant risks to their health and wellbeing.OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of the local COVID-19 outbreak on routine child health services.METHODS: The District Health Information System data set for KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) provincial health services was accessed, and monthly child health-related data were extracted for the period January 2018 - June 2020. Chronological and geographical variations in sentinel indicators for service access, service delivery and the wellbeing of children were assessed.RESULTS: During April - June 2020, following the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in KZN, significant declines were seen for clinic attendance (36%; p=0.001) and hospital admissions (50%; p=0.005) of children aged &lt;5 years, with a modest recovery in clinic attendance only. Among service delivery indicators, immunisation coverage recovered most rapidly, with vitamin A supplementation, deworming and food supplementation remaining low. Changes were less pronounced for in- and out-of-hospital births and uptake rates of infant polymerase chain reaction testing for HIV at birth, albeit with wide interdistrict variations, indicating inequalities in access to and provision of maternal and neonatal care. A temporary 47% increase in neonatal facility deaths was reported in May 2020 that could potentially be attributed to COVID-19-related disruption and diversion of health resources.CONCLUSIONS: Multiple indicators demonstrated disruption in service access, service delivery and child wellbeing. Further studies are needed to establish the intermediate- and long-term impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on child health, as well as strategies to mitigate these.

AB  - Water body detection using remote sensing based on machine interpretation of satellite image is efficient for managing water resource, drought and flood monitoring. In this study, water body detection with SAR satellite image based on machine learning was performed. However, non water body area can be misclassified to water body because of shadow effect or objects that have similar scattering characteristic comparing to water body, such as roads. To decrease misclassifying, 8 combination of morphology open filtered band, DEM band, curvature band and Cosmo-SkyMed SAR satellite image band about Mokpo region were trained to semantic segmentation machine learning models, respectively. For 8 case of machine learning models, global accuracy that is final test result was computed. Furthermore, concordance rate between landcover data of Mokpo region was calculated. In conclusion, combination of SAR satellite image, morphology open filtered band, DEM band and curvature band showed best result in global accuracy and concordance rate with landcover data. In that case, global accuracy was 95.07% and concordance rate with landcover data was 89.93%.

AB  - In order to address ‘fantastic literature’, it is essential a profound understanding of the concept of the genre, since the meanings involved in the term of ‘fantasy’ are too varied and broad, in addition to the fact that literary tradition -which deals with ‘fantasy’- is very olden. In particular, if fantasy literature is considered as a product of Romanticism, which was born with a specific worldview at the end of the 18th century–an epistemological reaction against Western ‘logocentrism’ –it is necessary to delimit it from other neighboring genres such as myths, medieval tales, fairy tales, magic realism and ‘lo real maravilloso americano(The Marvelous Real in America)’, among others.Doubtlessly, the effects of ‘the fantastic’, which are mechanisms of emotional and epistemological reactions caused by supernatural phenomena, can be relative according to the historical-cultural context of each society. No matter how different cultures are, the concept of ‘reality’ always prevails; likewise, the common purpose of ‘the fantastic’ genre is to pose an essential question about that idea of ‘reality’. In this sense, works of fantastic literature from different cultures can be analyzed with an identical methodology.In this research, after examining the constituent elements defined in the fantastic Western theory, “The dream” –tale written by Ra Do-Hyang (Korea, 1902-1926) – shall be analyzed. The abovementioned literary work is very remarkable from the ‘fantastic genre perspective’, as it satisfies most of the basic prerequisites of the ‘fantastic’ theoretical framework.Likewise, in this academic article, biographical elements and aesthetic aspects of the text shall be excluded, which are generally considered in the study related to the author. Thus, just the main rules required by fantastic literature shall be used to compare consistency between text and genre.

AB  - This paper examines the medieval Islamic worldview in historical and geographic writings about East Asia in the tenth century, particularly two books, Muruj al-Dhahab and Kitab al-Tanbih wa-al-Ishraf, by al-Masʿudi about Korean history. This article explores the conceptual elements in the texts about Silla to reconstruct the integration process of the foundation of the Islamic world history.The thesis’ approaches the application of the synthesis of previous written knowledge from different ancient civilizations and the contemporary field data collected by the time’s Muslim network over the world. Additionally, this research refers to the period dynamics among East Asian countries and their foreign relations with the Islamic world.The main argument is that the Islamic world created Korean history to meet Islamic theology. Particularly, al-Masʿudi set the origin of the Silla people from Yaphet, the son of Gomer in the Bible. Also, he designated the seventh nation consisting of the people of Silla and China. He regarded the Chinese and Silla people were derived from one of the seven primal civilizations.

AB  - This study focuses on the social imagination of character storytelling, focusing on Pengsoo of “Giant PengTV”, which is currently enjoying explosive popularity. Character storytelling is fundamentally related to business, so social and cultural phenomena are important tools. Also, the imagination that man has cannot help but face up to sociality and ultimately be incorporated into social order. This paper is notes that characters derive from images and absorb and recreate the tools and functions of society. In an information society, the media industry is becoming globalized by forming a cultural network. The media environment has become the basis for social imagination. Pengsoo's character has significant research value in that it absorbs the benefits of traditional storytelling and modern social phenomena against the backdrop of the media environment.Pengsoo character storytelling, first of all, has a simple design and behavior that is characteristic of a popular character, unexpectedness. Images secure the character's uniqueness and become the source of the ideological ideology that society aims for. Second, the company secured large numbers of subscribers through YouTube, while utilizing the advantages of terrestrial broadcasters to facilitate the establishment of fandom at various levels. Third, storytelling was built by combining the benefits of star system with the benefits of character through influencer marketing that grasped the replacement of consumption forces. Finally, we can cite the establishment of generational identity and the appearance of multipersona. This is in line with the social trend of trying to understand gender identity or discrimination that is now accepted in society as a difference. Pengsoo's worldview and storytelling are similar to those used in society today or what society is aiming for. This is in the same vein as the flow of popular culture. However, Pengsoo's fragmented language activity as an object of mass media and his non-central commerciality are pointed out as limitations.Character storytelling also has a good influence on business when understanding the environment and cultural trends of the society and expressing new imagination. It also stimulates the emotional inner side of human beings and expands throughout society and culture to develop in various ways. The character storytelling and character industry, which absorb the diversity required by the times like Pengsoo characters, will continue to develop and maintain a closer relationship with social imagination.

AB  - The amount of open satellite data has increased tremendously in recent years, simultaneously with a continuing decrease in the price of high performance cloud computing. This can be combined with machine learning methods to perform crop type classification in the agricultural sector. In this paper, we propose a data processing chain for processing multitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR data, and show how the temporal patterns of agricultural fields can be visualized to provide a valuable overview prior to classification. We then investigate the performance of 6 machine learning methods for crop type classification of 12 crop types based on 44333 fields, and achieve an overall accuracy of (94.02 +/- 0.25)% with an RBF SVM classifier. The dataset used is a subset of all the fields of the chosen crop types in Denmark in 2019, which comprises a total of 289810, or 49.34% of all fields in the country for the 2019 season. The entire data processing chain is based on open data and free open source software, thereby minimizing the cost of practical applications and future work for both industry and academia. All code used for the paper is available on GitHub.

AB  - Precision Agriculture (PA) has a fundamental role in the sustainability of agricultural systems, supporting decision-making of agricultural crops, increasing yield and quality in production. In the present research a PA approach for viticulture was made combining remote sensing data and robotic monitoring. With this approach it was intended to perform a spatial-temporal analysis of the grapevine phenology, according the 3 periods of the grape's biological cycle reproductive cycle, peak of the season and vegetative dormancy - corresponding to the years of 2017/18, for a specific area of the Green Wine Region, from Celorico de Basto (Portugal). The proposed methodology is based in the automation of spatial analyses through Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Python programming language. GEE was used for image acquisition and processing data of several indices, as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) and Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index ( VARI). Regarding the geoprocessing of environmental factors, it was considered the following parameters: precipitation, temperature and soil moisture. Afterwards, NDVI was selected for a space-time analysis of the vineyard phenology, once this index represents a close dynamic to the vineyard biological cycle. From the relation between environmental factors and NDVI it was possible to interpret the space-time dynamics of the vineyard phenology. Finally, a spatial interpolation of yield and NDVI was made to understand the influence of NDVI in the yield. It can be assumed that the NDVI does not have a statistically significant influence on vineyard yield.

AB  - In 1988 DARPA provided funding to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center to support the development of GaAs Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors (QWIP). The goal was to make a single element photodetector that might be expandable to a two-dimensional array format. Ultimately, this led to the development of a 128 x 128 element array in collaboration with AT&T Bell Labs and Rockwell Science Center in 1990. We continued to develop numerous generations of QWIP arrays most recently resulting in the multi-QWIP focal plane for the NASA-US Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat 8 mission launched in 2013 and a similar instrument on the Landsat 9 mission to be launched in 2020. Toward the end of the Landsat 8 QWIP-based Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) instrument the potential of the newly developed Strained Layer Superlattice (SLS) detector array technology became of great interest to NASA for three primary reasons: 1) higher operating temperature; 2) broad spectral response and; 3) higher sensitivity. We have collaborated extensively with QmagiQ, LLC and Northwestern University to further pursue and advance the SLS technology ever since we started back in 2012. In December of 2018 we launched the first SLS-based IR camera system to the International Space Station on board the Robotic Refueling Mission #3 (RRM3). This paper will describe the evolution of QWIP technology leading to the current development of SLS-based imaging systems at the Goddard Space Flight Center over the past 30 years.

TI  - Comparison of Different Multispectral Sensors for Photosynthetic and Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation-Fraction Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is very difficult and complex to acquire photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and non-PV (NPV) fractions (f(PV) and f(NPV)) using multispectral satellite sensors because estimations of f(PV) and f(NPV) are influenced by many factors, such as background-noise interference of pixel-, spatial-, and spectral-scale effects. In this study, comparisons between Sentinel-2A Multispectral Instrument (S2 MSI), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (L8 OLI), and GF1 Wide Field View (GF1 WFV) sensors for retrieving sparse photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation coverage are presented. The analysis employed a linear spectral-mixture model (LSMM) and nonlinear spectral-mixture model (NSMM) to unmix pixels with different spectral and spatial resolution images based on field endmembers; the estimated endmember fractions were later validated with reference to fraction measurements. The results demonstrated that: (1) with higher spatial and spectral resolution, the S2 MSI sensor had a clear advantage for retrieving PV and NPV fractions compared to L8 OLI and GF1 WFV sensors; (2) through incorporating more red edge (RE) and near-infrared (NIR) bands, the accuracy of NPV fraction estimation could be greatly improved; (3) nonlinear spectral mixing effects were not obvious on the 10-30 m spatial scale for desert vegetation; (4) in arid regions, a shadow endmember is a significant factor for sparse vegetation coverage estimated with remote-sensing data. The estimated NPV fractions were especially affected by the shadow effects and could increase root mean square by 50%. The utilized approaches in the study could effectively assess the performance of major multispectral sensors to extract f(PV) and f(NPV) through the novel method of spectral-mixture analysis.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to reveal the codes expressed in Kim Dong-ri and Park Mok-wol, and to find the connection points with the codes of Donghak. It is claimed that Gyeongju is the hometown of poetry and the hometown of novels. This is because it is the birthplace of Silla Scent and Geumoh Myth. From two poets, Gyeongju is revealed as a reflection of his hometown, feelings, family, nature and life. Gyeongju as a code of’millennium’ is connected to the world that encompasses both the victorious and the poor.In this study, the code of’connection’ as a physical contact was found. In the poems of Dongli and Mokwol,’nature and human’ are not different, and’life and death’ showed the characteristics of connection. Dong-ri’s <Train Travel> and Mok-wol’s <Traveler> are the features of the front, and <Paulownia flower> and <Hagwan> are works that show the features of the back. It turns out that no difference and connection are based on physical contact.Also, the emotional sympathy code was discovered. In the works of poets Kim Dong-ri and Park Mok-wol, we found that “time and space” is full and “seung and seung” communicate with each other. Fullness was the feature of Dong-ri’s <Cricket> and Mok-wol’s <Guimit-Samagui>. Also, the works that show communication were Dongli’s <Rainbow> and Mokwol’s <Sungulbi of Mansulabi>.The results of the research conducted in this paper are as follows. The codes of ‘connection’ and ‘communication’ in the works of poets Kim Dong-ri and Park Mok-wol were in the same context as the horizontal codes of Donghak. ‘Innaecheon’ and ‘Sainyeocheon’ are principles that resolve authority and discrimination and apply equally to relationships between people and the world. It is a horizontal relationship and such a worldview is based on horizontal thinking. The code of connection and communication revealed by expanding the space on a cosmic scale, or the perception that encompasses Lee Seung and Seung converges to the code of the race “millennial” while sharing the horizontal code and context of Donghak.

AB  - The detection of ship targets in remote sensing satellite images is an important means to obtain all ships on the sea surface by satellite image. It can realize the monitoring of sea surface resources, so it has important civil and military significance. Because of the complex background, ship detection in harbour is one of the difficulties. In recent years, many target detection methods based on deep learning have been proposed, and they have achieved good results in natural scene images. YOLOv3 is an advanced end-to-end method because of its high detection accuracy and fast detection speed. But even advanced methods have their shortcomings in this task. Ships in port usually dock side by side, which leads to missed detection of many targets when NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression) operation is performed on the predicted bounding boxes. In this paper, we replace the original NMS with Soft-NMS on the basis of YOLOv3. This operation makes the detector miss fewer targets. At the same time, we added IoU loss when calculating the loss of the prediction box and ground truth box. IoU loss takes the prediction box and the IoU value of its corresponding ground truth box as the evaluation criterion, which makes the target box generated by the detector more fitted to the target. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we use harbour remote sensing data collected from Google image and GaoFen-2 (GF-2) satellite, the experimental results show good performance of the proposed method in the detection of ship targets in harbour.

AB  - The topic of school community is considered very important in Christian education because the Christian religion is based on relationships. However, the studies on school community in Christian education are insufficient. Therefore, this study intends to explore the characteristics of school communities in Christian elementary school through descriptive approach. For this, data was collected through a ten-week participant observations and ten-time interview with the teachers, students, and parents, and artifacts collection. The result of the analysis, students were growing up with experiencing inner conflicts when they have a good relationship with their friends as a member of one community. This study gives suggestions to Christian school and public school communities as follows. First, studies on Christian schools’ community have to be based on the Christian worldview. Second, The community of justice needs to be included in Christian school communities. Third, Christian school students experience continuous inner conflicts when practicing Christian values, thus the classroom community needs to be a place where students can talk about it openly. Fourth, public schools only consider the abilities to cultivate community competence, but it needs to apply the Christian school community where it is comfortable and acceptable to reveal weakness. In this way, the community will become a more humanistic environment.

AB  - An algorithm uses the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series curve to compute NDVI change rate (CR) for every 8-day over a period (2008-2018) from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The indices of CR variables within the winter wheat growing season were correlated with the end of the season winter wheat yield. A strong correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient = -0.48) was found in day of year 153-161 (filling) and the CR_153161 was used to build a univariate regression model. Stepwise multiple linear regression was then used and then 16 CR variables were selected to construct the multiple regression model. The two models are good at predicting yield. The prediction results of two models were compared with official agricultural statistics showing that the RMSE = 578.21 kg ha(-1)/ 4 57.38 kg ha(-1) and MRE = 18.54%114.56%. Remote sensing of NDVI-CR, therefore, is a valuable tool for estimating winter wheat yield well in advance of harvest.

AB  - To solve the ill-conditioned problem of the traditional aerosol inversion methods, based on radiative transfer equations, an aerosol inversion method using deep learning for Landsat 8 OLI data was proposed in this article. The aerosol inversion model was generated by constructing a sample data set and training a deep learning network. Then the model was used to conduct aerosol inversion experiments in some typical areas worldwide, and AERONET data was selected to verify the accuracy of the inversions. Experiments and verification show that this method can achieve continuous and stable aerosol distribution for different underlying surface types, and the aerosol inversions are highly accurate and reliable. The method is of great significance in quantitative aerosol remote sensing and atmospheric pollution monitoring.

AB  - In order to ensure the reliability of satellite data, it is necessary to test the authenticity of satellite products during the operation of ocean color satellite in orbit. Therefore, it is significant to obtain accurate sea surface field data, which can provide source data for the authenticity test of satellite products. At present, the main means of acquiring data at sea in China is still large-scale voyage test on board ships. This method needs high cost and requires a lot of manual operation, and the efficiency of acquiring data is extremely limited. However, a large amount of observation data can be obtained by establishing long-term automatic observation stations at sea, and the cost is low. In this paper, the continuous observation data of atmospheric optical parameters obtained by CE318 solar photometer installed on Wenzhou offshore platform in Zhejiang Province are analyzed based on the data processing method of AERONET. Combined with the actual situation, the automatic observation data of atmospheric optical parameters at sea are qualitatively controlled and verified by satellite data. Finally, a data quality control scheme for automatic observation of atmospheric optical parameters at sea is proposed.

In previous work, interpretation of remote sensing images from Google suggests that this fault section exposes on slopes of the eastern bank of the Mingjiang River, expressing as surface ruptures, implying its activity during Holocene. While the features of fault scarps seen in the field challenges the existence of these ruptures. By virtue of exhaustive field investigations, this paper attempts to further address this issue. Our analysis of geology and geomorphology suggests that the topographic characteristics from remote sensing data are not traces of surface ruptures, instead resulted from a big landslide at the river. Thus it reminds us that there may be a great uncertainty when using remote sensing images interpretation to infer surface ruptures associated with faults.

AB  - Coastal environmental elements such as bathymetry maps are of great significance to the economic and military development of each country. Spaceborne hyperspectral imager is one of the important instruments for coastal zone monitoring. Firstly, this paper systematically reviews the index system of spaceborne hyperspectral imagers, and then introduces the applications of hyperspectral remote sensing images in the retrieval of nearshore bathymetry. In order to improve the inversion accuracy, the current research status and shortcomings of fusion technology of laser active remote sensing and hyperspectral passive remote sensing are discussed. Furthermore, the index system of hyperspectral imagers is prospected based on the requirement of applications in coastal zone monitoring, which provides reference and support for the further development of hyperspectral remote sensing in coastal applications.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays a crucial role in the water and energy flux exchange between the atmosphere and the land surface. Remote sensing and modeling are two main approaches to obtain the SM over the large-scale area. However, there are always differences between them due to spatial-temporal resolution, observation depths, algorithm and measurement uncertainties In this study, an assessment of the comparison of a remotely sensed SM product Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and a land surface model dataset (NLDAS-2) is carried by using 17 permanent SM observation sites located in the South Great Plains (SGP) in the U.S. The comparison between the SMAP and the NLDAS-2 was analyzed by using (1) a conventional statistic concerning in-situ measurements, (2) the triple collocation analysis. The results demonstrate that: (1) the SMAP products show stronger correlations (R=0.78) relative to the NLDAS-2 (R=0.72) with respect to the in-situ measurements; (2) the TC-derived R of NLDAS-2 is higher than the SMAP, which means the temporal variations of NLDAS -2 is closer to the true values. The uncertainty of the remotely sensed data is higher than the modelled data set, which must be considered in the assimilation of SM observations.

TI  - HISTIF: A New Spatiotemporal Image Fusion Method for High-Resolution Monitoring of Crops at the Subfield Level
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based time-series crop monitoring at the subfield level is essential to the efficient implementation of precision crop management. Existing spatiotemporal image fusion techniques can be helpful, but they were often proposed to generate medium-resolution images. This study proposed a high-resolution spatiotemporal image fusion method (HISTIF) consisting of filtering for cross-scale spatial matching (FCSM) and multiplicative modulation of temporal change (MMTC). In FCSM, we considered both point spread function effect and geo-registration errors between fine and coarse resolution images. Subsequently, MMTC used pixel-based multiplicative factors to estimate the temporal change between reference and prediction dates without image classification. The performance of HISTIF was evaluated using both simulated and real datasets with one from real Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and simulated Landsat-like/Sentinel-like images, and the other from real GF-1 and real Landsat/Sentinel-2 data on two sites. HISTIF was compared with the existing methods spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), FSDAF, and Fit-FC. The results demonstrated that HISTIF produced substantial reduction in the fusion error from cross-scale spatial mismatch and accurate reconstruction in spatial details within fields, regardless of simulated or real data. The images predicted by STARFM exhibited pronounced blocky artifacts. While the images predicted by HISTIF and Fit-FC both showed clear within-field variability patterns, HISTIF was able to reduce the spectral distortion more significantly than Fit-FC. Furthermore, HISTIF exhibited the most stable performance across sensors. The findings suggest that HISTIF could be beneficial for the frequent and detailed monitoring of crop growth at the subfield level.

TI  - AN IMPROVED CHANGE DETECTION METHOD FOR SOIL MOISTURE RETRIEVAL USING SENTINEL-1 AND SMAP DATA

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - In this paper, an improved change detection method (ICDM) is proposed to obtain the soil surface moisture (SSM) with a resolution of 20 meters, which greatly improves the resolution of SMAP soil moisture products. First, NDWI was calculated using a time series data of Sentinel-2 and then converted to vegetation water content (m(veg)). With the help of the water cloud model, the influence of vegetation on the backscattering coefficient is eliminated. Then, in order to make the change detection method (CDM) more reasonable, a method for removing influence of roughness change on backscattering coefficient is proposed. It uses the difference between copolarization and cross-polarization( sigma(0)(vv) - sigma(0)(vh))for roughness normalization. SSM was obtained by combining the soil relative moisture retrieved from the time series data of Sentinel-1 with the maximum and minimum water content of the study area within one year obtained from the SMAP data. The results showed that the MRE of SSM extracted by ICDM was 8.34%, which was less than 17.49% of CDM.

TI  - Validation of MODIS ocean-colour products in the coastal waters of the Yellow Sea and East China Sea
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - An extensive study collected in situ data along the Yellow Sea (YS) and East China Sea (ECS) to assess the radiometric properties and the concentration of the water constituents derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Thirteen high quality match-ups were obtained for evaluating the MODIS estimates of R-rs(lambda), chlorophyll a (Chl a) and concentrations of suspended particulate sediment matter (SPM). For MODIS R-rs(lambda), the mean absolute percentage difference (APD) was in the range of 20%-36%, and the highest uncertainty appeared at 412 nm, whereas the band ratio of R-rs(lambda) at 488 nm compared with that at 547 nm was highly consistent, with an APD of 7%. A combination of near-infrared bands and shortwave infrared wavelengths atmosphere correction algorithm (NIR-SWIR algorithm) was applied to the MODIS data, and the estimation accuracy of Rrs were improved at most of the visible spectral bands except 645 nm, 667 nm and 678 nm. Two ocean-colour empirical algorithms for Chl a estimation were applied to the processed data, the results indicated that the accuracy of the derived Chl a values was obviously improved, the four-band algorithms outperformed the other algorithm for measured and simulated datasets, and the minimum APD was 35%. The SPM was also quantified. Two regional and two coastal SPM algorithms were modified according to the in situ data. By comparison, the modified Tassan model had a higher accuracy for the application along the YS and ECS with an APD of 21%. However, given the limited match-up dataset and the potential influence of the aerosol properties on atmosphere correction, further research is required to develop additional algorithms especially for the low Chl a coastal water.

AB  - Aiming at the recognition of line features represented by bridges and airport runways in remote sensing data, this paper presents a line objects extraction algorithm based on Non-subsampled Contourlet Transform(NSCT), Firstly, NSCT is used to decompose the source image into multiple layers and directions to obtain the corresponding frequency sub-bands. Then the Line Segment Detection(LSD) algorithm with visual saliency is used to detect the line segments. Finally, line objects recognition is completed by multi-scale and multi-direction line features combination according to the established fusion rules. Comparison with some traditional algorithms verifies that the proposed algorithm can improve the recognition accuracy.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) allows all-weather, day and night surveillance. Thus, it is of great significance for the ship detection and recognition. Because of the SAR special imaging mechanism, it is very difficult to extract the ship features with SAR image for the traditional target detection algorithm. In this paper, we proposed a approach which is composed of you only look once (YOLO) algorithm, sliding window detection strategy, and clustering algorithm. Firstly, the SAR images of GaoFen-3 and training dataset are gathered. Secondly, the experiments about the size of ship detection frame is carried out to find the optimum size of the frame for the training model. Thirdly, the ships are detected initially with YOLO v3 and fast region-based convolutional neural network (Fast-RCNN). Finally, the detected ships are clustered adaptively, and the experimental results of YOLO v3 and Fast-RCNN are compared and discussed at length. Our experimental results demonstrated that our method outperformed Fast-RCNN to detect the ships in the surface sea with low-resolution wide -band SAR images. Therefore, our approach is a robust method to detect the ships in the surface sea with SAR images.

AB  - InSAR technique is a powerful remote sensing tool to detect potentially unstable slopes at a catchment scale and to monitor surface displacements of a single landslide. However, decorrelations caused by complex terrain and vegetation coverage in southwest mountainous areas of China, make it almost impossible for conventional time series InSAR methods (e.g. PSI and SBAS) to identify sufficient measurement points and get desired results. In this paper, a new InSAR approach named coherent scatterer (CS) -InSAR is proposed to map landslide surface displacements by joint exploitation of persistent scatterers (PS) and distributed scatterers (DS). Case study of Danba County using both L-band ALOS PALSAR images (2006-2011) and C-band Sentinel IW images (2017-2018) demonstrate the effectiveness of our CS- InSAR method in detecting and monitoring the activity of potential landslide in China's mountainous west.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an important role in a variety of practical applications. Land surface temperature (LST) is a valuable metric for constraining ET. However, retrieved remote sensed LST values corresponding to a scene viewed by different angles thus leading to different retrievals would bring directional effects on ET estimation. Here the directional effects were assessed by developing an approach to provide LST with consistent view angle. The key of this approach was to provide nadir (0 degrees view zenith) surface reflectance with bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model to derive nadir fractional vegetation cover (FVC); simultaneously, the original remote sensed directional LST was separated to soil temperature (T-s) and vegetation temperature (T-v) components which have no directional effects. Then the nadir LST were obtained by combining the T-s and T-v using corresponding nadir FVC. Finally, ET were estimated with the surface energy balance system (SEBS) model using the remote sensed directional LST and the obtained nadir LST as input, respectively, and the difference between them was analyzed for assessing the directional effects. Meteorological and remote sensing data at Yucheng site in China were used as test data. The results showed that the directional effect from LST would cause the escalation of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by 15.8 W/m(2) (5%) in ET estimations.

AB  - Shiyang River Basin, located in the north piedmont of Qilian Mountain and the east of Hexi region in Gansu province, is one of the three major in land rivers in Hexi region, the fall of the elevation in the basin is large, the ecological environment is complex, the eco-system type is complete, the land cover type is various and the regional difference is distinct, is one of the sensitive areas for climate change. This research is based on Landsat MSS (1980), Landsat-80LI(2015), filed study and vegetation chart and other multi-source data, using 3S technology to compile the data of land cover in Shiyang River Basin with high accuracy and analyze the changing features of land cover from 1980-2015 in the basin. We found the land utilization type distribution of Shiyang River Basin, forest mainly distributed in Qilian mountain areas where the altitude is relatively high, one part of the grassland which is the natural grassland is distributed in Qilian mountain area, the other part of the grassland, the artificial grassland is in the middle and lower area of the basin, which is cross distributed with the cropland. The vertical distribution of major cover type in the basin possesses distinct feature of zonation. Land cover goes from high altitude to low altitude, which is the distribution of the accumulation of snow, glacier, forest, grassland, built-up land, cropland, water body bare land or sand in sequence. These results provide a scientific basis for the study of land use and cover change in a critical region and will inform ecosystem protection, sustainability and management in area of Qilian Mountains.

TI  - A New RD-RFM Stereo Geolocation Model for 3D Geo-Information Reconstruction of SAR-Optical Satellite Image Pairs
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, numerous earth-observation data are obtained from different kinds of platforms, in which data from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors and optical sensors account for the vast majority. They have been widely used in different fields such as 3 dimensional (3D) geo-information reconstruction, object recognition and others. Researchers have investigated the suitability of the rational function model (RFM) for 3D geo-information production with stereo SAR-optical images. Compared with optical remote sensing data, parameters of the RFM for satellite SAR images are not provided to users in most cases, which increases the workload of users applying the SAR-optical stereo geolocation based on RFM. Moreover, the fitting accuracy of RFM to the Range Doppler (RD) model, which is considered as the rigorous sensor model for SAR imagery, do not always meet the requirements. Therefore, a new RD-RFM stereo geolocation model by integrating the RD model of SAR images with the RFM of optical images are proposed for 3D geo-information reconstruction with SAR-optical stereo image pairs. Experiments are conducted based on dataset from Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR satellite and Gaofen-2 (GF-2) optical satellite covering urban and mountainous areas in Xinyi City and Dengfeng City, Henan Province, China, respectively. Results indicated that our proposed model can achieve the best performance with different terrain and different convergence angle of stereo SAR-optical image pairs. Compared with the traditional stereo geolocation model based on the RFM for both SAR and optical data, our proposed model is more concise and efficient for the production of 3D geo-information with stereo SAR-optical image pairs, and it's easy to be implemented for users.

Preliminary behavioral and biological aspects of P. puparum were recorded from sentinel pupae of P. multicaudatus. Parasitoid wasps arrived at the pupae beginning on the second day of exposure and interacted with pupae for a period of one to five hours for seven days. A parasitism rate of 39% by P. puparum was recorded on P. multicaudatus pupae. Wasps began to emerge 46.15 days after pupae were exposed to parasitism, with an average of 144 wasps emerging per pupa. The sex ratio of parasitoids was skewed toward females, with a female: male ratio of 4:1.

TI  - Rapid urban flood damage assessment using high resolution remote sensing data and an object-based approach
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Torrential rainfall can generate landslides, flash floods, and debris flows which might become disasters, causing loss of life and damage to property and infrastructure. To respond opportunely to hydrometeorological hazards, it is necessary to assess, rapidly and accurately, damage to the affected area. This is commonly done through time-consuming reconnaissance visits to obtain detailed field information. This paper proposes a methodology which uses: i) high resolution satellite and RGB images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), ii) digital elevation models (DEM), and iii) object-based image analysis (OBIA) for rapid urban flood damage assessment and estimation of the number of houses washed away, or with a total or partial roof collapse, by comparing pre- and post-event data. The case study was Tropical Storm Earl in 2016 that affected the town of Chicahuaxtla, Puebla, Mexico, due to the overflow of the Zempoloantongo River that cuts through the town causing several loss of life and severe property damage. The results indicate that the three-pronged approach proposed herein is able to discriminate changes before and after the event and improve image classification of washed-away or destroyed houses. The overall accuracy of the proposed automatic classification obtained with UAV data had a value of 97.4%. Structural damage was not assessed in this study.

AB  - How to efficiently use multi-source remote sensing images to extract the coastal wetland vegetation landscape information of the Yellow River Delta, and provide scientific basis for wetland protection, utilization and ecological restoration, is of great significance. In this paper, the vegetation coverage of Landsat TM / OLI remote sensing images from 1984 to 2018 is dynamically monitored, and the remote sensing images are analyzed using NDVI and pixel dichotomous models. The conclusions are as follows: From 1984 to 2018, the coverage of vegetation in the northern part of the Yellow River Delta is relatively low, and the coverage of vegetation in the south due to agricultural development is high; Over the past 30 years, the vegetation coverage area of the Yellow River Delta has shown an overall upward trend, and the area of low vegetation coverage areas has declined significantly, decreasing by 19.64% from 1984 to 2018. For the study of the Yellow River Delta coastal wetland, the methods used include the NDVI and pixel dichotomy model, and the results obtained are consistent with the facts, which can help the local ecological protection or soil and water conservation.

AB  - The Academy Awards has met its turning point by conferring the Award for Best Picture to South Korean film Parasite, which demands particular attention for approving the non-western production the highest honor. Applying Fredric Jameson’s worldview of the first- and the third-world to the Academy’s perspective, it can be said that the western audience has turned its interest from the first-world legacy to the third-world text. Meta-textual understanding of Jameson’s generalized idea, that all third-world texts are to be read as national allegories, leads to the inference that the first-world readers expect national allegories in third-world texts. Accordingly, national allegories are found in two South Korean films, Burning and Parasite, both of which are critically acclaimed by the Academy. The allegories in both of the films embody capitalistically (post-)colonial relation between South Korea and the United States, which is possibly one of the factors to appeal to the western audience.

TI  - RETRIEVAL OF GREEN TIDE CONCENTRATION AND INTERANNUAL VARIATION ANALYSIS IN YELLOW SEA BASED ON MULTI-SOURCE REMOTE SENSING MONITORING

AB  - The economic losses and ecological damage caused by green tide in Yellow Sea have been very serious over the years, but the research on the risk of green tide is still in its infancy. The regional concentration is considered as a key factor in assessing the risk of green tides, because the harmful effects of the green tide come from the excessive accumulation and anoxia release of the decaying algae.Satellite remote sensing is recognized as the most effective means of monitoring the green tide. But different pixel resolution leads to inconsistence in multi-source satellite information fusion.In this paper, a general concentration retrieval model of green tide based on multi-source remote sensing monitoring is established for the disaster risk assessment and data fusion requirements in operational emergency. The model computes the green tide's concentration based on the minimum decision grid, which inputs the operational multi-source satellite data, and outputs the green tide's concentration of any designated area such as coastal areas and some key areas of concern.Based on the proposed model, the paper computes the overall concentration of the green tide in Yellow Sea for 11 years since the occurrence year based on the operational multi-source satellite data. The results indicates that the interannual distribution of the green tide in Yellow Sea from 2008 to 2018 is generally on the rise, and the areas with higher concentration are distributed in the south coasts of Shandong Peninsula, China. Affected areas generally extend southward, and the center of the risk zone located parallel to the Yancheng and Lianyungang coasts of Jiangsu Province, pointing to the direction of Shandong Qingdao, China, and the risk becomes bigger from south to north.

TI  - Microwave Brightness Temperature Characteristics of Three Strong Earthquakes in Sichuan Province, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive microwave remote sensing technology is an effective means to identify the thermal anomalies associated with earthquakes due to its penetrating capability through clouds compared with infrared sensors. However, observed microwave brightness temperature is strongly influenced by soil moisture and other surface parameters. In the present article, the segmented threshold method has been proposed to detect anomalous microwave brightness temperature associated with the strong earthquakes occurred in Sichuan province, China, an earthquake-prone area with high soil moisture. The index of microwave radiation anomaly (IMRA) computed by the proposed method is found to enhance prior to the three strong earthquakes, 2008 Wenchuan (M = 7.8), 2013 Lushan (M = 6.6), and 2017 Jiuzhaigou (M = 6.5), occurred during 2008-2018 using the Defense Meteorological Space Program Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder F17 satellite data. Our results show that the microwave brightness temperature anomalies appeared about two months prior to the three strong earthquakes. For the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes, the enhanced IMRA distributed along the main fault, which is consistent with the variations of our earlier studies of the 1997 Manyi (M = 7.5) and the 2001 Kokoxili (M = 7.8) earthquakes in the region with low soil moisture. For the Jiuzhaigou earthquake, the anomalies distributed around the epicenter and do not indicate the seismogenic structure, which could be due to the presence of a blind fault. It should be noted that quantitative evaluation of IMRA is limited due to infrequent occurrence of earthquakes.

TI  - 중국 마오난족(毛南族) 파왕굿의 민속지적 분석과 꽃과 다리의 상징
T2  - 한국민속학
M3  - research-article
AB  - The votive ceremony to Powang of Maonan nationality in China is a sorcery ceremony in which they pray to the fertility goddess in charge of the garden of life through singing, dancing, percussion and acting. The core part of votive ceremony to Powang is the bridge to pray for flowers of life “bridge for flowers”. In order to achieve the purpose of praying for children and children, taoists set up “Yin-yang Bridge, Yin bridge, eaves bridge and Yang Bridge” successively, and interweaved “planting flowers, sending flowers, picking flowers and collecting flowers” ceremony during the bridge building process. In this ritual, the “flower” is the symbol of human life. The goddess of fertility, Powang, uses the five elements principle, namely, planting magnolias in the East, lotus in the south, money flowers in the West, daffodils in the north and peonies in the center to create the “flower Mountain garden”. Red flowers represent girls and white flowers represent boys.The various Bridges erected during the votive ceremony to Powang are seen as pathways between the alien “garden of life” and the human world. There is a universal three-way cosmology among ethnic minorities in southern China. That is, the universe is composed of the “world of flowers” where fetuses are born, the “real world” where human beings live, and the “underworld” where human beings go after death. In the votive ceremony to Powang, bridging for flowers is the ritual process of the space transfer from “the world of flowers” to “the real world” in the ternary cosmology, and the transformation of life form from invisible to visible.The votive ceremony to Powang do not only regard the birthing process of life as a simple biological process. Rather, it is sublimated into a worldview and a view of life transformed into space. On the basis of the universal three-way cosmology among ethnic minorities, the Maonan people borrowed the process of the flower of life in the flower world to move to the real world to show the process of gestation and birth of children. Therefore, death is regarded as the process of the transfer of the flower of life from the real world to the underworld. In order to pray for children and ensure that the flower of life completes the transition of space smoothly, building the bridges have become a necessary part of the votive ceremony to Powang. It can be seen that the principle of praying for the child in the ritual of the Powang is to present the biological pregnancy process with spatial physical movement. The basis of this ritual process is the homeopathic magic.

TI  - Validation of GOES-16 ABI VNIR Channel Radiometric Performance with NPP VIIRS and AQUA MODIS over the Sonoran Desert
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard GOES-16 provides high quality visible and near-infrared (VNIR) imagery data. In this paper, radiometric performance of the GOES-16 ABI multiple VNIR bands (B1, B2, B3, B5, and B6) are evaluated over the Sonoran Desert by comparing measurements with Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) equivalent bands M3, M5, M7, M10, and M11 and Aqua MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) equivalent bands b3, b1, b2, b6 and b7, respectively. Spectral Band Adjustment Factor (SBAF) derived from Hyperion data over Sonoran Desert is used. The large viewing angle at the Sonoran Desert by ABI (56.34 degrees) and a lack of comprehensive BRDF model at such viewing geometry and angular dependence of atmospheric scattering are the main challenges for the comparison. To address this issue, a radiative transfer modeling-based (RTM) method to account for atmospheric effects is developed to facilitate the comparison. The time series trending and mean bias of reflectance ratio between ABI and VIIRS and MODIS measurements over the Sonoran Desert after SBAF and BRDF corrections are derived to evaluate the radiometric performance of ABI w.r.t. VIIRS and MODIS. The analysis shows that the radiometric biases of the first four VNIR channels of GOES-16 ABI are all within 6% in comparison to the matched channels of VIIRS or MODIS after applying the RTM correction. Only the reflectance consistency of the VIIRS M11 and MODIS b7 is similar to 0.09, which dues to the center wavelength difference and different H2O absorption effects. The analysis also detects similar to 6% drop in the radiometric bias of GOES-16 ABI 0.64 mu m channel after April 23, 2019, which can be traced to the implementation of a correction of the ABI B2 calibration coefficient around this date.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to understand and present the strategies necessary to utilize YouTube in accordance with Francis Schaeffer's Christian Apologetics.First, Francis Schaeffer's “Apologetics” approach allows Christians in Korea to more actively intervene on YouTube and fulfill the mission of the church needed for this era.Schaeffer said the purpose of “Apologetics” was defense and communication. Defense is an argumentative defense to protect Christian faith from non-Christian or anti-Christian messages. Communication means delivering Christianity in a form that any particular generation can understand.Second, it presents specific examples of making good use of the technical features of YouTube and realizing Francis Schaeffer's “Christian Apologetics.” “Damascus TV” is a Christian YouTube channel that draws attention from both Christians and non-Christians in the YouTube world and carries out Christian Apologetics.Third, it reveals the media characteristics of YouTube. And study the strategy Francis Schaeffer used to practice Christian Apologetics in L’Abri and apply it to YouTube. Francis Schaeffer is offering a strategy that Christians can use on YouTube.From the conclusion of this paper we can make two suggestions that the Korean church needs. One is that the church needs a change in its perception of YouTube society, and the other is to establish a cultural strategy that suits the reality of YouTube. When the church uses YouTube as the site and tool of the ministry, it requires a different perception and attitude than in the past.

AB  - Qing Ci is a style of writing that Taoist masters say to the gods of heaven while performing rituals, and is called Qing Ci because it is written on blue paper. The contents of Qing Ci contain thoughts on the Absolute of the Supreme Sovereign, which presides over the guile of the human world, and sometimes becomes the basis for the existence of all things in nature, including humans. Looking at the contents of Qing Ci in the history of Taoism in Korea, the terms used to define 'God', 'Heaven' or 'Dao' have the same side depending on the times. However, depending on whether it is a Confucian school or a Taoist school, the content defining the absolute is different. In particular, it can be seen that the rules on the absolute character appearing in Qing Ci written in the Joseon Dynasty are different from before. The Qing Ci written by Choichiwon in the Unified Silla Dynasty and Kimbusix and Liguebo during the Goryeo Dynasty all had the Daoga ideology at the root. In particular, the rules for the Absolute are based on the theory of the Taoist ideology. For example, the description is based on ‘hybridity’, ‘ecstasy’, ‘unauthenticated nature’, and ‘non-subjectiveness’ of ‘Dao’ that creates all things by being born and changing. Qing Ci in the Joseon Dynasty also used terms related to 'Dao', which is the core of Taoist ideology, but the question is how to move away from the color of Taoist ideology and switch to the cosmology of new Confucianism in a situation where neo-Confucianism is now prevailing. Accordingly, the concept of “Dao” contained in Qing Ci was replaced with the theory of Taigi Yin and Yang in 『The Book of Changes』, which forms the core of the cosmology of New Confucianism. In this case, the term used the most when describing'do' is the reason that 'there is no sound and no smell', which is used to define the essence of 'Taigi' ,'Dao', and 'Li' in New Confucianism. In addition, after the middle of the Joseon Dynasty, the national Qing Ci disappeared completely. This phenomenon is very closely related to the worldview of the New Confucianism and the socialism pursued by the high-ranking Confucian scholars who led the Joseon Dynasty.

AB  - Despite a lot of efforts to respond flood hazards with remote sensing data, it is still difficult to generate an accurate flood map using solely optical or radar imagery. While optical data is relatively high resolution and does not suffer from speckle noise compared to radar data, it is very likely to be impacted by cloud and shadow. On the other hand, radar imagery can be used in all weather conditions due to its capability of penetrating clouds. Although a significant improvement of flood monitoring capability is achieved by using radar data, it is still challenging to map urban floods because of strong backscattering by man-made structures. Therefore, complementary use of optical and radar imagery in flood response is required, particularly in urban areas. In this study, we have adopted the Bayesian Joint Probability function to combine two different flood products generated from SAR and optical imagery. Flood detection with SAR data relies on the difference of backscatter signals between standing water and rougher land surface, while a Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) approach is used for optical data. Specifically, Planet Dove data with its 3m spatial resolution is used with higher weight values to detect flood extent in urban areas.

AB  - The identification of axillary lymph node metastases in breast cancer patients is a critical factor in determining the stage, deciding the treatment modality, and predicting the prognosis. Over the years, axillary staging has evolved from a radical axillary lymph node dissection to a more conservative sentinel lymph node biopsy. The main goal of axillary imaging techniques is to identify metastatic lymph nodes with optimal accuracy, high enough to initially select patients for an upfront lymph node dissection. Features suggestive of an axillary lymph node metastasis may be seen with a range of imaging modalities. On the other hand, ultrasonography is the method of choice for evaluating the node morphology and allowing image-guided interventions of abnormal nodes. Gray-scale ultrasonography is not perfect on its own. Newer techniques, such as elastography or contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, have shown promise in identifying axillary lymph node metastases. This review provides a comprehensive overview of ultrasonography for an axillary lymph node assessment in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Can Mineral Oil Slicks Be Distinguished From Newly Formed Sea Ice Using Synthetic Aperture Radar?
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this feasibility study discriminating oil slicks and newly formed sea ice using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is investigated, using imagery from the L-band high-resolution uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR) airborne and the satellite C-band RADARSAT-2 (RS-2) systems. To determine the separability of these two varying but similar appearing low backscatter ocean surfaces, multipolarization features are utilized from both SAR datasets. The discrimination is evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov separability test. All imagery was obtained during several sea ice campaigns in the Arctic Ocean and separate oil spill campaigns in Norway and the Gulf of Mexico, with each campaign collecting in situ observations. We observe that the polarization difference (VV-HH) reliably separates the mineral oil slicks and newly formed sea ice areas using UAVSAR images, due to the low noise floor and subsequent high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) radiometric performance of the airborne system. The comparably higher noise floor and related lower SNR hampers the separability in the RS-2 images. Simulated noise floors were generated by adding white Gaussian noise to the UAVSAR data, which show that discrimination between the two low backscatter phenomena using multipolarization features is possible, provided that both datasets are still well above the noise floor. The pixel resolution has a limited effect on the separability. The results of this study provide an approach to distinguish oil slicks from newly formed sea ice, which might be of special interest should an oil spill occur within the marginal ice zone.

T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper assesses Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification and Land Surface Temperature (LST) in Wayanad district during the years 2004 and 2018. The LULC classification of Wayanad district is identified using IRS P6 (Linear Imaging Self Scanner) LISS- III, and LST using thermal band of (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) ETM+ imageries. Maximum likelihood classification (MLC) technique is opted to categorize six land-use features: water body, paddy field, forest, dense, agricultural crops and built-up. From 2004 to 2018, impacts of changes in features are correlated with the raised LST. Overall vegetation cover shows an increasing pattern during the study period. The water bodies in Wayanad district improved from 4.30 to 32.68 sq.km due to construction of two dams: Banasurasagar and Karappuzha. However, agricultural crops and paddy field area have decreased by 4.7% in last 14 years. Decreasing rate of agricultural crops can be directly linked to population growth, thereby developing various built-up zones for basic needs. Forest and dense vegetated cover area are increased nearly 2.3 and 3.0%, respectively, during the study period, while bamboo degradation has also been witnessed from 2008 to 2013. The built-up class shows growth from 1.48 to 5.69% of total land area during 2004 and 2018. LULC have noticeable influences on LST with a negative correlation between vegetation cover and LST with a decrease of 1.75oC. The study findings can help the local authorities to implement urban planning regulations for public awareness and policy makers for a sustainable planning and management in forthcoming years.
