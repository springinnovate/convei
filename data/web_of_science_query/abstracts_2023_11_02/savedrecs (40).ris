TI  - Determining the need for fertility care and the acceptability and feasibility of administering a fertility awareness tool from the user's perspective in a sample of Sudanese infertility patients.
T2  - Reproductive biomedicine & society online
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Fertility experts have advocated addressing preventable causes of infertility and early intervention. However, awareness of risk factors is low, especially in low- and middle-income countries where the prevalence of infertility is high. To address this lack of awareness, the Fertility Awareness Tool (FertiSTAT) was adapted for use in Sudan and other low-resource countries. The aims of this study were to ascertain the need for fertility education in Sudan (Aim 1), and to gauge the acceptability and feasibility of implementing the FertiSTAT in Sudan (Aim 2), both from the patients' perspective. Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants for semi-structured-in-depth interviews from a fertility clinic in Sudan. We collected sociodemographic information, medical and reproductive history, asked about fertility knowledge, administered the FertiSTAT and asked about the acceptability of the FertiSTAT. Thematic analysis was conducted for qualitative data. Twenty participants were included; of these, 17 were female, 13 were educated beyond secondary school, the mean age was 32.8 years, and the mean duration of infertility was 4.1 years. Ten themes emerged: of these, three themes addressed Aim 1: 'desire for fertility information', 'state of fertility knowledge' and 'benefits of fertility education'; and seven themes addressed Aim 2: 'specific suggestions for the tool', 'factors influencing the acceptability and feasibility of implementing the tool', 'challenges and barriers to implementation', 'self-disclosure', 'understanding of being at risk', 'compatibility with worldview' and 'cultural tailoring'. Fertility education was viewed as necessary and beneficial; however, participants thought that lack of acceptability of sensitive topics would hinder the implementation of the FertiSTAT. Acceptability and feasibility would be enhanced if challenges were addressed in a culturally sensitive manner using cultural tailoring of materials to increase compatibility with individual worldviews.

TI  - Serological Evidence of Common Equine Viral Infections in a Semi-Isolated, Unvaccinated Population of Hucul Horses
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The aim of the following research was an analysis of the occurrence of common equine viral infections in a Hucul herd, based on serological studies. This study provides epidemiological data concerning animals representing a semi-isolated herd, devoid of any specific prophylaxis. The obtained results provide a source of information on a primitive breed of horses, as well as giving an insight into viruses (among them, arboviruses) circulating within a local ecosystem. Huculs (Equus caballus) are an old breed of primitive mountain horses, originating from the Carpathian Mountains. To the best of our knowledge, data concerning the epidemiology of viral infections observed within this breed are sparse. The objective of this study was to estimate the serological status of a semi-isolated, unvaccinated Hucul herd, with respect to both common equine viral infections and horse-infecting arboviruses, the presence of which was previously reported in Poland. Twenty horses of the Hucul breed, living in a remote area in Poland, were studied in 2018 from March to May. Using nasal secretion swabs as a specimen source, isolation attempts were negative regarding ERAV, EHV-1, EAV, and EIV. According to the virus neutralisation method, in the sera obtained from the animals, antibodies against the following viruses were detected: EHV-1 in 12 horses (60%; with titres from 1:8 to 1:64), EIV A/H7N7 in 13 (65%; titres from 1:20 to 1:80), EIV A /H3N8 in 12 (60%; titres from 1:20 to 1:80), USUV in 5 (25%; titres from 1:10 to 1:80), and ERAV in 1 (5%; titre 1:32). Antibodies against EAV, EIAV, and WNV were not present in the tested sera. The detected presence of specific antibodies associated with five out of the eight equine viruses investigated indicates that the Hucul herd, due to its partial separation and lack of specific prophylaxis, could serve as a sentinel animal group for the detection of equine viruses/arboviruses present within the local ecosystem. The detection of common equine viral infections within the herd provides additional epidemiological data concerning the breed.

TI  - Transport and Variability of Tropospheric Ozone over Oceania and Southern Pacific during the 2019-20 Australian Bushfires
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study contributes to the scientific effort for a better understanding of the potential of the Australian biomass burning events to influence tropospheric trace gas abundances at the regional scale. In order to exclude the influence of the long-range transport of ozone precursors from biomass burning plumes originating from Southern America and Africa, the analysis of the Australian smoke plume has been driven over the period December 2019 to January 2020. This study uses satellite (IASI, MLS, MODIS, CALIOP) and ground-based (sun-photometer, FTIR, ozone radiosondes) observations. The highest values of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and carbon monoxide total columns are observed over Southern and Central Australia. Transport is responsible for the spatial and temporal distributions of aerosols and carbon monoxide over Australia, and also the transport of the smoke plume outside the continent. The dispersion of the tropospheric smoke plume over Oceania and Southern Pacific extends from tropical to extratropical latitudes. Ozone radiosonde measurements performed at Samoa (14.4 degrees S, 170.6 degrees W) and Lauder (45.0 degrees S, 169.4 degrees E) indicate an increase in mid-tropospheric ozone (6-9 km) (from 10% to 43%) linked to the Australian biomass burning plume. This increase in mid-tropospheric ozone induced by the transport of the smoke plume was found to be consistent with MLS observations over the tropical and extratropical latitudes. The smoke plume over the Southern Pacific was organized as a stretchable anticyclonic rolling which impacted the ozone variability in the tropical and subtropical upper-troposphere over Oceania. This is corroborated by the ozone profile measurements at Samoa which exhibit an enhanced ozone layer (29%) in the upper-troposphere. Our results suggest that the transport of Australian biomass burning plumes have significantly impacted the vertical distribution of ozone in the mid-troposphere southern tropical to extratropical latitudes during the 2019-20 extreme Australian bushfires.

TI  - Stratiform Cloud-Hydrometeor Assimilation for HRRR and RAP Model Short-Range Weather Prediction
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Significance Statement Short-range weather prediction models are particularly dependent on accurate initial representation of the current state of the atmosphere, including clouds. We describe a method for using satellite and surface-based observations of stratiform clouds to update the model cloud state at the initial time. The method is tested with the NOAA RAP model, and leads to improvement for forecast accuracy for several hours including for rare low-cloud events that are important for aviation safety. This stratiform-cloud data assimilation is also applied in the convective-scale HRRR model, where it complements radar/lightning assimilation for convective clouds described elsewhere. Assimilation to provide accurate initial cloud fields is critical to improve forecasts for aviation, energy, and severe weather applications.Accurate cloud and precipitation forecasts are a fundamental component of short-range data assimilation/model prediction systems such as the NOAA 3-km High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) or the 13-km Rapid Refresh (RAP). To reduce cloud and precipitation spinup problems, a nonvariational assimilation technique for stratiform clouds was developed within the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) data assimilation system. One goal of this technique is retention of observed stratiform cloudy and clear 3D volumes into the subsequent model forecast. The cloud observations used include cloud-top data from satellite brightness temperatures, surface-based ceilometer data, and surface visibility. Quality control, expansion into spatial information content, and forward operators are described for each observation type. The projection of data from these observation types into an observation-based cloud-information 3D gridded field is accomplished via identification of cloudy, clear, and cloud-unknown 3D volumes. Updating of forecast background fields is accomplished through clearing and building of cloud water and cloud ice with associated modifications to water vapor and temperature. Impact of the cloud assimilation on short-range forecasts is assessed with a set of retrospective experiments in warm and cold seasons using the RAPv5 model. Short-range (1-9 h) forecast skill is improved in both seasons for cloud ceiling and visibility and for 2-m temperature in daytime and with mixed results for other measures. Two modifications were introduced and tested with success: use of prognostic subgrid-scale cloud fraction to condition cloud building (in response to a high bias) and removal of a WRF-based rebalancing.

TI  - Studying the coal fire dynamics in Jharia coalfield, India using time-series analysis of satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal fires in Jharia coal field (JCF) leads to significant loss of coal and pollutes the environment through emission of toxic gases. The present study aims to analyze the coal-fire dynamics in JCF during 1989-2019 through timeseries analysis. The study used thermal band data of Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 along with the radiosonde data for estimating the land surface temperature (LST) using single channel algorithm. The year-wise coal fire maps were overlapped for analysing the trends of coal fire. The results indicated that coverage area of coal fire zones has been continuously increased from 1989 to 2019. The new fire zones established at every five-year interval from 1989 to 2019 were mapped for understating the fire dynamics. The results indicated that the fire propagation was not in any specific direction. That is, new fire zones developed pocket-wise due to multiple factors and not due to continuous burning of in-situ coals. It has been observed that production level in the mines during this period also been increased possibly through more number of mines. Thus, more number of coal blocks exposed to atmosphere, which leads to catches of fire due to spontaneous heating.

TI  - Assessing the Cooling Effect of Four Urban Parks of Different Sizes in a Temperate Continental Climate Zone: Wroclaw (Poland)
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban parks have been known to form park cooling islands (PCI), which can effectively alleviate the effect of urban heat islands (UHI) in cities. This paper presents results obtained for four different size parks in the city of Wroclaw, which is located in a temperate continental climate. The number of publications for urban areas located in this type of climate and cities is low compared to sites in hot and humid areas. Land surface temperature (LST) maps were developed from Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data acquired during three hottest weather periods between 2017 and 2019. Metrics and spatial statistics characterising the four parks selected for the analysis based on their size were calculated. These included: perimeter, area, landscape shape index (LSI) and P-LC (forest area) park metrics, and Park Cooling Area (PCA), Park Cooling Efficiency (PCE), Park Cooling Gradient (PCG), Park Cooling Island (PCI) and Extended Park Cooling Island (PCIe) spatial indexes. The averaged PCIe values ranged from 2.0 to 3.6 degrees C, PCI from 1.9 to 3.6 degrees C, PCG from 0.7 to 2.2 degrees C, PCE from 5.3 to 11.5, and PCA from 78.8 to 691.8 ha depending on the park. The cooling distance varied from 110 m to 925 m depending on park size, forest area and land use type in the park's vicinity. The study provides new insight into urban park cooling effects in a medium sized city located in a temperate continental climate, and the role of parks in regulation of urban temperature to mitigate the UHI effect.

TI  - Use of the Whole Country Insulin Consumption Data in Israel to Determine the Prevalence of Type 1 Diabetes in Children <5 Years of Age Before and During Rotavirus Vaccination
T2  - PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Recent studies showed that rotavirus vaccination may affect the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D). The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of early childhood (<5 years) T1D before and during the introduction of rotavirus vaccination in Israel by syndromic surveillance.Methods: Data on insulin purchases reported by Israel's four Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) were retrieved from the National Program for Quality Indicators in Community Healthcare.Results: During the prevaccination years (2002-2007), a steady increase in insulin purchases was reported in the young (<5 years). The period percent change (PC) of children <5 years old diagnosed with T1D inferred from purchased insulin prescriptions increased by 50.0%, and the annual percent change (APC) increased by 10.0% (p = 0.01). During the period of free, universal Rotavirus vaccination (2011-2018), the PC for T1D diagnoses among children <5 years of age decreased by 3.8% with an APC of -2.5% (p = 0.14). There was a significant difference (p = 0.002) between the increasing trend in insulin use before vaccination versus the decreasing trend after vaccination.Conclusion: Rotavirus vaccination correlated with attenuation of the increasing rate in the prevalence of T1D in <5-year-old children in Israel.

T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The displacements of the Earth's surface before and after the earthquakes that took place near the southern shore of Lake Baikal on September 21, 2020 (Bystrinskoe earthquake with a magnitude of M = 5.5), and August 27, 2008 (Kultukskoye earthquake with a magnitude of M = 6.3), were analyzed using satellite radar interferometry methods. Remote sensing data obtained by the Sentinel-1B (C-band) and the ALOS-1/2 PALSAR-1/2 (L-band) spaceborne synthetic aperture radars were used to study deformation processes. Blocks with different strain rates were found based on the results of analysis of satellite radar interferometric measurements for the period from May 2017 to October 2020 for the Bystrinskoe earthquake and from January 2007 to February 2011 for the Kultukskoe earthquake. The difference in the deformation values before the Bystrinskoe earthquake was 14 mm and that before the Kultukskoe earthquake ranged from 12 to 13 mm.

TI  - What's Love Got to Do with It? Religion and the Multiple Logic Tensions of Social Enterprise
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper develops a model that advances our understanding of how social enterprises respond to the complexity of a constellation of multiple, often competing goals, referred to here as institutional logics. Introducing a religious logic to the recognised social welfare and commercial logics of social enterprise, this model builds on a religious worldview foundation and incorporates religion-inspired altruistic love and non-transactional giving as its scaffolding. A comparative case study of faith-based, faith-inspired and secular organisations located in Southeast Asia demonstrates the origin and applicability of the model. Findings highlight that religion serves as an overarching logic, or "metalogic", and frame of reference. Faith-based social enterprises use this religious logic to redefine perceived paradoxical tensions between the social welfare and commercial objectives they embody. Study results advance knowledge on organisational responses to multiple logic prescriptions, underscores the influence of religion, altruistic love and giving on organisational behaviour and contributes to the scarce literature on faith-based social enterprises.

TI  - The Origins and Future of Sentinel: An Early-Warning System for Pandemic Preemption and Response
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - While investigating a signal of adaptive evolution in humans at the gene LARGE, we encountered an intriguing finding by Dr. Stefan Kunz that the gene plays a critical role in Lassa virus binding and entry. This led us to pursue field work to test our hypothesis that natural selection acting on LARGE-detected in the Yoruba population of Nigeria-conferred resistance to Lassa Fever in some West African populations. As we delved further, we conjectured that the "emerging" nature of recently discovered diseases like Lassa fever is related to a newfound capacity for detection, rather than a novel viral presence, and that humans have in fact been exposed to the viruses that cause such diseases for much longer than previously suspected. Dr. Stefan Kunz's critical efforts not only laid the groundwork for this discovery, but also inspired and catalyzed a series of events that birthed Sentinel, an ambitious and large-scale pandemic prevention effort in West Africa. Sentinel aims to detect and characterize deadly pathogens before they spread across the globe, through implementation of its three fundamental pillars: Detect, Connect, and Empower. More specifically, Sentinel is designed to detect known and novel infections rapidly, connect and share information in real time to identify emerging threats, and empower the public health community to improve pandemic preparedness and response anywhere in the world. We are proud to dedicate this work to Stefan Kunz, and eagerly invite new collaborators, experts, and others to join us in our efforts.

TI  - Cereal Yield Forecasting with Satellite Drought-Based Indices, Weather Data and Regional Climate Indices Using Machine Learning in Morocco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate seasonal forecasting of cereal yields is an important decision support tool for countries, such as Morocco, that are not self-sufficient in order to predict, as early as possible, importation needs. This study aims to develop an early forecasting model of cereal yields (soft wheat, barley and durum wheat) at the scale of the agricultural province considering the 15 most productive over 2000-2017 (i.e., 15 x 18 = 270 yields values). To this objective, we built on previous works that showed a tight linkage between cereal yields and various datasets including weather data (rainfall and air temperature), regional climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation in particular), and drought indices derived from satellite observations in different wavelengths. The combination of the latter three data sets is assessed to predict cereal yields using linear (Multiple Linear Regression, MLR) and non-linear (Support Vector Machine, SVM; Random Forest, RF, and eXtreme Gradient Boost, XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. The calibration of the algorithmic parameters of the different approaches are carried out using a 5-fold cross validation technique and a leave-one-out method is implemented for model validation. The statistical metrics of the models are first analyzed as a function of the input datasets that are used, and as a function of the lead times, from 4 months to 2 months before harvest. The results show that combining data from multiple sources outperformed models based on one dataset only. In addition, the satellite drought indices are a major source of information for cereal prediction when the forecasting is carried out close to harvest (2 months before), while weather data and, to a lesser extent, climate indices, are key variables for earlier predictions. The best models can accurately predict yield in January (4 months before harvest) with an R-2 = 0.88 and RMSE around 0.22 t. ha(-1). The XGBoost method exhibited the best metrics. Finally, training a specific model separately for each group of provinces, instead of one global model, improved the prediction performance by reducing the RMSE by 10% to 35% depending on the provinces. In conclusion, the results of this study pointed out that combining remote sensing drought indices with climate and weather variables using a machine learning technique is a promising approach for cereal yield forecasting.

TI  - Fiducial Reference Measurements for Vegetation Bio-Geophysical Variables: An End-to-End Uncertainty Evaluation Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With a wide range of satellite-derived vegetation bio-geophysical products now available to users, validation efforts are required to assess their accuracy and fitness for purpose. Substantial progress in the validation of such products has been made over the last two decades, but quantification of the uncertainties associated with in situ reference measurements is rarely performed, and the incorporation of uncertainties within upscaling procedures is cursory at best. Since current validation practices assume that reference data represent the truth, our ability to reliably demonstrate compliance with product uncertainty requirements through conformity testing is limited. The Fiducial Reference Measurements for Vegetation (FRM4VEG) project, initiated by the European Space Agency, is aiming to address this challenge by applying metrological principles to vegetation and surface reflectance product validation. Following FRM principles, and in accordance with the International Standards Organisation's (ISO) Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM), for the first time, we describe an end-to-end uncertainty evaluation framework for reference data of two key vegetation bio-geophysical variables: the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC). The process involves quantifying the uncertainties associated with individual in situ reference measurements and incorporating these uncertainties within the upscaling procedure (as well as those associated with the high-spatial-resolution imagery used for upscaling). The framework was demonstrated in two field campaigns covering agricultural crops (Las Tiesas-Barrax, Spain) and deciduous broadleaf forest (Wytham Woods, UK). Providing high-spatial-resolution reference maps with per-pixel uncertainty estimates, the framework is applicable to a range of other bio-geophysical variables including leaf area index (LAI), the fraction of vegetation cover (FCOVER), and canopy water content (CWC). The proposed procedures will facilitate conformity testing of moderate spatial resolution vegetation bio-geophysical products in future validation exercises.

TI  - Prospects of legal regulation of contractual relations in the sphere of lobbying management as a counteraction to corruption at the municipal level
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the article is a comprehensive analysis of the problem of interpretation of contractual relations and their management into the legal field of the national legislation to achieve the significant reduction of corruption at the municipal level on the territory of our country. To achieve this objective, a set of philosophical-worldview, general scientific (analysis, synthesis) and special-scientific methods (systemic, structural-functional, comparative-legal) have been used. It is proved that lobbying is a subjective factor that affects the process of municipal legal regulation. Emphasis is placed on the expediency of introducing the contractual form of regulation of relations on lobbying management decisions at the municipal level. The contract on lobbying at the municipal level is defined as a multilateral agreement between the customer, lobbyist and the body of local government, which has a public-law character, establishes contractual rules of law on lobbying to influence the process of adopting normative municipal-legal acts. It is concluded that it is extremely important to organize and regulate lobbying in any country in the world, because if this phenomenon cannot be completely eradicated, it must be regulated from the legal point of view, which, in the end, will significantly reduce the level of corruption in the society.

TI  - Anatomy of a Paroxysmal Lava Fountain at Etna Volcano: The Case of the 12 March 2021, Episode
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 13 December 2020, Etna volcano entered a new eruptive phase, giving rise to a number of paroxysmal episodes involving increased Strombolian activity from the summit craters, lava fountains feeding several-km high eruptive columns and ash plumes, as well as lava flows. As of 2 August 2021, 57 such episodes have occurred in 2021, all of them from the New Southeast Crater (NSEC). Each paroxysmal episode lasted a few hours and was sometimes preceded (but more often followed) by lava flow output from the crater rim lasting a few hours. In this paper, we use remote sensing data from the ground and satellite, integrated with ground deformation data recorded by a high precision borehole strainmeter to characterize the 12 March 2021 eruptive episode, which was one of the most powerful (and best recorded) among that occurred since 13 December 2020. We describe the formation and growth of the lava fountains, and the way they feed the eruptive column and the ash plume, using data gathered from the INGV visible and thermal camera monitoring network, compared with satellite images. We show the growth of the lava flow field associated with the explosive phase obtained from a fixed thermal monitoring camera. We estimate the erupted volume of pyroclasts from the heights of the lava fountains measured by the cameras, and the erupted lava flow volume from the satellite-derived radiant heat flux. We compare all erupted volumes (pyroclasts plus lava flows) with the total erupted volume inferred from the volcano deflation recorded by the borehole strainmeter, obtaining a total erupted volume of similar to 3 x 10(6) m(3) of magma constrained by the strainmeter. This volume comprises similar to 1.6 x 10(6) m(3) of pyroclasts erupted during the lava fountain and 2.4 x 10(6) m(3) of lava flow, with similar to 30% of the erupted pyroclasts being remobilized as rootless lava to feed the lava flows. The episode lasted 130 min and resulted in an eruption rate of similar to 385 m(3) s(-1) and caused the formation of an ash plume rising from the margins of the lava fountain that rose up to 12.6 km a.s.l. in similar to 1 h. The maximum elevation of the ash plume was well constrained by an empirical formula that can be used for prompt hazard assessment.

TI  - Lightning Activity Observed by the FengYun-4A Lightning Mapping Imager
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lightning Mapping Imager (LMI) onboard the geostationary meteorological satelliteFengYun-4A (FY-4A) detects both intra-cloud (IC) and cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning continuously during daytime and nighttime. This study examined, for the first time, the optical characteristics and distribution of the "Event," "Group," and "Flash" observed by the LMI in the whole LMI observation domain. The optical properties and spatial distribution of the LMI lightning were compared with those of the Lightning Imaging Sensor on the International Space Station (ISS-LIS) based on the dataset during 2018-2020. Due to the different spatial resolutions and detection efficiencies of these two lightning imagers, the number of ISS-LIS lightning was more than that of LMI lightning. The ISS-LIS Flash duration was also larger than that of the LMI Flash. The duration, radiance, and footprint of LMI lightning in different regions were analyzed in detail based on the LMI lightning dataset in 2019. The duration and radiance of the Flash were generally less than 50-500 ms and 200 Jm(-2)ster(-1)mu m(-)(1), respectively. The footprint of Flashes was distributed from 200 to 600 km(2). The number of Groups per Flash was mostly less than five. Considering the spatial distribution and temporal variations in the LMI lightning compared with the ground-based Lightning Location Network in China (LLNC), it was found that the LMI Group number was close to the LLNC CG (Cloud-to-Ground) Event number. The maximum Flash density was found in the middle and lower south of the Yangtze River and Pearl River Delta region, respectively, while the lower values were in western China, where the mean radiance per Flash was greater. There was more LMI lightning during the nighttime than that during the daytime, indicating the higher detection efficiency of the LMI in the nighttime than in the daytime.

TI  - MAPPING OF AREAS OF CAATINGA FOREST THROUGH RANDOM: CASE STUDY IN THE TAPEROA RIVER BASIN
T2  - REVISTA GEOARAGUAIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The caatinga consists of a large mosaic of shrubs and forests susceptible to seasonal changes characteristic of the biome. This fact constitutes one of the difficulties in mapping the biome at medium and large scales. With methodological advances in remote sensing techniques, algorithms have emerged to aid mapping and monitoring using time series. Thus, the present article aims to map the caatinga cover for the hydrographic basin of the Taperoa River through the random forrest algorithm. As a methodology, the Landsat 8 collection was used and through the Google Earth Engine platform it was possible to make the selection of images for the year 2020, implement the classification and evaluate it. The results show an efficiency in the use of the algorithm, as well as 79% in the global correctness of the mapping. As for vegetation, 62% of the basin's area is made up of caatinga and 28% is made up of degraded (anthropized) caatinga areas. The article also aims to contribute methodologically in the mapping of the caatinga vegetation.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth and Surface Data Using an Ensemble Modeling Approach to Assess PM<sub>2.5</sub> Temporal and Spatial Distributions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of statistical models and machine-learning techniques along satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a promising method to estimate ground-level particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), mainly in urban areas with low air quality monitor density. Nevertheless, the relationship between AOD and ground-level PM2.5 varies spatiotemporally and differences related to spatial domains, temporal schemes, and seasonal variations must be assessed. Here, an ensemble multiple linear regression (EMLR) model and an ensemble neural network (ENN) model were developed to estimate PM2.5 levels in the Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA), the second largest urban center in Mexico. Four AOD-SDSs (Scientific Datasets) from MODIS Collection 6 were tested using three spatial domains and two temporal schemes. The best model performance was obtained using AOD at 0.55 mu m from MODIS-Aqua at a spatial resolution of 3 km, along meteorological parameters and daily scheme. EMLR yielded a correlation coefficient (R) of similar to 0.57 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of similar to 7.00 mu g m(-3). ENN performed better than EMLR, with an R of similar to 0.78 and RMSE of similar to 5.43 mu g m(-3). Satellite-derived AOD in combination with meteorology data allowed for the estimation of PM2.5 distributions in an urban area with low air quality monitor density.

TI  - Casual Rerouting of AERONET Sun/Sky Photometers: Toward a New Network of Ground Measurements Dedicated to the Monitoring of Surface Properties?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an innovative method for observing vegetation health at a very high spatial resolution (similar to 5 x 5 cm) and low cost by upgrading an existing Aerosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) ground station dedicated to the observation of aerosols in the atmosphere. This study evaluates the capability of a sun/sky photometer to perform additional surface reflectance observations. The ground station of Toulouse, France, which belongs to the AERONET sun/sky photometer network, is used for this feasibility study. The experiment was conducted for a 5-year period (between 2016 and 2020). The sun/sky photometer was mounted on a metallic structure at a height of 2.5 m, and the acquisition software was adapted to add a periodical (every hour) ground-observation scenario with the sun/sky photometer observing the surface instead of being inactive. Evaluation is performed by using a classical metric characterizing the vegetation health: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), using as reference the satellite NDVI derived from a Sentinel-2 (S2) sensor at 10 x 10 m resolution. Comparison for the 5-year period showed good agreement between the S2 and sun/sky photometer NDVIs (i.e., bias = 0.004, RMSD = 0.082, and R = 0.882 for a mean value of S2A NDVI around 0.6). Discrepancies could have been due to spatial-representativeness issues (of the ground measurement compared to S2), the differences between spectral bands, and the quality of the atmospheric correction applied on S2 data (accuracy of the sun/sky photometer instrument was better than 0.1%). However, the accuracy of the atmospheric correction applied on S2 data in this station appeared to be of good quality, and no dependence on the presence of aerosols was observed. This first analysis of the potential of the CIMEL CE318 sun/sky photometer to monitor the surface is encouraging. Further analyses need to be carried out to estimate the potential in different AERONET stations. The occasional rerouting of AERONET stations could lead to a complementary network of surface reflectance observations. This would require an update of the software, and eventual adaptations of the measurement platforms to the station environments. The additional cost, based on the existing AERONET network, would be quite limited. These new surface measurements would be interesting for measurements of vegetation health (monitoring of NDVI, and also of other vegetation indices such as the leaf area and chlorophyll indices), for validation and calibration exercise purposes, and possibly to refine various scientific algorithms (i.e., algorithms dedicated to cloud detection or the AERONET aerosol retrieval algorithm itself). CIMEL is ready to include the ground scenario used in this study in all new sun/sky photometers.

M3  - Article
AB  - Castillo, D, Rodriguez-Fernandez, A, Nakamura, FY, Sanchez-Sanchez, J, Ramirez-Campillo, R, Yanci, J, Zubillaga, A, and Raya-Gonzalez, J. Influence of different small-sided game formats on physical and physiological demands and physical performance in young soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 35(8): 2287-2293, 2021-The aim of this study was to quantify the acute impact of bout duration and individual interaction space on physical and physiological demands and on physical performance. Ten young male soccer players (age: 14.8 +/- 0.6 years) from the same team playing in the National U-16 Division participated. Physical (total distance [TD]; distance covered at different speeds; and maximum velocity [Velmax]) and physiological (peak [HRpeak] and mean [HRmean] heart rate) parameters were collected for every bout during each small-sided game (SSG) format. Moreover, the effects of SSGs on horizontal jump (HJ) and 30-m sprint performances were evaluated. The SSG formats were composed of 6 players a side (including goalkeepers) and included 4 repetitions of 6 minutes in a space of 100 m(2) (SSG1) or 200 m(2) (SSG2) and 6 repetitions of 4 minutes in 100 m(2) (SSG3) or 200 m(2) (SSG4). The TD, the distance covered at different speeds, and Velmax were greater (p < 0.01, effect size [ES] = 1.25-5.95, large) in SSG2 and SSG4 than SSG1 and SSG3, respectively. Furthermore, the HRmean and HRpeak were lower (p < 0.05, ES = 1.53-2.23, large) during SSG3 than other SSGs. In addition, while a significant (p < 0.05, ES = 0.70-2.04, moderate to large) increase in SPR30 time in SSG1 and SSG3 was observed, HJ performance was not affected (p > 0.05, ES = 0.03-0.54, trivial to moderate) by any SSG format. These findings suggest increasing pitch size to induce greater physical demands and to use SSGs with smaller pitch size, and independently of the bout duration, to induce neuromuscular fatigue.

TI  - Modeling of Durum Wheat Yield Based on Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a modelling approach for the estimation/prediction of wheat yield based on Sentinel-2 data is presented. Model development was accomplished through a two-step process: firstly, the capacity of Sentinel-2 vegetation indices (VIs) to follow plant ecophysiological parameters was established through measurements in a pilot field and secondly, the results of the first step were extended/evaluated in 31 fields, during two growing periods, to increase the applicability range and robustness of the models. Modelling results were examined against yield data collected by a combine harvester equipped with a yield-monitoring system. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were examined as plant signals and combined with Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and/or Normalized Multiband Drought Index (NMDI) during the growth period or before sowing, as water and soil signals, respectively. The best performing model involved the EVI integral for the 20 April-31 May period as a plant signal and NMDI on 29 April and before sowing as water and soil signals, respectively (R-2 = 0.629, RMSE = 538). However, model versions with a single date and maximum seasonal VIs values as a plant signal, performed almost equally well. Since the maximum seasonal VIs values occurred during the last ten days of April, these model versions are suitable for yield prediction.

TI  - HMGB1-TIM3-HO1: A New Pathway of Inflammation in Skin of SARS-CoV-2 Patients? A Retrospective Pilot Study
T2  - BIOMOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has completely disrupted the health systems of the entire planet. From the earliest months, it became increasingly clear that in addition to affecting the upper airways and lungs, there were other organs that could be affected. Among these, the skin became a real "sentinel signal" to be able to even suspect COVID-19. Background: this study deals with a little-explored issue for now: the study of skin immunopathology in SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects ascertained using the most reliable methods available. Methods: we used skin biopsy samples from SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients, studying morphology (Hematoxylin-Eosin), T lymphocyte population (CD4 and CD8), three markers such as HMGB-1, TIM-3 and HO-1 by immunohistochemistry. Results: although the presence of the CD4 and CD8 T population did not differ statistically significantly, we found greater activation and release of HMGB-1 in skin samples from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, greater immunolabeling for TIM-3 at the level of CD4 and CD8 and a reduced expression of Heme oxygenase 1. Conclusions: these results support the possibility that there is immune deregulation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who develop skin manifestations of various kinds.

AB  - recovered crop, depending on the crop vigor/height. Decision matrix was prepared combining (0 VH) and (0 VH for NDVI-based crop vigor strata (low, medium, and high) to classify the area into affected, marginally affected and normal. Overall accuracy of the classified map was found to be 84.12% with kappa coefficient of 0.74. Nearly, 12.5% of the jute area, i.e., 38,119 ha was found to be either affected or marginally affected due to Amphan and distributed in the southern part of Murshidabad, north-eastern Nadia, northern 24 Paraganas (N), and middle region of Hooghli district. Geospatial map of block-wise affected jute area was prepared to facilitate informed decision making. The study demonstrated an operational methodology for assessing crop lodging due to natural calamities to support relief management and crop insurance.The present study is a maiden attempt to assess jute crop lodging due to super cyclone Amphan (20 May 2020) by synergistic use of Sentinel-2 (optical) and Sentinel-1 (SAR) data over part of West Bengal, India. Pre-event Sentinel-2 data (9 April, 14 May) along with the ground information were used to map the jute crop of the affected districts with accuracy of 85%. The cross-polarized backscatter (sigma(0)(VH)) of Sentinel-1 was found to be sensitive to the sudden change in the canopy structure due to lodging and partial flooding.Delta sigma(0)(VH)(sigma(0)(VH)(_22) May - sigma(0)(VH)(_16) May) indicating post-event damage was > 2.5 dB over the affected jute crop and (Delta 0 VH) (()sigma(0)(VH)_22 May - sigma(0)(VH)_28 May) representing post-event recovery showed > 1.5 dB for

TI  - Mangrove Forest Cover and Phenology with Landsat Dense Time Series in Central Queensland, Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are one of the most biologically productive ecosystems. Wetland ecosystem services, ranging from provision of food security to climate change mitigation, are enormous, far outweighing those of dryland ecosystems per hectare. However, land use change and water regulation infrastructure have reduced connectivity in many river systems and with floodplain and estuarine wetlands. Mangrove forests are critical communities for carbon uptake and storage, pollution control and detoxification, and regulation of natural hazards. Although the clearing of mangroves in Australia is strictly regulated, Great Barrier Reef catchments have suffered landscape modifications and hydrological alterations that can kill mangroves. We used remote sensing datasets to investigate land cover change and both intra- and inter-annual seasonality in mangrove forests in a large estuarine region of Central Queensland, Australia, which encompasses a national park and Ramsar Wetland, and is adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage site. We built a time series using spectral, auxiliary, and phenology variables with Landsat surface reflectance products, accessed in Google Earth Engine. Two land cover classes were generated (mangrove versus non-mangrove) in a Random Forest classification. Mangroves decreased by 1480 hectares (-2.31%) from 2009 to 2019. The overall classification accuracies and Kappa coefficient for 2008-2010 and 2018-2020 land cover maps were 95% and 95%, respectively. Using an NDVI-based time series we examined intra- and inter-annual seasonality with linear and harmonic regression models, and second with TIMESAT metrics of mangrove forests in three sections of our study region. Our findings suggest a relationship between mangrove growth phenology along with precipitation anomalies and severe tropical cyclone occurrence over the time series. The detection of responses to extreme events is important to improve understanding of the connections between climate, extreme weather events, and biodiversity in estuarine and mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Elevation Spatial Variation Error Compensation in Complex Scene and Elevation Inversion by Autofocus Method in GEO SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the high altitude of geosynchronous synthetic aperture radar (GEO SAR), its synthetic aperture time can reach up to several hundred seconds, and its revisit cycle is very short, which makes it of great application worth in the remote sensing field, such as in disaster monitoring and vegetation measurements. However, because of the elevation of the target, elevation spatial variation error is caused in the GEO SAR imaging. In this paper, we focus on the compensation of the elevation space-variant error in the fast variant part with the autofocus method and utilize the error to carry out elevation inversing in complex scenes. For a complex scene, it can be broken down into a slow variant slope and the remaining fast variant part. First, the phase error caused by the elevation spatial variation is analyzed. Second, the spatial variant error caused by the slowly variant slope is compensated with the improved imaging algorithm. The error caused by the remaining fast variable part is the focus of this paper. We propose a block map-drift phase gradient autofocus (block-MD-PGA) algorithm to compensate for the random phase error part. By dividing sub-blocks reasonably, the elevation spatial variant error is compensated for by an autofocus algorithm in each sub-block. Because the errors of different elevations are diverse, the proposed algorithm is suitable for the scene where the target elevations are almost the same after the sub-blocks are divided. Third, the phase error obtained by the autofocus method is used to inverse the target elevation. Finally, simulations with dot-matrix targets and targets based on the high-resolution TerraSAR-X image verify the excellent effect of the proposed method and the accuracy of the elevation inversion.

TI  - New Forest Aboveground Biomass Maps of China Integrating Multiple Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the spatial variation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) at the national or regional scale is important for estimating carbon emissions and removals and contributing to global stocktake and balancing the carbon budget. Recently, several gridded forest AGB products have been produced for China by integrating remote sensing data and field measurements, yet significant discrepancies remain among these products in their estimated AGB carbon, varying from 5.04 to 9.81 Pg C. To reduce this uncertainty, here, we first compiled independent, high-quality field measurements of AGB using a systematic and consistent protocol across China from 2011 to 2015. We applied two different approaches, an optimal weighting technique (WT) and a random forest regression method (RF), to develop two observationally constrained hybrid forest AGB products in China by integrating five existing AGB products. The WT method uses a linear combination of the five existing AGB products with weightings that minimize biases with respect to the field measurements, and the RF method uses decision trees to predict a hybrid AGB map by minimizing the bias and variance with respect to the field measurements. The forest AGB stock in China was 7.73 Pg C for the WT estimates and 8.13 Pg C for the RF estimates. Evaluation with the field measurements showed that the two hybrid AGB products had a lower RMSE (29.6 and 24.3 Mg/ha) and bias (-4.6 and -3.8 Mg/ha) than all five participating AGB datasets. Our study demonstrated both the WT and RF methods can be used to harmonize existing AGB maps with field measurements to improve the spatial variability and reduce the uncertainty of carbon stocks. The new spatial AGB maps of China can be used to improve estimates of carbon emissions and removals at the national and subnational scales.

TI  - A Collaborative Sensing System for Farmland Water Conservancy Project Maintenance through Integrating Satellite, Aerial, and Ground Observations
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - More and more attention has been paid to farmland water conservancy project (FWCP) maintenance in China, which can reallocate water resources in a more rational and efficient manner. Compared with the traditional survey such as field survey, FWCP maintenance can be improved efficiently with geospatial technology. To improve the level of FWCP maintenance in China, a collaborative sensing system framework by integrating satellite, aerial, and ground remote sensing is put forward. The structure of the system framework includes three sections, namely the data acquisition, the operational work, and the application and service. Through the construction and operation of such collaborative sensing system, it will break through the limitation of any single remote sensing platform and provide all-around and real-time information on FWCP. The collaborative monitoring schemes for the designed FWCP maintenance can engage ditch riders to maintain more effectively, which will enable them to communicate more specifically with smallholders in the process of irrigation. Only when ditch riders and farmers are fully involved, irrigation efficiency will be improved. Furthermore, the collaborative sensing system needs feasible standards for multi-source remote sensing data processing and intelligent information extraction such as data fusion, data assimilation, and data mining. In a way, this will promote the application of remote sensing in the field of agricultural irrigation and water saving. On the whole, it will be helpful to improve the traditional maintenance problems and is also the guarantee for establishing a long-term scientific management mechanism of FWCP maintenance in developing countries, especially in China.

TI  - Rupture Kinematics and Coseismic Slip Model of the 2021 Mw 7.3 Maduo (China) Earthquake: Implications for the Seismic Hazard of the Kunlun Fault
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 21 May 2021 Maduo earthquake was the largest event to occur on a secondary fault in the interior of the active Bayanhar block on the north-central Tibetan plateau in the last twenty years. A detailed kinematic study of the Maduo earthquake helps us to better understand the seismogenic environments of the secondary faults within the block, and its relationship with the block-bounding faults. In this study, firstly, SAR images are used to obtain the coseismic deformation fields. Secondly, we use a strain model-based method and steepest descent method (SDM) to resolve the three-dimensional displacement components and to invert the coseismic slip distribution constrained by coseismic displacement fields, respectively. The three-dimensional displacement fields reveal a dominant left-lateral strike-slip motion, local horizontal displacement variations and widely distributed near-fault subsidence/uplift deformation. We prefer a five-segment fault slip model, with well constrained fault geometry featuring different dip angles and striking, constrained by InSAR observations. The peak coseismic slip is estimated to be similar to 5 m near longitude 98.9 degrees E at a depth of similar to 4-7 km. Overall, the distribution of the coseismic slip on the fault is highly correlated to the measured surface displacement offsets along the entire rupture. We observe the moderate shallow slip deficit and limited afterslip deformation following the Maduo earthquake, it may indicate the effects of off-fault deformation during the earthquake and stable interseismic creep on the fault. The occurrence of the Maduo earthquake on a subsidiary fault updates the importance and the traditional estimate of the seismic hazards for the Kunlun fault.

TI  - Improved estimation of forest stand volume by the integration of GEDI LiDAR data and multi-sensor imagery in the Changbai Mountains Mixed forests Ecoregion (CMMFE), northeast China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest stand volume is a vital indicator of productivity and carbon storage. Conventionally, stand volume is estimated from field samples, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and optical imagery, which suffer saturation problems. Although Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technique degrades the signal saturation, its largescale application is hindered by spatial continuity. To address this issue, recently released Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR data, Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI), and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) digital surface model (DSM) imagery were integrated for volume modeling and estimation under a point-line-polygon framework. The footprint-level LiDAR variables, as a linear bridge, were adopted to link field plots to the full-cover multi-sensor imagery. Results showed that volume of the Changbai Mountains Mixed Forests Ecoregion (CMMFE) displayed variations along the elevation gradient, ranging from 47.56 to 277.30 m3/ha with a mean value of 151.39 m3/ha. Additionally, the accuracy comparison based on independent validation samples indicated that integrating GEDI LiDAR data under a point-line-polygon framework performed better than the traditional point-polygon approach, which directly linked field samples to multi-sensor imagery. The corresponding estimated error declined from 22.08% to 15.21%. The canopy cover and tree height from LiDAR, elevation from L band InSAR, and spectral indices of MSI red-edge bands were key for stand volume mapping in heterogeneous temperate forests. This comparison also showed that the integration of LiDAR by a point-line-polygon framework adopted 2/3 of the modeling points but acquired more accurate estimation than a traditional approach only based on multi-sensor imagery, which implied less field sampling work was needed for similar research. Consequently, as a pioneering exploration of GEDI LiDAR data combined with multi-sensor imagery under the point-line-polygon framework, this study provides an efficient methodology for the volume estimation of heterogeneous forests.

TI  - Mapping Maize Area in Heterogeneous Agricultural Landscape with Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Images Based on Random Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of crop area is essential to adjusting the regional crop planting structure and the rational planning of water resources. However, it is quite challenging to map crops accurately by high-resolution remote sensing images because of the ecological gradient and ecological convergence between crops and non-crops. The purpose of this study is to explore the combining application of high-resolution multi-temporal Sentinel-1 (S1) radar backscatter and Sentinel-2 (S2) optical reflectance images for maize mapping in highly complex and heterogeneous landscapes in the middle reaches of Heihe River, northwest China. We proposed a new two-step method of vegetation extraction and followed by maize extraction, that is, extract the vegetation-covered areas first to reduce the inter-class variance by using a Random Forest (RF) classifier based on S2 data, and then extract the maize distribution in the vegetation area by using another RF classifier based on S1 and/or S2 data. The results demonstrate that the vegetation extraction classifier successfully identified vegetation-covered regions with an overall accuracy above 96% in the study area, and the accuracy of the maize extraction classifier constructed by the combined multi-temporal S1 and S2 images is significantly improved compared with that S1 (alone) or S2 (alone), with an overall accuracy of 87.63%, F1_Score of 0.86, and Kappa coefficient of 0.75. In addition, with the introduction of multi-temporal S1 and/or S2 images in crop growing season, the constructed RF model is more beneficial to maize mapping.

TI  - Estimating average tree height in Xixiaoshan Forest Farm, Northeast China based on Sentinel-1 with Sentinel-2A data
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest resource survey is important for the sustainable development of forest ecosystem in China. The average tree height is a main structural parameter of forest resource survey, and also one of the key parameters with greatest difficulty to obtain. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential of joint active and passive remote sensing technology in estimating forest average height. Taking Xixiaoshan Forest Farm in Linjiang City of Jilin Province as the research area, we used Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2A data, extracted two backscatter coefficients and eight texture information of Sentinel-1, ten spectral bands and texture information of Sentinel-2A and eleven vegetation index variables, constructed five groups of average tree height estimation models based on above variables and fusion of four variables by multiple linear regression method. We further evaluated the influence of each variable on the inversion accuracy. The results showed that the texture information extracted from the Sentinel-2A spectral band of a single data source variable had a better modeling effect and could be used as effective data to estimate the average tree height. The height estimation model of the integrated four variables was optimal, with a R-2 vaule of 0.56, a root mean square error of leave-one-out cross-validation of 2.92 m, and a relative root mean square error of leave-one-out cross. validation of 21.5%. The forest average height model based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2a characteristic variables could improve the estimation accuracy of forest height, which could be used for regional forest average height estimation and mapping.

TI  - Digital Stories as a Creative Assignment for Studying World Religions
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The incorporation of creative assignments in the form of digital stories and artistic assignments in undergraduate and graduate World Religions courses has resulted in positive feedback from the students, and these courses were considered the favorite of the semester. They have given students, many of which identify as "spiritual but not religious", or "non-practicing", an opportunity to connect themes from various world religions to their own life stories, implicitly or explicitly. The purpose of this article is to encourage educators in both a secondary and a college/university/seminary setting to consider digital stories as a creative assignment that deepens their understanding of world religions within the context of a World Religions course, or other religion and religious education courses. This article will present the institutional support provided by Mercy College (Dobbs Ferry, New York) and the context for the World Religions class in which the digital stories are assigned. It will be followed by the process of making a digital story, the directions given to the students, the different platforms that students can choose to make the digital stories, and examples of digital stories created by the students. The paper will conclude with a summary of comments made by the students about the assignment and connections with additional articles on the benefits of digital stories to increase empathy and replace the dominant stories that cause oppression and injustice, like racism and white supremacy, with stories that offer resistance and counter the status quo of oppression and injustice.

TI  - Analysis of Mineral Aerosol in the Surface Layer over the Caspian Lowland Desert by the Data of 12 Summer Field Campaigns in 2002-2020
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In-situ knowledge on characteristics of mineral aerosols is important for weather and climate prediction models, particularly for modeling such processes as the entrainment, transport and deposition of aerosols. However, field measurements of the dust emission flux, dust size distribution and its chemical composition under realistic wind conditions remain rare. In this study, we present experimental data over annual expeditions in the arid and semi-arid zones of the Caspian Lowland Desert (Kalmykia, south of Russia); we evaluate characteristics of mineral aerosol concentration and fluxes, estimate its chemical composition and calculate its long-distance transport characteristics. The mass concentration in different years ranges from several tens to several hundred of mu g m(-3). The significant influence of wind velocity on the value of mass and counting concentration and on the proposed entrainment mechanisms is confirmed. An increased content of anthropogenic elements (S, Sn, Pb, Bi, Mo, Ag, Cd, Hg, etc.), which is characteristic for all observation points in the south of the European Russia, is found. The trajectory analysis show that long-range air particles transport from the Caspian Lowland Desert to the central regions of European Russia tends to increase in the recent decades.

TI  - Improvements of ADAM3 by Incorporating New Dust Emission Reduction Formulations Based on Real-Time MODIS NDVI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust events in Northeast Asia have several adverse effects on human health, agricultural land, infrastructure, and transport. Wind speed is the most important factor in determining the total dust emission at the land surface; however, various land-surface conditions must be considered as well. Recently, the Korea Meteorological Administration updated the dust emission reduction factor (RF) in the Asian Dust Aerosol Model 3 (ADAM3) using data from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We evaluated the improvements of ADAM3 according to soil types. We incorporated new RF formulations in the evaluation based on real-time MODIS NDVI data obtained over the Asian dust source regions in northern China during spring 2017. This incorporation improved the simulation performance of ADAM3 for the PM10 mass concentration in Inner Mongolia and Manchuria for all soil types, except Gobi. The ADAM3 skill scores for sand, loess, and mixed types in a 24 h forecast increased by 6.6%, 20.4%, and 13.3%, respectively, compared with those in forecasts employing the monthly RF based on the NDVI data. As surface conditions in the dust source regions continually change, incorporating real-time vegetation data is critical to improving performance of dust forecast models such as ADAM3.

TI  - Historical GIS as a Tool for Monitoring, Preserving and Planning Forest Landscape: A Case Study in a Mediterranean Region
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to assess the dynamics of forests and the effectiveness of their management strategies, it is necessary to develop monitoring systems based on qualitative and quantitative tools for their conservation, valorization and restoration. This approach is particularly important for areas that have undergone intense anthropogenic transformations in the last century. In order to do this, it is first necessary to apply a chronological methodology based on historical GIS that allows the integration of different types of geodata. As a result of constantly evolving spatial analysis tools, the monitoring of landscape forest evolution is increasingly more effective and complete. Using as a case study a region representative of common processes of other Mediterranean areas (Southern Italy-Basilicata region), a diachronic analysis of 156 years was applied to evaluate the forest landscape dynamics. Starting from historical cartographies to remotely sensed data available online, a GIS-based approach was implemented to evaluate the spatial and statistical variations of the forest landscape. In this way, it was possible to assess how much, where and how the forest landscape has changed in order to provide a methodology to support more detailed and sectoral studies.

TI  - Envisioning an Integrated Assessment System and Observation Network for the North Atlantic Ocean
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Review
AB  - The atmosphere over the Atlantic Ocean is highly impacted by human activities on the surrounding four major continents. Globally, human activity creates significant burdens for the sustainability of key Earth systems, pressuring the planetary boundaries of environmental sustainability. Here, we propose a science-based integrated approach addressing linked science and policy challenges in the North Atlantic. There is a unique combination of ongoing anthropogenic changes occurring in the coupled atmosphere-ocean environment of the region related to climate, air and water quality, the biosphere and cryosphere. This is matched by a unique potential for the societies that surround the North Atlantic to systematically address these challenges in a dynamic and responsive manner. Three key linked science-policy challenges to be addressed as part of this proposed integrated regional approach are: (1) understanding physical and dynamic changes, (2) sustaining human and ecosystem health and (3) reducing existing knowledge gaps on the carbon budget and the Earth's energy balance. We propose a North Atlantic multidisciplinary scientific assessment system and observation network to address these thematic challenges. We propose to build on and link with the existing research activities and observational networks and infrastructures to specifically address the key North Atlantic challenges that encompass a range of policy areas. This will strengthen the institutional response to weather, climate, environmental and ecological threats and reduce societal risk.

TI  - Integration of In Situ and Remote Sensing Measurements for the Management of Harmful Cyanobacteria Blooms. A Lesson from a Strategic Multiple-Uses Reservoir (Lake Occhito, South Italy)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful cyanobacteria blooms (HCBs) are one of the main water quality threats affecting reservoirs. Guidelines suggest integrating laboratory, real-time in situ, and remote sensing data in the monitoring of HCBs. However, this approach is still little adopted in institutional measuring programs. We demonstrated that this integration improves frequency and spatial resolution of the data collection. Data were from an intense HCB (Planktothrix rubescens), which occurred in a south Italy multiple-uses reservoir (Lake Occhito) between 2008 and 2009 and regarded both the lake and the irrigation network. Laboratory and in situ fluorometric data were related to satellite imagery, using simple linear regression models, to produce surface lake-wide maps reporting the distribution of both P. rubescens and microcystins. In the first node of the distribution network, microcystin concentrations (4-10 mu g L-1) reached values potentially able to damage the culture and to accumulate during cultivation. Nevertheless, our study shows a decrease in the microcystin content with the distance from the lake (0.05 mu g L-1 km(-1)), with a reduction of about 80% of the microcystin concentrations at the furthest tanks. Recent improvements in the spatial resolution (i.e., tens of meters) of satellite imagery allow us to monitor the main tanks of large and complex irrigation systems.

TI  - STICS crop model and Sentinel-2 images for monitoring rice growth and yield in the Camargue region
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of rice yield at territory level is important for strategic economic decisions. Assessing spatial and temporal yield variability at regional scale is difficult because of the numerous factors involved, including agricultural practices, phenological calendars, and environmental contexts. New remote sensing data acquired at decametric resolution (Sentinel missions) can provide information on this spatial variability. The study objective was thus to evaluate the potential of Sentinel-2 images for monitoring rice cropping systems and yield from farm to region scales. The approach considered both observations and modeling. In-depth farmers surveys were carried out in the Camargue region, Southeastern France. The novelty was to use operational tools (BVNET and PHENOTB) to compute leaf area index, to daily interpolate this biophysical variable from 44 images acquired in 2016 and 2017 for each rice field, and to derive key phenological parameters from the analysis of the temporal profiles. The STICS crop model was spatially used, considering the biophysical variables derived from remote sensing. We tested four simulation strategies, differing in the integration intensity of remote sensing information into the model. Results have shown that (1) Sentinel-2 data allowed distinguishing early and late rice varieties. (2) The phenological stages mapped at the regional level allowed to better understand the agricultural practices of farmers. (3) The assimilation of remote sensing data to the STICS crop model significantly improved yield estimation and provided useful information on the spatial variability observed at regional scale. It was the first time that Sentinel-2 data are used with STICS crop model to assess rice yield at both farm and regional scale in the Camargue area. The proposed method is based on free open data and free access model, easily reproducible in other environmental contexts.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Data Processing for Detecting and Monitoring of Ground Instabilities in the Rocky Coast of Central Asturias (N Spain)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The cliff coastline of the central region of Asturias (N Spain) is severely affected by terrain instabilities, causing considerable damage to properties and infrastructures every year. In this study, we applied the A-DInSAR technique based on Sentinel-1 imagery to map and monitor active slopes in an emblematic rocky area of the Asturian coast: the Penas Cape. The A-DInSAR dataset analysis has been focused at regional and local scales. For the local scale assessment, six areas were selected based on previous work and the landslide database of the Principality of Asturias region (BAPA-Base de datos de Argayos del Principado de Asturias), created by the University of Oviedo. The processing of the data has been performed using two independent sets of processing tools: the PSIG software tools, a professional tool and, the GEP service, an unsupervised platform. The dataset consisted of 113 SAR IW-SLC images acquired by the Sentinel-1 A/B satellites between January 2018 and February 2020. LOS mean deformation velocity maps (mm year(-1)) and deformation time series (mm) were obtained by PSIG and GEP software, allowing coastal areas with landslide incidence and other terrain movements to be distinguished. Deformation motion has been estimated from PSIG VLOS rates to be from -17.1 to 37.4 mm year(-1) and GEP VLOS rates from -23.0-38.3 mm year(-1). According to deformation time series (mm), the minimum and maximum accumulated displacements are -68.5-78.8 and -48.8-77.0 mm by means of PSIG and GEP, respectively. These ground motions could be associated with coastal instabilities related to marine activity and coastal retreat, both at regional and local study scales. The main contributions of this work are: (1) the demonstration of the potential of A-DInSAR techniques to evaluate coastal instabilities in a coastal retreat context and (2) the comparison of the results provided by the two sets of tools, which allowed the ground motion to be assessed by using an unsupervised approach vs. a contrasted one (robust software). This study increases the knowledge about coastal instabilities and other ground movements along the rocky coast and cliffs of Central Asturias. As a conclusion for the future, we believe that this work highlights the evaluated methods as significant tools to support the management of coastal territories with jagged and rocky coastlines.

TI  - Temporal and spatial characteristics of green vegetation cover changes in the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 1982 to 2019
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - We used two NDVI datasets ( GIMMS3g NDVI and MODIS NDVI) and a monthly dataset of basic meteorological elements in China to analyze the temporal and spatial variations of vegetation cover in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, based on the average NDVI and its dynamics in the warm season ( April - October) from 1982 to 2019. The contribution of climatic and non -climatic factors to the spatiotemporal variation of vegetation cover was quantified. The results showed that, during 1982-2019, the average warm season NDVI of most regions in the Yangtze River Economic Belt was higher than 0.5, suggesting a favorable vegetation coverage. From 1982 to 2019, the average warm season NDVI of the Yangtze River Economic Belt showed a significant increasing trend, but with distinct stage characteristics. From 1982 to 1990, vegetation coverage significantly increased, with the dominant contribution of non -climatic factors. The typical areas in this stage included Sichuan, Central South and Northwest Yunnan, eastern Hunan, and Jiangxi. From 1990 to 2003, vegetation coverage was generally stable, but decreased in some particular locations. The intensity of the enhancement dominated by climatic factors was equal to that of the reduction dominated by non -climatic factors, which were basically offset. The typical regions with increases of climate -driven NDVI included southern Jiangxi, Chongqing and Guizhou, while the typical regions with decreases of non -climate -driven NDVI included Yangtze River Delta, Huanghuai Plain, plains of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and Sichuan Basin. From 2003 to 2019, the vegetation coverage increased significantly, driven by both climate and non -climate factors, and with almost equal contributions. In general, the impacts of non -climatic factors on vegetation cover were greater than that of climatic factors during 1982 to 2019.

TI  - Breast Sentinel Lymph Node Frozen Section Practice
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context.-In recent years, there has been a shift to less aggressive surgical management of the axilla in breast cancer. Consequently, sentinel lymph node evaluation by frozen section (FS) has declined. Additionally, there has been an impetus to decrease efforts in identifying small sentinel lymph node metastases.Objectives.-To critically evaluate our enterprise performance in evaluating axillary sentinel lymph nodes submitted for FS prior to considering changes in processing.Design.-A retrospective review (August 1, 2017-July 31, 2019) was conducted to identify sentinel and non-sentinel lymph nodes from 1 academic institution and 2 community sites. Cases were evaluated for grossing technique and discordance between FS and permanent section (PS) due to sampling and/or interpretive error. Clinicopathologic features were assessed.Results.-Lymph nodes from 426 patients with 432 neoplasms were sent for FS. Serial sectioning at 2-mm intervals was adhered to in 338 of 432 (78.2%). Serial sectioning was significantly lower at the community sites (14 of 60; 23.3%) versus at the academic institution (324 of 372; 87.1%; P < .001). Discordant cases were all false negatives (21 of 432; 4.8%). A total of 7 of 21 false negatives (33.3%) had macrometastatic (>2 mm) disease; of these, 3 were post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 3 were neither serially sectioned nor posttherapy, and 1 was a small (0.3-cm) focus. A total of 15 of 16 false negatives due to sampling error were detected on the first permanent section level.Conclusions.-Standard serial sectioning of sentinel lymph nodes at 2-mm intervals resulted in infrequent false negatives due to macrometastatic disease. A single additional permanent section level is reasonable, given adherence to serial sectioning.

TI  - A Satellite-USV System for Persistent Observation of Mesoscale Oceanographic Phenomena
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional tools and methodologies for mesoscale observation of oceanographic phenomena are limited by under-sampling and data latency. In this article we evaluate three different scenario variants of an architecture for how heterogeneous sensor nodes can be integrated with satellite remote sensing. Independent space and marine sensing platforms are interconnected either directly or by means of a ground-based mission control center responsible for data processing, relay, and coordination of the assets. A wave-propelled unmanned surface vehicle (USV) persistently collects in situ data of the targeted phenomenon. In two variants of the architecture, a dedicated small satellite acts as a sensor node, a data processing facility and a communication node. We have used a System-of-Systems (SoS) modeling approach coupled with operational simulations in different locations on Earth, in order to support the proposed methodology and investigate quantitatively the reduction the data latency to end-users. Through a combination of field experiments and simulations we estimate how the different scenarios perform with respect to providing remote sensing data that are used to create a measurement and navigation plan for the autonomous vessel.

TI  - MSResNet: Multiscale Residual Network via Self-Supervised Learning for Water-Body Detection in Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Driven by the urgent demand for flood monitoring, water resource management and environmental protection, water-body detection in remote sensing imagery has attracted increasing research attention. Deep semantic segmentation networks (DSSNs) have gradually become the mainstream technology used for remote sensing image water-body detection, but two vital problems remain. One problem is that the traditional structure of DSSNs does not consider multiscale and multishape characteristics of water bodies. Another problem is that a large amount of unlabeled data is not fully utilized during the training process, but the unlabeled data often contain meaningful supervision information. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale residual network (MSResNet) that uses self-supervised learning (SSL) for water-body detection. More specifically, our well-designed MSResNet distinguishes water bodies with different scales and shapes and helps retain the detailed boundaries of water bodies. In addition, the optimization of MSResNet with our SSL strategy can improve the stability and universality of the method, and the presented SSL approach can be flexibly extended to practical applications. Extensive experiments on two publicly open datasets, including the 2020 Gaofen Challenge water-body segmentation dataset and the GID dataset, demonstrate that our MSResNet can obviously outperform state-of-the-art deep learning backbones and that our SSL strategy can further improve the water-body detection performance.

TI  - Evidence Supporting the Value of Surgical Procedures: Can We Do Better?
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - There is an acknowledged need for higher-quality evidence to quantify the benefit of surgical procedures, yet not enough has been done to improve the evidence base. This lack of evidence can prevent fully informed decision-making, lead to unnecessary or even harmful treatment, and contribute to wasteful expenditures of scare health care resources. Barriers to evidence generation include not only the long-recognized technical difficulties and ethical challenges of conducting randomized surgical trials, but also legal challenges that limit incentives to conduct surgical research as well as market-based challenges that make it difficult for those funding surgical research to recoup investment costs. These legal and market dynamics differ substantially from those surrounding new drug or device development. Nevertheless, obstacles could be overcome and overall expenditures could be reduced if a share of federal health care agency budgets were reallocated to generating randomized trial data, standardizing outcome measures, and conducting observational studies analogous to those that have been facilitated for drugs via the Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel Initiative. Until better quality evidence is available, ethical principles require adequate disclosure of the limited evidence base supporting current surgical procedures.

TI  - Improved kala-azar case management through implementation of health facility-based sentinel sites surveillance system in Bihar, India
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar (KA), is a neglected vector-borne disease, targeted for elimination, but several affected blocks of Bihar are posing challenges with the high incidence of cases, and moreover, the disease is spreading in newer areas. High-quality kala-azar surveillance in India, always pose great concern. The complete and accurate patient level data is critical for the current kala-azar management information system (KMIS). On the other side, no accurate data on the burden of post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) and co-infections are available under the current surveillance system, which might emerge as a serious concern. Additionally, in low case scenario, sentinel surveillance may be useful in addressing post-elimination activities and sustaining kala-azar (KA) elimination. Health facility-based sentinel site surveillance system has been proposed, first time to do a proper accounting of KA, PKDL and co-infection morbidity, mortality, diagnosis, case management, hotspot identification and monitoring the impact of elimination interventions. Methodology/principal findings Kala-azar sentinel site surveillance was established and activated in thirteen health facilities of Bihar, India, using stratified sampling technique during 2011 to 2014. Data were collected through specially designed performa from all patients attending the outpatient departments of sentinel sites. Among 20968 symptomatic cases attended sentinel sites, 2996 cases of KA and 53 cases of PKDL were registered from 889 endemic villages. Symptomatic cases meant a person with fever of more than 15 days, weight loss, fatigue, anemia, and substantial swelling of the liver and spleen (enlargement of spleen and liver).The proportion of new and old cases was 86.1% and 13.9% respectively. A statistically significant difference was observed for reduction in KA incidence from 4.13/10000 in 2011 to 1.75/10000 in 2014 (p<0.001). There were significant increase (0.08, 0.10 per 10 000 population) in the incidences of PKDL and co-infection respectively in the year 2014 as compared to that of 2011 (0.03, 0.06 per 10 000 population). The proportion of HIV-VL co-infection was significantly higher (1.6%; p<0.05) as compared to other co-infections. Proportions of male in all age groups were higher and found statistically significant (Chi-square test = 7.6; P = 0.026). Utilization of laboratory services was greatly improved. Friedman test showed statistically significant difference between response of different anti kala-azar drugs (F = 25.0, P = 0.004).The initial and final cure rate of AmBisome was found excellent (100%). The results of the signed rank sum test showed significant symmetry of unresponsiveness rate (P = 0.03). Similarly, relapse rate of sodium antimony gluconate (SAG) was also found significantly higher as compared to other drugs (95%CI 0.2165 to 19.7035; P = 0.03). A statistically significant difference was found (p<0.001) between villages having 1-2 cases (74%) and villages with 3-5 cases (15%). Significantly higher proportion (95%) of cases were captured by existing Govt. surveillance system (KMIS) (p<0.001), as compared to private providers (5%). Conclusions/significance Establishment of a sentinel site based kala-azar surveillance system in Bihar, India effectively detected the rising trend of PKDL and co-infections and captured complete and accurate patient level data.Further, this system may provide a model for improving laboratory services, KA, PKDL and co-infection case management in other health facilities of Bihar without further referral.Program managers may use these results for evaluating program's effectiveness. It may provide an example for changing the practices of health care workers in Bihar and set a benchmark of high quality surveillance data in a resource limited setting. However, the generalizability of this sentinel surveillance finding to other context remains a major limitation of this study. The justifications for this; the sentinel sites were made in the traditionally high endemic PHC's. The other conditions were Program commitment for diagnostic (rk-39) and the first line anti kala-azar drug i.e. miltefosine throughout the study period in the sentinel sites. In addition, there were clause of fulfillment of readiness criteria at each sentinel site (already described in the line no 171 to 180 at page no-8, 181-189 at page no-9 and 192-212 at page no-10). Rigorous efforts were taken to improve all the sentinel sites to meet the readiness criteria and research activities started only after meeting readiness criteria at the site. Therefore sentinel site surveillance described under the present study cannot be integrated into other set up (medium and low endemic areas). However, it can be integrated into highly endemic areas with program commitment and fulfillment of readiness criteria.Author summary Visceral leishmaniasis is a neglected vector-borne disease, and one of the major public health problems of Bihar. The disease has been targeted for elimination by 2020. Bihar still posing challenge i.e. incidence is much high in a number of affected blocks, and even the disease is spreading in newer areas. None availability of an accurate data on the burden of post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) and co-infections under the current surveillance system may emerge as a serious concern. Therefore, health facility-based sentinel site surveillance system has been attempted for the first time in Bihar for proper accounting of KA, PKDL and co-infection morbidity, mortality, diagnosis, case management, hotspot identification and monitoring the impact of elimination interventions. A system for capturing regional transmission is essential that can target focal areas of infection to monitor progress towards kala-azar elimination. Kala-azar sentinel site surveillance was established and activated in thirteen health facilities of Bihar during 2011 to 2014. The results showed a significant increase in PKDL and co-infection in 2014 when compared to 2011. Findings further revealed that utilization of laboratory services and case management were greatly improved, as majority of patients with KA, PKDL & co-infections were managed by the sentinel sites itself. The final cure rate of AmBisome was found excellent (100%). These observations may be useful to provide the basis for the design, refinement and resource allocation of the kala-azar control program. This system may also be useful in measuring impact of elimination interventions, their effectiveness and finally help in improving program management. It may further be used as an example for changing the practices of health care workers in Bihar and a lesson how to achieve high quality surveillance data in a resource limited setting. Standardization of sentinel site surveillance in terms of improved procedure, training, logistics, etc may further increase the effectiveness of this system. It may possibly be used as a cost-effective approach for capturing real-time kala-azar data under national kala-azar elimination programme.

TI  - Sensitivity of Spring Phenology Simulations to the Selection of Model Structure and Driving Meteorological Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of the timing of intensive spring leaf growth initiation at mid and high latitudes is crucial for improving the predictive capacity of biogeochemical and Earth system models. In this study, we focus on the modeling of climatological onset of spring leaf growth in Central Europe and use three spring phenology models driven by three meteorological datasets. The MODIS-adjusted NDVI3g dataset was used as a reference for the period between 1982 and 2010, enabling us to study the long-term mean leaf onset timing and its interannual variability (IAV). The performance of all phenology model-meteorology database combinations was evaluated with one another, and against the reference dataset. We found that none of the constructed model-database combinations could reproduce the observed start of season (SOS) climatology within the study region. The models typically overestimated IAV of the leaf onset, where spatial median SOS dates were best simulated by the models based on heat accumulation. When aggregated for the whole study area, the complex, bioclimatic index-based model driven by the CarpatClim database could capture the observed overall SOS trend. Our results indicate that the simulated timing of leaf onset primarily depends on the choice of model structure, with a secondary contribution from the choice of the driving meteorological dataset.

TI  - Impact of IRS: Four-years of entomological surveillance of the Indian Visceral Leishmaniases elimination programme
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summary Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar, is a major parasitic disease in South Asia (Indian subcontinent), with 85% of the disease incidence in India. Historically VL had been controlled and almost eliminated with Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) using dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). However, reinitiating this approach in 2015 failed due to high insecticide resistance in the sand fly vector and poor IRS quality, meaning that VL elimination targets were not met. To improve this the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme changed to an effective insecticide, alpha-cypermethrin and altered the mode of application to compression pumps. Sentinel sites were established to monitor the entomological indicators, these showed the positive impact of these changes from 2016 to 2019. During this period the overall incidence of disease has decreased, and India is now on track to reach it's target incidence for VL of less than 1/1000 people at the sub-district (block) level.Background In 2005, Bangladesh, India and Nepal agreed to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis (VL) as a public health problem. The approach to this was through improved case detection and treatment, and controlling transmission by the sand fly vector Phlebotomus argentipes, with indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide. Initially, India applied DDT with stirrup pumps for IRS, however, this did not reduce transmission. After 2015 onwards, the pyrethroid alpha-cypermethrin was applied with compression pumps, and entomological surveillance was initiated in 2016. Methods Eight sentinel sites were established in the Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. IRS coverage was monitored by household survey, quality of insecticide application was measured by HPLC, presence and abundance of the VL vector was monitored by CDC light traps, insecticide resistance was measured with WHO diagnostic assays and case incidence was determined from the VL case register KAMIS. Results Complete treatment of houses with IRS increased across all sites from 57% in 2016 to 70% of houses in 2019, rising to >80% if partial house IRS coverage is included (except West Bengal). The quality of insecticide application has improved compared to previous studies, average doses of insecticide on filters papers ranged from 1.52 times the target dose of 25mg/m(2) alpha-cypermethrin in 2019 to 1.67 times in 2018. Resistance to DDT has continued to increase, but the vector was not resistant to carbamates, organophosphates or pyrethroids. The annual and seasonal abundance of P. argentipes declined between 2016 to 2019 with an overall infection rate of 0.03%. This was associated with a decline in VL incidence for the blocks represented by the sentinel sites from 1.16 per 10,000 population in 2016 to 0.51 per 10,000 in 2019. Conclusion Through effective case detection and management reducing the infection reservoirs for P. argentipes in the human population combined with IRS keeping P. argentipes abundance and infectivity low has reduced VL transmission. This combination of effective case management and vector control has now brought India within reach of the VL elimination targets.

AB  - Ramsar Convention (RC) is the first of modern intergovernmental agreement on the conscious use and conservation of natural resources. It provides a platform for contracting parties working together to develop the best available data, advice, and policy recommendations to increase awareness of the benefits of wetlands in nature and society. Turkey became a party of the RC in 1994, and in the years 1994 to 2013, 14 wetlands that reached the Ramsar criteria were recognized as Ramsar sites (RS). With this study, all inland RS in Turkey from 1985 to 2020 were examined, and changes in the water surface areas were evaluated on the GEE cloud computing platform using Landsat satellite images and the NDWI index. The closest meteorological station data to each RS were evaluated and associated with the surface area changes. The reasons for the changes in these areas, besides the meteorological effects, have been scrutinized using management plans and publications. As a result, inland wetlands decreased at different rates from 1985 to 2020, with a total loss of 31.38% and 21,571.0 ha for the spring months. Since the designation dates of RS, the total amount of water surface area reduction was 27.35%, constituting 17,758.90 ha.

TI  - Influences of Soil Bulk Density and Texture on Estimation of Surface Soil Moisture Using Spectral Feature Parameters and an Artificial Neural Network Algorithm
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective monitoring of soil moisture (theta) by non-destructive means is important for crop irrigation management. Soil bulk density (rho) is a major factor that affects potential application of theta estimation models using remotely-sensed data. However, few researchers have focused on and quantified the effect of p on spectral reflectance of soil moisture with different soil textures. Therefore, we quantified influences of soil bulk density and texture on theta, and evaluated the performance from combining spectral feature parameters with the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm to estimate theta. The conclusions are as follows: (1) for sandy soil, the spectral feature parameters most strongly correlated with theta were S-g (sum of reflectance in green edge) and A_Depth(780 -970) (absorption depth at 780-970 nm). (2) The theta had a significant correlation to the R900-970 (maximum reflectance at 900-970 nm) and S900-970 (sum of reflectance at 900-970 nm) for loamy soil. (3) The best spectral feature parameters to estimate theta were R900-970 and S900-970 for clay loam soil, respectively. (4) The R900-970 and S900-970 showed higher accuracy in estimating theta for sandy loam soil. The R900-970 and S900-970 achieved the best estimation accuracy for all four soil textures. Combining spectral feature parameters with ANN produced higher accuracy in estimating theta (R-2 = 0.95 and RMSE = 0.03 m(3) m(-3)) for the four soil textures.

TI  - Annual Actual Evapotranspiration Estimation via GIS Models of Three Empirical Methods Employing Remotely Sensed Data for the Peloponnese, Greece, and Comparison with Annual MODIS ET and Pan Evaporation Measurements
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) has been insufficiently investigated in Greece. This study aimed to estimate annual ETa by empirical methods (Turc, modified Turc, and Coutagne) for the Peloponnese, Greece, a Mediterranean testbed, between 2016-2019, four of the warmest years since the preindustrial era, and compare them to MODIS ET. Furthermore, measurements of annual pan evaporation (Epan) were performed for two Class A pan stations in the Peloponnese with different reliefs and conditions. The empirical methods and statistical formulae (RMSD, MB, and NMB) were developed as models in ArcMap. The outcomes of the Turc method resembled MODIS ET ranges for all years, followed by those of Coutagne. The estimates by the modified Turc method were almost identical to MODIS ET. Therefore, the modified Turc method can be used as an alternative to MODIS ET (and vice versa) for the Peloponnese for 2016-2019. Moreover, the Epan at Patras University station (semiurban, low elevation) exhibited an upward trend resembling the trends of the empirical methods over the study years, whereas the Epan at Ladonas station (higher elevation, lakeside) required investigation on a monthly time scale. Additionally, the gradual decrease of pan-water icing at Ladonas in December (from 20 d in 2016 to 0 d in 2019) could imply an undergoing decrease in snowpack storage retention across the mountains of the Peloponnese.

TI  - Joint Master-Slave Yaw Steering for Bistatic Spaceborne SAR With an Arbitrary Configuration
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Yaw steering is an important technique for bistatic spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR), traditionally implemented separately at the master and slave satellites, such as the X-band TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X system. This separate yaw steering method, however, will degrade the illumination synchronization between the master and slave satellites. With the increment in frequency band and master-slave distance, the degradation will get worse, leading to intolerable azimuth resolution degradation or even failure of imaging. To solve this problem, a new joint yaw steering (JYS) method is proposed for bistatic spaceborne SAR with an arbitrary configuration in this letter. The word "joint" means that the master and slave satellites cooperatively work to always make their beams point to an identical point on the Earth's surface. In this way, the best illumination synchronization can be achieved, contributing to the best available azimuth resolution. The presented approach has been evaluated through computer simulations.

TI  - Long-Term Corrosion Testing of Zy-4 in a LiOH Solution under High Pressure and Temperature Conditions
T2  - MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The fuel cladding is one of the most important structural components for maintaining the integrity of a fuel channel and for safely exploitation of a nuclear power plant. The corrosion behavior of a fuel cladding material, Zy-4, under high pressure and temperatures conditions, was analyzed in a static isothermal autoclave under simulated primary water conditions-a LiOH solution at 310 degrees C and 10 MPa for up to 3024 h. After this, the oxides grown on the Zy-4 sample surface were characterized using electrochemical measurements, gravimetric analysis, metallographic analysis, SEM and XPS. The maximum oxide thicknesses evaluated by gravimetric and SEM measurements were in good agreement; both values were around 1.2 mu m. The optical light microscopy (OLM) investigations identified the presence of small hydrides uniformly distributed horizontally across the alloy. EIS impedance spectra showed an increase in the oxide impedance for the samples oxidized for a long time. EIS plots has the best fit with an equivalent circuit which illustrated an oxide model that has two oxide layers: an inner oxide layer and outer layer. The EIS results showed that the inner layer was a barrier layer, and the outer layer was a porous layer. Potentiodynamic polarization results demonstrated superior corrosion resistance of the samples tested for longer periods of time. By XPS measurements we identified all five oxidation states of zirconium: Zr-0 located at 178.5 eV; Zr4+ at 182.8 eV; and the three suboxides, Zr+, Zr2+ and Zr3+ at 179.7, 180.8 and 181.8 eV, respectively. The determination of Vickers microhardness completed the investigation.

TI  - A Robust SAR Speckle Tracking Workflow for Measuring and Interpreting the 3D Surface Displacement of Landslides
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a workflow for investigating large, slow-moving landslides which combines the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique, GIS post-processing, and airborne laser scanning (ALS), and apply it to Fels landslide in Alaska, US. First, we exploit a speckle tracking (ST) approach to derive the easting, northing, and vertical components of the displacement vectors across the rock slope for two five-year windows, 2010-2015 and 2015-2020. Then, we perform post-processing in a GIS environment to derive displacement magnitude, trend, and plunge maps of the landslide area. Finally, we compare the ST-derived displacement data with structural lineament maps and profiles extracted from the ALS dataset. Relying on remotely sensed data, we estimate that the thickness of the slide mass is more than 100 m and displacements occur through a combination of slumping at the toe and planar sliding in the central and upper slope. Our approach provides information and interpretations that can assist in optimizing and planning fieldwork activities and site investigations at landslides in remote locations.

TI  - Multi-scale deformation monitoring with Sentinel-1 InSAR analyses along the Middle Route of the South-North Water Diversion Project in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As the longest water transfer route in the world, the South-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) plays a key role in mitigating the serious water shortage problem in the arid north China, and thus the routine stability monitoring of this mega infrastructure becomes a critical issue to ensure continuous fresh water supply. Compared with traditional geodetic tools such as leveling and GNSS that can only measure deformation at discrete points along the canal, modern satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) that can capture subtle ground deformation over wide areas is much more suitable to accomplish this challenging task. In this study, we carried out multi-scale InSAR analyses with multi-track Sentinel-1 data stacks to monitor deformation along the Middle Route canal of SNWDP. A coarse-resolution InSAR analysis was first carried out to map regional land subsidence in north China, and the result suggested that the Middle Route canal bypassed the huge subsidence funnel in the southeast part of Hebei province and exhibited overall stability. Afterwards, the results of relatively high-resolution InSAR analyses performed within the 5 km buffering zones along the entire canal revealed that a few sections were affected by significant embankment deformation or land subsidence. In particular, the high-filled canal sections are more prone to deform, such as the cases in Ye County and Jiaozuo City in Henan province. The validation of InSAR deformation measurements with synchronous leveling in Jiaozuo City indicated that a measurement accuracy of 6 mm was achieved. Another big problem identified is the severe uneven land subsidence along the Tianjin Branch Route, which may pose great threats upon the long-term safety of local water transfer operation, and must be handled properly to avoid further degradation.

TI  - Japanese Honeybees (<i>Apis cerana japonica</i> Radoszkowski, 1877) May Be Resilient to Land Use Change
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Pollinators are threatened globally by growing urban sprawl and agriculture. The Western Honeybee (Apis mellifera) readily adapts to whatever food is available, so people have made it the most widely distributed pollinator across the world. Previous research has suggested that the Western Honeybee may be less resilient to land use change outside of its natural range. This study examines a different honeybee species-the Japanese Honeybee (Apis cerana japonica). Unlike the Western Honeybee, this species is found almost exclusively in its natural range in Japan. Consequently, it may be better adapted to its local food sources and therefore more resilient. Working in southern Japan, in the Nagasaki and Saga prefectures, we looked at the nectar and pollen that the Japanese Honeybee feeds on. Their food intake was then examined in relation to local land use composition. We found minimal impact of increasing urban sprawl on the forage of the Japanese Honeybee. This goes against previous studies on the Western Honeybee elsewhere in the world. Though in need of a direct comparison with Western Honeybee, these preliminary results could be due to differences in urban green infrastructure in Japan, or due to an adaptation by the Japanese honeybee to its surroundings. Pollinators are being threatened globally by urbanisation and agricultural intensification, driven by a growing human population. Understanding these impacts on landscapes and pollinators is critical to ensuring a robust pollination system. Remote sensing data on land use attributes have previously linked honeybee nutrition to land use in the Western Honeybee (Apis mellifera L.). Here, we instead focus on the less commonly studied Apis cerana japonica-the Japanese Honeybee. Our study presents preliminary data comparing forage (honey and pollen) with land use across a rural-urban gradient from 22 sites in Kyushu, southern Japan. Honey samples were collected from hives between June 2018 and August 2019. Pollen were collected and biotyped from hives in urban and rural locations (n = 4). Previous studies of honey show substantial variation in monosaccharide content. Our analysis of A. cerana japonica honey found very little variation in glucose and fructose (which accounted for 97% of monosaccharides), despite substantial differences in surrounding forage composition. As expected, we observed temporal variation in pollen foraged by A. cerana japonica, likely dependent on flowering phenology. These preliminary results suggest that the forage and nutrition of A. cerana japonica may not be negatively affected by urban land use. This highlights the need for further comparative studies between A. cerana japonica and A. mellifera as it could suggest a resilience in pollinators foraging in their native range.

TI  - Positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography imaging of tertiary lymphoid structures during the development of lupus nephritis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMMUNOPATHOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymphoid neogenesis occurs in tissues targeted by chronic inflammatory processes, such as infection and autoimmunity. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), such structures develop within the kidneys of lupus-prone mice ((NZBXNZW)F1) and are observed in kidney biopsies taken from SLE patients with lupus nephritis (LN). The purpose of this prospective longitudinal animal study was to detect early kidney changes and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) using in vivo imaging. Positron emission tomography (PET) by tail vein injection of 18-F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-18-FDG)(PET/FDG) combined with computed tomography (CT) for anatomical localization and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) by intraperitoneal injection of (TC)-T-99m labeled Albumin Nanocoll ((TC)-T-99m-Nanocoll) were performed on different disease stages of NZB/W mice (n = 40) and on aged matched control mice (BALB/c) (n = 20). By using one-way ANOVA analyses, we compared two different compartmental models for the quantitative measure of F-18-FDG uptake within the kidneys. Using a new five-compartment model, we observed that glomerular filtration of (18F)FDG in lupus-prone mice decreased significantly by disease progression measured by anti-dsDNA Ab production and before onset of proteinuria. We could not visualize TLS within the kidneys, but we were able to visualize pancreatic TLS using (TC)-T-99m Nanocoll SPECT. Based on our findings, we conclude that the five-compartment model can be used to measure changes of FDG uptake within the kidney. However, new optimal PET/SPECT tracer administration sites together with more specific tracers in combination with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may make it possible to detect formation of TLS and LN before clinical manifestations.

TI  - Freshwater aquatic reptiles (Testudines and Crocodylia) as biomonitor models in assessing environmental contamination by inorganic elements and the main analytical techniques used: a review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite the general lack of studies that use reptiles as bioindicators, the value of freshwater turtles and crocodilians in ecotoxicology has been proven, due to their importance as sentinel species. The aim of this study was to compile information on the use of freshwater turtles and crocodilians as environmental biomonitors of inorganic element contamination. We searched for articles in databases using specific keywords. A total of 104 studies published between the years 1970 and 2020 were collected. We noted a general increase in the number of studies involving turtles and crocodilians during the study time period. The Order Testudines were the subjects of 46% of the analysed publications, and the Order Crocodylia accounted for 54%. Within these studies, we counted 39 species (turtles n = 29 and crocodilians n = 10). Forty chemical elements were evaluated in the analysed articles, of which the majority represented non-essential elements (Hg, Cd, Pb). Although internal organs constituted the main biological matrix chosen for each group (37%), we observed an increase in the use of non-destructive matrices in both groups (scale, blood, tail muscle, carapace). The majority of analysed studies used HNO3 for the sample decomposition, with the majority of analyses being performed using atomic absorption spectroscopy (53%). Mainly blank controls (19%), analyte recovery (18%) and replicates (18%) were used as methods of validating analytical procedures. Furthermore, the studies used certified reference materials, which measure the accuracy of the methods used. We conclude that the increase in the use of aquatic reptiles in environmental monitoring research is mainly due to their ability to reveal integrated changes in ecosystems, aiding in environmental public policy decision-making and effective management plans.

TI  - Projection of Air Pollution in Northern China in the Two RCPs Scenarios
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution in North China (NC) is an important issue affecting the economy and health. In this study, we used a regional climate model, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to project air pollution in NC and investigate the variations of air pollutions response to future climate changes, which probably has an implication to strategy and control policy for air quality in NC. A comprehensive model evaluation was conducted to verify the simulated aerosol optical depth (AOD) based on MODIS and MISR datasets, and the model also showed reasonable results in aerosol concentrations. Future changes of air pollution in the middle of the 21st century (2031-2050) were projected in the two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and compared with the situation in the historical period (1986-2005). In the two RCPs, the simulated averaged PM2.5 concentration was projected with the highest values of 50-250 mu g.m(-3) over the Bohai Rim Economic Circle (BREC) in winter. The maximum AOD is in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region in summer, with an average value of 0.68. In winter, in the RCP4.5 scenario, PM2.5 concentration and AOD obviously declined in BTH and Shandong province. However, in the RCP8.5 scenario, PM2.5 concentration and AOD increased. Results indicated that air pollution would be reduced in winter if society developed in the low emission pathway. Precipitation was projected to increase both in the two RCPs scenarios in spring, summer, and winter, but it was projected to decrease in autumn. The planetary boundary layer height decreased in the two RCPs scenarios in the central region of NC in the summer and winter. The results indicated that changes of meteorological conditions have great impact on air pollution in future scenarios.

TI  - Continued Monitoring and Modeling of Xingfeng Solid Waste Landfill Settlement, China, Based on Multiplatform SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continued settlement monitoring and modeling of landfills are critical for land redevelopment and safety assurance. This paper adopts a MTInSAR technique for time-series monitoring of the Xingfeng landfill (XFL) settlement. A major challenge is that the frequent and significant settlement in the initial stage after the closure of landfills can affect the coherence of interferograms, thus hindering the monitoring of settlement by MTInSAR. We analyzed the factors that can directly affect the temporal decorrelation of landfills and adopted a 3D phase unwrapping approach to correct the phase unwrapping errors caused by such deformation gradient. SAR images from four platforms, including 50 Sentinel-1A, 12 Radarsat-2, 4 ALOS-2, and 2 TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X images, are collected to measure the settlement and thickness of the landfill. The settlement accuracy is evaluated by a cross-evaluation between Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1A that have similar temporal coverages. We analyzed the spatial characteristics of settlement and the relationship between the settlement and thickness. Further, we modeled the future settlement of the XFL with a hyperbolic function model. The results showed that the coherence in the initial stage after closure of the XFL is primarily affected by temporal decorrelation caused by considerable deformation gradient compared with spatial decorrelation. Settlement occurs primarily in the forward slope of the XFL, and the maximum line-of-sight (LOS) settlement rate reached 0.808 m/year from August 2018 to May 2020. The correlation between the settlement and thickness is 0.62, indicating an obvious relationship between the two. In addition, the settlement of younger areas is usually greater than that of older areas.

TI  - Absorbable aerosols based on OMI data: a case study in three provinces of Northeast China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to assess the status of aerosol pollution in three selected Northeast Provinces of China, Ozone Monitoring Instrument/Aura Near UV Aerosol Optical Depth and Single Scattering Albedo 1-orbit L2 Swath 13 x 24km V003 (OMAERUV) daily product data was used to evaluate (1) the ultraviolet aerosol index (UVAI) temporal and spatial distribution of the three Northeast Provinces from 2009 to 2018; (2) the potential pollution source areas of provincial capital cities; and (3) future trend changes. Furthermore, the influencing factors were also analyzed and are discussed herein. The results show that the UVAI in the Northeast Provinces exhibit an overall increasing trend, with an average annual increase rate of 2.99%. Seasonally, the UVAI increasing trend in winter is higher than in spring which in turn is higher than autumn. And summer has the least increasing trend. In addition, the external source of absorbent aerosol transmission is mainly in the southwest. Moreover, the overall UVAI remains relatively constant in the central part of the region, and increases slightly and significantly in the south and north directions. In general, spring, autumn, and winter all exhibit increasing trends in varying degrees. The difference between the forecasted and actual UVAI values in the Northeast Provinces does not exceed 10%; thus, the forecasting reliability is good. Also, UVAI has different degrees of correlation with natural factors, such as precipitation and temperature. With respect to social factors, UVAI and population density (a social factor) are positively correlated in 98.2% of the study area, demonstrating that there is a strong positive correlation between UVAI and smoke and dust emissions.

TI  - Effect of projected climate change on potential evapotranspiration in the semiarid region of central India
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of potential evapotranspiration (PET) methods such as pan evaporation (physical measurement), empirical formulas (Penman-Monteith (PM), Hargreaves and Thornthwaite) and satellite-derived PET (MOD16) were assessed in a semiarid region of central India. The satellite-based PET was obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The comparisons between different methods were made with observed pan evaporation (ETpan) data to identify the best method for the semiarid region. Further, the future projection of PET was carried out using RCP4.5 emission scenarios of seven CMIP5 models. Two approaches were applied for the projection of PET. In the first approach, RCP4.5 scenario data are directly used in the PM method, and in the second approach, these variables are used as a predictor in the calibrated and validated least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) model. The projection of PET was made using the best-identified model among PM and LS-SVM from the years 2006-2100. The results show that MOD16 and Hargreaves overestimate the PET; however, PM and Thornwaite underestimate the PET. PM based PET is closely related with ETpan and is a good indicator of ETpan in a semiarid region. GFDL-ESM2M is identified as the most skillful CMIP5 model, and results show that PET is projected to increase in future using the LS-SVM model.

TI  - Detection and Mapping of Active Landslides before Impoundment in the Baihetan Reservoir Area (China) Based on the Time-Series InSAR Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many potential landslides occured in the Baihetan reservoir area before impoundment. After impoundment, these landslides may still slide, affecting the safe operation of the reservoir area (e.g., causing barrier lakes and floods). Identifying the locations of landslides and their distribution pattern has attracted attention in China and globally. In addition, due to the rolling terrain of the reservoir area, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging will affect the interactive synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) deformation results. Only by obtaining effective deformation information can active landslides be accurately identified. Therefore, the banks of the Hulukou Xiangbiling section of the Baihetan reservoir area before impoundment in the Jinsha River Basin were studied in this paper. Using terrain data and the satellite parameters from Sentinel-1A ascending and descending orbits and ALOS PALSAR ascending orbit, the line-of-sight visibility was quantitatively analyzed, and an analysis method was proposed. Based on the SAR data visibility analysis, the small baseline subset (SBAS) technique was used to process the SAR data to acquire effective deformation. InSAR deformation data was combined with Google Earth imagery to identify 25 active landslides. After field verification, 21 active landslides (14 new) were determined. Most of the active landslides are controlled by faults, and the strata of the other landslides are relatively weak. This InSAR analysis method based on SAR data visibility can provide a reference for identifying and analyzing active landslides in other complicated terrain.

TI  - A Blended Sea Ice Concentration Product from AMSR2 and VIIRS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An effective blended Sea-Ice Concentration (SIC) product has been developed that utilizes ice concentrations from passive microwave and visible/infrared satellite instruments, specifically the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The blending takes advantage of the all-sky capability of the AMSR2 sensor and the high spatial resolution of VIIRS, though it utilizes only the clear sky characteristics of VIIRS. After both VIIRS and AMSR2 images are remapped to a 1 km EASE-Grid version 2, a Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) method is used to combine the AMSR2 and VIIRS SIC for a blended product at 1 km resolution under clear-sky conditions. Under cloudy-sky conditions the AMSR2 SIC with bias correction is used. For validation, high spatial resolution Landsat data are collocated with VIIRS and AMSR2 from 1 February 2017 to 31 October 2019. Bias, standard deviation, and root mean squared errors are calculated for the SICs of VIIRS, AMSR2, and the blended field. The blended SIC outperforms the individual VIIRS and AMSR2 SICs. The higher spatial resolution VIIRS data provide beneficial information to improve upon AMSR2 SIC under clear-sky conditions, especially during the summer melt season, as the AMSR2 SIC has a consistent negative bias near and above the melting point.

TI  - Environmental and Internal Controls on Lagrangian Transitions from Closed Cell Mesoscale Cellular Convection over Subtropical Oceans
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Classifications of mesoscale cellular convection (MCC) for marine boundary layer clouds are produced using a supervised neural network algorithm applied to MODIS daytime liquid water path data. The classifier, used in prior studies, distinguishes closed, open, and cellular but disorganized MCC. This work uses trajectories in four eastern subtropical ocean basins to compare meteorological variables and the structures of boundary layers for trajectories that begin as closed cells but evolve into either open cells or disorganized cells or remain closed cells over one afternoon-afternoon cycle. Results show contrasts between the trajectory sets: Trajectories for MCC that remain closed cells are more frequently observed nearer coasts, whereas trajectories that break into open and disorganized cells begin farther offshore. The frequency at which closed cells transition to open cells is seasonally invariant. The fraction of trajectories that stay as closed MCC varies throughout the year in opposition to those that break into disorganized cells, so that their annual cycles are 180 degrees out of phase. Trajectories remain as closed cell more frequently in austral spring and boreal summer when the trade inversion is stronger. The closed-disorganized MCC breakup is associated with weaker subsidence, a weaker inversion, a drier free troposphere, and enhanced nighttime boundary layer deepening, consistent with a warming-drying mechanism. The closed-open transition occurs in meteorological conditions similar to closed-closed trajectories. However, prior to the transition, the closed-open trajectories exhibit stronger surface winds and lower cloud droplet concentrations and rain more heavily overnight. Results suggest that multiple, independent mechanisms drive changes in cloud amount and morphology.

TI  - Remote Retrieval of Suspended Particulate Matter in Inland Waters: Image-Based or Physical Atmospheric Correction Models?
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper was to compare the limits of three image-based atmospheric correction models (top of the atmosphere (ToA), dark object subtraction (DOS), and cosine of the sun zenith angle (COST)), and three physical models (atmospheric correction for flat terrain (ATCOR), fast line-of-sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes (FLAASH)), and ACOLITE) for retrieving suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations in inland water bodies using Landsat imagery. For SPM concentration estimates, all possible combinations of 2-band normalized ratios (2b(NR)) were computed, and a stepwise regression was applied. The correlation analysis allowed highlighting that the red/blue 2b(NR) was the best spectral index to retrieve SPM concentrations in the case of image-based models, while the red/green 2bNR was the best in the case of physical models. Contrary to expectations, image-based atmospheric models outperformed the accuracy of physical models. The cross-validation results underlined the good performance of the DOS and COST models, with R-2 > 0.83, NASH-criterion (Nash) > 0.83, bias = -0.01 mg/L, and RMSE < 0.27 mg/L. This outperformance was confirmed using blind test validation data, with an R-2 > 0.86 and Nash > 0.58 for the DOS and COST models. The challenges and limitations involved in the remote monitoring of SPM spatial distribution in turbid productive waters using satellite data are discussed at the end of the paper.

TI  - Integrating Inland and Coastal Water Quality Data for Actionable Knowledge
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Water quality measures for inland and coastal waters are available as discrete samples from professional and volunteer water quality monitoring programs and higher-frequency, near-continuous data from automated in situ sensors. Water quality parameters also are estimated from model outputs and remote sensing. The integration of these data, via data assimilation, can result in a more holistic characterization of these highly dynamic ecosystems, and consequently improve water resource management. It is becoming common to see combinations of these data applied to answer relevant scientific questions. Yet, methods for scaling water quality data across regions and beyond, to provide actionable knowledge for stakeholders, have emerged only recently, particularly with the availability of satellite data now providing global coverage at high spatial resolution. In this paper, data sources and existing data integration frameworks are reviewed to give an overview of the present status and identify the gaps in existing frameworks. We propose an integration framework to provide information to user communities through the the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) AquaWatch Initiative. This aims to develop and build the global capacity and utility of water quality data, products, and information to support equitable and inclusive access for water resource management, policy and decision making.

TI  - Enhanced Estimation of Root Zone Soil Moisture at 1 km Resolution Using SMAR Model and MODIS-Based Downscaled AMSR2 Soil Moisture Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) is an essential variable for weather and hydrological prediction models. Satellite-based microwave observations have been frequently utilized for the estimation of surface soil moisture (SSM) at various spatio-temporal resolutions. Moreover, previous studies have shown that satellite-based SSM products, coupled with the soil moisture analytical relationship (SMAR) can estimate RZSM variations. However, satellite-based SSM products are of low-resolution, rendering the application of the above-mentioned approach for local and pointwise applications problematic. This study initially attempted to estimate SSM at a finer resolution (1 km) using a downscaling technique based on a linear equation between AMSR2 SM data (25 km) with three MODIS parameters (NDVI, LST, and Albedo); then used the downscaled SSM in the SMAR model to monitor the RZSM for Rafsanjan Plain (RP), Iran. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by measuring the soil moisture profile at ten stations in RP. The results of this study revealed that the downscaled AMSR2 SM data had a higher accuracy in relation to the ground-based SSM data in terms of MAE (down arrow 0.021), RMSE (down arrow 0.02), and R (up arrow 0.199) metrics. Moreover, the SMAR model was run using three different SSM input data with different spatial resolution: (a) ground-based SSM, (b) conventional AMSR2, and (c) downscaled AMSR2 products. The results showed that while the SMAR model itself was capable of estimating RZSM from the variation of ground-based SSM data, its performance increased when using downscaled SSM data suggesting the potential benefits of proposed method in different hydrological applications.

TI  - NIR-MID Reflectance and Emissivity Study at Different Temperatures of Sodium Carbonate Minerals: Spectra Characterization and Implication for Remote Sensing Identification
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent satellite observations and the deconvolution of remote sensing data have shown the existence of various carbonate minerals in different solar system bodies. Emissivity, from 403 to 803 K, and reflectance spectra at 300 and 193 K of selected carbonates minerals with different ratios of Na:Ca and water amounts were respectively collected at 3-20 mu m and at 1-16 mu m. All reflectance spectra show absorption features in the 1.9-2.5 and 3.4-4.0 mu m areas due to overtone and a combination of CO32- and fundamental vibrational models at approximate to 9.09, 11.35, 7.06, and 14.7 mu m. The increase of the Na:Ca ratio in anhydrous samples produces a shift of the absorption features in the 3.4-4.0 mu m area toward shorter wavelengths, and the peak at 3.9 mu m doubles in the presence of a CO32- oxygen group shared with two cations in minerals having more complex structures. The comparison of the bands at approximate to 669 and approximate to 794 cm(-1) in the emissivity spectra collected at high temperatures indicates that around 600 K, phase transitions occurred in natrite and thermonatrite. The reflectance spectra measured at 193 K reveal a fine structure compared to spectra collected at room temperature. The comparison of laboratory results with the spectrum of Ceres's brightest crater Occator from the Dawn mission, taken as a case study, showed how the anhydrous samples, shortite and nyerereite, studied in this work can also be hypothesized for Ceres's surface beyond that already suggested (trona, natrite, thermonatrite).

TI  - Dynamic Cosine Method for Normalizing Incidence Angle Effect on C-band Radar Backscattering Coefficient for Maize Canopies Based on NDVI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wide mode SAR images have an apparent incidence angle effect. The existing incident angle normalization methods assume that the relationship between the incident angle (theta) and the backscattering coefficient (sigma(PQ)) does not change with the growth stage of crops, which is in conflict with the real-life situation. Therefore, the normalization results of sigma(PQ) based on these existing methods will affect the accuracy of object classification, target recognition, and land surface parameter inversion. Here, the change in theta-sigma(PQ) relationship was investigated based on time-series (April to October) sigma(PQ) of maize canopies in northeast China, and a dynamic method based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was developed to normalize the effect of theta on sigma(PQ). Through the accuracy evaluation, the following conclusions are obtained: (1) the dependence (referring to N) of Sentinel 1 C-band sigma(PQ) on theta varies with maize NDVI. In addition, the value of N changed from 9.35 to 0.66 at VV polarization from bare soil to biomass peak, and from 6.26 to 0.99 at VH polarization; (2) a dynamic method was proposed to quantify the change of N based on its strong correlation with NDVI, indicated by R-2 of 0.82 and 0.80 for VV and VH polarization, respectively; and (3) the overall root mean square error of normalized sigma(PQ) based on the newly-developed dynamic method is 0.51 dB, and this accuracy outperforms the original first-order cosine method (1.37 dB) and cosine square law method (1.08 dB) by about 63% and 53% on the whole. This study provides a dynamic framework for normalizing radar backscatter coefficient, improving the retrieval accuracy of land surface parameters from radar remote sensing.

TI  - Assessing the Risk of Nodal Metastases in Canine Integumentary Mast Cell Tumors: Is Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Always Necessary?
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Mast cell tumor (MCT) is the most common integumentary neoplasm in dogs. The draining lymph node (LN) is the first site of histologically detectable metastasis, even if not clinically altered. The recent literature showed the discrepancy between the regional LN and the truly draining LN (the so-called sentinel lymph node-SLN) in dogs with integumentary MCT. However, the mapping and biopsy of SLN include additional anesthesiologic, diagnostic and surgical procedures, and additional cost. The study aimed to assess the possible association between clinicopathological variables and SLN status. Sixty-six cases of low-grade cutaneous and subcutaneous MCT in dogs admitted to the mapping and biopsy of SLN were included. An MCT dimension smaller than 3 cm seems to correlate less with occult or overt SLN metastasis, although further study should confirm the exclusion of cases with this variable to the mapping and biopsy of the SLN. In contrast, the high association of tumor >= 3 cm and subcutaneous MCT with overt SLN metastasis involves a solid suggestion for those procedures in the presence of one of these variables. The recent literature supports the sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in dogs with MCT due to discrepancy with the regional lymph node and the high percentage of occult metastasis. However, the SLN biopsy includes additional anesthesiologic, diagnostic, and surgical procedures, and additional costs. The study aimed to assess the association between clinicopathological variables and SLN status, determining the identification of dogs at lower risk of SLN metastases. Dogs with integumentary MCT were admitted to the lymphoscintigraphic mapping and subsequent biopsy of SLN. The association between clinicopathological variables of MCT and SLN status was statistically tested, both considering occult and overt metastasis together (HN2-HN3) and overt metastasis (HN3) alone. Fifty low-grade cutaneous MCT and 16 subcutaneous MCT were included. A small to moderate association between integumentary MCT >= 3 cm and HN2-HN3 SLN was found. A strong association of integumentary MCT dimension and subcutaneous MCT with HN3 SLN occurred. Dimension of low-grade cutaneous and subcutaneous MCT seems to correlate with SLN status, but additional study should confirm this data before excluding small MCT to the SLN biopsy. On the contrary, the study results induce a solid suggestion for mapping and biopsy of the SLN in MCT > 3 cm and subcutaneous MCT.

TI  - Retrospective evaluation of landslide susceptibility maps and review of validation practice
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite the widespread application of landslide susceptibility analyses, there is hardly any information about whether or not the occurrence of recent landslide events was correctly predicted by the relevant susceptibility maps. Hence, the objective of this study is to evaluate four landslide susceptibility maps retrospectively in a landslide-prone area of the Swabian Alb (Germany). The predictive performance of each susceptibility map is evaluated based on a landslide event triggered by heavy rainfalls in the year 2013. The retrospective evaluation revealed significant variations in the predictive accuracy of the analyzed studies. Both completely erroneous as well as very precise predictions were observed. These differences are less attributed to the applied statistical method and more to the quality and comprehensiveness of the used input data. Furthermore, a literature review of 50 peer-reviewed articles showed that most landslide susceptibility analyses achieve very high validation scores. 73% of the analyzed studies achieved an area under curve (AUC) value of at least 80%. These high validation scores, however, do not reflect the high uncertainty in statistical susceptibility analysis. Thus, the quality assessment of landslide susceptibility maps should not only comprise an index-based, quantitative validation, but also an additional qualitative plausibility check considering local geomorphological characteristics and local landslide mechanisms. Finally, the proposed retrospective evaluation approach cannot only help to assess the quality of susceptibility maps and demonstrate the reliability of such statistical methods, but also identify issues that will enable the susceptibility maps to be improved in the future.

TI  - Modeling °Brix and pH in Wine Grapes from Satellite Images in Colchagua Valley, Chile
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - To monitor the ripeness and composition of wine grape berries and establish an optimal harvest date, the determination of degrees Brix and pH is vital. This research studies two harvest seasons of Cabernet Sauvignon wine grapes: 2017 and 2018. Field data were periodically collected to follow the phenological state of the fruits. In parallel, eight bands and four spectral indices from Sentinel-2 image time series were used, which are directly related to the foliage properties and activity, and indirectly to the fruit evolution. They were related to the variables measured from field samples: degrees Brix and pH. The degrees Brix models obtained with the spectral indices presented an R-2 of 69% and 73% in the 2017 and 2018 seasons, respectively. In pH modeling, the 2017 season had low R-2 results, reaching 43%, improving considerably in the 2018 season, reaching 63.8%. Estimated Brix and pH maps were obtained, expressing the spatial variability in the evolution of the fruit, which is useful for zoning the plots and to improve the sampling task prior to harvest. They are therefore a valuable tool to monitor the maturation, to improve the efficiency of harvest and subsequently, the quality of the wine.

TI  - Spatial-temporal differentiation of mountain-water-forest-farmland-lake-grass system in Qinghai area of the Qilian Mountain National Park, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Higher and more precise requirements are critically needed for the protection, regulation, and restoration of ecological environment in the Qilian Mountain National Park after it is classified as a national park system pilot in China. Based on remote sensing data in 1980-2018, the spatial pattern map of mountain-water-forest-farmland-lake-grass system was constructed to analyze its spatial-temporal variations in the general control area and core conservation area in Qinghai area of the Qilian Mountain National Park. The results showed that grasslands, with an area of 8174.93 km(2), were the main landscape in the park, and that grassland area in the core conservation area was 1.2 times as that of the general control area. The bare exposed rocks, a major type of unused land, accounted for 86.7% and 79.4% of the unused land in the core conservation area and the general control area, respectively. Forest area in the general control area was larger than that in the core conservation area. Water area in the core conservation area was 4.9 times as large as that in the general control area, with 90.4% of which being dominated by permanent glaciers and snowfields. The drylands were mainly concentrated in the general control area. From 1980 to 2018, the water area was decreasing and had been reduced by 186.75 km(2). The area of permanent glaciers and snowfields decreased the most, with a drop of 12.05 and 175.88 km(2) in the general control area and the core conservation area, respectively. The area of forests and grasslands were enlarged constantly. The changes of high-, medium-, and low-coverage grasslands in the core conservation area were greater than that in the general control area, which were the most significant during 1990-2000. Moreover, the degradation of high- and medium-coverage grasslands in the general control area as well as high- and low-coverage grasslands in the core conservation area was observed from 1980 to 2018. The area of bare exposed rocks was on the rise, while the permanent glaciers and snowfields displayed a decreasing trend. The permanent glaciers and snowfields and the bare exposed rocks exhibited the most obvious changes in the park. The glaciers in the core conservation area retreated remarkably faster than those in the general control area, which were transformed into the bare exposed rocks mainly in 1980-1990 and 2000-2010.

TI  - Snow Cover Variability in the Greater Alpine Region in the MODIS Era (2000-2019)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is particularly important in the Alps for tourism and the production of hydroelectric energy. In this study, we investigate the spatiotemporal variability in three snow cover metrics, i.e., the length of season (LOS), start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS), obtained by gap-filling of MOD10A1 and MYD10A1, daily snow cover products of MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). We analyze the period 2000-2019, evaluate snow cover patterns in the greater Alpine region (GAR) as a whole and further subdivide it into four subregions based on geographical and climate divides to investigate the drivers of local variability. We found differences both in space and time, with the northeastern region having generally the highest LOS (74 +/- 4 days), compared to the southern regions, which exhibit a much shorter snow duration (48/49 +/- 2 days). Spatially, the variability in LOS and the other metrics is clearly related to elevation (r(2) = 0.85 for the LOS), while other topographic (slope, aspect and shading) and geographic variables (latitude and longitude) play a less important role at the MODIS scale. A high interannual variability was also observed from 2000 to 2019, as the average LOS in the GAR ranged between 41 and 85 days. As a result of high variability, no significant trends in snow cover metrics were seen over the GAR when considering all grid cells. Considering 500-m elevation bands and subregions, as well as individual grid points, we observed significant negative trends above 3000 m a.s.l., with an average of -17 days per decade. While some trends appeared to be caused by glacierized areas, removing grid cells covered by glaciers leads to an even higher frequency of grid cells with significant trends above 3000 m a.s.l., reaching 100% at 4000 m a.s.l. Trends are however to be considered with caution because of the limited length of the observation period.

TI  - Using Chemical Ecology to Enhance Weed Biological Control
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Signaling chemicals produced by one organism that bring about a behavioral response in a recipient organism are known as semiochemicals, with pheromones being a well-known example. Semiochemicals have been widely used to monitor and control insect pests in agricultural and forestry settings, but they have not been widely used in weed biological control. Here, we list the few examples of semiochemical use in the practice of classical weed biological control, where a natural enemy (biocontrol agent) from the native range of the plant is introduced into the new invaded range. Uses of semiochemicals include monitoring of biocontrol agents (sex pheromones), keeping biocontrol agents together long enough for them to become well established (aggregation pheromones) and repelling agents from areas where they may be unwanted (host or non-host plant volatile organic deterrents). We make the case that given the vast potential of biological control in suppressing invasive plants it is well worth developing and utilizing semiochemicals to enhance biocontrol programs. In agricultural systems, chemical ecology and the use of semiochemicals have become critical components of integrated pest management. The categories of semiochemicals that have been used include sex pheromones, aggregation pheromones, and plant volatile compounds used as attractants as well as repellents. In contrast, semiochemicals are rarely utilized for management of insects used in weed biological control. Here, we advocate for the benefit of chemical ecology principles in the implementation of weed biocontrol by describing successful utilization of semiochemicals for release, monitoring and manipulation of weed biocontrol agent populations. The potential for more widespread adoption and successful implementation of semiochemicals justifies multidisciplinary collaborations and increased research on how semiochemicals and chemical ecology can enhance weed biocontrol programs.

TI  - Vegetation responses to climate change in the Qilian Mountain Nature Reserve, Northwest China
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the dynamics of vegetation responses to climate change can provide important information for environmental management. The Qilian Mountain Nature Reserve in Northwest China, a high-altitude mountainous region that is of critical ecological importance, has been affected by drastic climate change. However, the response of vegetation to climate change in this area has not been established. This study aims to address three unanswered questions. First, what is the relative importance of temperature and precipitation change in driving regional vegetation change? Second, how does this vegetation-climate relationship manifest itself across different timescales (e.g., seasonal)? Third, what is the spatial heterogeneity of the vegetation-climate relationship? Based on MODIS data and daily meteorological data from 41 stations within and adjacent to the reserve, we used Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), Theil-Sen median trend analysis, the Mann-Kendall nonparametric test, and Pearson correlation analysis to study the evolution of temperature, precipitation, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The key results are as follows: (1) during 1985-2019, the temperature in the reserve has increased by an average of 0.048 degrees C/a, with the largest average annual increases occurring in spring (0.069 degrees C) and summer (0.056 degrees C); (2) during the same period, precipitation in the reserve increased by an average of 1.17 mm/a, with the largest annual increases occurring in autumn (0.669 mm) and summer (0.545 mm); (3) during 2001-2019, the NDVI increased by an average of 0.004/a; an average annual increase was experienced in all seasons, although the largest increase occurred in summer; (4) there is a statistically significant positive correlation (0.619) between the NDVI and temperature at the annual scale; (5) in contrast, the correlation between the NDVI and precipitation is weaker and not statistically significant (0.368), which indicates that temperature is the dominant factor affecting vegetation changes in the reserve; (6) there exist seasonal differences in the vegetation-climate relationship. The positive correlation between NDVI and temperature is strongest in spring whereas the positive correlation between NDVI and precipitation is strongest in summer; (7) the vegetation-climate relations demonstrate a degree of spatial heterogeneity driven by variability in climate factors and ecosystems. The value of this research is that it analyzes the response characteristics of vegetation to climate change using multiple methods and at multiple scales, providing a useful reference for understanding vegetation changes and their response to climate change in high-altitude mountain regions.

TI  - Scaling Analysis of the China France Oceanography Satellite Along-Track Wind and Wave Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbulence or turbulence-like phenomena are ubiquitous in nature, often showing a power-law behavior of the fluctuations in either spatial or temporal domains. This power-law behavior is due to interactions among different scales of motion, and to the absence of characteristic scale. In this work, we consider the multiscale dynamics of China France Oceanography SATellite (CFOSAT) data as atmospheric and oceanic quantities influenced by turbulence. Fourier power spectra were estimated for the data provided by the CFOSAT via the Wiener-Khinchine theorem to extract multiscale information for both wind speed (WS) and significant wave height (Hs). The WS data were collected from December 18, 2018 to August 31, 2020, and the Hs data from July 29, 2019 to August 31, 2020. Fourier power spectra for both WS and Hs exhibit power-law features in the ranges of 100-3,000 km with a scaling exponent beta varying from 5/3 to 3. The global distributions and seasonal variations of beta for both WS and Hs have also been considered. The results show that due to the energetic convective activities in the low-latitude zones, the scaling exponents beta in these regions are closer to the value of 5/3. Concerning the seasonal variations, for most regions, the scaling exponents in winter are larger than those in summer for WS. The seasonal variations of beta in low-latitudes are stronger than those in the mid-latitudes. Our preliminary results enrich the fundamental knowledge of ocean surface processes and also provide a benchmark for either oceanic or atmospheric models.

TI  - Application of SAR Data for Tropical Cyclone Intensity Parameters Retrieval and Symmetric Wind Field Model Development
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an effective tool to observe tropical cyclone (TC) wind fields at very high spatial resolutions. TC wind speeds can be retrieved from cross-polarization signals without wind direction inputs. This paper proposed methodologies to retrieve TC intensity parameters; for example, surface maximum wind speed, TC fullness (TCF) and central surface pressure from the European Space Agency Sentinel-1 Extra Wide swath mode cross-polarization data. First, the MS1A geophysical model function was modified from 6 to 69 m/s, based on three TC samples' SAR images and the collocated National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration stepped frequency microwave radiometer wind speed measurements. Second, we retrieved the wind fields and maximum wind speeds of 42 TC samples up to category 5 acquired in the last five years, using the modified MS1A model. Third, the TCF values and central surface pressures were calculated from the 1-km wind retrievals, according to the radial curve fitting of wind speeds and two hurricane wind-pressure models. Three intensity parameters were found to be dependent upon each other. Compared with the best-track data, the averaged bias, correlation coefficient (Cor) and root mean-square error (RMSE) of the SAR-retrieved maximum wind speeds were -3.91 m/s, 0.88 and 7.99 m/s respectively, showing a better result than the retrievals before modification. For central pressure, the averaged bias, Cor and RMSE were 1.17 mb, 0.77 and 21.29 mb and respectively, indicating the accuracy of the proposed methodology for pressure retrieval. Finally, a new symmetric TC wind field model was developed with the fitting function of the TCF values and maximum wind speeds, radial wind curve and the Rankine Vortex model. By this model, TC wind field can be simulated just using the maximum wind speed and the radius of maximum wind speed. Compared with wind retrievals, averaged absolute bias and averaged RMSE of all samples' wind fields simulated by the new model were smaller than those of the Rankine Vortex model.

TI  - Interrelationships of Sea Surface Salinity, Chlorophyll-<i>α</i> Concentration, and Sea Surface Temperature near the Antarctic Ice Edge
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data can now provide a coherent picture of sea surface salinity (SSS), chlorophyll-alpha concentration (Chl alpha), sea surface temperature (SST), and sea ice cover across the Southern Ocean. The availability of these data at the basin scale enables novel insight into the physical and biological processes in an area that has historically been difficult to gather in situ data from. The analysis shows large regional and interannual variability of these parameters but also strong coherence across the Southern Ocean. The covariability of the parameters near the marginal ice zone shows a generally negative relationship between SSS and Chl alpha (r = -0.87). This may in part be attributed to the large seasonality of the variables, but analysis of data within the spring period (from November to December) shows similarly high correlation (r = -0.81). This is the first time that a large-scale robust connection between low salinity and high phytoplankton concentration during ice melt period has been quantified. Chlorophyll-alpha concentration is also well correlated with SST (r = 0.79) providing a potential indicator of the strength of the temperature limitation on primary productivity in the region. The observed correlation also varied regionally due to differences in ice melt patterns during spring and summer. Overall, this study provides new insights into the physical characteristics of the Southern Ocean as observed from space. In a continually warming and freshening Southern Ocean, the relationships observed here provide a key data source for testing ocean biogeochemical models and assessing the effect of sea ice-ocean processes on primary production.

TI  - A Climatological Assessment of Intense Desert Dust Episodes over the Broader Mediterranean Basin Based on Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A satellite algorithm able to identify Dust Aerosols (DA) is applied for a climatological investigation of Dust Aerosol Episodes (DAEs) over the greater Mediterranean Basin (MB), one of the most climatologically sensitive regions of the globe. The algorithm first distinguishes DA among other aerosol types (such as Sea Salt and Biomass Burning) by applying threshold values on key aerosol optical properties describing their loading, size and absorptivity, namely Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Aerosol Index (AI) and angstrom ngstrom Exponent (alpha). The algorithm operates on a daily and 1 degrees x 1 degrees geographical cell basis over the 15-year period 2005-2019. Daily gridded spectral AOD data are taken from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua Collection 6.1, and are used to calculate the alpha data, which are then introduced into the algorithm, while AI data are obtained by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) -Aura- Near-UV aerosol product OMAERUV dataset. The algorithm determines the occurrence of Dust Aerosol Episode Days (DAEDs), whenever high loads of DA (higher than their climatological mean value plus two/four standard deviations for strong/extreme DAEDs) exist over extended areas (more than 30 pixels or 300,000 km(2)). The identified DAEDs are finally grouped into Dust Aerosol Episode Cases (DAECs), consisting of at least one DAED. According to the algorithm results, 166 (116 strong and 50 extreme) DAEDs occurred over the MB during the study period. DAEDs are observed mostly in spring (47%) and summer (38%), with strong DAEDs occurring primarily in spring and summer and extreme ones in spring. Decreasing, but not statistically significant, trends of the frequency, spatial extent and intensity of DAECs are revealed. Moreover, a total number of 98 DAECs was found, primarily in spring (46 DAECs) and secondarily in summer (36 DAECs). The seasonal distribution of the frequency of DAECs varies geographically, being highest in early spring over the eastern Mediterranean, in late spring over the central Mediterranean and in summer over the western MB.

TI  - GEOINFORMATICS FOR THE VISIBILITY OF URBAN AREAS IN THE AMAZON CITIES
T2  - REVISTA GEOARAGUAIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is a central element in the study of sustainable development scenarios for Amazon. However, it remains secondary in the plans and agendas for the region. This article presents an analysis of the urban extension detected in general mapping bases based on orbital remote sensing data for the year 2010. Six cities in the state of Para, with different socio-spatial and historical contexts, are the case of studies: Altamira, Cameta, Itaituba, Novo Progresso, Santarem, and Sao Felix do Xingu. We accessed seven general and global databases that mapped urbanized areas based on data compatible with Landsat imagery. From RapidEye images for 2011, we delineated spatial patterns of intra-urban occupation that were integrated into those mapping databases. An analysis of consistency and agreement between those bases and the spatial patterns was undertaken using a regular grid as an integration strategy. Intra-urban occupation patterns with medium and high densities showed agreement, on five or more bases, greater than 90% of the area included in these patterns. The greatest limitations were observed in the pattern with low occupancy density. In general, the analyzed bases allow an approximation of urbanization in the Amazon territory from the cities, although some specificities remain invisible.

TI  - A Spatio-Temporal Brightness Temperature Prediction Method for Forest Fire Detection with MODIS Data: A Case Study in San Diego
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Early detection of forest fire is helpful for monitoring the spread of fire promptly, minimizing the loss of forests, wild animals, human life, and economy. The performance of brightness temperature (BT) prediction determines the accuracy of fire detection. Great efforts have been made on BT prediction model building, but there still remains some uncertainty. Based on the widely used contextual BT prediction model (CM) and temporal-contextual BT prediction model (TCM), we proposed a spatio-temporal contextual BT prediction model (STCM), which involves historical images to contrast the BT correlation matrix between the pixel to be predicted and its background pixels within a dynamic window, and the spatial distance factor was introduced to modify the BT correlation matrix. We applied the STCM to a fire-prone area in San Diego, California, US, and compared it with CM and TCM. We found that the average RMSE of STCM was 12.54% and 9.12% lower than that of CM and TCM, and the standard deviation of RMSE calculated by STCM was reduced by 12.04% and 15.57% compared with CM and TCM, respectively. In addition, the bias of STCM was concentrated around zero and the range of bias of STCM was 88.7% and 15.3% lower than that of CM and TCM, respectively. The results demonstrated that the STCM can be used to obtain the highest BT prediction accuracy and most robust performance, followed by TCM, and CM performed worst. Our research on the BT prediction of potential fire pixels is helpful for improving the fire detection accuracy and is potentially useful for the prediction of other environmental variables with high spatial and temporal autocorrelation. However, the requirement of high-quality continuous data will limit the application of STCM in cloudy and rainy areas.

TI  - Limitation of Using Ultrasonography After Positive Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in a Patient with Melanoma in the Detection of Lymph Node Metastasis
T2  - YONAGO ACTA MEDICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have shown that complete lymph node dissection (CLND) performed immediately did not improve the overall survival in patients with sentinel lymph node (LN)-positive melanoma. According to these results, nodal observation with ultrasonography becomes standard. However, it still has some limitations for detection of metastatic LNs. A 74-year-old woman was diagnosed with acral lentiginous melanoma of her left sole. The sentinel LN was positive for metastasis, but she refused CLND. Sixteen months after operation, ultrasonography showed an abnormal LN in the inguinal region. There was no other abnormal LNs around the LN. We resected the abnormal LN. The resected LN was black in color, and the adjacent LN that showed normal appearance in ultrasonography was also black. A recent study showed only 6.6% sensitivity in preoperative ultrasonographic detection of metastatic melanoma in a LN. We should keep in mind the limitation of ultrasonography for detection of a metastatic LN.

TI  - Efficient Holographic Focusing Metasurface
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the design and experimental demonstration of an efficient holographic metasurface aperture that focuses microwaves in the Fresnel zone. The proposed circular structure consists of two stacked plates with their periphery terminated in a conductive layer. Microwaves are injected into the bottom plate, which forms the feed layer, and are coupled to the top holographic metasurface layer via an annular ring. This coupling results in an inward traveling cylindrical wave in the top layer, which serves as the reference wave for a hologram. The radiating elements consist of a slot pair with their orientations designed to couple efficiently with the cylindrical reference wave while maintaining a linearly polarized focused beam. A general condition on the slot pairs radiated power is proposed to ensure low sidelobe level (SLL) and is validated with full-wave simulation. An aperture that is 20 cm in diameter, operates at 20 GHz in the K-band frequency, and forms a diffraction-limited focal spot at a distance of 10 cm is experimentally demonstrated. The proposed near-field focusing metasurface has high antenna efficiency and can find application as a compact source for Fresnel-zone wireless power transfer and remote sensing schemes.

TI  - A framework for assessing the effects of shock events on livestock and environment in sub-Saharan Africa: The COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Kenya
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: Livestock are the primary source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture in most African countries, but there is a paucity of baseline data and monitoring of GHG emissions from livestock in Africa, particularly for extreme or shock events. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a novels shock to livestock systems and may result in indirect effects on livestock emissions and other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Due to the pandemic in 2020, extensive pastoralist livestock systems in Northern Kenya were subjected to restrictions on movement, increased costs of transportation, and closure of livestock markets. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on GHG emissions from livestock systems in Northern Kenya using proxy data and a three-part framework based on changes in 1) herd size, 2) feed availability, and 3) livestock movement. METHODS: We evaluated changes in GHG emissions from livestock systems in Northern Kenya due to the COVID19 pandemic based on proxy data from crowd-sourced market data, household panel surveys, and remote sensing data on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Proxy data were obtained before the pandemic in 2019 and after the pandemic in 2020 to compare between years and evaluate the indirect effects of the pandemic and associated restrictions on livestock GHG emissions using the three-part framework. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall GHG emissions from livestock in Northern Kenya have decreased due to the pandemic and this was largely driven by reductions in herd size. This reduction in GHG emissions occurred despite an increase in GHG emissions from livestock associated with higher feed availability. Decreased livestock movement due to the pandemic contributed to reductions in GHG emissions from livestock, but such reductions were likely to be small due to limited need for livestock to travel longer distances under the prevailing conditions of high feed availability. SIGNIFICANCE: This research shows that assessments of changes in GHG emissions from livestock systems due to shock events can be conducted successfully based on proxy data and the three-part framework developed here. We found that shock events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may lead to unexpected results with respect to the direction and magnitude of changes in livestock emissions depending on contextual factors and environmental conditions. Thus, we call for more spatially explicit and continued data collection to assess and monitor the consequences of shock events on GHG emissions from livestock and related SDGs in Africa.

TI  - Fine Particulate Matter and Age-Related Eye Disease: The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging
T2  - INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE. To determine the relationship between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ocular outcomes such as visual impairment and age-related eye disease.METHODS. Baseline data were used from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. The Comprehensive Cohort consisted of 30,097 adults ages 45 to 85 years. Annual mean PM2.5 levels (mu g/m(3)) for each participant's postal code were estimated from satellite data. Ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide levels were also estimated. Binocular presenting visual acuity was measured using a visual acuity chart. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured in millimeters of mercury using the Reichart Ocular Response Analyzer. Participants were asked about a diagnosis of glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataract. Logistic and linear regression models were used.RESULTS. The overall mean PM2.5 level was 6.5 mu g/m(3) (SD = 1.8). In the single pollutant models, increased PM2.5 levels (per interquartile range) were associated with visual impairment (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.24), glaucoma (OR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.29), and visually impairing age-related macular degeneration (OR = 1.52; 95% CI, 1.10-2.09) after adjustment for sociodemographics and disease. PM2.5 had a borderline adjusted association with cataract (OR = 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99-1.14). In the multi-pollutant models, increased PM2.5 was associated with glaucoma and IOP only after adjustment for sociodemographics and disease (OR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05-1.46 and beta = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.12-0.37).CONCLUSIONS. Increased PM2.5 is associated with glaucoma and IOP. These associations should be confirmed using longitudinal data and potential mechanisms should be explored. If confirmed, this work may have relevance for revision of World Health Organization thresholds to protect human health.

TI  - The Seasonality of VLF Attenuation Through the Ionosphere Verified by DEMETER Satellite
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We constructed a program, we call "Iriatten," to calculate using parameters from the International Reference Ionosphere, attenuation of Very Low Frequency (VLF) radiation transiting the ionosphere. The calculations are performed as function of latitude, longitude, year, month, day, and hour and based upon the quasi-longitudinal approximation put forth by Helliwell, where the wave vector k, is in the direction of propagation, and follows the Earth's magnetic field lines. The best values of various parameters are taken from the literature. Attenuation occurs through electron neutral collisions. In his seminal 1965 text, Helliwell presented atmospheric attenuation curves for day and night, 2 and 20 kHz, as a function of latitude. Program Iriatten is used to re-calculate Helliwell's curves and then to fully exercise access to seasonality. High power VLF transmitters are utilized as a reference signal and two physical models are used to represent them. In the Vertically Inclined model, the attenuation is assumed to occur "straight up" from the location of the VLF transmitter. In the Crary model waves are launched from a dipole source and ionospheric attenuation is applied where the wave is turned up in the Earth-ionospheric waveguide. Both representations reveal a seasonality that is unmistakable. Using the two models the ionospheric attenuation is calculated for four VLF transmitters and compared to observations by the DEMETER. Results from the Crary transmitter model more realistically portray seasonal variations exemplified by DEMETER satellite data. Crary model errors, which are within 11 dB, are lower than or comparable to Vertically Inclined errors.

TI  - The Detection of Active Sinkholes by Airborne Differential LiDAR DEMs and InSAR Cloud Computing Tools
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) cloud computing and the subtraction of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) are innovative approaches to detect subsidence in karst areas. InSAR cloud computing allows for analyzing C-band Envisat and Sentinel S1 SAR images through web platforms to produce displacement maps of the Earth's surface in an easy manner. The subtraction of serial LiDAR DEMs results in the same product but with a different level of accuracy and precision than InSAR maps. Here, we analyze the capability of these products to detect active sinkholes in the mantled evaporite karst of the Ebro Valley (NE Spain). We found that the capability of the displacement maps produced with open access, high-resolution airborne LiDAR DEMs was up to four times higher than InSAR displacement maps generated by the Geohazard Exploitation Platform (GEP). Differential LiDAR maps provide accurate information about the location, active sectors, maximum subsidence rate and growing trend of the most rapid and damaging sinkholes. Unfortunately, artifacts and the subsidence detection limit established at -4 cm/yr entailed important limitations in the precise mapping of the sinkhole edges and the detection of slow-moving sinkholes and small collapses. Although InSAR maps provided by GEP show a worse performance when identifying active sinkholes, in some cases they can serve as a complementary technique to overcome LiDAR limitations in urban areas.

TI  - A seasonal relationship between land surface temperature and normalized difference bareness index
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study analyzes the seasonal variability of the relationship between the land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference bareness index (NDBaI) on different land use/land cover (LULC) in Raipur City, India by using sixty-five Landsat images of four seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter) of 1991-1992, 1995-1996, 1999-2000, 2004-2005, 2009-2010, 2014-2015, and 2018-2019. The results show that the post-monsoon season indicates the best correlation (0.59), followed by the monsoon (0.56), pre-monsoon (0.47), and winter (0.44) season. The water bodies reflect a strongly positive correlation in all the four seasons (0.65 in pre-monsoon, 0.51 in monsoon, 0.53 in post-monsoon, and 0.62 in winter). On green vegetation, this correlation is also strongly positive in monsoon (0.57), post-monsoon (0.62), and winter (0.55), whereas it is moderate positive in pre-monsoon (0.37) season. The built-up area and bare land build a moderate positive correlation in all the four seasons (0.35 in pre-monsoon, 0.43 in monsoon, 0.48 in post-monsoon, and 0.39 in winter). Among the four seasons, the post-monsoon season builds the best correlation for all LULC types, whereas the pre-monsoon season has the least correlation. This research work is beneficial for land use and environmental planning of any city under similar climatic conditions.

TI  - Mechanism of Land Subsidence Mutation in Beijing Plain under the Background of Urban Expansion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the background of over-exploitation of groundwater and urban expansion, the land subsidence in the Beijing Plain has dramatically increased recently, and has demonstrated obvious mutation characteristics. Firstly, this paper used the land-use transfer matrix (LUTM) to quantify the urban expansion of Beijing, from 1990 to 2015. Secondly, the gravity center migration model (GCM) and standard deviation ellipse (SDE) methods were employed in order to quantitatively reveal the response relationship between urban expansion and land subsidence in the study area. Finally, the research innovatively combines multi-disciplinary (remote sensing, geophysical prospecting, spatial analysis, and hydrogeology), to analyze the mechanism of land subsidence mutation in the Beijing Plain, at multiple scales. The results showed the following: 1. The development direction of the urban expansion and the subsidence bowl (subsidence rate > 50 mm/year) were highly consistent, with values of 116.8 degrees and 113.3 degrees, respectively. 2. At the regional scale, the overall spatial distribution of subsidence mutations is controlled by the geological conditions, and the subsidence mutation time was mainly in 2005 and 2015. The area where mutation occurred in 2005 was basically located in the subsidence bowls, and the correlation between the confined water level and the subsidence rate was relatively high (r > 0.62). The area where the settlement mutation occurred in 2015, was mainly located outside the subsidence bowls, and the correlation between the confined water level and the subsidence rate was relatively low (r < 0.71). 3. In the typical subsidence area, the subsidence mutation occurred mostly in the places where the stratigraphic density is reduced, due to human activities (such as groundwater exploitation). Human activities caused the reduction in stratigraphic density, at 20 m and 90 m vertical depth in urban and rural areas, respectively. 4. At the local scale, clusters of subsidence mutation were located in the fault buffer zone, with a lateral influence range of nearly 1 km in Tongzhou. The scattered settlement mutation is distributed as a spot pattern, and the affected area is relatively small, which basically includes high-rise buildings.

TI  - MODIS NDVI Multi-Temporal Analysis Confirms Farmer Perceptions on Seasonality Variations Affecting Apple Orchards in Kinnaur, Himachal Pradesh
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Apple cultivation in the Kinnaur district of the northern Indian State of Himachal Pradesh faces challenges from climatic changes and developmental activities. Farmers in the neighboring districts have already faced a major loss of livelihood due to seasonal changes. Therefore, it is important to study the extent of seasonal variations in the apple growing locations of this region. This study makes that attempt by assessing seasonality variations during a 15-year period from 2004 to 2018 when maximum construction activities occurred in this region. The study uses geospatial and statistical techniques in addition to farmer perceptions obtained during a field visit in November 2019. A temporal pattern using a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was studied for seven apple-growing locations in the district. The results show high seasonal variations and reduced snowfall at lower elevations, resulting in less chilling hours, which are necessary for the healthy growth of apples. The normalized difference snow index (NDSI) and rainfall show a high correlation with apple growth. Local farmers are unprepared for future seasonal disturbances, as they lack early warning systems, insurance for apple crops, and alternative livelihood options.

TI  - Slow Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Southern Brazil Over a 6-Month Period: Report on 8 Sequential Statewide Serological Surveys Including 35 611 Participants
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To evaluate the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) over 6 months in the Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Sul (population 11.3 million), based on 8 serological surveys.Methods. In each survey, 4151 participants in round 1 and 4460 participants in round 2 were randomly sampled from all state regions. We assessed presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using a validated lateral flow point-of-care test; we adjusted figures for the time-dependent decay of antibodies.Results. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence increased from 0.03% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.00%, 0.34%; 1 in every 3333 individuals) in mid-April to 1.89%(95% Cl - 1.36%, 2.54%; 1 in every 53 individuals) in early September. Prevalence was similar across gender and skin color categories. Older adults were less likely to be infected than younger participants. The proportion of the population who reported leaving home daily increased from 21.4% (95% CI = 20.2%, 22.7%) to 33.2% (95% CI = 31.8%, 34.5%).Conclusions. SARS-CoV-2 infection increased slowly during the first 6 months in the state, differently from what was observed in other Brazilian regions. Future survey rounds will continue to document the spread of the pandemic.

TI  - Examining Cloud Macrophysical Changes over the Pacific for 2007-17 Using <i>CALIPSO</i>, <i>CloudSat</i>, and MODIS Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud macrophysical changes over the Pacific Ocean from 2007 to 2017 are examined by combining CALIPSO and CloudSat (CALCS) active-sensor measurements, and these are compared with MODIS passive-sensor observations. Both CALCS and MODIS capture well-known features of cloud changes over the Pacific associated with meteorological conditions during El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. For example, midcloud (cloud tops at 3-10 km) and high cloud (cloud tops at 10-18 km) amounts increase with relative humidity (RH) anomalies. However, a better correlation is obtained between CALCS cloud volume and RH anomalies, confirming more accurate CALCS cloud boundaries than MODIS. Both CALCS and MODIS show that low cloud (cloud tops at 0-3 km) amounts increase with EIS and decrease with SST over the eastern Pacific, consistent with earlier studies. It is also further shown that the low cloud amounts do not increase with positive EIS anomalies if SST anomalies are positive. While similar features are found between CALCS and MODIS low cloud anomalies, differences also exist. First, relative to CALCS, MODIS shows stronger anticorrelation between low and mid/high cloud anomalies over the central and western Pacific, which is largely due to the limitation in detecting overlapping clouds from passive MODIS measurements. Second, relative to CALCS, MODIS shows smaller impacts of mid- and high clouds on the low troposphere (<3 km). The differences are due to the underestimation of MODIS cloud layer thicknesses of mid- and high clouds.

TI  - Mapping Antebellum Rice Fields as a Basis for Understanding Human and Ecological Consequences of the Era of Slavery
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Model systems enlightened by history that provide understanding and inform contemporary and future landscapes are needed. Through transdisciplinary collaboration, historic rice fields of the southeastern United States can be such models, providing insight into how human-ecological systems work. Rice culture in the United States began in the 1670s; was primarily successfully developed, managed, and driven by the labor of enslaved persons; and ended with the U.S. Civil War. During this time, wetlands were transformed into highly managed farming systems that left behind a system of land use legacies when abandoned after slavery. Historically accepted estimates range from 29,950 to 60,703 ha; however, using remotely sensed data (e.g., LiDAR) and expert opinion, we mapped 95,551 ha of historic rice fields in South Carolina, USA. After mapping, the rice fields' current wetland and land cover characteristics were assessed. Understanding the geographic distribution and characteristics allows insight into the overall human and ecological costs of forced land use change that can inform future landscapes.

TI  - PET-CT for staging pT4b melanomas prior to sentinel lymph node biopsy: a 5-year review
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - In this centre, patients with pT4b cutaneous melanoma are staged using F-18-FDG PET-computed tomography (PET-CT) prior to considering sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The objective was to assess the utility of PET-CT in terms of rates of detection of metastases leading to changes in planned treatment and if performing PET-CT was associated with a delay in surgical management. In this single-centre retrospective cohort study, 88 consecutive patients with pT4b melanoma were identified from February 2014 to May 2019. Data were collected from clinical records. Of the 88 patients, 76 patients underwent PET-CT and 16/76 (21%) of these demonstrated metastatic/potentially metastatic disease. In total 16/76 (21%) patients had positive findings on PET-CT, and of these 14 (18%) had alterations to their clinical care. Performing PET-CT did not significantly delay time to wide local excision (PET-CT median 74 days (range 16-220) vs. no PET-CT median 55 days (range 36-143) P = 0.56) or SLNB (PET-CT median 67 days (range 16-206) vs. no PET-CT median 124 days (range 45-203) P = 0.66). Of the 29 patients undergoing SLNB who had negative PET-CT findings, 12/29 (41%) demonstrated microscopic metastatic disease. At the median follow-up of 1.75 years, 28 patients (34%) had died. Median survival was not reached. Performing staging PET-CT prior to SLNB in patients with pT4b melanoma can reveal metastases in over a fifth of patients, leading to alteration in management without treatment delay. Due to the low sensitivity of PET-CT for small metastases, SLNB remains important for definitive staging.

TI  - Surface Urban Heat Islands Dynamics in Response to LULC and Vegetation across South Asia (2000-2019)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is an increasing phenomenon around the world, causing many adverse effects in urban areas. Urban heat island is are of the most well-known phenomena. In the present study, surface urban heat islands (SUHI) were studied for seven megacities of the South Asian countries from 2000-2019. The urban thermal environment and relationship between land surface temperature (LST), land use landcover (LULC) and vegetation were examined. The connection was explored with remote-sensing indices such as urban thermal field variance (UTFVI), surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) and normal difference vegetation index (NDVI). LULC maps are classified using a CART machine learning classifier, and an accuracy table was generated. The LULC change matrix shows that the vegetated areas of all the cities decreased with an increase in the urban areas during the 20 years. The average LST in the rural areas is increasing compared to the urban core, and the difference is in the range of 1-2 (degrees C). The SUHII linear trend is increasing in Delhi, Karachi, Kathmandu, and Thimphu, while decreasing in Colombo, Dhaka, and Kabul from 2000-2019. UTFVI has shown the poor ecological conditions in all urban buffers due to high LST and urban infrastructures. In addition, a strong negative correlation between LST and NDVI can be seen in a range of -0.1 to -0.6.

TI  - Broadacre Crop Yield Estimation Using Imaging Spectroscopy from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS): A Field-Based Case Study with Snap Bean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate, precise, and timely estimation of crop yield is key to a grower's ability to proactively manage crop growth and predict harvest logistics. Such yield predictions typically are based on multi-parametric models and in-situ sampling. Here we investigate the extension of a greenhouse study, to low-altitude unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Our principal objective was to investigate snap bean crop (Phaseolus vulgaris) yield using imaging spectroscopy (hyperspectral imaging) in the visible to near-infrared (VNIR; 400-1000 nm) region via UAS. We aimed to solve the problem of crop yield modelling by identifying spectral features explaining yield and evaluating the best time period for accurate yield prediction, early in time. We introduced a Python library, named Jostar, for spectral feature selection. Embedded in Jostar, we proposed a new ranking method for selected features that reaches an agreement between multiple optimization models. Moreover, we implemented a well-known denoising algorithm for the spectral data used in this study. This study benefited from two years of remotely sensed data, captured at multiple instances over the summers of 2019 and 2020, with 24 plots and 18 plots, respectively. Two harvest stage models, early and late harvest, were assessed at two different locations in upstate New York, USA. Six varieties of snap bean were quantified using two components of yield, pod weight and seed length. We used two different vegetation detection algorithms. the Red-Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (RENDVI) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), to subset the fields into vegetation vs. non-vegetation pixels. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used as the regression model. Among nine different optimization models embedded in Jostar, we selected the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and their resulting joint ranking. The findings show that pod weight can be explained with a high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.78-0.93) and low root-mean-square error (RMSE = 940-1369 kg/ha) for two years of data. Seed length yield assessment resulted in higher accuracies (R2 = 0.83-0.98) and lower errors (RMSE = 4.245-6.018 mm). Among optimization models used, ACO and SA outperformed others and the SAM vegetation detection approach showed improved results when compared to the RENDVI approach when dense canopies were being examined. Wavelengths at 450, 500, 520, 650, 700, and 760 nm, were identified in almost all data sets and harvest stage models used. The period between 44-55 days after planting (DAP) the optimal time period for yield assessment. Future work should involve transferring the learned concepts to a multispectral system, for eventual operational use; further attention should also be paid to seed length as a ground truth data collection technique, since this yield indicator is far more rapid and straightforward.

TI  - Distributed Deep Learning for Remote Sensing Data Interpretation
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
M3  - Article
AB  - As a newly emerging technology, deep learning (DL) is a very promising field in big data applications. Remote sensing often involves huge data volumes obtained daily by numerous in-orbit satellites. This makes it a perfect target area for data-driven applications. Nowadays, technological advances in terms of software and hardware have a noticeable impact on Earth observation applications, more specifically in remote sensing techniques and procedures, allowing for the acquisition of data sets with greater quality at higher acquisition ratios. This results in the collection of huge amounts of remotely sensed data, characterized by their large spatial resolution (in terms of the number of pixels per scene), and very high spectral dimensionality, with hundreds or even thousands of spectral bands. As a result, remote sensing instruments on spaceborne and airborne platforms are now generating data cubes with extremely high dimensionality, imposing several restrictions in terms of both processing runtimes and storage capacity. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art in DL for remote sensing data interpretation, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the most widely used techniques in the literature, as well as an exhaustive description of their parallel and distributed implementations (with a particular focus on those conducted using cloud computing systems). We also provide quantitative results, offering an assessment of a DL technique in a specific case study (source code available: https://github.com/mhaut/cloud-dnn-HSI). This article concludes with some remarks and hints about future challenges in the application of DL techniques to distributed remote sensing data interpretation problems. We emphasize the role of the cloud in providing a powerful architecture that is now able to manage vast amounts of remotely sensed data due to its implementation simplicity, low cost, and high efficiency compared to other parallel and distributed architectures, such as grid computing or dedicated clusters.

TI  - How Do Two- and Three-Dimensional Urban Structures Impact Seasonal Land Surface Temperatures at Various Spatial Scales? A Case Study for the Northern Part of Brooklyn, New York, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the driving factors of urban land surface temperatures (U-LSTs) is critical in improving urban thermal environments and in supporting the sustainable development of cities. Previous studies have demonstrated that two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) urban structure parameters (USPs) largely influence seasonal U-LSTs. However, the effects of 2D and 3D USPs on seasonal U-LSTs at different spatial scales still await a general explanation. In this study, we used very-high-resolution remotely sensed data to investigate how 2D and 3D USPs impact seasonal U-LSTs at different spatial scales (including pixel and city block scales). In addition, the influences of various functional zones on U-LSTs were analyzed. The results show that, (1) generally, the links between USPs and U-LSTs at the city block scale were more obvious than those at the pixel scale, e.g., the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between U-LST and the mean building height at the city block scale (summer: r = -0.156) was higher than that at the pixel scale (summer: r = -0.081). Tree percentage yielded a considerable cooling effect on summer U-LSTs on both the pixel (r = -0.199) and city block (r = -0.369) scales, and the effect was more obvious in regions with tall trees. (2) The independently total explained variances (R-2) of 3D USPs on seasonal U-LSTs were considerably higher than those of 2D USPs in most urban functional zones (UFZs), suggesting the distinctive roles of 3D USPs in U-LST regulation at the local scale. Three-dimensional USPs (R-2 value = 0.66) yielded more decisive influences on summer U-LSTs than 2D USPs did (R-2 value = 0.48). (3) Manufacturing zones yielded the highest U-LST, followed by residential and commercial zones. Notably, it is found that the explained variances of the total study area for seasonal U-LSTs were significantly lower than those of each UFZ, suggesting the different roles of 2D and 3D USPs played in various UFZs and that it is critical to explain U-LST variations by using UFZs.

TI  - Aircraft Detection above Clouds by Sentinel-2 MSI Parallax
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of aircrafts in satellite images is a challenging problem when the background is strongly reflective clouds with varying transparency. We develop a fast and effective detection algorithm that can find almost all aircrafts above and between clouds in Sentinel-2 multispectral images. It exploits the time delay of a few seconds between the recorded multispectral images such that a moving aircraft is observed at different positions due to parallax effects. The aircraft speed, heading and altitude are also calculated accurately. Analysing images over the English Channel during fall 2020, we obtain a detection accuracy of 80%, where the most of the remaining were covered by clouds. We also analyse images in the 1.38 mu m water absorption band, where only 61% of the aircrafts are detected.

TI  - Reliable Crops Classification Using Limited Number of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study presents the analysis of the possible use of limited number of the Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 to check if crop declarations that the EU farmers submit to receive subsidies are true. The declarations used in the research were randomly divided into two independent sets (training and test). Based on the training set, supervised classification of both single images and their combinations was performed using random forest algorithm in SNAP (ESA) and our own Python scripts. A comparative accuracy analysis was performed on the basis of two forms of confusion matrix (full confusion matrix commonly used in remote sensing and binary confusion matrix used in machine learning) and various accuracy metrics (overall accuracy, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, etc.). The highest overall accuracy (81%) was obtained in the simultaneous classification of multitemporal images (three Sentinel-2 and one Sentinel-1). An unexpectedly high accuracy (79%) was achieved in the classification of one Sentinel-2 image at the end of May 2018. Noteworthy is the fact that the accuracy of the random forest method trained on the entire training set is equal 80% while using the sampling method ca. 50%. Based on the analysis of various accuracy metrics, it can be concluded that the metrics used in machine learning, for example: specificity and accuracy, are always higher then the overall accuracy. These metrics should be used with caution, because unlike the overall accuracy, to calculate these metrics, not only true positives but also false positives are used as positive results, giving the impression of higher accuracy. Correct calculation of overall accuracy values is essential for comparative analyzes. Reporting the mean accuracy value for the classes as overall accuracy gives a false impression of high accuracy. In our case, the difference was 10-16% for the validation data, and 25-45% for the test data.

AB  - With uninterrupted space-based data collection since 1972, Landsat plays a key role in systematic monitoring of the Earth's surface, enabled by an extensive and free, radiometrically consistent, global archive of imagery. Governments and international organizations rely on Landsat time series for monitoring and deriving a systematic understanding of the dynamics of the Earth's surface at a spatial scale relevant to management, scientific inquiry, and policy development. In this study, we identify trends in Landsat-informed change detection studies by surveying 50 years of published applications, processing, and change detection methods. Specifically, a representative database was created resulting in 490 relevant journal articles derived from the Web of Science and Scopus. From these articles, we provide a review of recent developments, opportunities, and trends in Landsat change detection studies. The impact of the Landsat free and open data policy in 2008 is evident in the literature as a turning point in the number and nature of change detection studies. Based upon the search terms used and articles included, average number of Landsat images used in studies increased from 10 images before 2008 to 100,000 images in 2020. The 2008 opening of the Landsat archive resulted in a marked increase in the number of images used per study, typically providing the basis for the other trends in evidence. These key trends include an increase in automated processing, use of analysis-ready data (especially those with atmospheric correction), and use of cloud computing platforms, all over increasing large areas. The nature of change methods has evolved from representative bi-temporal pairs to time series of images capturing dynamics and trends, capable of revealing both gradual and abrupt changes. The result also revealed a greater use of nonparametric classifiers for Landsat change detection analysis. Landsat-9, to be launched in September 2021, in combination with the continued operation of Landsat-8 and integration with Sentinel-2, enhances opportunities for improved monitoring of change over increasingly larger areas with greater intra- and interannual frequency.

AB  - The identification of Land Use and Vegetation Cover (LUVC) distribution is relevant for sustainable land management and planification of any territory. The aim of this study is to present the current spatial distribution of LUVC of the Municipality of Zapotitlan, Puebla, with a map on a scale of 1:50,000. We classified a Landsat-8 OLI satellite image using the random forest method, field verification data, and complemented the analysis with topographic and climatic variables. We obtained an overall accuracy of 68% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.63. We found that 79.7% of the area still holds natural vegetation cover, being the tetecho, Cephalocereus tetetzo, forest ("tetechera") the dominant class (21.2%). In 8.9% of the territory, people carry out agricultural activities and 10.1% correspond to bare soil. Much of the area still holds natural vegetation, however, the cartography of LUVC distribution in that geographical scale, will allow to analyze the modification or conversion processes, assess the impact of conservation actions, and guide actions for the sustainable management of natural vegetation cover.

TI  - Radio-echo sounding and waveform modeling reveal abundant marine ice in former rifts and basal crevasses within Crary Ice Rise, Antarctica
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Crary Ice Rise formed after the Ross Ice Shelf re-grounded similar to 1 kyr BP. We present new ice-penetrating radar data from two systems operating at center frequencies of 7 and 750 MHz that confirm the ice rise is composed of a former ice shelf buried by subsequent accumulation. Stacks of englacial diffraction hyperbolas are present almost everywhere across the central ice rise and extend up to similar to 350 m above the bed. In many cases, bed reflections beneath the diffraction hyperbolas are obscured for distances up to 1 km. Waveform modeling indicates that the diffraction hyperbolas are likely caused by marine ice deposits in former basal crevasses and rifts. The in-filling of rifts and basal crevasses may have strengthened the connection between the ice rise and the surrounding ice shelf, which could have influenced local and regional ice dynamics. Three internal reflection horizons mark the upper limit of disturbed ice and diffraction hyperbolas in different sections of the ice rise, indicating at least three stages of flow stabilization across the ice rise. A surface lineation visible in MODIS imagery corresponds spatially to deepening and strong deformation of these layers, consistent with the characteristics of former grounding lines observed elsewhere in Antarctica.

AB  - Data-driven decision making is the key to providing effective and efficient wildfire protection and sustainable use of natural resources. Due to the complexity of natural systems, management decision(s) require clear justification based on substantial amounts of information that are both accurate and precise at various spatial scales. To build information and incorporate it into decision making, new analytical frameworks are required that incorporate innovative computational, spatial, statistical, and machine-learning concepts with field data and expert knowledge in a manner that is easily digestible by natural resource managers and practitioners. We prototyped such an approach using function modeling and batch processing to describe wildfire risk and the condition and costs associated with implementing multiple prescriptions for risk mitigation in the Blue Mountains of Oregon, USA. Three key aspects of our approach included: (1) spatially quantifying existing fuel conditions using field plots and Sentinel 2 remotely sensed imagery; (2) spatially defining the desired future conditions with regards to fuel objectives; and (3) developing a cost/revenue assessment (CRA). Each of these components resulted in spatially explicit surfaces describing fuels, treatments, wildfire risk, costs of implementation, projected revenues associated with the removal of tree volume and biomass, and associated estimates of model error. From those spatially explicit surfaces, practitioners gain unique insights into tradeoffs among various described prescriptions and can further weigh those tradeoffs against financial and logistical constraints. These types of datasets, procedures, and comparisons provide managers with the information needed to identify, optimize, and justify prescriptions across the landscape.

TI  - Multi-sensor remote sensing to map glacier debris cover in the Greater Caucasus, Georgia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is causing glaciers in the Caucasus Mountains and around the world to lose mass at an accelerated pace. As a result of this rapid retreat, significant parts of the glacierized surface area can be covered with debris deposits, often making them indistinguishable from the surrounding land surface by optical remote-sensing systems. Here, we present the DebCovG-carto toolbox to delineate debris-covered and debris-free glacier surfaces from non-glacierized regions. The algorithm uses synthetic aperture radar-derived coherence images and the normalized difference snow index applied to optical satellite data. Validating the remotely-sensed boundaries of Ushba and Chalaati glaciers using field GPS data demonstrates that the use of pairs of Sentinel-1 images (2019) from identical ascending and descending orbits can substantially improve debris-covered glacier surface detection. The DebCovG-carto toolbox leverages multiple orbits to automate the mapping of debris-covered glacier surfaces. This new automatic method offers the possibility of quickly correcting glacier mapping errors caused by the presence of debris and makes automatic mapping of glacierized surfaces considerably faster than the use of other subjective methods.

TI  - Developing machine learning-based snow depletion curves and analysing their sensitivity over complex mountainous areas
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - A snow depletion curve (SDC), the relationship between snow mass (e.g., snow depth [SD]) and fractional snow cover area (SCF), is essential to parameterize the effect of snowpack within a physically based snow model. Existing SDCs are constructed using traditional statistic methods may not be applicable in complex mountainous areas. In this study, we developed an information fusion framework to define the relationship between SCF and SD as well as 12 auxiliary factors by using a traditional statistical method and four prevailing machine learning (ML) algorithms, which have comprehensively considered the variable conditions that cause spatiotemporal heterogeneity of snow cover. We also performed a single-dimensional sensitivity analysis to investigate the physical rationality of the newly developed SDCs. The Northern Xinjiang, Northwest China, is selected as the study area, and the data from 46 meteorological stations covering five snow seasons from 2010 to 2015 are used. The results illustrated that ML techniques can be used to establish high-accuracy and robust SDCs for complex mountainous areas. Compared with SDCs constructed by traditional statistical, the performance of the four ML-based SDCs is significantly improved, the RMSE values can be reduced by 50%, R-2 above 0.75, and an average relative variance close to 0. ML-based SDCs predicted SCF values showed a range of sensitivities to different input variables (e.g., Land surface temperature, aspect, longwave radiation and land cover type), in addition to SD, that were physically representative of effects that snow cover is sensitive to. Moreover, the complexity of SDCs can be reduced by removing insensitive input variables.

TI  - Improving Urban Land Cover Classification with Combined Use of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate land cover mapping is important for urban planning and management. Remote sensing data have been widely applied for urban land cover mapping. However, obtaining land cover classification via optical remote sensing data alone is difficult due to spectral confusion. To reduce the confusion between dark impervious surface and water, the Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Rader (SAR) data are synergistically combined with the Sentinel-2B Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data. The novel support vector machine with composite kernels (SVM-CK) approach, which can exploit the spatial information, is proposed to process the combination of Sentinel-2B MSI and Sentinel-1A SAR data. The classification based on the fusion of Sentinel-2B and Sentinel-1A data yields an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.12% with a kappa coefficient (KA) of 0.89, superior to the classification results using Sentinel-2B MSI imagery and Sentinel-1A SAR imagery separately. The results indicate that the inclusion of Sentinel-1A SAR data to Sentinel-2B MSI data can improve the classification performance by reducing the confusion between built-up area and water. This study shows that the land cover classification can be improved by fusing Sentinel-2B and Sentinel-1A imagery.

TI  - Long-Term Variation Assessment of Aerosol Load and Dominant Types over Asia for Air Quality Studies Using Multi-Sources Aerosol Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term (2000-2019) assessment of aerosol loads and dominant aerosol types at spatiotemporal scales using multi-source datasets can provide a strong impetus to the investigation of aerosol loads and to the targeted prevention control of atmospheric pollution in densely populated regions with frequent anthropogenic activities and heavy aerosol emissions. This study uses multi-source aerosol datasets, including Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), to conduct a long-term variation assessment of aerosol load, high aerosol load frequency, and dominant aerosol types over Asia. The results indicate that regional aerosol type information with adequate spatial resolution can be combined with aerosol optical depth (AOD) values and heavy aerosol load frequency characterization results to explore the key contributors to air pollution. During the study period, the aerosol load over the North China Plain, Central China, Yangtze River Delta, Red River Delta, Sichuan Basin, and Pearl River Delta exhibited an increasing trend from 2000-2009 due to a sharp rise in aerosol emissions with economic development and a declining trend from 2010-2019 under stricter energy conservation controls and emissions reductions. The growth of urban/industrial (UI) type and biomass burning (BB) type aerosol emissions hindered the improvement of the atmospheric environment. Therefore, in future pollution mitigation efforts, focus should be on the control of UI-type and BB-type aerosol emissions. The Indus-Ganges River Plain, Deccan Plateau, and Eastern Ghats show a continuously increasing trend; however, the aerosol load growth rate of the last decade was lower than that of the first decade, which was mainly due to the decrease in the proportion of the mixed type aerosols.

TI  - Space-Time Machine Learning Models to Analyze COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown Effects on Aerosol Optical Depth over Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent COVID-19 pandemic affected various aspects of life. Several studies established the consequences of pandemic lockdown on air quality using satellite remote sensing. However, such studies have limitations, including low spatial resolution or incomplete spatial coverage. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a machine learning-based scheme to solve the pre-mentioned limitations by training an optimized space-time extra trees model for each year of the study period. The results have shown that our trained models reach a prediction accuracy up to 95% when predicting the missing values in the MODIS MCD19A2 Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) product. The outcome of the mentioned scheme was a geo-harmonized atmospheric dataset for aerosol optical depth at 550 nm with 1 km spatial resolution and full coverage over Europe. As an application, we used the proposed machine learning based prediction approach in AOD levels analysis. We compared the mean AOD levels between the lockdown period from March to June in 2020 and the mean AOD values of the same period for the past 5 years. We found that AOD levels dropped over most European countries in 2020 but increased in several eastern and western countries. The Netherlands had the most significant average decrease in AOD levels (19%), while Spain had the highest average increase (10%). Moreover, we analyzed the relationship between the relative percentage difference of AOD and four meteorological variables. We found a positive correlation between AOD and relative humidity and a negative correlation between AOD and wind speed. The value of the proposed prediction scheme is further emphasized by taking into consideration that the reconstructed dataset can be used for future air quality studies concerning Europe.

TI  - SAR Imaging Distortions Induced by Topography: A Compact Analytical Formulation for Radiometric Calibration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging distortions induced by topography is addressed and a novel radiometric calibration method is proposed in this paper. An analytical formulation of the problem is primarily provided in purely geometrical terms, by adopting the theoretical notions of the differential geometry of surfaces. The novel and conceptually simple formulation relies on a cylindrical coordinate system, whose longitudinal axis corresponds to the sensor flight direction. A 3D representation of the terrain shape is then incorporated into the SAR imaging model by resorting to a suitable parametrization of the observed ground surface. Within this analytical framework, the area-stretching function quantitatively expresses in geometrical terms the inherent local radiometric distortions. This paper establishes its analytical expression in terms of the magnitude of the gradient of the look-angle function uniquely defined in the image domain, thus resulting in being mathematically concise and amenable to a straightforward implementation. The practical relevance of the formulation is also illustrated from a computational perspective, by elucidating its effective discrete implementation. In particular, an inverse cylindrical mapping approach is adopted, thus avoiding the drawback of pixel area fragmentation and integration required in forward-mapping-based approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed SAR radiometric calibration method is experimentally demonstrated by using COSMO-SkyMed SAR data acquired over a mountainous area in Italy.

TI  - Estimation of Urban Land-Use Efficiency for Sustainable Development by Integrating over 30-Year Landsat Imagery with Population Data: A Case Study of Ha Long, Vietnam
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Humans are moving into urban areas at an accelerated pace. An increasing urban population fuels urban expansion and reduces nearby agricultural lands and natural environments such as forests, swamps, other water-pervious areas. Unsustainable development creates a disproportion between the growth of urban areas and the growth in urban population. The UN SDG indicator 11.3.1 specifically addresses the issue of the measurement of land-use efficiency. While the metric and methodology to estimate the indicator are straightforward, it faces problems of data unavailability and inconsistency. Vietnam has a record of tremendous economic growth that has translated into more urban settlements of size. Consequently, rural population movement into urban areas has led to many urban sustainable planning and development challenges. In the absence of previous work on estimating land-use efficiency in Vietnamese cities, this study makes the first attempt to examine land-use efficiency in Ha Long, one of the country's fast-growing cities in recent decades. We mapped land use from high-resolution Landsat imagery (30 m) spanning multi-decadal observations from 1986 to 2020. An advanced machine learning approach, the Support Vector Machine algorithm, was applied to estimate the built-up area, which, by integration with census data, is essential for calculating SDG indicator 11.3.1. This study shows that the land-use efficiency metric was positive but small at the beginning of the considered period but increased in 2000-2020. These results suggest that before 2000, the urban land consumption rate in Ha Long was lower than the population growth rate, implying denser urban land use. The situation changed to the opposite when the urban land consumption rate exceeded the population growth rate in the past two decades. The study's approach is applicable to regional and district levels to provide comparative analyses between cities or parts of a region or districts of the city. These analyses are valuable tools for assessing the impact of local urban and municipal planning policies on urban development.

TI  - Evaluation of Low-Cost GNSS Receiver under Demanding Conditions in RTK Network Mode
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Positioning with low-cost GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receivers is becoming increasingly popular in many engineering applications. In particular, dual-frequency receivers, which receive signals of all available satellite systems, offer great possibilities. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the accuracy of a position determination using low-cost receivers in different terrain conditions. The u-blox ZED-F9P receiver was used for testing, with the satellite signal supplied by both a dedicated u-blox ANN-MB-00 low-cost patch antenna and the Leica AS10 high-precision geodetic one. A professional Leica GS18T geodetic receiver was used to acquire reference satellite data. In addition, on the prepared test base, observations were made using the Leica MS50 precise total station, which provided higher accuracy and stability of measurement than satellite positioning. As a result, it was concluded that the ZED-F9P receiver equipped with a patch antenna is only suitable for precision measurements in conditions with high availability of open sky. However, the configuration of this receiver with a geodetic-grade antenna significantly improves the quality of results, beating even professional geodetic equipment. In most cases of the partially obscured horizon, a high precision positioning was obtained, making the ZED-F9P a valuable alternative to the high-end geodetic receivers in many applications.

TI  - A Waveform-Encoded SAR Implementation Using a Limited Number of Cyclically Shifted Chirps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides high-resolution images of the Earth's surface irrespective of sunlight and weather conditions. In conventional spaceborne SAR, nadir echoes caused by the pulsed operation of SAR may significantly affect the SAR image quality. Therefore, the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is constrained within the SAR system design to avoid the appearance of nadir echoes in the SAR image. As an alternative, the waveform-encoded SAR concept using a pulse-to-pulse variation of the transmitted waveform and dual-focus postprocessing can be exploited for nadir echo removal and to alleviate the PRF constraints. In particular, cyclically shifted chirps have been proposed as a possible waveform variation scheme. However, a large number of distinct waveforms is required to enable the simple implementation of the concept. This work proposes a technique based on the Eulerian circuit for generating a waveform sequence starting from a reduced number of distinct cyclically shifted chirps that can be effectively exploited for waveform-encoded SAR. The nadir echo suppression performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed through simulations using real TerraSAR-X data and a realistic nadir echo model that shows how the number of distinct waveforms and therefore the system complexity can be reduced without significant performance loss. These developments reduce the calibration burden and make the concept viable for implementation in future SAR systems.

TI  - The Visible and Less-visible World: Social Ethnography in the Study of World Christianity
T2  - JOURNAL OF WORLD CHRISTIANITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the idea of religion as the cumulative experiences of an individual within a community, part of lived human existence, this article will argue that "World Christianity" needs to be understood as a social phenomenon deeply enmeshed in the emotional and intellectual encounters of humanity within which the "sacred" is located and experienced. Christian belief and its corresponding symbols are intimately linked to the worldly conditions and "lived-in-environments." Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork in South India, Ghana and England, this article will explore the place of sacred objects, images of the divine, and rituals, which are often treated with great reverence so as to extract power and to prevent misfortune in personal, social, and economic life. From a social ethnographic perspective, this article will shed light on the methodological challenges stemming from the fact that human beings are not neutral/passive observers but are rather active participants in shaping their notions of the "sacred."

TI  - Split-Attention Networks with Self-Calibrated Convolution for Moon Impact Crater Detection from Multi-Source Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impact craters are the most prominent features on the surface of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury. They play an essential role in constructing lunar bases, the dating of Mars and Mercury, and the surface exploration of other celestial bodies. The traditional crater detection algorithms (CDA) are mainly based on manual interpretation which is combined with classical image processing techniques. The traditional CDAs are, however, inefficient for detecting smaller or overlapped impact craters. In this paper, we propose a Split-Attention Networks with Self-Calibrated Convolution (SCNeSt) architecture, in which the channel-wise attention with multi-path representation and self-calibrated convolutions can generate more prosperous and more discriminative feature representations. The algorithm first extracts the crater feature model under the well-known target detection R-FCN network framework. The trained models are then applied to detecting the impact craters on Mercury and Mars using the transfer learning method. In the lunar impact crater detection experiment, we managed to extract a total of 157,389 impact craters with diameters between 0.6 and 860 km. Our proposed model outperforms the ResNet, ResNeXt, ScNet, and ResNeSt models in terms of recall rate and accuracy is more efficient than that other residual network models. Without training for Mars and Mercury remote sensing data, our model can also identify craters of different scales and demonstrates outstanding robustness and transferability.

TI  - Cloud Cover throughout All the Paddy Rice Fields in Guangdong, China: Impacts on Sentinel 2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI Optical Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud cover hinders the effective use of vegetation indices from optical satellite-acquired imagery in cloudy agricultural production areas, such as Guangdong, a subtropical province in southern China which supports two-season rice production. The number of cloud-free observations for the earth-orbiting optical satellite sensors must be determined to verify how much their observations are affected by clouds. This study determines the quantified wide-ranging impact of clouds on optical satellite observations by mapping the annual total observations (ATOs), annual cloud-free observations (ACFOs), monthly cloud-free observations (MCFOs) maps, and acquisition probability (AP) of ACFOs for the Sentinel 2 (2017-2019) and Landsat 8 (2014-2019) for all the paddy rice fields in Guangdong province (APRFG), China. The ATOs of Landsat 8 showed relatively stable observations compared to the Sentinel 2, and the per-field ACFOs of Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 were unevenly distributed. The MCFOs varied on a monthly basis, but in general, the MCFOs were greater between August and December than between January and July. Additionally, the AP of usable ACFOs with 52.1% (Landsat 8) and 47.7% (Sentinel 2) indicated that these two satellite sensors provided markedly restricted observation capability for rice in the study area. Our findings are particularly important and useful in the tropics and subtropics, and the analysis has described cloud cover frequency and pervasiveness throughout different portions of the rice growing season, providing insight into how rice monitoring activities by using Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 imagery in Guangdong would be impacted by cloud cover.

TI  - Non-invasive prediction of lymph node status for patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer based on a morphological feature from ultrasound images
T2  - QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study aimed to estimate the value of a morphological feature on ultrasound (US) for preoperative diagnosis of axillary lymph node (ALN) status in patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer (ESIBC).Methods: In this retrospective work, a total of 239 ESIBC patients, were recruited, and their preoperative US images and postoperative pathology results were collected. The relationship between US images based on morphological features and ALN metastasis was investigated. The tumor circularity and US-reported ALN status were developed as a nomogram to predict the ALN status.Results: Among the 239 participants, 82 (34.31%) had ALN metastasis, and 157 (65.69%) did not. There was a statistically significant difference in tumors between participants diagnosed with and without ALN metastasis. The median value was 0.47 vs. 0.62 (P<0.001) in the training group, respectively, and the value was 0.50 vs. 0.60 (P<0.001) in the validation group, respectively. The clinical model nomogram was shown to have high efficiency in predicting ALN status among our research population. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.89 in the training group and 0.90 in the validation group and the accuracy was 85.79% and 81.63%, respectively.Conclusions: The clinical model nomogram based on tumor circularity and US-reported ALN status is a non-invasive approach for ALN metastasis prediction in ESIBC patients with high efficacy.

TI  - A Forest Monitoring System for Tanzania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests provide essential ecosystem services related to human livelihoods. However, the distribution and condition of tropical forests are under significant pressure, causing shrinkage and risking biodiversity loss across the tropics. Tanzania is currently undergoing significant forest cover changes, but monitoring is limited, in part due to a lack of remote sensing knowledge, tools and methods. This study has demonstrated a comprehensive approach to creating a national-scale forest monitoring system using Earth Observation data to inform decision making, policy formulation, and combat biodiversity loss. A systematically wall-to-wall forest baseline was created for 2018 through the application of Landsat 8 imagery. The classification was developed using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine-learning algorithm, and achieved an accuracy of 89% and identified 45.76% of the country's area to be covered with forest. Of those forested areas, 45% was found within nationally protected areas. Utilising an innovative methodology based on a forest habitat suitability analysis, the forest baseline was classified into forest types, with an overall accuracy of 85%. Woodlands (open and closed) were found to make up 79% of Tanzania's forests. To map changes in forest extent, an automated system for downloading and processing of the Landsat imagery was used along with the XGBoost classifiers trained to define the national forest extent, where Landsat 8 scenes were individually downloaded and processed and the identified changes summarised on an annual basis. Forest loss identified for 2019 was found to be 157,204 hectares, with an overall accuracy of 82%. These forest losses within Tanzania have already triggered ecological problems and alterations in ecosystem types and species loss. Therefore, a forest monitoring system, such as the one presented in this study, will enhance conservation programmes and support efforts to save the last remnants of Tanzania's pristine forests.

TI  - Does conserving roadless wildland increase wildfire activity in western US national forests?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - National forests in the western United States are divided roughly in half between lands without roads managed for wilderness characteristics and lands with an extensive road system managed for multiple uses including resource extraction. We investigated the influence of these land use designations on fire ignitions, fire extent, and fire severity over the last three decades. Although roadless areas experienced fewer fire ignitions and are generally cooler, moister, and higher elevation landscapes less conducive to fire, wildfire extent was far greater in these areas than in roaded areas. An area equivalent to approximately one-third of roadless areas burned in the last three decades, while an area equivalent to less than one-fifth of roaded areas experienced fire. Most of the largest fires that have burned on national forest land in recent years began in roadless areas. Despite greater fire extent in roadless areas, there was no significant difference in fire severity between roadless areas and roaded areas after accounting for biophysical differences between these management regimes. Although fire patterns in roadless areas may pose challenges to land managers, the available evidence suggests that the greater extent of fire in roadless areas may confer resilience to these landscapes in the face of climate change.

TI  - A Systematic Review on the Application of Machine Learning in Exploiting Mineralogical Data in Mining and Mineral Industry
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Review
AB  - Machine learning is a subcategory of artificial intelligence, which aims to make computers capable of solving complex problems without being explicitly programmed. Availability of large datasets, development of effective algorithms, and access to the powerful computers have resulted in the unprecedented success of machine learning in recent years. This powerful tool has been employed in a plethora of science and engineering domains including mining and minerals industry. Considering the ever-increasing global demand for raw materials, complexities of the geological structure of ore deposits, and decreasing ore grade, high-quality and extensive mineralogical information is required. Comprehensive analyses of such invaluable information call for advanced and powerful techniques including machine learning. This paper presents a systematic review of the efforts that have been dedicated to the development of machine learning-based solutions for better utilizing mineralogical data in mining and mineral studies. To that end, we investigate the main reasons behind the superiority of machine learning in the relevant literature, machine learning algorithms that have been deployed, input data, concerned outputs, as well as the general trends in the subject area.

TI  - Comparison of Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 and spectral indices combinations for Google Earth Engine-based land use mapping in the Johor River Basin, Malaysia
T2  - GEOGRAFIA-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY & SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate land use information is the basis for scientific research related to carbon cycle analysis, hydro-climatic modelling, soil degradation assessment, etc. It is also an indispensable basic information for local land management departments in land use planning and management. With development in big data and internet network, Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based computing platform allows users to perform satellite images processing more efficiently. This study aims to improve the land use mapping in a tropical region based on the GEE platform. Seven satellite images and indices combinations include Landsat 8 (C1), Sentinel-2 (C2), Landsat 8+Sentinel-2 (C3), Landsat 8+Indices (C4), Sentinel-2+Indices (C5), Landsat 8+Sentinel-2+Indices (C6), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)+Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)+Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)+Elevation (C7) were developed to evaluate the best combination for land use mapping in the Johor River Basin (JRB), Malaysia. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used to classify the land use land cover (LULC) with 222 training samples and 78 verification samples obtained through the Google Earth Pro higher resolution satellite images and field samplings. The results show that the overall accuracies of all the seven combinations are mostly more than 75%, ranging from 72% (C1) to 86% (C6). The findings show that adding of additional indices information before the land use classification helps to increase the overall accuracy significantly. For instance, the overall accuracy of the C6 combination is 14% higher than that of the Landsat 8 image solely. This study can act as a reference to effectively improve the land use mapping in cloud-prone tropical regions.

TI  - Onset Altitudes of Co-Seismic Ionospheric Disturbances Determined by Multiple Distributions of GNSS TEC After the Foreshock of the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake on March 9, 2011
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate ionospheric disturbances using the total electron content (TEC) data obtained from the radio signals emitted from three satellites after the foreshock of the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake on March 9, 2011. Co-seismic ionospheric disturbances (CIDs) appeared to extend from an onset point concentrically in all of the satellite data. We have found, however, that the geographic coordinates of the onset points did not coincide if the observed CIDs were assumed to occur at one altitude. Admitting that the altitudes of the onset points are different, we searched for coinciding geographic coordinates of the onset points by changing the altitudes and identified the altitude of the three onset points to be 107.8, 131.8, and 133.3 km and the onset time at these altitudes. As a result, the vertical velocity of an acoustic-gravity wave is estimated to be 448 m/s from the travel time between the altitudes of 107.8 and 131.8 km and 370 m/s between the altitude of 107.8 and 133.3 km. This is comparable to the speed of sound calculated using the empirical model NRLMSISE-00. The present study provides a method of determining the altitude and geographic coordinates of the onset point from the ionospheric TEC analysis independently of the seismic data. Furthermore, the source location of the acoustic-gravity wave is simultaneously determined because its wavefront propagating vertically arrives earliest at an altitude that TEC disturbance is detectable.

TI  - THE STRUGGLE FOR CLASS RANKS AND PROSECUTOR'S DRESS DURING UKRAINIAN INDEPENDENCE: HISTORICAL, LEGAL, AND CULTURAL PERSPECTIVES
T2  - ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN EASTERN EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is devoted to the problem of confrontation between researchers about the dress of Ukrainian prosecutors and whether prosecutors should have class ranks (special ranks, equated to military ranks and providing bonuses to salaries). This confrontation has lasted for more than 10 years. Ukrainian MPs have proposed legislative amendments to solve this problem, but the approaches of the proposals are in opposition to each other.According to the Law of Ukraine 'On the Prosecutor's Office' of 19 September 2019, the Ukrainian Parliament, at the ninth convocation, completely abolished the class ranks and military-like dress of prosecutors. At the same time, a Draft Law on their restoration is being considered by the current session of the same parliament, and the initiators call their abolishment a 'premature mistake'. Regardless of the consequences of the consideration of this Draft Law, this issue may not be resolved in the near future in Ukraine, as it is an integral part of the worldview and culture of the pro-Western or Eurasian vector of the prosecutor's office.The aim of the present piece of legal scholarship is to provide a report that is as informative as possible on the consistency between class ranks, prosecutor's dress, and the principles of justice, the functions of the prosecutor, and his/her role in the justice system in comparison with the approaches of other states. Moreover, it is important to advise the legislative initiatives, and the voice of parliamentarians since this issue has gained traction in the professional environment and in society.The author analysed the issue of prosecutor's dress and class ranks in relation to various aspects - constitutional functions and roles of prosecutors, procedural law, comparative law, international law, incentive, as well as psychological, value-philosophical, cultural, and deontological aspects, etc.The prosecutor's dress code of the Council of Europe's 47 member states has been clarified; it was found that only prosecutors from Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia have the military dress; in other countries, prosecutors wore a robe or business suit. Periods of transformation of the prosecutor's office had taken place in all the post-Soviet republics as a part of their European integration processes - Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, as well as Georgia and Moldova, abandoned the military dress of prosecutors as associate members of the EU.The remuneration system of prosecutors in Poland and Germany is analysed in detail, where seniority, experience, qualifications, and position are taken into account in the 'rates' (Poland) or 'R levels' (Germany) of the basic salary of prosecutors. 'Rates' and 'R levels' are important only for calculating wages and are not analogous to class ranks.

TI  - Remote-sensing-based algorithms for water quality monitoring in Olushandja Dam, north-central Namibia
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent and continuous water quality monitoring of Olushandja Dam in Namibia is needed to inform timely decision making. This study was carried out from November 2014 to June 2015 with Landsat 8 reflectance values and field measured water quality data that were used to develop regression-analysis-based retrieval algorithms. Water quality parameters considered included turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), nitrates, ammonia, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and total algae counts. Results show that turbidity levels exceeded the recommended limits for raw water for potable water treatment while TN and TP values are within acceptable values. Turbidity, TN, and TP and total algae count showed a medium to strong positive linear relationship between Landsat predicted and measured water quality data while TSS showed a weak linear relationship. The regression coefficients between predicted and measured values were: turbidity (R-2 = 0.767); TN (R-2 = 0.798,); TP (R-2 = 0.907); TSS (R-2 = 0.284,) and total algae count (R-2 = 0.851). Prediction algorithms are generally the best fit to derive water quality parameters. Remote sensing is recommended for frequent and continuous monitoring of Olushandja Dam as it has the ability to provide rapid information on the spatio-temporal variability of surface water quality.

TI  - Time-Series of Cloud-Free Sentinel-2 NDVI Data Used in Mapping the Onset of Growth of Central Spitsbergen, Svalbard
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic is a region that is expected to experience a high increase in temperature. Changes in the timing of phenological phases, such as the onset of growth (as observed by remote sensing), is a sensitive bio-indicator of climate change. In this paper, the study area was the central part of Spitsbergen, Svalbard, located between 77.28 degrees N and 78.44 degrees N. The goals of this study were: (1) to prepare, analyze and present a cloud-free time-series of daily Sentinel-2 NDVI datasets for the 2016 to 2019 seasons, and (2) to demonstrate the use of the dataset in mapping the onset of growth. Due to a short and intense period with greening-up and frequent cloud cover, all the cloud-free Sentinel-2 data were used. The onset of growth was then mapped by a NDVI threshold method, which showed significant correlation (r(2) = 0.47, n = 38, p < 0.0001) with ground-based phenocam observation of the onset of growth in seven vegetation types. However, large bias was found between the Sentinel-2 NDVI-based mapped onset of growth and the phenocam-based onset of growth in a moss tundra, which indicates that the data in these vegetation types must be interpreted with care. In 2018, the onset of growth was about 10 days earlier compared to 2017.

TI  - William Wordsworth's Ethical Views in the Context of 18th Century English Moral Philosophy
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the moral views of the English romance of William Wordsworth that reflected in his poetic works. The author traces the continuity of Wordsworth's ethics with the moral philosophy of the eighteenth century, primarily with English ethical sentimentalism, and notes the closeness of the poet's views with the moral ideas of Shaftesbury. The closest points in the ethical concepts of Wordsworth and Shaftesbury are the idea of nature as a source of moral sense, the concept of the unity of all living things and the ensuing thought of love for humanity as a necessary condition for love for an individual person. To know the unity of nature and the integrity of humanity is possible only with the help of creative intuition and imagination, which both the romantic poet and the philosopher of the Enlightenment see as a necessary part of man's moral attitude to the world. The lack of emotional connection with the world deprives a person of the opportunity to distinguish good from evil and live a moral life. Both Wordsworth and Shaftesbury try to understand and explain the nature of evil, which is associated with the imperfection of the material world, the suffering and death of all living things. To explain evil, Shaftesbury uses aesthetic theodicy, describing the individual negative aspects of the universe as necessary components of world harmony. Wordsworth does not focus on natural evil and explains moral evil in man as an emotional falling away from world unity and, as a result, inability to love other living beings. Wordsworth and Shaftesbury consider the feeling of joy and pleasure that a person experiences when doing a good deed or observing moral manifestations in other people to be evidence of the innate and natural nature of morality. Many features in the ethical views of Wordsworth and Shaftesbury testify to the inclination of these thinkers to the pantheistic worldview and to philosophical concepts based on pantheism - Neo-Platonism, and, in the case of Wordsworth, to the teachings of Baruch Spinoza. The influence of Neo-Platonism is evidenced by the interpretation by these authors of the concept of love as a way of knowing the unity of the world and as an attraction of the soul to the beautiful, including moral beauty. Spinoza's influence on Wordsworth can be traced in his understanding of free will. Among thinkers who influenced Wordsworth in the field of ethical ideas, Immanuel Kant, who did not share the views of the eighteenth-century ethical sentimentalism, stands apart. In Kant's moral philosophy, the English poet was attracted by the idea of duty dictated by the categorical imperative - the voice of God in the human soul, and the idea of the inadmissibility of treating a person only as a means. In general, the analysis of the moral ideas that were reflected in Wordsworth's poetry speaks of the connection of this representative of romanticism with the traditions of the moral philosophy of the Enlightenment and in the first place with the teachings of Shaftesbury.

TI  - Effects of Climate Change on Vegetation Cover in the Oued Lahdar Watershed. Northeastern Morocco
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Episodes of drought that Morocco experienced in the years 1984-1986, 1993-1995, and 1997-2000 had repercussions that were felt many years later and continue to pose serious problems for environmentalists, as some of the affected lands have become practically deserted. These problems acted on the socio-economic conditions and created severe constraints for the development of the country. This work was conducted to study and identify changes that occurred in vegetation cover in the Oued Lahdar watershed (Rif, Morocco) between 1984 and 2017 using Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Landsat TM 5, and Landsat OLI 8. The LST had significantly increased overall from 1984 to 2017, where it moved from a mean value of 29.4 degrees C in 1984 to 40.4 degrees C in 2007 and then reduced slightly to 37.9 degrees C in 2017. The vegetation cover index for the study area indicates that in 1984, fully vegetated areas represented 94.3% before deteriorating to 35.4% in 2007 and recovering in 2017 to 54.3%. While bare soil, which previously constituted 5.7%, reached a very high value of 64.6% in 2007 and then decreased to 47.7%. This study contributes towards society as it provides interesting data about the consequences of climate change in the area studied as well as potential protective strategies to protect vegetation cover.

TI  - A brown wave of riparian woodland mortality following groundwater declines during the 2012-2019 California drought
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - As droughts become more frequent and more severe under anthropogenic climate change, water stress due to diminished subsurface supplies may threaten the health and function of semi-arid riparian woodlands, which are assumed to be largely groundwater dependent. To better support the management of riparian woodlands under changing climatic conditions, it is essential to understand the sensitivity of riparian woodlands to depth to groundwater (DTG) across space and time. In this study, we examined six stands of riparian woodland along 28 km of the Santa Clara River in southern California. Combining remote sensing data of fractional land cover, based on spectral mixture analysis, with historical groundwater data, we assessed changes in riparian woodland health in response to DTG during the unprecedented 2012-2019 California drought. We observed a coherent 'brown wave' of tree mortality, characterized by decreases in healthy vegetation cover and increases in dead/woody vegetation cover, which progressed downstream through the Santa Clara River corridor between 2012 and 2016. We also found consistent, significant relationships between DTG and healthy vegetation cover, and separately between DTG and dead/woody vegetation cover, indicating that woodland health deteriorated in a predictable fashion as the water table declined at different sites and different times. Based on these findings, we conclude that the brown wave of vegetation dieback was likely caused by local changes in DTG associated with the propagation of precipitation deficits into a depleted shallow alluvial aquifer. These factors suggest that semi-arid riparian woodlands are strongly dependent on shallow groundwater availability, which is in turn sensitive to climate forcing.

TI  - Phenological Classification Using Deep Learning and the Sentinel-2 Satellite to Identify Priority Afforestation Sites in North Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of forests to sequester carbon is considered an important strategy for mitigating climate change and achieving net zero emissions. However, forests in North Korea have continued to be cleared since the 1990s due to the lack of food and energy resources. Deforestation in this country has not been accurately classified nor consistently reported because of the characteristics of small patches. This study precisely determined the area of deforested land in North Korea through the vegetation phenological classification using high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning algorithms. Effective afforestation target sites in North Korea were identified with priority grade. The U-Net deep learning algorithm and time-series Sentinel-2 satellite images were applied to phenological classification; the results reflected the small patch-like characteristics of deforestation in North Korea. Based on the phenological classification, the land cover of the country was classified with an accuracy of 84.6%; this included 2.6 million ha of unstocked forest and reclaimed forest. Sites for afforestation were prioritized into five grades based on deforested characteristics, altitude and slope. Forest area is expanded and the forest ecosystem is restored through successful afforestation, this may improve the overall ecosystem services in North Korea. In the long term, it will be possible to contribute to carbon neutrality and greenhouse gas reduction on the Korean Peninsula level through optimal afforestation by using these outcomes.

TI  - An Efficient Structure of an Agrophotovoltaic System in a Temperate Climate Region
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify an efficient agrophotovoltaic (APV) system structure for generating electricity from solar radiation without causing an adverse impact on crop growth. In a temperate climate region, it is critical to design an APV system with appropriate structure with the maximum amount of electricity generation because, unlike in desert areas, strong solar radiation is only available for a few hours a day. In this study, APV systems with three different shading ratios (i.e., 32%, 25.6%, and 21.3%) were considered, and the optimum structure in terms of electricity efficiency and profitability was investigated via nonlinear programming. Moreover, an estimation model of electricity generation was developed via a polynomial regression model based on remote sensing data given by the APV system located at Jeollanamdo Agricultural Research and Extension Services in South Korea. To evaluate the impact of the APV on crop production, five different grain crops-sesame (Sesamum indicum), mung bean (Vigna radiata), red bean (Vigna angularis), corn (Zea mays), and soybean (Glycine max)-were cultivated in the system. As a result, the proposed optimization model successfully identified the best APV system structure without reducing existing crop production.

TI  - Linguistic discourse in gifted students' historical education
T2  - DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In Russian educational practice, there are not many studies devoted to the approach of linguistic discourse of gifted students' education from a historical point of view. The study considers giftedness as a complex system of abilities and analyzes approaches to the study of giftedness in accordance with the teaching of linguistic disciplines. Linguistics as a discipline studies various aspects of language and is closely related to the system of sciences, the study of which is necessary for the formation of students' giftedness and the level of their worldview. In the course of the study, both qualitative (the dynamics of changes in the proportion of students participating in additional educational programs for children in 2015-19 in relation to their total number) and quantitative (the dynamics of changes in the total number of students participating in additional educational programs for children in 2015-19 and thoroughly studying certain areas in 2019) were collected. The information was collected in the course of the research using content search in open educational databases of Moscow and the Moscow region. The results of the study show that the availability of various types of modern educational technologies increases the pedagogical capabilities of teachers to develop the abilities and talents of children, as well as contributes to the efficient knowledge assimilation and broadens the horizons of learners. The practical use of the research results involves the exchange of the experience related to the application of additional methods to study linguistics, history and social studies.

TI  - Analysis of TEC values predicted by OKSM amongst low, mid and high latitude GPS stations during X 9.3 solar flare
T2  - ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary descriptive quantity of the ionospheric regions of the Earth is the Total Electron Content (TEC). This value is affected by erratic solar events such as solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CME), which affect satellite signal communication. This paper aims to utilize the Ordinary Kriging-based Surrogate model (OKSM) to predict the TEC values for Low, Mid, and High- latitude GPS satellite signals receiving stations across the globe during X 9.3 solar flare that occurred on 6 September 2017. The GPS TEC values that are obtained from IONOLAB are down sampled into steps of 24 values per day for 10 days between 1 September 2017 to 10 September 2017. The relative solar parameters such as Sun Spot Number (SSN), F10.7, Kp, Ap, and Dst are considered for analyzing OKSM response. The effects of the solar flares on TEC values during these days were analyzed and validated with the TEC values from internationally acclaimed models like IRI 2016 and IRI PLAS 2017. It is found that the OKSM predicted better TEC values during extreme solar disturbance conditions when compared with its respective counterparts. The comparative results with the IRI-2016 and IRI PLAS-2017 model indicate that OKSM follows the same TEC. The performance indicator for the proposed model considered as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for low latitude Global Positioning System (GPS) station is estimated as 4.60 TECU. Similarly, the RMSE calculated for Mid and High latitude stations is computed as 1.55 and 1.29 TECU. It is evident from the results that OKSM values are closer to the original TEC values and precisely following the response of the solar flare days.

TI  - Lithological Mapping of the Ayhan Basin (Central Anatolia) and Geological Implications: An Integration of Remote Sensing and Field Surveys
T2  - TURKIYE JEOLOJI BULTENI-GEOLOGICAL BULLETIN OF TURKEY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex (CACC), consisting of metamorphic rocks, ophiolites, and magmatic intrusions, is the largest metamorphic complex in Turkey. It is also one of the key areas for reconstruction of the subduction zones, accommodating the Africa-Europe convergence since the Cretaceous in the Eastern Mediterranean.The Ayhan Basin, chosen as the study area, is a supra-detachment basin that developed on the CACC. It has basin infill with an age ranging from Paleocene to Quaternary, interrupted by angular unconformities, and is expected to contain the whole geological record of tectonic mechanisms which have affected the region from Paleocene to Recent times. Producing a well-defined lithological map showing the structural elements of the basin is very important to understand the geological evolution of the Ayhan Basin and also to determine the spatial and temporal effects of the triggering mechanisms which deform the CACC. For this purpose, optical satellite image (Landsat TM and ASTER) processing techniques (pan-sharpening, resampling, principal component analysis, decorrelation stretching, and band combination), which have a widespread application, were used in determination of the lineaments and lithological units, having different reflectance values. After this, detailed lithostratigraphy and geological mapping of the Ayhan Basin were created by field verification.Considering the reconstructed stratigraphy and the geological map of the Ayhan Basin based on field observation and remotely sensed data, it has a depositional system that starts with continental deposits before Lutetian, then continues with marine sediments during the Eocene, and again ends with continental deposits. When the deformation processes are evaluated based on the trigger mechanisms of the Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex's (CACC) evolution, the northern and southern part of the CACC show clearly different processes. Accordingly, the boundary of the impact zone of the subduction zones in the north and south of the CACC is located between the Cicekdag and Ayhan basins.

TI  - Weekly Mapping of Sea Ice Freeboard in the Ross Sea from ICESat-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - NASA's ICESat-2 has been providing sea ice freeboard measurements across the polar regions since October 2018. In spite of the outstanding spatial resolution and precision of ICESat-2, the spatial sparsity of the data can be a critical issue for sea ice monitoring. This study employs a geostatistical approach (i.e., ordinary kriging) to characterize the spatial autocorrelation of the ICESat-2 freeboard measurements (ATL10) to estimate weekly freeboard variations in 2019 for the entire Ross Sea area, including where ICESat-2 tracks are not directly available. Three variogram models (exponential, Gaussian, and spherical) are compared in this study. According to the cross-validation results, the kriging-estimated freeboards show correlation coefficients of 0.56-0.57, root mean square error (RMSE) of similar to 0.12 m, and mean absolute error (MAE) of similar to 0.07 m with the actual ATL10 freeboard measurements. In addition, the estimated errors of the kriging interpolation are low in autumn and high in winter to spring, and low in southern regions and high in northern regions of the Ross Sea. The effective ranges of the variograms are 5-10 km and the results from the three variogram models do not show significant differences with each other. The southwest (SW) sector of the Ross Sea shows low and consistent freeboard over the entire year because of the frequent opening of wide polynya areas generating new ice in this sector. However, the southeast (SE) sector shows large variations in freeboard, which demonstrates the advection of thick multiyear ice from the Amundsen Sea into the Ross Sea. Thus, this kriging-based interpolation of ICESat-2 freeboard can be used in the future to estimate accurate sea ice production over the Ross Sea by incorporating other remote sensing data.

T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We report the discovery of a compact, coplanar, quadruple-lined, eclipsing quadruple star system from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data, TIC 454140642, also known as TYC 0074-01254-1. The target was first detected in Sector 5 with a 30-minute cadence in full-frame images and then observed in Sector 32 with a 2-minute cadence. The light curve exhibits two sets of primary and secondary eclipses with periods of P ( A ) = 13.624 days (binary A) and P ( B ) = 10.393 days (binary B). Analysis of archival and follow-up data shows clear eclipse-timing variations and divergent radial velocities, indicating dynamical interactions between the two binaries and confirming that they form a gravitationally bound quadruple system with a 2 + 2 hierarchy. The Aa+Ab binary, Ba+Bb binary, and A-B system are aligned with respect to each other within a fraction of a degree: the respective mutual orbital inclinations are 0.degrees 25 (A versus B), 0.degrees 37 (A versus A-B), and 0.degrees 47 (B versus A-B). The A-B system has an orbital period of 432 days-the second shortest of the confirmed quadruple systems-and an orbital eccentricity of 0.3.

TI  - Hydro-Meteorological Trends in an Austrian Low-Mountain Catchment
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - While ongoing climate change is well documented, the impacts exhibit a substantial variability, both in direction and magnitude, visible even at regional and local scales. However, the knowledge of regional impacts is crucial for the design of mitigation and adaptation measures, particularly when changes in the hydrological cycle are concerned. In this paper, we present hydrometeorological trends based on observations from a hydrological research basin in Eastern Austria between 1979 and 2019. The analyzed variables include air temperature, precipitation, and catchment runoff. Additionally, the number of wet days, trends for catchment evapotranspiration, and computed potential evapotranspiration were derived. Long-term trends were computed using a non-parametric Mann-Kendall test. The analysis shows that while mean annual temperatures were decreasing and annual temperature minima remained constant, annual maxima were rising. Long-term trends indicate a shift of precipitation to the summer, with minor variations observed for the remaining seasons and at an annual scale. Observed precipitation intensities mainly increased in spring and summer between 1979 and 2019. Catchment actual evapotranspiration, computed based on catchment precipitation and outflow, showed no significant trend for the observed time period, while potential evapotranspiration rates based on remote sensing data increased between 1981 and 2019.

TI  - Sinkhole Scanner: A New Method to Detect Sinkhole-Related Spatio-Temporal Patterns in InSAR Deformation Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sinkholes are sudden disasters that are usually small in size and occur at unexpected locations. They may cause serious damage to life and property. Sinkhole-prone areas can be monitored using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series. Defining a pattern using InSAR-derived spatio-temporal deformations, this study presents a sinkhole pattern detector, called the Sinkhole Scanner. The Sinkhole Scanner includes a spatio-temporal mathematical model such as a 2-dimensional time evolving Gaussian function as a kernel, which moves over the study area using a sliding window approach. The scanner attempts to fit the model over deformation time series of Constantly Coherent Scatterers (CCS) intersected by the window and returns the posterior variance as a measure of goodness of fit. In this way, the scanner searches for subsiding regions resembling sinkhole shapes over a sinkhole prone area. It is designed to detect large sinkholes with a high efficiency, and small sinkholes with a lower efficiency. It is tested at four different spatial scales, and on a simulated and real set of deformation data. Real data were obtained from Sentinel-1A SLC data in IW mode, over Ireland where a large sinkhole occurred on 24 September 2018. The Sinkhole Scanner was able to identify a pattern of low posterior variance zones consistent with the simulated set. In case of the real data, it is able to identify significantly low posterior variance zones near the sinkhole area with the lowest value being 51.1% of the maximum value. The results from Sinkhole Scanner over the real sinkhole site were compared with Multiple Hypothesis Testing (MHT), which identifies Breakpoint and Heaviside temporal anomalies in the deformation time series of CCS. MHT was able to identify high likelihood for Heaviside anomalies in deformation time series of CCS near the sinkhole site about 10 epochs before the sinkhole occurrence. We show that the Sinkhole Scanner is efficient in monitoring a large area and search for sinkholes and that MHT can be used successively to identify temporal anomalies in the vicinity of areas detected by the Sinkhole Scanner. Future research may address other Sinkhole shapes whereas the underlying stochastic model may be adjusted. We conclude that the Sinkhole Scanner is important to be applied at different levels of scale to converge on potential sinkhole centers.

AB  - Commercial microwave link (MWL) used by mobile telecom operators for data transmission can provide hydro-meteorologically valid rainfall estimates according to studies in the past decade. For the first time, this study investigated a new method, the MSG technique, that uses Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite data to improve MWL rainfall estimates. The investigation, conducted during daytime, used MSG optical (VIS0.6) and near IR (NIR1.6) data to estimate rain areas along a 15 GHz, 9.88 km MWL for classifying the MWL signal into wet-dry periods and estimate the baseline level. Additionally, the MSG technique estimated a new parameter, wet path length, representing the length of the MWL that was wet during wet periods. Finally, MWL rainfall intensity estimates from this new MSG and conventional techniques were compared to rain gauge estimates. The results show that the MSG technique is robust and can estimate gauge comparable rainfall estimates. The evaluation scores every three hours of RMSD, relative bias, and r(2) based on the entire evaluation period results of the MSG technique were 2.61 mm h(-1), 0.47, and 0.81, compared to 2.09 mm h(-1), 0.04, and 0.84 of the conventional technique, respectively. For convective rain events with high intensity spatially varying rainfall, the results show that the MSG technique may approximate the actual mean rainfall estimates better than the conventional technique.

TI  - Delineation of Groundwater Potential Zone using Analytical Hierarchy Process
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the groundwater potential zone was demarcated and suitable site selection for the water storage structures was identified in the Deoria watershed of Jharkhand by using analytical hierarchy process. Thematic layers of lithology, geomorphology, soil, lineament, lineament density, slope, relief, aspects, drainage, drainage density, land use and land cover, and groundwater depth maps were created. The watershed falls under fourth-order river basin. A major portion of the basin is mainly dominated by lower order streams. Groundwater potential zones were categorized as very good, good, moderate, bad, and very bad. Only 9.37% of the total watershed area falls under a very good category. Twenty-eight suitable sites were recognized for constructing water harvesting structure in the Deoria watershed. The vast majority of the Deoria watersheds were observed to be appropriate for check dam. The watershed is characterized as having a reasonable land-use class (forest, river bed), slope (under 15%) and soil type (sandy loamy topsoil) which fills the need for soil and water conservation and groundwater expansion. The appropriateness of other water storage structures like nala bandh, farm pond and bore well were apportioned on the grounds. Remote sensing, satellite data, and GIS techniques provide a convenient approach for delineating the potential of groundwater zones which ultimately support the better planning and management of groundwater resources.

TI  - Western Missionaries in Modern China: From Ministers of Foreign Teachings to Agents of Imperialism?
T2  - HISTORY OF RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Western missionaries working for the proselytization of Christianity during the early twentieth century were predominantly representatives of a new worldview that put scientific objectives on a par with the aim of converting the Chinese to their faith. Conventional wisdom stipulates that the 1920s brought about a sea change in public attitudes, transforming the missionaries' perceived role in China, as well as in the colonized world, into "agents of imperialism." This article posits that this may well have been the case within the ranks of a radicalizing and ideologically reorienting intellectual elite. However, the majority of the population within the Republic of China held a variety of views, from deep-rooted suspicion ("Western clerics as alien magicians") to high esteem ("clerics as medical experts"). The May Fourth Movement's axiom of a monolithic, "patriotic," and "scientific" opposition to the Western missionaries thus needs to be replaced by a more nuanced interpretation.

TI  - Rainrate Estimation from FY-4A Cloud Top Temperature for Mesoscale Convective Systems by Using Machine Learning Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite rainrate estimation is a great challenge, especially in mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), which is mainly due to the absence of a direct physical connection between observable cloud parameters and surface rainrate. The machine learning technique was employed in this study to estimate rainrate in the MCS domain via using cloud top temperature (CTT) derived from a geostationary satellite. Five kinds of machine learning models were investigated, i.e., polynomial regression, support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, and multilayer perceptron, and the precipitation of Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH) was used as the reference. A total of 31 CTT related features were designed to be the potential inputs for training an algorithm, and they were all proved to have a positive contribution in modulating the algorithm. Random forest (RF) shows the best performance among the five kinds of models. By combining the classification and regression schemes of the RF model, an RF-based hybrid algorithm was proposed first to discriminate the rainy pixel and then estimate its rainrate. For the MCS samples considered in this study, such an algorithm generates the best estimation, and its accuracy is definitely higher than the operational precipitation product of FY-4A. These results demonstrate the promising feasibility of applying a machine learning technique to solve the satellite precipitation retrieval problem.

TI  - Urban Growth Derived from Landsat Time Series Using Harmonic Analysis: A Case Study in South England with High Levels of Cloud Cover
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate detection of spatial patterns of urban growth is crucial to the analysis of urban growth processes. A common practice is to use post-classification change analysis, overlaying multiple independently derived land cover layers. This approach is problematic as propagation of classification errors can lead to overestimation of change by an order of magnitude. This paper contributes to the growing literature on change classification using pixel-based time series analysis. In particular, we have developed a method that identifies change in the urban fabric at the pixel level based on breaks in the seasonal and year-on-year trend of the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). The method is applied to a case study area in the south of England that is characterised by high levels of cloud cover. The study uses the Landsat data archive over the period 1984-2018. The performance of the method was assessed using 500 ground truth points. These points were randomly selected and manually assessed for change using high-resolution earth observation imagery. The method identifies pixels where a land cover change occurred with a user's accuracy of change 45.3 +/- 4.45% and outperforms a post-classification analysis of an otherwise more advanced land cover product, which achieved a user's accuracy of 17.8 +/- 3.42%. This method performs better where changes exhibit large differences in NDVI dynamics amongst land cover types, such as the transition from agricultural to suburban, and less so where small differences of NDVI are observed, such as changes in land cover within pixels that are densely built up already. The method proved relatively robust for outliers and missing data, for example, in the case of high levels of cloud cover, but does rely on a period of data availability before and after the change event. Future developments to improve the method are to incorporate spectral information other than NDVI and to consider multiple change events per pixel over the analysed period.

TI  - Exploring the Use of PlanetScope Data for Particulate Matter Air Quality Research
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Planet, a commercial company, has achieved a key milestone by launching a large fleet of small satellites (smallsats) that provide high spatial resolution imagery of the entire Earth's surface on a daily basis with its PlanetScope sensors. Given the potential utility of these data, this study explores the use for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air quality applications. However, before these data can be utilized for air quality applications, key features of the data, including geolocation accuracy, calibration quality, and consistency in spectral signatures, need to be addressed. In this study, selected Dove-Classic PlanetScope data is screened for geolocation consistency. The spectral response of the Dove-Classic PlanetScope data is then compared to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over different land cover types, and under varying PM2.5 and mid visible aerosol optical depth (AOD) conditions. The data selected for this study was found to fall within Planet's reported geolocation accuracy of 10 m (between 3-4 pixels). In a comparison of top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance over a sample of different land cover types, the difference in reflectance between PlanetScope and MODIS ranged from near-zero (0.0014) to 0.117, with a mean difference in reflectance of 0.046 +/- 0.031 across all bands. The reflectance values from PlanetScope were higher than MODIS 78% of the time, although no significant relationship was found between surface PM2.5 or AOD and TOA reflectance for the cases that were studied. The results indicate that commercial satellite data have the potential to address Earth-environmental issues.

TI  - Sensor-Level Mosaic of Multistrip KOMPSAT-3 Level 1R Products
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application The proposed method can generate a mosaic image at the product level that is corrected only for radiometric and sensor distortions. High-resolution satellite images such as KOMPSAT-3 data provide detailed geospatial information over interest areas that are evenly located in an inaccessible area. The high-resolution satellite cameras are designed with a long focal length and a narrow field of view to increase spatial resolution. Thus, images show relatively narrow swath widths (10-15 km) compared to dozens or hundreds of kilometers in mid-/low-resolution satellite data. Therefore, users often face obstacles to orthorectify and mosaic a bundle of delivered images to create a complete image map. With a single mosaicked image at the sensor level delivered only with radiometric correction, users can process and manage simplified data more efficiently. Thus, we propose sensor-level mosaicking to generate a seamless image product with geometric accuracy to meet mapping requirements. Among adjacent image data with some overlaps, one image is the reference, whereas the others are projected using the sensor model information with shuttle radar topography mission. In the overlapped area, the geometric discrepancy between the data is modeled in spline along the image line based on image matching with outlier removals. The new sensor model information for the mosaicked image is generated by extending that of the reference image. Three strips of KOMPSAT-3 data were tested for the experiment. The data showed that irregular image discrepancies between the adjacent data were observed along the image line. This indicated that the proposed method successfully identified and removed these discrepancies. Additionally, sensor modeling information of the resulted mosaic could be improved by using the averaging effects of input data.

TI  - Daytime Cloud Detection Algorithm Based on a Multitemporal Dataset for GK-2A Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is an essential and important process in remote sensing when surface information is required for various fields. For this reason, we developed a daytime cloud detection algorithm for GEOstationary KOrea Multi-Purpose SATellite 2A (GEO-KOMPSAT-2A, GK-2A) imagery. For each pixel, the filtering technique using angular variance, which denotes the change in top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance over time, was applied, and filtering technique by using the minimum TOA reflectance was used to remove remaining cloud pixels. Furthermore, near-infrared (NIR) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images were applied with dynamic thresholds to improve the accuracy of the cloud detection results. The quantitative results showed that the overall accuracy of proposed cloud detection was 0.88 and 0.92 with Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), respectively, and indicated that the proposed algorithm has good performance in detecting clouds.

TI  - Evaluation of Air and Soil Temperatures for Determining the Onset of Growing Season
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - While air temperature has commonly been used to define the onset of the growing season (plant uptake of soil nutrients), there is evidence in the literature suggesting vegetation growth is sensitive to soil temperature. As soil temperature observations become increasingly available from monitoring networks, differences in the start of season (SOS) estimates based on both above and below-ground temperatures should be explored. In this study, air, surface, and soil (at depths of 5, 10, and 20 cm) temperature from the U.S. Climate Reference Network were used to estimate SOS at 104 stations across the U.S.. Temperature thresholds of 0, 5, or 10 degrees C were used to estimate the SOS as the earliest date of the year when temperatures remained above each threshold. SOS dates based on temperature were compared with MODIS-satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Results indicated that the day-of-year of SOS based on soil temperature occurred about two months earlier than SOS estimates from air and surface temperatures. Overall, 5 cm soil temperature SOS estimates using a 5 degrees C threshold matched well with SOSNDVI; albeit, only slightly better than air temperature SOS estimates using the 0 degrees C threshold. This was in part because air temperature conditions were more likely to dip back below a given threshold with the passage cold fronts than soil temperatures. This often resulted in later air temperature SOS estimates particularly in years with sub-freezing late season cold fronts. This suggests soil temperature can improve SOS estimates for many locations across the U.S.

TI  - Using satellite data to assess management frequency and rate of regeneration on heather moorlands in England as a resilience indicator
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatland resilience, defined here as the rate of recovery from perturbation, is crucial to our understanding of the impacts of climate change and land management on these unique ecosystems. Many peatland areas in the UK are managed as grouse moors using small burns (or increasingly, heather cutting) to encourage heather growth and limit fuel load. These small burns or cuts are distinct disturbance events which provide a useful means of assessing resilience. Until now, it has been difficult to monitor the area affected by management each season due to the remoteness and size of moorland sites. Newer satellite sensors such as those on Sentinel-2 are now collecting data at a spatial resolution that is fine enough to detect individual burns or cut areas, and at a temporal resolution which can be used to monitor occurrence and recovery each year. This study considered four areas of moorland; the North Pennines, Yorkshire Dales, North York Moors, and the Peak District. For each of these areas Sentinel-2 optical data was used to detect management areas using the dNBR (differenced Normalized Burn Ratio), and to monitor vegetation recovery using the NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index). Significant differences were found between the four selected sites in management repeat interval, with the North York Moors having the shortest repeat interval of 20 years on average (compared to 40-66 years across the other three study sites). Recovery times were found to be affected by burn size and severity, weather during the summer months, and altitude. This suggests that the interactions between peatland management and climate change may affect the future resilience of these areas, with hot, dry summers causing longer management recovery times.

TI  - Long-Term Land-Use/Land-Cover Change Increased the Landscape Heterogeneity of a Fragmented Temperate Forest in Mexico
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The temperate forests of northern Mexico possess a great diversity of unique and endemic species, with the greatest associations of pine-oak in the planet occurring within them. However, the ecosystems in this region had experienced an accelerated fragmentation process in the past decades. This study described and quantified the landscape fragmentation level of a degraded watershed located in this region. For that, data from the Landsat series from 1990, 2005 and 2017, classified with the Support Vector Machine method, were used. The landscape structure was analyzed based on six metrics applied at both, the landscape and class levels. Results show considerable gains in surface area for the land use land cover change (LULC) of secondary forest while the Primary Forest (PF) lost 18.1% of its area during 1990-2017. The PF increased its number of patches from 7075 to 12,318, increased its patch density (PD) from 53.51 to 58.46 # of patches/100 ha, and reduced its average patch size from 39.21 to 15.05 ha. This made the PF the most fragmented LULC from the 5 LULCs evaluated. In this study, strong fluctuations in edge density and PD were registered, which indicates the forests of northern Mexico have experienced a reduction in their productivity and have been subjected to a continuous degradation process due to disturbances such as fires, clandestine and non-properly controlled logging, among others.

TI  - Recent changes in cropland area and productivity indicate unsustainable cropland expansion in Malawi
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland expansion is a common strategy for boosting agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) even though it often leads to economic, environmental, and social trade-offs. Ensuring sustainable cropland use and their management is critical for improving food security and preserving ecosystem services. To develop policies and approaches that support sustainable cropland management at national and sub-national scales, there is a need to understand the spatial distribution of cropland expansion (/loss), and any resultant changes in cropland productivity. This is especially important in SSA countries such as Malawi, where spatially explicit assessments of changes in cropland area and cropland productivity are lacking. To address this gap in Malawi, we used multi-source satellite data and socio-economic data, combined with satellite image classification and trend analysis, firstly to quantify spatial changes in cropland area and productivity, and secondly to evaluate potentially available cropland for future expansion. We found evidence of unsustainable cropland use in Malawi, which was demonstrated by: (a) rapid cropland expansion between 2010 and 2019 (increase 8.5% of land area), characterized by an expansion of crop farming into upland areas which indicate increased land scarcity in Malawi; (b) limited potential for future expansion, as approximately only 5% of the total land remained as potentially available cropland (corresponding to 4671 000 ha); and (c) an overall reduction in cropland productivity and a prevalence of increase in soil erosion. Our findings underscore the urgent need for taking measures to promote sustainable cropland use, including by protecting current cropland from further degradation (e.g. Southern Malawi) and improving cropland use planning (e.g. Northern Malawi).

TI  - Improving Potato Yield Prediction by Combining Cultivar Information and UAV Remote Sensing Data Using Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate high-resolution yield maps are essential for identifying spatial yield variability patterns, determining key factors influencing yield variability, and providing site-specific management insights in precision agriculture. Cultivar differences can significantly influence potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber yield prediction using remote sensing technologies. The objective of this study was to improve potato yield prediction using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing by incorporating cultivar information with machine learning methods. Small plot experiments involving different cultivars and nitrogen (N) rates were conducted in 2018 and 2019. UAV-based multi-spectral images were collected throughout the growing season. Machine learning models, i.e., random forest regression (RFR) and support vector regression (SVR), were used to combine different vegetation indices with cultivar information. It was found that UAV-based spectral data from the early growing season at the tuber initiation stage (late June) were more correlated with potato marketable yield than the spectral data from the later growing season at the tuber maturation stage. However, the best performing vegetation indices and the best timing for potato yield prediction varied with cultivars. The performance of the RFR and SVR models using only remote sensing data was unsatisfactory (R-2 = 0.48-0.51 for validation) but was significantly improved when cultivar information was incorporated (R-2 = 0.75-0.79 for validation). It is concluded that combining high spatial-resolution UAV images and cultivar information using machine learning algorithms can significantly improve potato yield prediction than methods without using cultivar information. More studies are needed to improve potato yield prediction using more detailed cultivar information, soil and landscape variables, and management information, as well as more advanced machine learning models.

TI  - Understanding the Influence of Building Loads on Surface Settlement: A Case Study in the Central Business District of Beijing Combining Multi-Source Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In metropolitan areas, the static load of high-rise buildings may result in uneven settlement, which seriously threatens residents' living safety. Studying the response relationship between the additional stress of high-rise buildings and foundation settlement plays an important role in ensuring the safe development of metropolitan cities. Firstly, based on Persistent Scatterers Interferometric Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) technology, we used 68 descending TerraSAR-X images to obtain the surface settlement in the study area from April 2010 to October 2018, which were validated with leveling benchmark monitoring results. Secondly, we calculated the additional stress of the building loads to quantify its effect on the uneven settlement in the Central Business District (CBD) of Beijing. Finally, two sets of characteristic points were selected to analyze the response relationships between foundation settlement and additional stress generated by building loads. The findings show: (1) The surface settlement rate varied from -145.2 to 24 mm/year in the Beijing Plain. The InSAR results agree well with the monitoring results derived from the leveling benchmark; the Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.98 and 0.95 in 2011-2013 and 2015-2016, respectively. (2) The stress results show that the depth of the influence of the static load of high-rise buildings was 74.9 m underground in the CBD. (3) The spatial distribution pattern of the additional stress is consistent with the foundation settlement. A characteristic point with greater additional stress in the same group has a higher foundation settlement rate. This relationship has also been found between the uneven foundation settlement and additional stress gradients. These findings provide scientific support for mitigating economic losses due to foundation settlement caused by additional stresses derived from building loads.

TI  - Spatial distribution of human activity intensity in Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau Wetland scenic area: A case study of Lashihai watershed in Yunnan Province, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activity intensity is mostly used to quantify the degree of human influence on natural systems, with obvious spatial variability. With Lashihai watershed in Yunnan Province as an example, we used SPOT remote sensing images to update land use data, and obtained a comprehensive index of land use intensity after gridding by assigning weights to different land types, which was considered as the basic human activity intensity. The local tourism activities (horseback riding and boating) were also included. The horseback riding and boating were spatially quantified according to the location of horse farms and the abundance of horses and boats which were superimposed with the basic human activity intensity on the spatial scale of 100 mx100 m to obtain a more accurate comprehensive human activity intensity and to analyze the spatial variations. The results showed that the gridding and the kernel density analysis improved the accuracy of spatial analysis and reflected the spatial superposition and diffusion effects. In the comprehensive human activity intensity map of Lashihai watershed, the highest intensity value of water area was at the mouth of the sea, the lowest intensity value was at the center of the sea, and the overall trend of intensity gradually decreased from the surrounding to the middle. The land settlement had the highest intensity, the intensity value of the agricultural land gathering area was at the middle level, and the intensity of human activities in the forestry area of higher altitude was lower. The comprehensive human activity intensity in the water area of the Lashihai watershed varied most obviously, and differed greatly from the basic human activity intensity. Although there were many local characteristic tourism activities in Yunnan. Guizhou Plateau Wetland scenic area, but their land use types did not change. We need to take them into account when quantifying the intensity of human activities.

TI  - RS-MetaNet: Deep Metametric Learning for Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Y Training a modern deep neural network on massive labeled samples is the main paradigm in solving the scene classification problem for remote sensing, but learning from only a few data points remains a challenge. Existing methods for a few-shot remote sensing scene classification are performed in a sample-level manner, resulting in easy overfitting of learned features to individual samples and inadequate generalization of learned category segmentation surfaces. To solve this problem, learning should be organized at the task level rather than the sample level. Learning on tasks sampled from a task family can help tune learning algorithms to perform well on new tasks sampled in that family. Therefore, we propose a simple but effective method, called RS-MetaNet, to resolve the issues related to few-shot remote sensing scene classification in the real world. On the one hand, RS-MetaNet raises the level of learning from the sample to the task by organizing training in a metaway, and it learns to learn a metric space that can well classify remote sensing scenes from a series of tasks. We also propose a new loss function, called balance loss, which maximizes the generalization ability of the model to new samples by maximizing the distance between different categories, providing the scenes in different categories with better linear segmentation planes while ensuring model fit. The experimental results on three open and challenging remote sensing data sets, UCMerced_LandUse, NWPU-RESISC45, and Aerial Image Data, demonstrate that our proposed RS-MetaNet method achieves state-of-the-art results in cases where there are only 1 similar to 20 labeled samples.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Inversion and Mechanism Analysis of Surface Subsidence in Shanghai Area Based on Time-Series InSAR
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Abnormal surface subsidence has become a widespread geological problem being faced by cities. As a first-tier city in the world, there are problems such as unclear analysis of subsidence mechanism. Therefore, the monitoring of the Shanghai surface is particularly important. In this paper, the Sentinel-1A satellite SAR image data of 36 scenes covering Shanghai area from January 2018 to March 2020 were processed on the basis of time-series interferometry synthetic aperture radar technique. The subsidence rate field and accumulated surface subsidence in Shanghai area during the study period were obtained, and the spatial-temporal distribution characteristics of subsidence in the study area were discussed and analyzed from many different aspects. Moreover, the correlation between regional subsidence and geological structure, precipitation, urbanization, and other influencing factors were analyzed and established. Results show that the non-uniform subsidence in Shanghai area is clear, and those of the districts of eastern Songjiang, southern Jinshan, and Fengxian are more serious with a maximum subsidence rate of -26.2 mm/year. After analyzing the causes of subsidence, the special foundation of soft soil in Shanghai area is determined as the main reason for the subsidence, and the uneven subsidence is mainly caused by the over-exploitation of groundwater, human activities, and the subsidence of soil layer. Through comparative analysis, factors, such as rainfall, groundwater, and urbanization process, have high correlation with surface subsidence.

TI  - Vegetation Index Reconstruction and Linkage with Drought for the Source Region of the Yangtze River Based on Tree-ring Data
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in vegetation are closely related to climate change, but understanding of their characteristics and causes remains limited. As a typical semi-humid and semi-arid cold plateau region, it is important to understand the knowledge of long term Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) variations and find the potential causes in the source region of the Yangtze River. Based on four tree-ring width chronologies, the regional mean NDVI for July and August spanning the period 1665-2013 was reconstructed using a regression model, and it explained 43.9% of the total variance during the period 1981-2013. In decadal, the reconstructed NDVI showed eight growth stages (1754-1764, 1766-1783, 1794-1811, 1828-1838, 1843-1855, 1862-1873, 1897-1909, and 1932-1945) and four degradation stages (1679-1698, 1726-1753, 1910-1923, and 1988-2000). And based on wavelet analysis, significant cycles of 2-3 yr and 3-8 yr were identified. In additional, there was a significant positive correlation between the NDVI and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) during the past 349 yr, and they were mainly in phase. However, according to the results of correlation analysis between different grades of drought/wet and NDVI, there was significant asymmetry in extreme drought years and extreme wet years. In extreme drought years, NDVI was positively correlated with PDSI, and in extreme wet years they were negatively correlated.

TI  - Distributed Fusion of Heterogeneous Remote Sensing and Social Media Data: A Review and New Developments
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite the wide availability of remote sensing big data from numerous different Earth Observation (EO) instruments, the limitations in the spatial and temporal resolution of such EO sensors (as well as atmospheric opacity and other kinds of interferers) have led to many situations in which using only remote sensing data cannot fully meet the requirements of applications in which a (near) real-time response is needed. Examples of these applications include floods, earthquakes, and other kinds of natural disasters, such as typhoons. To address this issue, social media data have gradually been adopted to fill possible gaps in the analysis when remote sensing data are lacking or incomplete. In this case, the fusion of heterogeneous big data streams from multiple data sources introduces significant demands from a computational viewpoint. In order to meet these challenges, distributed computing is increasingly viewed as a feasible solution to parallelize the analysis of massive data coming from different sources (e.g., remote sensing and social media data). In this article, we provide an overview of available and new distributed strategies to address the computational challenges brought by massive heterogeneous data processing and fusion for real-time environmental monitoring and decision-making. The 2013 Boulder (Colorado) flood event is taken as a case study to evaluate several new distributed data fusion frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed distributed frameworks are suitable in terms of response time and computational requirements for fusing large-volume heterogeneous data sources.

TI  - Meteorological satellite stakeholder relationship network based on social network analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The meteorological satellite service range is extensive, and science and technology and related industries have become beneficiaries of it. The complex meteorological satellite stakeholder relationship warrants quantitative evaluation. This study investigates the meteorological satellite stakeholder relationship network to provide a new research perspective for meteorological satellites in the field of management. For literature analysis, 16 meteorological satellite stakeholders are identified through keyword screening, classified, and coded. A meteorological satellite stakeholder relationship network model is then constructed through social network analysis (SNA). Ego, local, and overall networks are analyzed from three perspectives to measure the network principle and to form a relationship network coordination degree evaluation system. The improved analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is then used to determine index weights and evaluate the relationship network coordination process design comprehensively. In empirical analysis, data for the meteorological satellite Fengyun-4 are obtained through questionnaire survey and literature analysis. Ucinet6 is used to generate relationship networks and analyze various stakeholder roles and status, stakeholder relationship network coordination degree, and evaluation results. The results demonstrate that the competent meteorological satellite department, the meteorological administration, the National Meteorological Centre, and the government are in the center of the Fengyun-4 stakeholder relationship network, with coordination degree in an "average" state. Thus, establishing a stakeholder coordination mechanism may strengthen connection and promote the development of meteorological undertakings.

TI  - LEO-Constellation-Augmented BDS Precise Orbit Determination Considering Spaceborne Observational Errors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The precise orbit determination (POD) accuracy of the Chinese BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) is still not comparable to that of the Global Positioning System because of the unfavorable geometry of the BDS and the uneven distribution of BDS ground monitoring stations. Fortunately, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, serving as fast moving stations, can efficiently improve BDS geometry. Nearly all studies on Global Navigation Satellite System POD enhancement using large LEO constellations are based on simulations and their results are usually overly optimistic. The receivers mounted on a spacecraft or an LEO satellite are usually different from geodetic receivers and the observation conditions in space are more challenging than those on the ground. The noise level of spaceborne observations needs to be carefully calibrated. Moreover, spaceborne observational errors caused by space weather events, i.e., solar geomagnetic storms, are usually ignored. Accordingly, in this study, the actual spaceborne observation noises are first analyzed and then used in subsequent observation simulations. Then, the observation residuals from the actual-processed LEO POD during a solar storm on 8 September 2017 are extracted and added to the simulated spaceborne observations. The effect of the observational errors on the BDS POD augmented with different LEO constellation configurations is analyzed. The results indicate that the noise levels from the Swarm-A, GRACE-A, and Sentinel-3A satellites are different and that the carrier-phase measurement noise ranges from 2 mm to 6 mm. Such different noise levels for LEO spaceborne observations cause considerable differences in the BDS POD solutions. Experiments calculating the augmented BDS POD for different LEO constellations considering spaceborne observational errors extracted from the solar storm indicate that these errors have a significant influence on the accuracy of the BDS POD. The 3D root mean squares of the BDS GEO, IGSO, and MEO satellite orbits are 1.30 m, 1.16 m, and 1.02 m, respectively, with a Walker 2/1/0 LEO constellation, and increase to 1.57 m, 1.72 m, and 1.32 m, respectively, with a Walker 12/3/1 constellation. When the number of LEO satellites increases to 60, the precision of the BDS POD improves significantly to 0.89 m, 0.77 m, and 0.69 m for the GEO, IGSO, and MEO satellites, respectively. While 12 satellites are sufficient to enhance the BDS POD to the sub-decimeter level, up to 60 satellites can effectively reduce the influence of large spaceborne observational errors, i.e., from solar storms.

TI  - Analysis of a Record-Breaking Rainfall Event Associated With a Monsoon Coastal Megacity of South China Using Multisource Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Y Monsoon coastal cities often suffer from extreme rain-induced flooding and severe hazard. However, the associated physical mechanisms and detailed storm structures are poorly understood due to the lack of high-resolution data. This study presents an analysis of a thunderstorm that produces extreme hourly rainfall (EXHR) of 219 mm over the Guangzhou megacity on the southern coast of China using integrated multiplatform observations and a four-dimensional variational Doppler radar analysis system. Results indicate that weak environmental flows and convectively generated weak cold pool facilitate the formation of a quasi-stationary storm, while onshore warm and moist flows in the boundary layer (BL) provide the needed moisture supply. The 219-mm EXHR is attendant by a shallow meso-gamma-scale vortex due to stretching of intense latent heating-induced convergence, which, in turn, helps organize convective updrafts into its core region. Lightning and dual-polarization radar observations reveal active warm-rain (but weak mixed-phase) microphysical processes, with raindrop size distribution (RSD) closer to marine convection. In contrast, another storm develops about 4 h earlier and only 35 km to the northwest, but with more lightning, higher cloud tops, more graupel and supercooled liquid water content, more continental RSD, little evidence of rotation, and much less rainfall; they are attributable to the presence of larger convective available potential energy resulting from the urban heat island effects and less moisture supply in the BL. These results highlight the importance of using multisource remote sensing data sets in understanding the microphysical and kinematic structures of EXHR-producing storms.

TI  - Assessment of Global FY-3C/VIRR Sea Surface Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) is a second-generation meteorological satellite of China that was launched on 23 September 2013. The on board Visible and Infrared Radiometer (VIRR) can be used to observe global sea surface temperature (SST). In this paper, the VIRR SST products are compared with MODIS SST products and buoy measurements from 2015 to 2019. The collocations of VIRR, MODIS, and buoy SST are generated separately during the day and night with the spatial window of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees. The comparison results show that the biases of VIRR SST minus buoy SST during the day and night are -0.21 and -0.13 degrees C with a corresponding robust standard deviation (RSD) of 0.58 and 0.59 degrees C, respectively. The mean differences between VIRR and MODIS are -0.10 and 0.08 degrees C with RSDs of 0.53 and 0.58 degrees C for the daytime and nighttime, respectively. The consistency of VIRR SST accuracy from 2015 to 2019 and the dependence of VIRR SST error on SST and latitude are also investigated.

TI  - A comprehensive assessment and analysis of Antarctic satellite grounding line products from 1992 to 2009
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present the results of a comprehensive assessment and analysis of five major Antarctic grounding line (GL) products from remote sensing data. The systematic assessment of this large amount of GL data was performed using a new two-step framework and implementation strategy, in which 84.4% of the product data were processed effectively by using a set of developed assessment metrics, with the remaining 15.6% handled by a comprehensive manual processing procedure aided by additional multisource data. The radar GL product shows a high quality (inconsistency of 0.3%) and is recommended for use wherever available. Meanwhile, the optical image GL products show a lower quality (inconsistency of 3-12%) but offer complete coverage, particularly in areas of weak tides. The GL analysis based on the assessed products (1992-2009) showed that 9.5% of the entire Antarctic GL were retreating or advancing, classified as a dynamic state. At the basin scale, the highest retreat rate was -1544 +/- 51 m a(-1) in Basin 22 (including Pine Island Glacier) and the highest advancement rate was 304 +/- 16 m a(-1) in Basin 14 (including Mertz Glacier). The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) showed the average GL change rates of -370 +/- 8 m a(-1) and 5 +/- 7 m a(-1), respectively, indicating that there was a clear trend of GL retreat in WAIS and a balanced to slightly advanced GL state in EAIS (except for the region around Totten).

TI  - An Adaptive Weighted Phase Optimization Algorithm Based on the Sigmoid Model for Distributed Scatterers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Distributed scatterers (DSs) have been widely used in the time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique, which compensates for the insufficient density of persistent scatterers (PSs) in nonurban areas. In contrast to PS, DS is vulnerable to temporal and geometric decorrelation effects. Thus, phase optimization processing for DS is essential for reliable deformation parameter estimation. Advanced research has revealed that the application of all possible interferometric pairs will be more conducive to the reduction in phase biases. However, the low-coherence pixels will inevitably increase the difficulty of phase optimization and introduce unpredictable negative effects, which will reduce the effect of phase optimization. Therefore, this study proposed an advanced adaptive weighted phase optimization algorithm (AWPOA). In the AWPOA, the adaptive weighting strategy based on the sigmoid model was first proposed to assign more reasonable weights to pixels of different quality, which can efficiently reduce the negative influence of low-coherence pixels and improve the optimization performance. Moreover, coherence bias correction based on the second-kind statistics and an efficient solution strategy based on eigenvalue decomposition were derived and applied to achieve optimal phase series retrieval. The experimental results validated against both simulated and two sets of TerraSAR-X data demonstrated the overall superiority of the AWPOA over traditional phase optimization algorithms (POAs). Specifically, the processing efficiency of the eigenvalue decomposition solution strategy used in AWPOA was nearly 20 times faster than that of the PTA iterative solution strategy under the case without bias correction. Although bias correction increased the processing time, the optimization effect was significantly improved. Moreover, in terms of the quantitative evaluation indexes with the residual and the sum of the phase difference, the mean value of the improvement percentage of the AWPOA was increased by more than 12%, and the standard deviation was reduced by more than 1% over the traditional POAs, indicating its superior optimization performance and noise robustness.

TI  - Understanding Urban Growth in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region over the Past 100 Years Using Old Maps and Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying urban expansion from a longer-term perspective is of great significance to obtain an in-depth understanding of the process of urbanization. Remote sensing data are mostly selected to investigate the long-term expansion of cities. In this study, we selected the world-class urban agglomeration of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) as the study area, and then discussed how to make full use of multi-source, multi-category, and multi-temporal spatial data (old maps and remote sensing images) to study long-term urbanization. Through this study, we addressed three questions: (1) How much has the urban area in BTH expanded in the past 100 years? (2) How did the urban area expand in the past century? (3) What factors or important historical events have changed the development of cities with different functions? By comprehensively using urban spatial data, such as old maps and remote sensing images, geo-referencing them, and extracting built-up area information, a long-term series of urban built-up areas in the BTH region can be obtained. Results show the following: (1) There was clear evidence of dramatic urban expansion in this area, and the total built-up area had increased by 55.585 times, from 126.181 km(2) to 7013.832 km(2). (2) Continuous outward expansion has always been the main trend, while the compactness of the built-up land within the city is constantly decreasing and the complexity of the city boundary is increasing. (3) Cities in BTH were mostly formed through the construction of city walls during the Ming and Qing dynasties, and the expansion process was mostly highly related to important political events, traffic development, and other factors. In summary, the BTH area, similarly to China and most regions of the world, has experienced rapid urbanization and the history of such ancient cities should be further preserved with the combined use of old maps.

TI  - Position Inversion of Goafs in Deep Coal Seams Based on DS-InSAR Data and the Probability Integral Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The goafs caused by coal mining cause great harm to the surface farmland, buildings, and personal safety. The existing monitoring methods cost a lot of workforce and material resources. Therefore, this paper proposes an inversion approach for establishing the locations of underground goafs and the parameters of the probability integral method (PIM), thus integrating distributed scatter interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DS-InSAR) data and the PIM. Firstly, a large amount of surface deformation observation data above the goaf are obtained by DS-InSAR, and the line-of-sight deformation is regarded as the true value. Secondly, according to the obtained surface deformations, the ranges of eight goaf location parameters and three PIM parameters are set. Thirdly, a correlation function between the surface deformation and the underground goaf location is constructed. Finally, a particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to search for the optimal parameters in the range of the set parameters to meet the requirement for minimum error between the surface deformation calculated by PIM and the line-of-sight deformation obtained by DS-InSAR. These optimal parameters are thus regarded as the real values of the position of the underground goaf and the PIM parameters. The simulation results show that the maximum relative error between the position of the goaf and the PIM parameters is 2.11%. Taking the 93,604 working face of the Zhangshuanglou coal mine in the Peibei mining area as the research object and 12 Sentinel-1A images as the data source, the goaf location and PIM parameters of the working face were successfully inverted. The inversion results show that the maximum relative error in the goaf location parameters was 16.61%, and the maximum relative error in the PIM parameters was 26.67%.

TI  - A Practical Remote Sensing Monitoring Framework for Late Frost Damage in Wine Grapes Using Multi-Source Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Late frost damage is one of the main meteorological disasters that affect the growth of wine grapes in spring, causing a decline in wine grapes quality and a reduction in yield in Northwest China. At present, remote sensing technology has been widely used in the field of crop meteorological disasters monitoring and loss assessments, but little research has been carried out on late frost damage in wine grapes. To monitor the impact of late frost in wine grapes accurately and quickly, in this research, we selected the Ningxia planting area as the study area. A practical framework of late frost damage on wine grapes by integrating visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared satellite data is proposed. This framework includes: (1) Wine grape planting area extraction using Gaofen-1 (GF-1), Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 based on optimal feature selection and Random Forest (RF) algorithm; (2) retrieval of the land surface temperature (LST) using Landsat-8 thermal infrared data; (3) data fusion using Landsat-8 LST and MODIS LST for a high spatiotemporal resolution of LST with the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM); (4) the estimation of daily minimum air temperature (T-min) using downscaled LST and meteorological station data; (5) monitoring and evaluation of the degree of late frost damage in wine grapes in April 2020 by combining satellite-derived data and late frost indicators. The results show that the total area of wine grapes extracted in Ningxia was about 39,837 ha. The overall accuracy was 90.47%, the producer's accuracy was 91.09%, and the user's accuracy was 90.22%. The root mean square (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-2) of the T-min estimation model were 1.67 celcius and 0.91, respectively. About 41.12% of the vineyards suffered severe late frost damage, and the total affected area was about 16,381 ha during April 20-25, 2020. This suggests the satellite data can accurately monitor late frost damage in wine grapes by mapping the wine grape area and estimating T-min. The results can help farmers to take remedial measures to reduce late frost damage in wine grapes, and provide an objective evaluation of late frost damage insurance claims for wine grapes. With the increasing weather extremes, this study has an important reference value for standardized global wine grape management and food security planning.

TI  - Urban Water Extraction with UAV High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data Based on an Improved U-Net Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining water body images quickly and reliably is important to guide human production activities and study urban change. This paper presents a fast and accurate method to identify water bodies in complex environments based on UAV high-resolution images. First, an improved U-Net (SU-Net) model is proposed in this paper. By increasing the number of connections in the middle layer of the neural network, more image features can be retained through S-shaped circular connections. Second, aiming at the interference of mixed ground objects and dark ground objects on water detection, the fusion of a deep learning network and visual features is investigated. We analyse the influence of a wavelet transform and grey level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) on water extraction. Using a confusion matrix to evaluate accuracy, the following conclusions are drawn: (1) Compared with existing methods, the SU-Net method achieves a significant improvement in accuracy, and the overall accuracy (OA) is 96.25%. The kappa coefficient (KC) is 0.952. (2) SU-Net combined with the GLCM has a higher accuracy (OA is 97.4%) and robustness in distinguishing mixed and dark objects. Based on this method, a distinct water boundary in urban areas, which provides data for urban water vector mapping, can be obtained.

TI  - SFRS-Net: A Cloud-Detection Method Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for GF-1 Remote-Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds constitute a major obstacle to the application of optical remote-sensing images as they destroy the continuity of the ground information in the images and reduce their utilization rate. Therefore, cloud detection has become an important preprocessing step for optical remote-sensing image applications. Due to the fact that the features of clouds in current cloud-detection methods are mostly manually interpreted and the information in remote-sensing images is complex, the accuracy and generalization of current cloud-detection methods are unsatisfactory. As cloud detection aims to extract cloud regions from the background, it can be regarded as a semantic segmentation problem. A cloud-detection method based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN)-that is, a spatial folding-unfolding remote-sensing network (SFRS-Net)-is introduced in the paper, and the reason for the inaccuracy of DCNN during cloud region segmentation and the concept of space folding/unfolding is presented. The backbone network of the proposed method adopts an encoder-decoder structure, in which the pooling operation in the encoder is replaced by a folding operation, and the upsampling operation in the decoder is replaced by an unfolding operation. As a result, the accuracy of cloud detection is improved, while the generalization is guaranteed. In the experiment, the multispectral data of the GaoFen-1 (GF-1) satellite is collected to form a dataset, and the overall accuracy (OA) of this method reaches 96.98%, which is a satisfactory result. This study aims to develop a method that is suitable for cloud detection and can complement other cloud-detection methods, providing a reference for researchers interested in cloud detection of remote-sensing images.

TI  - Hybridizing Cross-Level Contextual and Attentive Representations for Remote Sensing Imagery Semantic Segmentation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in intelligent interpretation. Since deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) performed considerable insight in learning implicit representations from data, numerous works in recent years have transferred the DCNN-based model to remote sensing data analysis. However, the wide-range observation areas, complex and diverse objects and illumination and imaging angle influence the pixels easily confused, leading to undesirable results. Therefore, a remote sensing imagery semantic segmentation neural network, named HCANet, is proposed to generate representative and discriminative representations for dense predictions. HCANet hybridizes cross-level contextual and attentive representations to emphasize the distinguishability of learned features. First of all, a cross-level contextual representation module (CCRM) is devised to exploit and harness the superpixel contextual information. Moreover, a hybrid representation enhancement module (HREM) is designed to fuse cross-level contextual and self-attentive representations flexibly. Furthermore, the decoder incorporates DUpsampling operation to boost the efficiency losslessly. The extensive experiments are implemented on the Vaihingen and Potsdam benchmarks. In addition, the results indicate that HCANet achieves excellent performance on overall accuracy and mean intersection over union. In addition, the ablation study further verifies the superiority of CCRM.

TI  - Earth Rotation Parameters Estimation Using GPS and SLR Measurements to Multiple LEO Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth rotation parameters (ERP) are one of the key parameters in realization of the International Terrestrial Reference Frames (ITRF). At present, the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) generates the satellite laser ranging (SLR)-based ERP products only using SLR observations to Laser Geodynamics Satellite (LAGEOS) and Etalon satellites. Apart from these geodetic satellites, many low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites of Earth observation missions are also equipped with laser retroreflector arrays, and produce a large number of SLR observations, which are only used for orbit validation. In this study, we focus on the contribution of multiple LEO satellites to ERP estimation. The SLR and Global Positioning System (GPS) observations of the current seven LEO satellites (Swarm-A/B/C, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)-C/D, and Sentinel-3A/B) are used. Several schemes are designed to investigate the impact of LEO orbit improvement, the ERP quality of the single-LEO solutions, and the contribution of multiple LEO combinations. We find that ERP estimation using an ambiguity-fixed orbit can attain a better result than that using ambiguity-float orbit. The introduction of an ambiguity-fixed orbit contributes to an accuracy improvement of 0.5%, 1.1% and 15% for X pole, Y pole and station coordinates, respectively. In the multiple LEO satellite solutions, the quality of ERP and station coordinates can be improved gradually with the increase in the involved LEO satellites. The accuracy of X pole, Y pole and length-of-day (LOD) is improved by 57.5%, 57.6% and 43.8%, respectively, when the LEO number increases from three to seven. Moreover, the combination of multiple LEO satellites is able to weaken the orbit-related signal existing in the single-LEO solution. We also investigate the combination of LEO satellites and LAGEOS satellites in the ERP estimation. Compared to the LAGEOS solution, the combination leads to an accuracy improvement of 0.6445 ms, 0.6288 ms and 0.0276 ms for X pole, Y pole and LOD, respectively. In addition, we explore the feasibility of a one-step method, in which ERP and the orbit parameters are jointly determined, based on SLR and GPS observations, and present a detailed comparison between the one-step solution and two-step solution.

TI  - Measuring Ocean Surface Current in the Kuroshio Region Using Gaofen-3 SAR Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kuroshio is the strongest warm current in the western North Pacific, which plays a crucial role in climate and human activities. In terms of this, the accurate acquisition of ocean surface current velocity and direction in the Kuroshio region is of great research value. Gaofen-3 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides data support for the study of ocean surface current measurements in the Kuroshio region, but no relevant experimental result has been published yet. In this paper, four available stripmap mode SARs' data acquired by Gaofen-3 in the Kuroshio region are used for measuring the ocean surface current field. In general, the Doppler centroid anomaly (DCA) estimation is a common method to infer ocean surface currents from single-antenna stripmap data, but only the radial velocity component can be retrieved. In order to measure current vectors, a novel method combining the sub-aperture processing and the least squares (LS) technology is suggested and demonstrated by applying to the Gaofen-3 SAR data processing. The experiment's results agree well with model-derived ocean current data, indicating that the Gaofen-3 SAR has the capability to accurately retrieve the ocean surface current field in the Kuroshio region and motivate further research by providing more data.

TI  - Evaluation of All-Sky Assimilation of FY-3C/MWHS-2 on Mei-yu Precipitation Forecasts over the Yangtze-Huaihe River Basin
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - All-sky (i.e., clear, cloudy, and precipitating conditions) assimilation of microwave observations shows potentially positive impacts on the improvement of the forecasts of cloud-associated weather processes. In this study, a typical mei-yu heavy precipitation event that occurred in 2017 was investigated, and the Weather Research and Forecasting data assimilation (WRFDA) as well as its 3D-Var assimilation scheme (excluding cloud and precipitation control variables) were applied to assimilate the Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) Microwave Humidity Sounder-2 (MWHS-2) observations under clear-sky (excluding the observations that are strongly affected by ice clouds and precipitation) and all-sky conditions. Three experiments including a control experiment without assimilating any observations, clear-sky, and all-sky experiments with only FY-3C/MWHS-2 observations assimilated were carried out. The results show that the all-sky assimilation approach that provides more cloud and precipitation information and increased more than 10% of the satellite data usage than the clear-sky experiment. Meanwhile, as compared with the control experiment, the all-sky assimilation reduced nearly 0.5% of the root mean square errors in the humidity fields, leading to more accurate forecast performances regarding the distribution and intensity of heavy rainfall; but it exhibited a neutral to negative impacts on the wind and temperature. Although the system used to conduct all-sky assimilation is only able to adjust control variables for moisture-, wind-, and temperaturerelated variables in the presence of cloud and does not benefit directly from cloud or precipitation information, the positive effects on heavy rainfall forecasts achieved in this study indicate a potential future benefit regarding disaster prevention and mitigation.

TI  - Simulation of the influence of a fine-scale urban underlying surface on the urban heat island effect in Beijing
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model coupled with slab model and single-layer urban canopy model (SLUCM) was used to simulate the urban heat island effect in Beijing. The effects of the refined local climate zone (LCZ) urban underlying surface and Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land use data on temperature simulated results were compared through sensitivity tests. These two types of underlying surface data present similar simulation error tendencies, showing an overestimation of the 2 m temperature at night. The simulated temperature results using MODIS land use data are closer to the observations than those simulated using the LCZ data. However, the MODIS land use data provide one classification for urban surface, which cannot reflect the complex urban morphology, whereas the LCZ concept divides urban land surface into ten categories that can reflect the surface characteristics more accurately. The sensitivity of different urban canopy parameters on temperature simulation provides priority parameters for model improvement. Real data were used to improve the parameter table setting in the urban canopy model and thus enhance the simulation ability of the LCZ test. The urban fraction, emissivity, and albedo in the parameter table were calculated and replaced. It was found that the use of the accurate emissivity provided the best simulation results. There are negative correlations between near-surface temperature and emissivity/albedo, and a positive correlation between near-surface temperature and urban fraction. The influence of the parameters on the simulated temperature at night was more evident than that during the daytime.

TI  - COVID-19 Publications in Family Medicine Journals in 2020: A PubMed-Based Bibliometric Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Family medicine physicians have been on the front lines of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; however, research and publications in family medicine journals are rarely discussed. In this study, a bibliometric analysis was conducted on COVID-19-related articles published in PubMed-indexed English language family medicine journals in 2020, which recorded the publication date and author's country and collected citations from Google Scholar. Additionally, we used LitCovid (an open database of COVID-19 literature from PubMed) to determine the content categories of each article and total number of global publications. We found that 33 family medicine journals published 5107 articles in 2020, of which 409 (8.0%) were COVID-19-related articles. Among the article categories, 107 were original articles, accounting for only 26.2% of the articles. In terms of content, the main category was prevention, with 177 articles, accounting for 43.3% of the articles. At the beginning of the epidemic, 10 articles were published in family medicine journals in January 2020, accounting for 11% of all COVID-19-related articles worldwide; however, this accounted for <0.5% of all disciplinary studies in the entire year. Therefore, family medicine journals indeed play a sentinel role, and the intensities and timeliness of COVID-19 publications deserve further investigation.

TI  - Subsidence Monitoring of Fill Area in Yan'an New District Based on Sentinel-1A Time Series Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, many cities in the Chinese loess plateau (especially in Shanxi province) have encountered ground subsidence problems due to the construction of underground projects and the exploitation of underground resources. With the completion of the world's largest geotechnical project, called "mountain excavation and city construction," in a collapsible loess area, the Yan'an city also appeared to have uneven ground subsidence. To obtain the spatial distribution characteristics and the time-series evolution trend of the subsidence, we selected Yan'an New District (YAND) as the specific study area and presented an improved time-series InSAR (TS-InSAR) method for experimental research. Based on 89 Sentinel-1A images collected between December 2017 to December 2020, we conducted comprehensive research and analysis on the spatial and temporal evolution of surface subsidence in YAND. The monitoring results showed that the YAND is relatively stable in general, with deformation rates mainly in the range of -10 to 10 mm/yr. However, three significant subsidence funnels existed in the fill area, with a maximum subsidence rate of 100 mm/yr. From 2017 to 2020, the subsidence funnels enlarged, and their subsidence rates accelerated. Further analysis proved that the main factors induced the severe ground subsidence in the study area, including the compressibility and collapsibility of loess, rapid urban construction, geological environment change, traffic circulation load, and dynamic change of groundwater. The experimental results indicated that the improved TS-InSAR method is adaptive to monitoring uneven subsidence of deep loess area. Moreover, related data and information would provide reference to the large-scale ground deformation monitoring and in similar loess areas.

TI  - Rapid pseudo-H&E imaging using a fluorescence-inbuilt optical coherence microscopic imaging system
T2  - BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - A technique using Linnik-based optical coherence microscopy (OCM), with built-in fluorescence microscopy (FM), is demonstrated here to describe cellular-level morphology for fresh porcine and biobank tissue specimens. The proposed method utilizes color-coding to generate digital pseudo-H&E (p-H&E) images. Using the same camera, colocalized FM images are merged with corresponding morphological OCM images using a 24-bit RGB composition process to generate position-matched p-H&E images. From receipt of dissected fresh tissue piece to generation of stitched images, the total processing time is <15 min for a 1-cm(2) specimen, which is on average two times faster than frozen-section H&E process for fatty or water-rich fresh tissue specimens. This technique was successfully used to scan human and animal fresh tissue pieces, demonstrating its applicability for both biobank and veterinary purposes. We provide an in-depth comparison between p-H&E and human frozen-section H&E images acquired from the same metastatic sentinel lymph node slice (-10 pm thick), and show the differences, like elastic fibers of a tiny blood vessel and cytoplasm of tumor cells.

TI  - Improved global estimations of gross primary productivity of natural vegetation types by incorporating plant functional type
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based light use efficiency (LUE) models are important tools for estimating regional and global vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP). However, all LUE models assume a constant value of maximum LUE at canopy scale (LUEmaxcanopy) over a given vegetation type. This assumption is not supported by observed plant traits regulating LUEmaxcanopy, which varies greatly even within the same ecosystem type. In this study, we developed an improved satellite data driven GPP model by identifying the potential maximal GPP (GPPPOT) and their dominant climate control factor in various plant functional types (PFT), which takes into account both plant trait and climatic control inter-dependence. We selected 161 sites from the FLUXNET2015 dataset with eddy covariance CO2 flux data and continuous meteorology to derive GPPPOT and their dominant climate control factor of vegetation growth for 42 natural PFTs. Results showed that (1) under the same phenology and incident photosynthetic active radiation, the maximal variance of GPPPOT is found in different PFTs of forests (10.9 g C m- 2 day-1) and in different climatic zones of grasslands (>10 g C m- 2 day-1); (2) intra-annual change of GPP in tropical and arid climate zones is mostly driven by vapor pressure deficit (VPD) changes, while temperature is the dominant climate control factor in temperate, boreal and polar climate zones; even under the same climate condition, physiological stress in photosynthesis is different across PFTs; (3) the model that takes into account the plant trait difference across PFTs had a higher agreement with flux tower-based GPP data (GPPflux) than the GPP products that omit PFT differences. Such agreement was highest for natural vegetation cover sites (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 1.79 g C m- 2 day- 1). These results suggest that global scale GPP models should incorporate both plant traits and their dominant climate control factor variance in various PFT to reduce the uncertainties in terrestrial carbon assessments.

TI  - Strategy of Multi-Beam Spot Allocation for GEO Data Relay Satellite Based on Modified K-Means Algorithm
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the booming development of satellite applications, the giant constellations of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites have introduced challenges for the data relay service. The multi-beam satellite not only offers concurrent access to a large number of objects, but can also meet the high data requirements toward specific coverage of the LEO constellation. However, the multi-beam satellite often faces the mismatch problem of spot allocation and data requirements, which can cause an overload traffic jam or a waste of resources. An optimization algorithm on spot beam allocation is necessary to automatically place the spot centers with appropriate beam widths in line with the density of the traffic demands and to realize the uniformity of the beam occupation. Compared with the conventional K-means algorithm, two adjustable parameters alpha and beta are introduced: one for tuning the ratio of two components making up the distance matrix, and the other for setting the obligatory minimum number of objects per beam. In this paper, the whole process of the proposed method is demonstrated, including the establishment of the low-orbit satellite constellation model, the extraction of the distribution features, and the implementation and evaluation of the modified K-means algorithm. The results prove the validity of the proposed algorithm. A larger value of beta with a relative smaller value of alpha tends to obtain the uniformity of beam occupation; the minimum standard deviation of objects per beam is achieved when alpha is 0.2 and beta is 0.8. This demonstrates that the uniformity of objects per beam can be realized by adjusting the parameters of the distance determination matrix and the obligatory minimal number of objects in each beam. The impact of parameter range on the results is also analyzed.

TI  - A Strain-Model Based InSAR Time Series Method and Its Application to The Geysers Geothermal Field, California
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - A new time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar method is presented based on a strain model. Traditionally, the interferometric phases are optimized based only on a constant set of statistically homogeneous points throughout the observing period, and thus the decorrelated phase cannot be well recovered and possible incoherent (or coherent) phases are (are not) used to optimize the target phase. In the proposed method, a strain model, representing the geophysical relationship of spatially adjacent points' deformations, is employed to optimize the interferometric phases interferogram-by-interferogram. The unwrapped phase time series can be estimated from the wrapped interferograms based on the linear iterative weighted least squares method, which is simple and can effectively suppress the decorrelation noise. Both simulations and analysis of data over The Geysers geothermal field (TG), California are conducted, validating that the proposed method can reduce the decorrelations and simultaneously preserve the deformation signals. The displacement results of TG from 2007-2011 L-band ascending ALOS-1 data and 2015-2020 C-band ascending/descending Sentinel-1 data reveal that (a) the displacement rate of TG is decreasing from 2007-2011 to 2015-2020, and (b) temporally variable displacement signals in addition to steady displacement can be observed from 2015 to 2020 for both the east-west and the vertical components.Plain Language Summary The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique is capable of accurately measuring ground surface displacements at high spatial resolution and large coverage. This paper proposes a strain-model based InSAR time series method, here referred to as the SIGMA method. The SIGMA method aims to enhance the capability of InSAR to measure displacements and can achieve higher accuracy and density of InSAR displacement measurements. Both simulations and real-data experiments are conducted to illuminate the benefits of the SIGMA method in the presence of substantial decorrelation noise. Particularly, the SIGMA method is used to investigate the surface displacements of The Geysers geothermal field, California, during 2007-2011 and 2015-2020. These time periods are complementary to those considered in previous studies, providing an important data set to investigate the long-term evolution of ground surface deformation, as well as the effects of recent fluid injection and production practices in the geothermal field. The new method should be of value for improved geo-hazards monitoring.

TI  - Assimilating FY-4A Lightning and Radar Data for Improving Short-Term Forecasts of a High-Impact Convective Event with a Dual-Resolution Hybrid 3DEnVAR Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A dual-resolution, hybrid, three-dimensional ensemble-variational (3DEnVAR) data assimilation method combining static and ensemble background error covariances is used to assimilate radar data, and pseudo-water vapor observations to improve short-term severe weather forecasts with the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. The higher-resolution deterministic forecast and the lower-resolution ensemble members have 3 and 9 km horizontal resolution, respectively. The water vapor pseudo-observations are derived from the combined use of total lightning data and cloud top height from the Fengyun-4A(FY-4A) geostationary satellite. First, a set of single-analysis experiments are conducted to provide a preliminary performance evaluation of the effectiveness of the hybrid method for assimilating multisource observations; second, a set of cycling analysis experiments are used to evaluate the forecast performance in convective-scale high-frequency analysis; finally, different hybrid coefficients are tested in both the single and cycling experiments. The single-analysis results show that the combined assimilation of radar data and water vapor pseudo-observations derived from the lightning data is able to generate reasonable vertical velocity, water vapor and hydrometeor adjustments, which help to trigger convection earlier in the forecast/analysis and reduce the spin-up time. The dual-resolution hybrid 3DEnVAR method is able to adjust the wind fields and hydrometeor variables with the assimilation of lightning data, which helps maintain the triggered convection longer and partially suppress spurious cells in the forecast compared with the three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) method. A cycling analysis that introduced a large number of observations with more frequent small adjustments is able to better resolve the observed convective events than a single-analysis approach. Different hybrid coefficients can affect the forecast results, either in the single deterministic or cycling analysis experiments. Overall, we found that a static coefficient of 0.4 and an ensemble coefficient of 0.6 yields the best forecast skill for this event.

TI  - Driving Factors of Land Surface Temperature in Urban Agglomerations: A Case Study in the Pearl River Delta, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) in urban agglomerations plays an important role for policymakers in urban planning. The Pearl River Delta (PRD) is one of the regions with the highest urban densities in the world. This study aims to explore the spatial patterns and the dominant drivers of LST in the PRD. MODIS LST (MYD11A2) data from 2005 and 2015 were used in this study. First, spatial analysis methods were applied in order to determine the spatial patterns of LST and to identity the hotspot areas (HSAs). Second, the hotspot ratio index (HRI), as a metric of thermal heterogeneity, was developed in order to identify the features of thermal environment across the nine cities in the PRD. Finally, the geo-detector (GD) metric was employed to explore the dominant drivers of LST, which included elevation, land use/land cover (LUCC), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), impervious surface distribution density (ISDD), gross domestic product (GDP), population density (POP), and nighttime light index (NLI). The GD metric has the advantages of detecting the dominant drivers without assuming linear relationships and measuring the combined effects of the drivers. The results of Moran's Index showed that the daytime and nighttime LST were close to the cluster pattern. Therefore, this process led to the identification of HSAs. The HSAs were concentrated in the central PRD and were distributed around the Pearl River estuary. The results of the HRI indicated that the spatial distribution of the HSAs was highly heterogeneous among the cities for both daytime and nighttime. The highest HRI values were recorded in the cities of Dongguan and Shenzhen during the daytime. The HRI values in the cities of Zhaoqing, Jiangmen, and Huizhou were relatively lower in both daytime and nighttime. The dominant drivers of LST varied from city to city. The influence of land cover and socio-economic factors on daytime LST was higher in the highly urbanized cities than in the cities with low urbanization rates. For the cities of Zhaoqing, Huizhou, and Jiangmen, elevation was the dominant driver of daytime LST during the study period, and for the other cities in the PRD, the main driver changed from land cover in 2005 to NLI in 2015. This study is expected to provide useful guidance for planning of the thermal environment in urban agglomerations.

TI  - Analogy-Based Crop Yield Forecasts Based on Temporal Similarity of Leaf Area Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal forecasts of crop yield are important components for agricultural policy decisions and farmer planning. A wide range of input data are often needed to forecast crop yield in a region where sophisticated approaches such as machine learning and process-based models are used. This requires considerable effort for data preparation in addition to identifying data sources. Here, we propose a simpler approach called the Analogy Based Crop-yield (ABC) forecast scheme to make timely and accurate prediction of regional crop yield using a minimum set of inputs. In the ABC method, a growing season from a prior long-term period, e.g., 10 years, is first identified as analogous to the current season by the use of a similarity index based on the time series leaf area index (LAI) patterns. Crop yield in the given growing season is then forecasted using the weighted yield average reported in the analogous seasons for the area of interest. The ABC approach was used to predict corn and soybean yields in the Midwestern U.S. at the county level for the period of 2017-2019. The MOD15A2H, which is a satellite data product for LAI, was used to compile inputs. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of crop yield forecasts was <10% for corn and soybean in each growing season when the time series of LAI from the day of year 89 to 209 was used as inputs to the ABC approach. The prediction error for the ABC approach was comparable to results from a deep neural network model that relied on soil and weather data as well as satellite data in a previous study. These results indicate that the ABC approach allowed for crop yield forecast with a lead-time of at least two months before harvest. In particular, the ABC scheme would be useful for regions where crop yield forecasts are limited by availability of reliable environmental data.

TI  - Geographic Optimal Transport for Heterogeneous Data: Fusing Remote Sensing and Social Media
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fusion of heterogeneous remote sensing and social media data can fill the gaps in satellite image collections and improve the spatiotemporal resolution of the available data sets. As a result, it is being gradually adopted in multimodal data analytics. Generally, the fusion of heterogeneous geographic data faces the following issues: 1) the probability density functions may differ from different data sources and 2) the geolocations may not be well aligned. The former one can be generally solved by performing an alignment of representations in the source and target domains using, for instance, domain adaptation. The latter issue is seldom considered in the fusion of heterogeneous geographic data. In this article, we present a new method called geographic optimal transport (GOT), which aims at aligning representations and geolocations in a simultaneous fashion. A flood event that took place in 2013 in Boulder, CO, USA, is taken as a case study to evaluate our GOT method. Here, we consider two remote sensing features derived from water indicators, i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI), for the fusion of Landsat 8 imagery and Twitter data. A comparison between our newly developed GOT and the traditional optimal transport (OT) is performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GOT can accurately align spatially biased georeferenced tweets to the flood phenomena, leading to the conclusion that GOT can effectively fuse heterogeneous remote sensing and social media data.

TI  - Gradient Boosting Estimation of the Leaf Area Index of Apple Orchards in UAV Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a key parameter for describing the canopy structure of apple trees. This index is also employed in evaluating the amount of pesticide sprayed per unit volume of apple trees. Hence, numerous manual and automatic methods have been explored for LAI estimation. In this work, the leaf area indices for different types of apple trees are obtained in terms of multispectral remote-sensing data collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), along with simultaneous measurements of apple orchards. The proposed approach was tested on apple trees of the "Fuji", "Golden Delicious", and "Ruixue" types, which were planted in the Apple Experimental Station of the Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University in Baishui County, Shaanxi Province, China. Five vegetation indices of strong correlation with the apple leaf area index were selected and used to train models of support vector regression (SVR) and gradient-boosting decision trees (GBDT) for predicting the leaf area index of apple trees. The best model was selected based on the metrics of the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE). The experimental results showed that the gradient-boosting decision tree model achieved the best performance with an R-2 of 0.846, an RMSE of 0.356, and a spatial efficiency (SPAEF) of 0.57. This demonstrates the feasibility of our approach for fast and accurate remote-sensing-based estimation of the leaf area index of apple trees.

TI  - A Transfer Classification Method for Heterogeneous Data Based on Evidence Theory
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - It remains a challenging problem for data classification without training patterns. In many applications, there may exist some labeled data in other related domains (called source domain), and such labeled data can be helpful to solve the classification problem in the target domain. It is considered that the source domain and target domain are heterogeneous here and they represent the distinct feature spaces. A new transfer classification method for heterogeneous data is proposed based on the evidence theory. Some pattern pairs in the source domain and target domain are given to predict the link of these two domains. For each pattern in the target domain, we estimate its possible mapping value in the source domain using these pattern pairs with a self-organizing map (SOM) technique, and then the mapping value is classified using the labeled data in the source domain. However, the patterns with close values in the target domain may have more or less different values in the source domain due to the distinct characteristics of these two domains. So the mapping value can be very uncertain sometimes. In such a case, the target pattern is allowed to have multiple mapping values with different weights/reliabilities in the source domain. These mapping values can produce different classification results. The evidence theory is good at characterizing and combining uncertain information. In order to improve the classification accuracy, a new evidence-based weighted fusion method is developed for combining these classification results, which are discounted by the corresponding weights under the belief functions framework, and the final class decision is made according to the combination result. In experimental applications, some heterogeneous remote sensing data and UCI data are used to test the performance of new method with respect to several other methods, and it shows that the new method can efficiently improve the classification accuracy.

TI  - Twice Is Nice: The Benefits of Two Ground Measures for Evaluating the Accuracy of Satellite-Based Sustainability Estimates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data offer great promise for improving measures related to sustainable development goals. However, assessing satellite estimates is complicated by the fact that traditional ground-based measures of these same outcomes are often very noisy, leading to underestimation of satellite performance. Here, we quantify the amount of noise in traditional measures for three commonly studied outcomes in prior work-agricultural yields, household asset ownership, and household consumption expenditures-and present a theoretical basis for properly characterizing satellite performance in the presence of noisy ground data. We find that for both yield and consumption, repeated ground measures often disagree with each other, with less than half of the variability in one ground measure captured by the other. Estimates of the performance of satellite measures, in terms of squared correlation (r(2)), which account for this noise in ground data are accordingly higher, and occasionally even double, the apparent performance based on a naive comparison of satellite and ground measures. Our results caution against evaluating satellite measures without accounting for noise in ground data and emphasize the benefit of estimating that noise by collecting at least two independent ground measures.

TI  - AlgaeMAp: Algae Bloom Monitoring Application for Inland Waters in Latin America
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to increasing algae bloom occurrence and water degradation on a global scale, there is a demand for water quality monitoring systems based on remote sensing imagery. This paper describes the scientific, theoretical, and methodological background for creating a cloud-computing interface on Google Earth Engine (GEE) which allows end-users to access algae bloom related products with high spatial (30 m) and temporal (similar to 5 day) resolution. The proposed methodology uses Sentinel-2 images corrected for atmospheric and sun-glint effects to generate an image collection of the Normalized Difference Chlorophyll-a Index (NDCI) for the entire time-series. NDCI is used to estimate both Chl-a concentration, based on a non-linear fitting model, and Trophic State Index (TSI), based on a tree-decision model classification into five classes. Once the Chl-a and TSI algorithms had been calibrated and validated they were implemented in GEE as an Earth Engine App, entitled Algae Bloom Monitoring Application (AlgaeMAp). AlgaeMAp is the first online platform built within the GEE platform that offers high spatial resolution of water quality parameters. The App benefits from the huge processing capability of GEE that allows any user with internet access to easily extract detailed spatial (30 m) and long temporal Chl-a and TSI information (from August 2015 and with images every 5 days) throughout the most important reservoirs in the State of Sao Paulo/Brazil. The application will be adapted to extend to other relevant areas in Latin America.

TI  - The Impact of Phenological Developments on Interferometric and Polarimetric Crop Signatures Derived from Sentinel-1: Examples from the DEMMIN Study Site (Germany)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the potential of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to identify phenological phases of wheat, sugar beet, and canola. Breakpoint and extreme value analyses were applied to a dense time series of interferometric (InSAR) and polarimetric (PolSAR) features recorded during the growing season of 2017 at the JECAM site DEMMIN (Germany). The analyses of breakpoints and extrema allowed for the distinction of vegetative and reproductive stages for wheat and canola. Certain phenological stages, measured in situ using the BBCH-scale, such as leaf development and rosette growth of sugar beet or stem elongation and ripening of wheat, were detectable by a combination of InSAR coherence, polarimetric Alpha and Entropy, and backscatter (VV/VH). Except for some fringe cases, the temporal difference between in situ observations and breakpoints or extrema ranged from zero to five days. Backscatter produced the signature that generated the most breakpoints and extrema. However, certain micro stadia, such as leaf development of BBCH 10 of sugar beet or flowering BBCH 69 of wheat, were only identifiable by the InSAR coherence and Alpha. Hence, it is concluded that combining PolSAR and InSAR features increases the number of detectable phenological events in the phenological cycles of crops.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Data Analysis for Smallholding Forest Cut Control
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land fragmentation and small plots are the main features of the rural environment of Galicia (NW Spain). Smallholding limits land use management, representing a drawback in local forest planning. This study analyzes the potential use of multitemporal Sentinel-2 images to detect and control forest cuts in very small pine and eucalyptus plots located in southern Galicia. The proposed approach is based on the analysis of Sentinel-2 NDVI time series in 4231 plots smaller than 3 ha (average 0.46 ha). The methodology allowed us to detect cuts, allocate cut dates and quantify plot areas due to different cutting cycles in an uneven-aged stand. An accuracy of approximately 95% was achieved when the whole plot was cut, with an 81% accuracy for partial cuts. The main difficulty in detecting and dating cuts was related to cloud cover, which affected the multitemporal analysis. In conclusion, the proposed methodology provides an accurate estimation of cutting date and area, helping to improve the monitoring system in sustainable forest certifications to ensure compliance with forest management plans.

TI  - A WoT-Based Method for Creating Digital Sentinel Twins of IoT Devices
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The data produced by sensors of IoT devices are becoming keystones for organizations to conduct critical decision-making processes. However, delivering information to these processes in real-time represents two challenges for the organizations: the first one is achieving a constant dataflow from IoT to the cloud and the second one is enabling decision-making processes to retrieve data from dataflows in real-time. This paper presents a cloud-based Web of Things method for creating digital twins of IoT devices (named sentinels).The novelty of the proposed approach is that sentinels create an abstract window for decision-making processes to: (a) find data (e.g., properties, events, and data from sensors of IoT devices) or (b) invoke functions (e.g., actions and tasks) from physical devices (PD), as well as from virtual devices (VD). In this approach, the applications and services of decision-making processes deal with sentinels instead of managing complex details associated with the PDs, VDs, and cloud computing infrastructures. A prototype based on the proposed method was implemented to conduct a case study based on a blockchain system for verifying contract violation in sensors used in product transportation logistics. The evaluation showed the effectiveness of sentinels enabling organizations to attain data from IoT sensors and the dataflows used by decision-making processes to convert these data into useful information.

TI  - Coral Reef Mapping with Remote Sensing and Machine Learning: A Nurture and Nature Analysis in Marine Protected Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping habitats is essential to assist strategic decisions regarding the use and protection of coral reefs. Coupled with machine learning (ML) algorithms, remote sensing has allowed detailed mapping of reefs at meaningful scales. Here we integrated WorldView-3 and Landsat-8 imagery and ML techniques to produce a map of suitable habitats for the occurrence of a model species, the hydrocoral Millepora alcicornis, in coral reefs located inside marine protected areas in Northeast Brazil. Conservation and management efforts in the region were also analyzed, integrating human use layers to the ecological seascape. Three ML techniques were applied: two to derive base layers, namely geographically weighted regressions for bathymetry and support vector machine classifier (SVM) for habitat mapping, and one to build the species distribution model (MaxEnt) for Millepora alcicornis, a conspicuous and important reef-building species in the area. Additionally, human use was mapped based on the presence of tourists and fishers. SVM yielded 15 benthic classes (e.g., seagrass, sand, coral), with an overall accuracy of 79%. Bathymetry and its derivative layers depicted the topographical complexity of the area. The Millepora alcicornis distribution model identified distance from the shore and depth as topographical factors limiting the settling and growth of coral colonies. The most important variables were ecological, showing the importance of maintaining high biodiversity in the ecosystem. The comparison of the habitat suitability model with species absence and human use maps indicated the impact of direct human activities as potential inhibitors of coral development. Results reinforce the importance of the establishment of no-take zones and other protective measures for maintaining local biodiversity.

TI  - Deep Learning for Effective Refugee Tent Extraction Near Syria-Jordan Border
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rukban is a desert area crossing the border between Syria and Jordan, and thousands of Syrian refugees fled into this area since the Syrian civil war in 2014. In the past few years, the number of refugee shelters for the forcibly displaced Syrian refugees in this area has increased rapidly. Estimating the location and number of refugee tents has become a key factor to maintain the sustainability of the refugee shelter camps. Manually counting the shelters is labor-intensive and sometimes prohibitive given the large quantities. In addition, these shelters/tents are usually small in size, irregular in shape, and sparsely distributed in a very large area and could be easily missed by the traditional image-analysis techniques, making the image-based approaches also challenging. In this letter, we proposed a deep fully convolutional neural network (FCN) model to extract automatically the refugee shelters/tents in the worldview-2 (WV-2) satellite images. In addition, we transferred knowledge in the pretrained VGG-16 model to improve the detection accuracy and network training convergence. We compared the proposed approach with the traditional spectral angle mapper (SAM) method, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models, and the mask Region-based CNN (R-CNN) model. The experimental results show that the FCN model improved the overall accuracy by 4.49%, 3.54%, and 0.88% compared with the CNNs, SAM, and mask R-CNN models, and improved the precision by 34.61%, 41.99%, and 11.87%, respectively.

TI  - A Framework for Guiding Transformative Growth After School Shootings
T2  - PEACE AND CONFLICT-JOURNAL OF PEACE PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - For the last 20 years, gun violence has severely compromised safety, learning outcomes, social development, and psychological well-being in many high school communities. An emerging body of international research describes strategies developed to support students and staff members in the wake of school shootings. However, these protocols are typically designed to help administrators manage the immediate sequelae of these incidents, leaving survivors to handle the lasting consequences of their experiences on their own. This article presents a broad framework for facilitating long-term psychological growth that can be integrated into high school curricula. It is based on the complementary theories of Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) and Transformative Learning (TL), which explain how positive psychological change can occur after a traumatic event disrupts a person's assumptive worldview. The three segments of the TL process-questioning, exploring, and experimenting-facilitate PTG by transforming established beliefs into broader meaning perspectives that accommodate present realities. The framework below provides an organized approach to guiding high school students, staff, and communities through the full process of rebuilding global schemas after a shooting occurs. It can be implemented alongside existing crisis-response models, resulting in an expansion of their utility. Its guided-growth strategies can also be leveraged to reshape school culture and encourage collective action in the surrounding community, maximizing the possibility of positive worldview development.

TI  - A Fast Aircraft Detection Method for SAR Images Based on Efficient Bidirectional Path Aggregated Attention Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In aircraft detection from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, there are several major challenges: the shattered features of the aircraft, the size heterogeneity and the interference of a complex background. To address these problems, an Efficient Bidirectional Path Aggregation Attention Network (EBPA2N) is proposed. In EBPA2N, YOLOv5s is used as the base network and then the Involution Enhanced Path Aggregation (IEPA) module and Effective Residual Shuffle Attention (ERSA) module are proposed and systematically integrated to improve the detection accuracy of the aircraft. The IEPA module aims to effectively extract advanced semantic and spatial information to better capture multi-scale scattering features of aircraft. Then, the lightweight ERSA module further enhances the extracted features to overcome the interference of complex background and speckle noise, so as to reduce false alarms. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed network, Gaofen-3 airports SAR data with 1 m resolution are utilized in the experiment. The detection rate and false alarm rate of our EBPA2N algorithm are 93.05% and 4.49%, respectively, which is superior to the latest networks of EfficientDet-D0 and YOLOv5s, and it also has an advantage of detection speed.

TI  - Improving Satellite Image Fusion via Generative Adversarial Training
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The optical images acquired from satellite platforms are commonly multiresolution images, and converting multiresolution satellite images into full higher-resolution (HR) images has been a critical technique for improving the image quality. In this study, we introduced the generative adversarial network (GAN) and proposed a new fusion GAN (FusGAN) approach for solving the remote sensing image fusion problem. Specifically, we developed a new adversarial training strategy: 1) downscaled multiresolution images are adopted for generative network (G-Net) training, and 2) the discriminative network (D-Net) is used to adversarially train the G-Net by discriminating whether the original multiresolution images have been fused well enough. To further improve the capability of the network, we structured our G-Net with residual dense blocks by combining state-of-the-art residual and dense connection ideas. Our proposed FusGAN approach is evaluated both visually and quantitatively on Sentinel-2 and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) multiresolution images. As demonstrated by the results, the proposed FusGAN approach outperforms the selected benchmark methods and both perfectly preserves spectral information and reconstructs spatial information in image fusion. Considering the common resolution disparities among intra- and intersatellite images, the proposed FusGAN approach can contribute to the quality improvement of satellite images and thus improve remote sensing applications.

TI  - Signatures of Wetland Impact: Spatial Distribution of Forest Aboveground Biomass in Tumen River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tumen River Basin, located in the cross-border region of China, North Korea, and Russia, constitutes an important ecological barrier in China. Forest here is mainly distributed around wetland, with the distribution of wetland having the potential to regulate regional forest carbon storage. However, the spatially explicit map of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) and potential impact of drivers, i.e., wetland distribution and climate, is still lacking. We thus use a deep neural network and multi-source remote sensing data to quantify forest AGB in the Tumen River Basin. Our results show the mean forest AGB is 103.43 Mg ha(-1), with divergent spatial variation along its distance to wetland. The results of correlation analysis showed that with sufficient soil moisture supply, temperature dominant spatial variation of forest aboveground biomass. Noted that using the space for time substitution, we find when wetland decreased by less than 11.1%, the forest AGB decreased by more than 8%. Our result highlight the signatures of wetland impact on its nearby forest carbon storage, and urge the wetland protection, especially under the warming and drying future.

TI  - Spatial, Phenological, and Inter-Annual Variations of Gross Primary Productivity in the Arctic from 2001 to 2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the spatial, seasonal (phenological), and inter-annual variations of gross primary productivity (GPP) in the Arctic is critical for comprehending the terrestrial carbon cycle and its feedback to climate warming in this region. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of the MOD17A2H GPP product using the FLUXNET 2015 dataset in the Arctic, then explored the spatial patterns, seasonal variations, and interannual trends of GPP, and investigated the dependence of the spatiotemporal variations in GPP on land cover types, latitude, and elevation from 2001 to 2019. The results showed that MOD17A2H was consistent with in situ measurements (R = 0.8, RMSE = 1.26 g C m(-2) d(-1)). The functional phenology was also captured by the MOD17A2H product (R = 0.62, RMSE = 9 days) in the Arctic. The spatial variation of the seasonal magnitude of GPP and its interannual trends is partly related to land cover types, peaking in forests and lowest in grasslands. The interannual trend of GPP decreased as the latitude and elevation increased, except for the latitude between 62 degrees similar to 66 degrees N and elevation below 700 m. Our study not only revealed the variation of GPP in the Arctic but also helped to understand the carbon cycle over this region.

TI  - Airport's Throughput Estimation Using Nighttime Light Data in China Mainland
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS

AB  - Accurate information about the airport's throughput is crucial for monitoring traffic flow, evaluating the development status of aviation industry. In this letter, we used the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (NPP-VIIRS) and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime light (NTL) data as effective proxies for evaluating and monitoring the airport's throughput power in China mainland. The results show that there is a significant positive correlation between the NTL intensity and the airport's throughput (R-2 > 0.85). The NPP-VIIRS NTL data have been proved to not only distinguish the airport area and nonairport area but also build airport's NTL feature space. This letter reveals that the NTL images provide powerful remote sensing data sources to model the spatiotemporal dynamics of airport's throughput of China mainland at a large spatial scale.

TI  - Cloud Detection Algorithm for Multi-Satellite Remote Sensing Imagery Based on a Spectral Library and 1D Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic cloud detection in remote sensing images is of great significance. Deep-learning-based methods can achieve cloud detection with high accuracy; however, network training heavily relies on a large number of labels. Manually labelling pixel-wise level cloud and non-cloud annotations for many remote sensing images is laborious and requires expert-level knowledge. Different types of satellite images cannot share a set of training data, due to the difference in spectral range and spatial resolution between them. Hence, labelled samples in each upcoming satellite image are required to train a new deep-learning-based model. In order to overcome such a limitation, a novel cloud detection algorithm based on a spectral library and convolutional neural network (CD-SLCNN) was proposed in this paper. In this method, the residual learning and one-dimensional CNN (Res-1D-CNN) was used to accurately capture the spectral information of the pixels based on the prior spectral library, effectively preventing errors due to the uncertainties in thin clouds, broken clouds, and clear-sky pixels during remote sensing interpretation. Benefiting from data simulation, the method is suitable for the cloud detection of different types of multispectral data. A total of 62 Landsat-8 Operational Land Imagers (OLI), 25 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS), and 20 Sentinel-2 satellite images acquired at different times and over different types of underlying surfaces, such as a high vegetation coverage, urban area, bare soil, water, and mountains, were used for cloud detection validation and quantitative analysis, and the cloud detection results were compared with the results from the function of the mask, MODIS cloud mask, support vector machine, and random forest. The comparison revealed that the CD-SLCNN method achieved the best performance, with a higher overall accuracy (95.6%, 95.36%, 94.27%) and mean intersection over union (77.82%, 77.94%, 77.23%) on the Landsat-8 OLI, MODIS, and Sentinel-2 data, respectively. The CD-SLCNN algorithm produced consistent results with a more accurate cloud contour on thick, thin, and broken clouds over a diverse underlying surface, and had a stable performance regarding bright surfaces, such as buildings, ice, and snow.

TI  - Where are Greater Climate Change Adaptation Measures Needed in a Wetland?
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change in arid areas leads to intensive drought, which causes widespread degradation in wetland ecosystems. Since wetlands play an important role in the sustainability of arid regions, climate change adaptation measures are required to conserve wetlands. However, how can we determine the regions that need increased adaptation measures? This paper aims to respond to this question and determine the regions that were highly degraded after climate change to consider them as high priority for adaptation measures. To reach this goal, degradation in the main factors that affect the functions of the Hamoun wetlands was detected in two periods, including wetland a one-year inundation period and over a 40-year period. The Hamoun wetlands are dealing with intensive drought because of the climate change that dries out these wetlands in some months and some years. Landsat images were classified using a support vector machine (SVM) in both the one-year inundation period and over 40 years to determine the regions that lost water and vegetation cover. The degradation of water bird habitat was also determined over both periods. The multicriteria evaluation (MCE) method was applied to overlay the layers and prioritize the regions for adaptation measures based on the degradation criteria. The two important contributions of this paper include introducing a functional method for the implementation of adaptation measures and running this method by the main components shared between all wetlands, which makes this method applicable in all regions.

TI  - Countrywide mapping of trees outside forests based on remote sensing data in Switzerland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Although trees growing outside forests are less perceived in relation to those inside forests, they are also valuable and serve various functions. The biophysical thresholds of Trees Outside Forests (TOF) were recently defined and standardised by the Global Forest Resources Assessments of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (UNFAO-FRA). With these definitions, standardised mapping of TOF resources became feasible at the national and international level. Here, we aimed to fill the spatial information gap of TOF resources at the national scale with an automated mapping approach based on the UNFAO-FRA definition. The approach was carried out in ArcGIS using adapted UNFAO-FRA biophysical thresholds with routinely acquired countrywide remote sensing data for the whole of Switzerland: a Vegetation Height Model (VHM), a Topographic Landscape Model (TLM Regio) land cover map, and a Forest Mask. Results were validated using stereo-image interpretation data of the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI), which verified 95%, 55% and 75% of overall, producer?s and user?s accuracy, respectively. Of the five forest production regions in Switzerland, the highest accuracy was achieved in the Central Plateau and the lowest in the Alps, with accuracy generally decreasing with increasing elevation. Omission and commission errors were highly correlated with the vertical and horizontal accuracy of the VHM, and the applied biophysical thresholds caused both types of error. The final TOF map produced with our approach is at the countrywide scale, is superior to existing TOF information, meets UNFAO-FRA management and reporting needs, and enables the derivation of TOF?s biomass, carbon sequestration potential and species distribution for the whole country.

TI  - Automatic Generation of Seamless Mosaics Using Invariant Features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The acquisition of satellite images over a wide area is often carried out across seasons because of satellite orbits and atmospheric conditions (e.g., cloud cover, dust, etc.). This results in spectral mismatch between adjacent scenes as the sun angle and the atmospheric conditions will be different for different acquisitions. In this work, we developed an approach to generate seamless mosaics using Scale-Invariant Features Transformation (SIFT). In this process, we make use of the overlapping areas between two adjacent scenes and then map spectral values of one imagery scene to another based on the filtered points detected by SIFT features to create a seamless mosaic. We make use of the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) method successively to filter out obtained SIFT points across adjacent tiles and to remove spectral outliers across each band of an image. Several high resolution satellite images acquired with WorldView-2 and Dubaisat-2 satellites, and medium resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery are used for experimentation. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can generate good seamless mosaics. Furthermore, Sentinel-2's level 2A (L2A) product surface reflectance data is used to adjust the spectral values for color consistency.

This was the first of 17 short, but violent, eruptive events occurring during February-April 2021, mostly at a time interval of about 2-3 days between each other. The paroxysms produced lava fountains (up to 1000 m high), huge tephra columns (up to 10-11 km above sea level), lava and pyroclastic flows, expanding 2-4 km towards East and South. The last event, which was characterised by about 3 days of almost continuous eruptive activity (30 March-1 April), generated the most lasting lava fountain (8-9 h). During some paroxysms, volcanic ash led to the temporary closure of the Vincenzo Bellini Catania International Airport. Heavy ash falls then affected the areas surrounding the volcano, in some cases reaching zones located hundreds of kilometres away from the eruptive vent. In this study, we investigate the Mt. Etna paroxysms mentioned above through a multi-platform satellite system. Results retrieved from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), starting from outputs of the Robust Satellite Techniques for Volcanoes (RSTVOLC), indicate that the 17th paroxysm (31 March-1 April) was the most intense in terms of radiative power, with values estimated around 14 GW. Moreover, by the analysis of SEVIRI data, we found that the 5th and 17th paroxysms were the most energetic. The Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and the Operational Land Imager (OLI), providing shortwave infrared (SWIR) data at 20/30 m spatial resolution, enabled an accurate localisation of active vents and the mapping of the areas inundated by lava flows. In addition, according to the Normalized Hotspot Indices (NHI) tool, the 2nd (17-18 February) and 7th (28 February) paroxysm generated the largest thermal anomaly at Mt. Etna after April 2013, when Landsat-8 OLI data became available. Despite the impact of clouds/plumes, pixel saturation, and other factors (e.g., satellite viewing geometry) on thermal anomaly identification, the used multi-sensor approach allowed us to retrieve quantitative information about the 17 paroxysms occurring at Mt. Etna. This approach could support scientists in better interpreting changes in thermal activity, which could lead to future and more dangerous eruptions.

TI  - BFAST Lite: A Lightweight Break Detection Method for Time Series Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - BFAST Lite is a newly proposed unsupervised time series change detection algorithm that is derived from the original BFAST (Breaks for Additive Season and Trend) algorithm, focusing on improvements to speed and flexibility. The goal of the BFAST Lite algorithm is to aid the upscaling of BFAST for global land cover change detection. In this paper, we introduce and describe the algorithm and then compare its accuracy, speed and features with other algorithms in the BFAST family: BFAST and BFAST Monitor. We tested the three algorithms on an eleven-year-long time series of MODIS imagery, using a global reference dataset with over 30,000 point locations of land cover change to validate the results. We set the parameters of all algorithms to comparable values and analysed the algorithm accuracy over a range of time series ordered by the certainty of that the input time series has at least one abrupt break. To compare the algorithm accuracy, we analysed the time difference between the detected breaks and the reference data to obtain a confusion matrix and derived statistics from it. Lastly, we compared the processing speed of the algorithms using both the original R code as well as an optimised C++ implementation for each algorithm. The results showed that BFAST Lite has similar accuracy to BFAST but is significantly faster, more flexible and can handle missing values. Its ability to use alternative information criteria to select the number of breaks resulted in the best balance between the user's and producer's accuracy of detected changes of all the tested algorithms. Therefore, BFAST Lite is a useful addition to the BFAST family of unsupervised time series break detection algorithms, which can be used as an aid in narrowing down areas with changes for updating land cover maps, detecting disturbances or estimating magnitudes and rates of change over large areas.

TI  - Mast Cells and the Pancreas in Human Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes
T2  - CELLS
M3  - Review
AB  - Mast cells are highly differentiated, widely distributed cells of the innate immune system, that are currently considered as key regulators of both innate and adaptive immunity. Mast cells play a key role in health and survival mechanisms, especially as sentinel cells that can stimulate protective immune responses. On the other hand, it has been shown that mast cells are involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, and recently a possible pathogenetic role of mast cells in diabetes has been proposed. In this review we summarize the evidence on the increased presence of mast cells in the pancreas of subjects with type 1 diabetes, which is due to the autoimmune destruction of insulin secreting beta cells, and discuss the differences with type 2 diabetes, the other major form of diabetes. In addition, we describe some of the pathophysiological mechanisms through which mast cells might exert their actions, which could be targeted to potentially protect the beta cells in autoimmune diabetes.

TI  - Risk Assessment of Land Degradation (RALDE) in Khuzestan Province, Iran
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation lower land productivity, livelihood development and economic growth. Monitoring spatial and temporal changes in land degradation is a key contribution to understand their nature and causes, and to properly develop restoration and rehabilitation programs. The Khuzestan Province, Iran, was selected as study area to design, develop and test a new model. The Risk Assessment of Land Degradation (RALDE) model consider various indicators of land degradation based on a biophysical and socioeconomic approach. To determine the risk of land degradation, RALDE will identify areas that are more vulnerable and will improve the land planning. Data gathered from different governmental offices of Khuzestan Province and MODIS satellite data were used for this purpose. Maps of land degradation were produced after overlying the covers related to the biophysical and socioeconomic factors by means of a Geographical Information System. The Khuzestan Province was classified into subclasses with different probability of risk. In this method, the risk probability was evaluated according to trend and potential of degradation. Results showed that the range of degradation risk probability was between 7 to 88%. The areas under different subclasses of severe to very severe risk covered about 68% of the study area, showing higher threat of land degradation. The RALDE model contributes to a better understand land degradation processes and risk in different regions of the world.

TI  - Effectiveness of a Complex Fertilisation Technology Applied to <i>Zea mays</i>, Assessed Based on Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of effectiveness of fertilisation is a complex, multistage procedure. A few methods, used for this purpose, are based mainly on physiological measures acquired from a limited number of plants. Assessment of the process taking into account the entire area, in which the crop is grown, can be conducted using satellite remote sensing methods. The current study presents four fertilisation schemes applied to maize plants, including innovative foliar fertilizers and soil localized fertilization. Nutritional status and condition of the plants were assessed using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the results were analysed in relation to the grain yield. The findings show that the complex fertilisation technology applied to maize is most effective, producing grain yield which was 42.4% higher than the yield from the control variant.

TI  - The Return of Nature to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone: Increases in Forest Cover of 1.5 Times Since the 1986 Disaster
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - For 34 years since the 1986 nuclear disaster, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (ChEZ) landscapes have been protected with very limited human interventions. Natural afforestation has largely occurred throughout the abandoned farmlands, while natural disturbance regimes, which dominantly include wildfires, have become more frequent and severe in the last years. Here, we utilize the dense time series of Landsat satellite imagery (1986-2020) processed by using the temporal segmentation algorithm LandTrendr in order to derive a robust land cover and forest mask product for the ChEZ. Additionally, we carried out an analysis of land cover transitions on the former farmlands. The Random Forest classification model developed here has achieved overall accuracies of 80% (using training data for 2017) and 89% on a binary "forest/non-forest" validation (using data from 1988). The total forest cover area within the ChEZ has increased from 41% (in 1986) to 59% (in 2020). This forest gain can be explained by the afforestation that has occurred in abandoned farmlands, which compensates for forest cover losses due to large fire events in 1992, 2015-2016, and 2020. Most transitions from open landscapes to dense forest cover occurred after the year 2000 and are possibly linked to past forest management practices. We conclude that a consistent forest strategy, with the aid of remote monitoring, is required to efficiently manage new forests in the ChEZ in order to retain their ecosystem functions and to ensure sustainable habitats.

TI  - Hydrological Impacts of Land Use - Land Cover Change on Urban Flood Hazard: A Case Study of the Jukskei River in Alexandra Township, Johannesburg, South Africa
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding in urban areas is a major natural disaster causing damage to infrastructure, properties and loss of life. In urban areas the major causes behind the changing hydrological processes (i.e., floods) include topography, increase in precipitation due to climate change and change in landuse/land-cover (LULC) over time. The objective of this study is to evaluate the spatial and temporal LULC change impacts on flooding along the Jukskei River in Alexandra Township, Johannesburg, South Africa. The LULC images of 1987 MSS and 2015 OLI derived from Landsat satellite were preprocessed and classified using a supervised classification method. The analysis of LULC revealed that, there is an increase in built-up area from 934,2 ha to 1277,2 ha and reduction in intact and sparse vegetation from 190,5 ha to 62,4 ha and 380,8 ha to 142,1 ha, respectively, between the years 1987 and 2015. The flood depth map, velocity map and flood depth-velocity for different return periods and LULC scenarios have been developed by using an integrated approach of the Hydrological Engineering Centre-River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) and the HEC-GeoRAS with the geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing data. From the analysis, it is observed that there is an increase in flood depth and flood velocity from 2,3 m to 3,0 m and 1,4 m/s to 3,4 m/s, whereas the depth-velocity for the last 28-years increased by 3,4 m(2)/s from 2,9 m2/s to 6,3 m2/s for the 1987 LULC and the 2015 LULC conditions, respectively. The flood hazard maps generated in this study can be used by local authorities and municipalities for flood disaster management.

TI  - Semantic Boosting: Enhancing Deep Learning Based LULC Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification of land use and land cover (LULC) is a well-studied task within the domain of remote sensing and geographic information science. It traditionally relies on remotely sensed imagery and therefore models land cover classes with respect to their electromagnetic reflectances, aggregated in pixels. This paper introduces a methodology which enables the inclusion of geographical object semantics (from vector data) into the LULC classification procedure. As such, information on the types of geographic objects (e.g., Shop, Church, Peak, etc.) can improve LULC classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate how semantics can be fused with imagery to classify LULC. Three experiments were performed to explore and highlight the impact and potential of semantics for this task. In each experiment CORINE LULC data was used as a ground truth and predicted using imagery from Sentinel-2 and semantics from LinkedGeoData using deep learning. Our results reveal that LULC can be classified from semantics only and that fusing semantics with imagery-Semantic Boosting-improved the classification with significantly higher LULC accuracies. The results show that some LULC classes are better predicted using only semantics, others with just imagery, and importantly much of the improvement was due to the ability to separate similar land use classes. A number of key considerations are discussed.

TI  - Prognostic Significance of Subungual Anatomic Site in Acral Lentiginous Melanoma
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context.-Acral lentiginous melanoma is a rare and aggressive type of cutaneous melanoma that arises on the acral skin and the nail unit. The prognostic significance of subungual anatomic site in acral lentiginous melanoma is not established.Objective.-To assess the impact of subungual anatomic site on overall survival and disease-specific survival in acral lentiginous melanoma.Design.-Retrospective cohort analysis. Clinicopathologic characteristics of 627 primary acral lentiginous melanomas (45 [7%] subungual and 582 [93%] non-subungual) were summarized, and the impact of these characteristics on overall survival and disease-specific survival was determined using univariate and multivariable analyses.Results.-No significant differences in clinicopathologic features were identified between the subungual and nonsubungual acral lentiginous melanomas. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival rates were 81%, 40%, and 28%, respectively, for subungual acral lentiginous mela-noma and 94%, 59%, and 38%, respectively, for nonsubungual acral lentiginous melanoma (P = .04); risk of death was significantly higher for subungual tumors (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.59 [1.02-2.50]; P = .04). The 1-, 5-, and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were 94%, 56%, and 48%, respectively, for subungual acral lentiginous melanoma versus 96%, 69%, and 55%, respectively, for nonsubungual acral lentiginous melanoma (P = .18). By multivariable analysis, independent poor prognostic factors included older age and ulceration for overall survival and greater Breslow thickness and sentinel lymph node positivity for overall survival and disease-specific survival. Subungual anatomic site was not an independent prognostic factor for overall or disease-specific survival.Conclusions.-Subungual anatomic site is not an independent prognostic factor for acral lentiginous melanoma.

TI  - Assessment of FSDAF Accuracy on Cotton Yield Estimation Using Different MODIS Products and Landsat Based on the Mixed Degree Index with Different Surroundings
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on fusion modeling of high spatial and temporal resolution images typically uses MODIS products at 500 m and 250 m resolution with Landsat images at 30 m, but the effect on results of the date of reference images and the 'mixed pixels' nature of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images are not often considered. In this study, we evaluated those effects using the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion model (FSDAF) to generate fusion images with both high spatial resolution and frequent coverage over three cotton field plots in the San Joaquin Valley of California, USA. Landsat images of different dates (day-of-year (DOY) 174, 206, and 254, representing early, middle, and end stages of the growing season, respectively) were used as reference images in fusion with two MODIS products (MOD09GA and MOD13Q1) to produce new time-series fusion images with improved temporal sampling over that provided by Landsat alone. The impact on the accuracy of yield estimation of the different Landsat reference dates, as well as the degree of mixing of the two MODIS products, were evaluated. A mixed degree index (MDI) was constructed to evaluate the accuracy and time-series fusion results of the different cotton plots, after which the different yield estimation models were compared. The results show the following: (1) there is a strong correlation (above 0.6) between cotton yield and both the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat (NDVIL30) and NDVI from the fusion of Landsat with MOD13Q1 (NDVIF250). (2) Use of a mid-season Landsat image as reference for the fusion of MODIS imagery provides a better yield estimation, 14.73% and 17.26% higher than reference images from early or late in the season, respectively. (3) The accuracy of the yield estimation model of the three plots is different and relates to the MDI of the plots and the types of surrounding crops. These results can be used as a reference for data fusion for vegetation monitoring using remote sensing at the field scale.

TI  - Variation in fractional vegetation cover and its attribution analysis of different regions of Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Region, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the MODIS NDVI data from 2000 to 2018, we estimated the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) using the dimidiate pixel model and analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of FVC in the Beijing-Tianjin sand source region (BTSSR). The geographical detector model was used to estimate the impacts of natural and human factors on FVC spatial distribution at the regional scale. The results showed that the FVC of the BBTSR showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2018, with an annual growth rate of 0.013 . (10 a)(-1) and a vegetation increase rate of 8.2%. The area with high FVC was concentrated in the Yanshan Mountain water source protection area, followed by the pastoral transitional zone desertified land control area and the Otindag sandy land area. The area with poor FVC was concentrated in the northern arid grassland area. The explanatory power of driving factors to FVC varied across different regions. Among the natural factors, annual precipitation was the main driving factor for the spatial distribution of FVC in the northern arid grassland area, the Otindag sandy land area and the Yanshan Mountain water source protection area. Slope was the main driving factor for the spatial distribution of FVC in the pastoral transitional zone desertified land control area. Among different human activities, the number of large livestock at the year-end was the main driving factor controlling the spatial distribution of FVC in the northern arid grassland area and the pastoral transitional zone desertified land control area, while population density was the main driving factor controlling the spatial distribution of FVC in the Otindag sandy land area and the Yanshan Mountain water source protection area. There were regional differences in the influence of other factors on FVC spatial distribution. The results of the interaction detector showed that the two-factor interactions were mainly the double-synergy and nonlinear synergy. The interaction of human activities with annual precipitation and slope could more fully explain the spatial variations of FVC. The range of suitable vegetation growth identified by the risk detector was the area with annual precipitation of 316.4-486.0 mm, average relative humidity of 48.4%-57.6%, and average annual temperature of 2.5-7.9 degrees C, while other driving factors were different in different zones.

T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focused to analyze the main human-induced land use and/or cover changes and their impact on the response to surface runoff from the Hayk Lake endorheic basin between 1989 and 2015. The investigation of Landsat images of years 1989, 2000 and 2015 with the aid of ArcGIS 10.1 indicated an increase in cultivation land by 137.74% at the disbursement of a decrease of 1.34% in lake water, 49.48% in shrubland, 55.84% in plantation, and 17.32% in grassland. Overall accuracy (92%-96%) and kappa values (0.90-0.95) proved that the image classifications were accurate. The impact of the changed land use and/or cover on surface runoff was investigated by simulating the surface runoff for the years 1989, 2000 and 2015, and then quantifying the individual rate of contribution of land use and/or cover change on the magnitude of simulated surface runoff using HEC-HMS modeling tool. The analysis found that land use and cover change alone increased surface runoff by 20.18% and that climate change reduced surface runoff by 120.18%. The combined effect reduced surface runoff and caused a continued decline in water level at Hayk Lake. Therefore, this study advocated basin-based lake water management strategies linked to the negative impacts of land use and land cover, and climate change on the water balance of Hayk Lake for its sustainability.

TI  - Quantifying Surface-Height Change Over a Periglacial Environment With ICESat-2 Laser Altimetry
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We use Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) laser altimetry crossovers and repeat tracks collected over the North Slope of Alaska to estimate ground surface-height change due to the seasonal freezing and thawing of the active layer. We compare these measurements to a time series of surface deformation from Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and demonstrate agreement between these independent observations of surface deformation at broad spatial scales. We observe a relationship between ICESat-2-derived surface subsidence/uplift and changes in normalized accumulated degree days, which is consistent with the thermodynamically driven seasonal freezing and thawing of the active layer. Integrating ICESat-2 crossover estimates of surface-height change yields an annual time series of surface-height change that is sensitive to changes in snow cover during spring and thawing of the active layer throughout spring and summer. Furthermore, this time series exhibits temporal correlation with independent reanalysis datasets of temperature and snow cover, as well as an InSAR-derived time series. ICESat-2-derived surface-height change estimates can be significantly affected by short length-scale topographic gradients and changes in snow cover and snow depth. We discuss optimal strategies of post-processing ICESat-2 data for permafrost applications, as well as the future potential of joint ICESat-2 and InSAR investigations of permafrost surface-dynamics.Plain Language Summary NASA's Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) was designed to accurately measure surface heights in order to study changes to Earth's ice sheets, sea ice, and biomass. In this paper, we analyze changes in estimated surface-height from ICESat-2 data collected over an area in the Alaskan Arctic, where seasonal freezing and thawing of the ground causes the Earth's surface to deform with time. We compare these estimates of surface-height change with independent estimates of surface deformation acquired by the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 spacecraft, which was specifically designed to precisely measure surface deformation. By comparing changes in estimated surface height from the ICESat-2 mission to surface deformation measurements from Sentinel-1, we demonstrate agreement of the estimated spatial patterns of surface deformation, suggesting that ICESat-2 data can be used to quantify surface dynamics in tundras. Further, the different strengths of ICESat-2 laser altimetry and Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) could be jointly leveraged to provide novel insights into periglacial surface processes. We discuss several phenomena that can complicate ICESat-2 surface-height change estimation and introduce errors, as well as future methods that might be employed to mitigate such errors.

TI  - Assessment of Sentinel-2 Images, Support Vector Machines and Change Detection Algorithms for Bark Beetle Outbreaks Mapping in the Tatra Mountains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cambiophagous insects, fires and windthrow cause significant forest disturbances, generating ecological changes and economical losses. The bark beetle (Ips typographus L.), inhabiting coniferous forests and eliminating weakened trees, plays a key role in posing a threat to tree stands, which are dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies) and covers a large part of mountain areas, as well as the lowlands of Northern, Central and Eastern Europe. Due to the dynamics of the phenomena taking place, the EU recommends constant monitoring of forests in terms of large-area disturbances and factors affecting tree stands' susceptibility to destruction. The right tools for this are multispectral satellite images, which regularly and free of charge provide up-to-date information on changes in the environment. The aim of this study was to develop a method of identifying disturbances of spruce stands, including the identification of bark beetle outbreaks. Sentinel 2 images from 2015-2018 were used for this purpose; the reference data were high-resolution aerial images, satellite WorldView 2, as well as field verification data. Support Vector Machines (SVM) distinguished six classes: deciduous forests, coniferous forests, grasslands, rocks, snags (dieback of standing trees) and cuts/windthrow. Remote sensing vegetation indices, Multivariate Alteration Detection (MAD), Multivariate Alteration Detection/Maximum Autocorrelation Factor (MAD/MAF), iteratively re-weighted Multivariate Alteration Detection (iMAD) and trained SVM signatures from another year, stacked band rasters allowed us to identify: (1) no changes; (2) dieback of standing trees; (3) logging or falling down of trees. The overall accuracy of the SVM classification oscillated between 97-99%; it was observed that in 2015-2018, as a result of the windthrow and bark beetle outbreaks and the consequences of those natural disturbances (e.g., sanitary cuts), approximately 62.5 km(2) of coniferous stands (29%) died in the studied area of the Tatra Mountains.

TI  - Modeling of aquifer potentiality using GIS-based knowledge-driven technique: a case study of hard rock geological setting, southwestern Nigeria
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial prediction of how aquifers store and transmit sufficient groundwater in subtle hydrogeological conditions typical of crystalline basement complex is quite challenging. This study explored diverse methodologies including remote sensing, geophysical and knowledge-driven data mining model for possible solution. The acquired geophysical, remote sensed, ancillary, and climate data were processed applying geophysical and geospatial software to determine both subsurface geophysical parameters (SGPs) and surface hydrological parameters (SHPs). Five aquifer potentiality conditioning factors (APCFs) based on the results of the interpreted SGPs and SHPs were derived. The produced APCFs maps were assigned suitable weights using the standard Saaty's scale in the context of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) data mining technique. An aquifer potentiality prediction index (APPI) data mining model was developed for integrating the APCFs maps to compute the APPI values in the range of 1.24-4.37 for the study area. Based on the estimated APPI results, the aquifer potentiality prediction zone (APPZ) map of the area was produced in GIS environment. The map revealed that about 76% of the areal extent account for the very low, low, and medium predicted aquifer potential classes and 24% of the area covers the moderate-high to high aquifer potential classes. The prediction accuracy of the produced APPZ map was established via statistical analysis of Borehole yield rate and Geoelectrical Parameters in-situ Modeling validations results. The results of the study established the new approach of modeling SGPs and SHPs to inform decision-making process for locating appropriate positions of new productive wells in the study area.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Impacts of Urban Land Use/Land Cover Changes on Land Surface Temperature: A Comparative Study of Damascus and Aleppo (Syria)
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the impact of changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) is of great importance in environmental and urban studies. In this context, this study aimed to analyze the dynamics of LULC and its impact on the spatiotemporal variation of the LST in the two largest urban cities in Syria, Damascus, and Aleppo. To achieve this, LULC changes, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and LST were calculated from multi-temporal Landsat data for the period 2010 to 2018. The study revealed significant changes in LULC, which were represented by a decrease in agricultural land and green areas and an increase in bare areas in both cities. In addition, built-up areas decreased in Aleppo and increased in Damascus during the study period. The temporal and spatial variation of the LST and its distribution pattern was closely related to the effect of changes in LULC as well as to land use conditions in each city. This effect was greater in Aleppo than in Damascus, where Aleppo recorded a higher increase in the mean LST, by about 2 degrees C, than in Damascus, where it was associated with greater degradation and loss of vegetation cover. In general, there was an increasing trend in the minimum and maximum LST as well as an increasing trend in the mean LST in both cities. The negative linear relationship between LST and NDVI confirms that vegetation cover can help reduce LST in both cities. This study can draw the attention of relevant departments to pay more attention to mitigating the negative impact of LULC changes in order to limit the increase in LST.

TI  - Persistence of marine heat waves for coral bleaching and their spectral characteristics around Andaman coral reef
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reefs are fragile and endangered ecosystems in the tropical marine and coastal environment. Thermal stress due to marine heat waves (MHW) could cause significantly negative impacts on the health conditions, i.e., bleaching of the coral ecosystem. The current study is an attempt to quantify the intensity of coral bleaching in the Andaman region in recent decades using the intensity of marine heat wave (IMHW) estimated from satellite measured sea surface temperature (SST). A linear regression model was developed between IMHW and in situ observations of percent coral bleaching (PCB) which has the slope 7.767 (of IMHW unit) and intercept (- 141.7). Further, an attempt was also made to establish the relationship between PCB and the ratio between the remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at 443 and 531 nm to upscale the percentage of coral bleaching at synoptic scales. A significant positive correlation between the PCB and band ratio index was found (R-2 = 0.72). This approach can be used for the operational monitoring of coral reef beaching in this region.

TI  - Soil Moisture Estimates in a Grass Field Using Sentinel-1 Radar Data and an Assimilation Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The new constellation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite, Sentinel-1, provides images at a high spatial resolution (up to 10 m) typical of radar sensors, but also at high time resolutions (6-12 revisit days), representing a major advance for the development of operational soil moisture mapping at a plot scale. Our objective was to develop and test an operational approach to assimilate Sentinel 1 observations in a land surface model, and to demonstrate the potential of the use of the new satellite sensors in soil moisture predictions in a grass field. However, for soil moisture retrievals from Sentinel 1 observations in grasslands, there is still the need to identify robust and parsimonious solutions, accounting for the effects of vegetation attenuation and their seasonal variability. In a grass experimental site in Sardinia, where field measurements of soil moisture were available for the 2016-2018 period, three common retrieval methods have been compared to estimate soil moisture from Sentinel 1 data, with increasing complexity and physical interpretation of the processes: the empirical change detection method, the semi-empirical Dubois model, and the physically-based Fung model. In operational approaches for soil moisture mapping from remote sensing, the parameterization simplification of soil moisture retrieval techniques is encouraged, looking for parameter estimates without a priori information. We have proposed a simplified approach for estimating a key parameter of retrieval methods, the surface roughness, from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived by simultaneous Sentinel 2 optical observations. Soil moisture was estimated better using the proposed approach and the Dubois model than by using the other methods, which accounted vegetation effects through the common water cloud model. Furthermore, we successfully merged radar-based soil moisture observations and a land surface model, through a data assimilation approach based on the Ensemble Kalman filter, providing robust predictions of soil moisture.

TI  - Progress in Grassland Cover Conservation in Southern European Mountains by 2020: A Transboundary Assessment in the Iberian Peninsula with Satellite Observations (2002-2019)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation and policy agendas, such as the European Biodiversity strategy, Aichi biodiversity (target 5) and Common Agriculture Policy (CAP), are overlooking the progress made in mountain grassland cover conservation by 2020, which has significant socio-ecological implications to Europe. However, because the existing data near 2020 is scarce, the shifting character of mountain grasslands remains poorly characterized, and even less is known about the conservation outcomes because of different governance regimes and map uncertainty. Our study used Landsat satellite imagery over a transboundary mountain region in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula (Peneda-Geres) to shed light on these aspects. Supervised classifications with a multiple classifier ensemble approach (MCE) were performed, with post classification comparison of maps established and bias-corrected to identify the trajectory in grassland cover, including protected and unprotected governance regimes. By analysing class-allocation (Shannon entropy), creating 95% confidence intervals for the area estimates, and evaluating the class-allocation thematic accuracy relationship, we characterized uncertainty in the findings. The bias-corrected estimates suggest that the positive progress claimed internationally by 2020 was not achieved. Our null hypothesis to declare a positive progress (at least equality in the proportion of grassland cover of 2019 and 2002) was rejected (X2 = 1972.1, df = 1, p < 0.001). The majority of grassland cover remained stable (67.1 +/- 10.1 relative to 2002), but loss (-32.8 +/- 7.1% relative to 2002 grasslands cover) overcame gain areas (+11.4 +/- 6.6%), indicating net loss as the prevailing pattern over the transboundary study area (-21.4%). This feature prevailed at all extents of analysis (lowlands, -22.9%; mountains, -17.9%; mountains protected, -14.4%; mountains unprotected, -19.7%). The results also evidenced that mountain protected governance regimes experienced a lower decline in grassland extent compared to unprotected. Shannon entropy values were also significantly lower in correctly classified validation sites (z = -5.69, p = 0.0001, n = 708) suggesting a relationship between the quality of pixel assignment and thematic accuracy. We therefore encourage a post-2020 conservation and policy action to safeguard mountain grasslands by enhancing the role of protected governance regimes. To reduce uncertainty, grassland gain mapping requires additional remote sensing research to find the most adequate spatial and temporal data resolution to retrieve this process.

TI  - Ecological corridors in Costa Rica: An evaluation applying landscape structure, fragmentation-connectivity process, and climate adaptation.
T2  - Conservation Science and Practice
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, ecological corridors have been proposed on a global scale as a response to the accelerated process of natural ecosystem fragmentation, mainly as a result of human impact. In accordance with this trend, Costa Rica has undergone a process of implementing ecological corridors as to promote ecological connectivity since the 1990s, with the establishment of 44 ecological corridors covering 38% of Costa Rica's territory. Nevertheless, there is no research evaluating these corridors on a national scale that takes into account their functions as conduits, barriers, and habitats. Thus, the objective of this research was to describe the process of biological corridor formation in Costa Rica, and to evaluate the potential effectiveness of corridors by considering aspects of landscape structure and ecological processes related to connectivity and fragmentation. We used the National Program of Ecological Corridors database along with coverage analysis from Landsat images from 2000 and 2015.The composition of the biological corridors was determined at the landscape scale and related to potential to maintain a specific population of wild mammals weighing more than 10 kg. The composition of the ecological corridors was highly variable in terms of total area, proportion of natural habitat, and fragmentation process. Most biological corridors are capable of maintaining viable populations of Pecari tajacu and Tapir bairdii, while none could maintain populations of Panthera onca and Tayassu pecari. Only 50% of the biological corridors had improved in their connectivity. Therefore, public policies, such as master plans focusing on ecosystem restoration must be established. In addition, only two biological corridors incorporate the majority of elevation ranges (Life Zones) present in the country, which reduces the potential of the corridor system as a tool for climate change adaptation.

TI  - Development and Application of Earth Observation Based Machine Learning Methods for Characterizing Forest and Land Cover Change in Dilijan National Park of Armenia between 1991 and 2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dilijan National Park is one of the most important national parks of Armenia, established in 2002 to protect its rich biodiversity of flora and fauna and to prevent illegal logging. The aim of this study is to provide first, a mapping of forest degradation and deforestation, and second, of land cover/land use changes every 5 years over a 28-year monitoring cycle from 1991 to 2019, using Sentinel-2 and Landsat time series and Machine Learning methods. Very High Spatial Resolution imagery was used for calibration and validation purposes of forest density modelling and related changes. Correlation coefficient R-2 between forest density map and reference values ranges from 0.70 for the earliest epoch to 0.90 for the latest one. Land cover/land use classification yield good results with most classes showing high users' and producers' accuracies above 80%. Although forest degradation and deforestation which initiated about 30 years ago was restrained thanks to protection measures, anthropogenic pressure remains a threat with the increase in settlements, tourism, or agriculture. This case study can be used as a decision-support tool for the Armenian Government for sustainable forest management and policies and serve as a model for a future nationwide forest monitoring system.

TI  - 'The Best of Two Worlds'-Combining Classifier Fusion and Ecological Models to Map and Explain Landscape Invasion by an Alien Shrub
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spread of invasive alien species promotes ecosystem structure and functioning changes, with detrimental effects on native biodiversity and ecosystem services, raising challenges for local management authorities. Predictions of invasion dynamics derived from modeling tools are often spatially coarse and therefore unsuitable for guiding local management. Accurate information on the occurrence of invasive plants and on the main factors that promote their spread is critical to define successful control strategies. For addressing this challenge, we developed a dual framework combining satellite image classification with predictive ecological modeling. By combining data from georeferenced invaded areas with multispectral imagery with 10-meter resolution from Sentinel-2 satellites, a map of areas invaded by the woody invasive Acacia longifolia in a municipality of northern Portugal was devised. Classifier fusion techniques were implemented through which eight statistical and machine-learning algorithms were ensembled to produce accurate maps of invaded areas. Through a Random Forest (RF) model, these maps were then used to explore the factors driving the landscape-level abundance of A. longifolia. RF models were based on explanatory variables describing hypothesized environmental drivers, including climate, topography/geomorphology, soil properties, fire disturbance, landscape composition, linear structures, and landscape spatial configuration. Satellite-based maps synoptically described the spatial patterns of invaded areas, with classifications attaining high accuracy values (True Skill Statistic, TSS: 0.895, Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve, ROC: 0.988, Kappa: 0.857). The predictive RF models highlighted the primary role of climate, followed by landscape composition and configuration, as the most important drivers explaining the species abundance at the landscape level. Our innovative dual framework-combining image classification and predictive ecological modeling-can guide decision-making processes regarding effective management of invasions by prioritizing the invaded areas and tackling the primary environmental and anthropogenic drivers of the species' abundance and spread.

TI  - Current concepts of ectopic nodal inclusions with special emphasis on nodal nevi
T2  - JOURNAL DER DEUTSCHEN DERMATOLOGISCHEN GESELLSCHAFT
M3  - Review
AB  - Nodal inclusions of ectopic tissue within lymph nodes are seen comparatively often in dermatopathology and general pathology. Glandular and nonglandular epithelium, as well as melanocytic nevi can be observed within lymph nodes and represent mostly incidental findings without any relevance. The main challenge in reporting these morphologic features is to differentiate such benign inclusions from metastatic settlements of distinct organ tumors. As sentinel node biopsy and lymph node dissection have become standard procedure in clinical oncology and have an immense clinical impact, the correct evaluation of these nodal inclusions is indispensable to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment of patients. In addition, the genesis of these inclusions has not yet been satisfactorily clarified. Two concepts have been laid out: the theory of benign metastases and the migration arrest theory. However, neither theory has so far been able to answer the following questions: Why do we find more nodal nevi in patients with melanoma who had a sentinel node biopsy than in patients without melanoma, and why do we not find nodal nevi in deep visceral lymph nodes? We present a comprehensive review of the current knowledge on nodal inclusions, proposing a concept for the pathogenesis of nodal nevi, to answer these questions.

TI  - Options to Determine Pathological Response of Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Advanced Breast Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Neoadjuvant therapy instituted prior to definitive surgery helps to reduce the tumor burden in the breast and axilla. De-escalation of surgery in the axilla may allow removal of just the involved nodes and sentinel nodes for determination of pathological response of previously biopsy proven positive axillary nodes. In order to attain the optimal surgical results with minimum risk of complications, it is important to choose the accurate method of identification of these positive nodes. In this review, we examine the different options to assure identification of the nodes deemed positive before neoadjuvant therapy, at the time of definitive surgery. Increasing use of neoadjuvant therapy in large tumors or node positive disease in breast cancer patients or hormone negative and HER 2 overexpressing cancers often gives rise to complete clinical response, with resolution of disease in the breast and axilla. These results have raised important questions to deescalate loco-regional surgical treatment options with minimum recurrence risk and treatment related morbidity. Although there is excellent prognosis following clinical response, the primary goal of surgery still remains to confirm complete pathological response in the biopsied node that was previously positive and now clinically/radiologically negative (ycN0). Biopsied lymph nodes are often marked with a clip to allow future identification at the time of definitive surgery. The goal of lymph node surgery in oncology is that it should be accurate, hence the significance of localizing the biopsied node. This article aims to review the different options to localize the deemed positive node at the time of definitive surgery, in order to help determine pathological response after neoadjuvant therapy.

TI  - Adaptive Crop Management under Climate Uncertainty: Changing the Game for Sustainable Water Use
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Water supplies are projected to become increasingly scarce, driving farmers, energy producers, and urban dwellers towards an urgent and emerging need to improve the effectiveness and the efficiency of water use. Given that agricultural water use is the largest water consumer throughout the U.S. Southwest, this study sought to answer two specific research questions: (1) How does water consumption vary by crop type on a metropolitan spatial scale? (2) What is the impact of drought on agricultural water consumption? To answer the above research questions, 92 Landsat images were acquired to generate fine-resolution daily evapotranspiration (ET) maps at 30 m spatial resolution for both dry and wet years (a total of 1095 ET maps), and major crop types were identified for the Phoenix Active Management Area. The study area has a subtropical desert climate and relies almost completely on irrigation for farming. Results suggest that there are some factors that farmers and water managers can control. During dry years, crops of all types use more water. Practices that can offset this higher water use include double or multiple cropping practice, drought tolerant crop selection, and optimizing the total farmed area. Double and multiple cropping practices result in water savings because soil moisture is retained from one planting to another. Further water savings occur when drought tolerant crop types are selected, especially in dry years. Finally, disproportionately large area coverage of high water consuming crops can be balanced and/or reduced or replaced with more water efficient crops. This study provides strong evidence that water savings can be achieved through policies that create incentives for adopting smart cropping strategies, thus providing important guidelines for sustainable agriculture management and climate adaptation to improve future food security.

TI  - Prediction of Urban Area Expansion with Implementation of MLC, SAM and SVMs' Classifiers Incorporating Artificial Neural Network Using Landsat Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A reliable land cover (LC) map is essential for planners, as missing proper land cover maps may deviate a project. This study is focusing on land cover classification and prediction using three well known classifiers and remote sensing data. Maximum Likelihood classifier (MLC), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) algorithms are used as the representatives for parametric, non-parametric and subpixel capable methods for change detection and change prediction of Urmia City (Iran) and its suburbs. Landsat images of 2000, 2010, and 2020 have been used to provide land cover information. The results demonstrated 0.93-0.94 overall accuracies for MLC and SVMs' algorithms, but it was around 0.79 for the SAM algorithm. The MLC performed slightly better than SVMs' classifier. Cellular Automata Artificial neural network method was used to predict land cover changes. Overall accuracy of MLC was higher than others at about 0.94 accuracy, although, SVMs were slightly more accurate for large area segments. Land cover maps were predicted for 2030, which demonstrate the city's expansion from 5500 ha in 2000 to more than 9000 ha in 2030.

TI  - The Interplay between Canopy Structure and Topography and Its Impacts on Seasonal Variations in Surface Reflectance Patterns in the Boreal Region of Alaska-Implications for Surface Radiation Budget
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play an essential role in maintaining the Earth's overall energy balance. The variability in forest canopy structure, topography, and underneath vegetation background conditions create uncertainty in modeling solar radiation at the Earth's surface, particularly for boreal regions in high latitude. The purpose of this study is to analyze seasonal variation in visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared reflectance with respect to land cover classes, canopy structures, and topography in a boreal region of Alaska. We accomplished this investigation by fusing Landsat 8 images and LiDAR-derived canopy structural data and multivariate statistical analysis. Our study shows that canopy structure and topography interplay and influence reflectance spectra in a complex way, particularly during the snow season. We observed that deciduous trees, also tall with greater rugosity, are more dominant on the southern slope than on the northern slope. Taller trees are typically seen in higher elevations regardless of vegetation types. Surface reflectance in all studied wavelengths shows similar relationships with canopy cover, height, and rugosity, mainly due to close connections between these parameters. Visible and near-infrared reflectance decreases with canopy cover, tree height, and rugosity, especially for the evergreen forest. Deciduous forest shows more considerable variability of surface reflectance in all studied wavelengths, particularly in March, mainly due to the mixing effect of snow and vegetation. The multivariate statistical analysis demonstrates a significant tree shadow effect on surface reflectance for evergreen forests. However, the topographic shadow effect is prominent for deciduous forests during the winter season. These results provide great insight into understanding the role of vegetation structure and topography in surface radiation budget in the boreal region.

TI  - Clinical Outcomes in Clinical N0 Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Penis According to Nodal Management: Early, Delayed or Selective (following Dynamic Sentinel Node Biopsy) Inguinal Lymph-Node Dissection
T2  - JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: We evaluated the oncologic efficacy of early inguinal lymph-node dissection, observation or dynamic sentinel node biopsy followed by delayed or selective inguinal lymph-node dissection in cN0 patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma.Materials and Methods: Between 1980 and 2017 (inclusive), 296 evaluable consecutive cN0 penile squamous cell carcinoma patients underwent early inguinal lymphnode dissection (16), observation (114) or dynamic sentinel node biopsy (166). Median followup was 50 months. Tumor stage, grade, lympho-vascular invasion and age were considered. Kaplan-Meier plots illustrated 5-year inguinal relapse-free and cancer specific survival rates. Multivariable Cox regression models tested the treatment effect. Analyses were repeated after inverse probability of treatment weighting adjustment.Results: The 5-year inguinal relapse-free survival and cancer specific survival rates following early, observation and dynamic sentinel node biopsy inguinal lymph-node dissection were 100%, 87%, 89%, and 84%, 81%, 85%, respectively. The 5-year crude inguinal relapse-free survival and cancer specific survival rates were 90% and 93% in low-risk patients undergoing observation. Clavien grade 3 complications were 0.6 vs 12.5% in the dynamic sentinel node biopsy and early inguinal lymph-node dissection group, respectively. After inverse probability after treatment weighting adjustment, 5-year inguinal relapse and cancer specific survival were 90% vs 73% and 90% vs 77% following dynamic sentinel node biopsy and observation, respectively. At multivariable Cox regression model, patients undergoing dynamic sentinel node biopsy had significantly lower inguinal relapse (HR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.85, p 0.02) and cancer specific mortality (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11-0.77; p = 0.01) compared to those under observation. The low number of patients undergoing early inguinal lymph-node dissection made a reliable comparison with this group impractical.Conclusions: Selective inguinal lymph-node dissection following dynamic sentinel node biopsy significantly improved inguinal relapse and cancer specific mortality when compared with observation, providing evidence of efficacy of dynamic sentinel node biopsy in clinical stage N0 squamous cell carcinoma of the penis.

TI  - Entomological Survey Confirms Changes in Mosquito Composition and Abundance in Senegal and Reveals Discrepancies among Results by Different Host-Seeking Female Traps
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, arbovirosis and lymphatic filariasis are major public health issues, particularly in Africa. In order to predict the risk of transmission of these diseases and plan optimal mosquito control interventions, it is vital to have updated information of the mosquito species present, as each of them has a different capacity to transmit different pathogens, and to monitor how these species vary over time, also in relation to environmental and climatic changes. This is achieved by entomological monitoring carried out by various types of traps, whose collection efficacy may vary depending on the mosquito species and the ecological and climatic situation. We carried out collections in two villages in Senegal and showed evidence of a decline of malaria vector species and an increase of lymphatic filarial vectors. Moreover, we showed that using different traps to collect female mosquitoes may provide different estimates of mosquito species composition over time, depending on geographical setting and season. This is very relevant for a correct planning of mosquito monitoring and for appropriate interpretation of the results. Mosquitoes-borne diseases are major public health issues particularly in Africa. Vector control interventions and human-made environmental/climatic changes significantly affect the distribution and abundance of vector species. We carried out an entomological survey targeting host-seeking mosquitos in two different ecological contexts-coastal and inland-in Senegal, by CDC-light and BG-sentinel traps. Results show high predominance of Culex quinquefasciatus (90%) and of Anopheles arabiensis within malaria vectors (46%), with mean numbers of females/trap/nights =8 and <1, respectively, reinforcing previous evidence of changes in species composition and abundance, highlighting thus increasing risk of transmission of filariasis and emerging arboviruses in the Senegambia region. From the methodological perspective, results show a higher specificity of BG traps for Cx. quinquefasciatus and of CDC traps for An. gambiae s.l. and highlight that, despite both traps target the host-seeking fraction of the population, they provide different patterns of species abundance, temporal dynamics and host-seeking activity, leading to possible misinterpretation of the species bionomics. This draws attention to the need of taking into account trapping performance, in order to provide realistic quantification of the number of mosquitoes per units of space and time, the crucial parameter for evaluating vector-human contact, and estimating risk of pathogen transmission.

TI  - Online Multiview Deep Forest for Remote Sensing Image Classification via Data Fusion
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data can be sequentially acquired from different sources or feature spaces, which are regarded as multiple views. For the classification task where the training data arrive in a sequence, online learning (OL) methods are effective by learning new knowledge from incoming samples incrementally. However, it is known that shallow OL models usually have limited performance. In this letter, an online multiview deep forest (OMDF) architecture is proposed, which consists of multiple layers and employs a cascade structure. Each layer is an ensemble of multiple random forests, which process data from different views, respectively. For each view, the outputs of one layer concatenated with the original feature are fed into the next layer. The proposed method learns a deep forest model in an online manner from a stream of multiview data. The structure of every random forest and the weights adjusting the importance among different views will be updated dynamically. Experimental results on multifeature or multifrequency PolSAR data and the fusion of PolSAR and optical data demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve higher test accuracy and significantly improve the performance, especially on small-scale training data, compared with the other methods.

TI  - On the Value of Sentinel-1 InSAR Coherence Time-Series for Vegetation Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisitions are mainly deemed suitable for mapping dynamic land-cover and land-use scenarios due to their timeliness and reliability. This particularly applies to Sentinel-1 imagery. Nevertheless, the accurate mapping of regions characterized by a mixture of crops and grasses can still represent a challenge. Radar time-series have to date mainly been exploited through backscatter intensities, whereas only fewer contributions have focused on analyzing the potential of interferometric information, intuitively enhanced by the short revisit. In this paper, we evaluate, as primary objective, the added value of short-temporal baseline coherences over a complex agricultural area in the Sao Paulo state, cultivated with heterogeneously (asynchronously) managed annual crops, grasses for pasture and sugarcane plantations. We also investigated the sensitivity of the radar information to the classification methods as well as to the data preparation and sampling practices. Two supervised machine learning methods-namely support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)-were applied to the Sentinel-1 time-series at the pixel and field levels. The results highlight that an improvement of 10 percentage points (p.p.) in the classification accuracy can be achieved by using the coherence in addition to the backscatter intensity and by combining co-polarized (VV) and cross-polarized (VH) information. It is shown that the largest contribution in class discrimination is brought during winter, when dry vegetation and bare soils can be expected. One of the added values of coherence was indeed identified in the enhanced sensitivity to harvest events in a small but significant number of cases.

TI  - European Space Agency (ESA) Calibration/Validation Strategy for Optical Land-Imaging Satellites and Pathway towards Interoperability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Land remote sensing capabilities in the optical domain have dramatically increased in the past decade, owing to the unprecedented growth of space-borne systems providing a wealth of measurements at enhanced spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions. Yet, critical questions remain as how to unlock the potential of such massive amounts of data, which are complementary in principle but inherently diverse in terms of products specifications, algorithm definition and validation approaches. Likewise, there is a recent increase in spatiotemporal coverage of in situ reference data, although inconsistencies in the used measurement practices and in the associated quality information still hinder their integrated use for satellite products validation. In order to address the above-mentioned challenges, the European Space Agency (ESA), in collaboration with other Space Agencies and international partners, is elaborating a strategy for establishing guidelines and common protocols for the calibration and validation (Cal/Val) of optical land imaging sensors. Within this paper, this strategy will be illustrated and put into the context of current validation systems for land remote sensing. A reinforced focus on metrology is the basic principle underlying such a strategy, since metrology provides the terminology, the framework and the best practices, allowing to tie measurements acquired from a variety of sensors to internationally agreed upon standards. From this general concept, a set of requirements are derived on how the measurements should be acquired, analysed and quality reported to users using unified procedures. This includes the need for traceability, a fully characterised uncertainty budget and adherence to community-agreed measurement protocols. These requirements have led to the development of the Fiducial Reference Measurements (FRM) concept, which is promoted by the ESA as the recommended standard within the satellite validation community. The overarching goal is to enhance user confidence in satellite-based data and characterise inter-sensor inconsistencies, starting from at-sensor radiances and paving the way to achieving the interoperability of current and future land-imaging systems.

TI  - Analysis on the Variation of Hydro-Meteorological Variables in the Yongding River Mountain Area Driven by Multiple Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, strong human activities have not only brought about climate change including both global warming and shifts in the weather patterns but have also caused anomalous variations of hydrological elements in different basins all around the world. Studying the mechanisms and causes of these hydrological variations scientifically is the basis for the management of water resources and the implementation of ecological protection. Therefore, taking the Yongding River mountain area as a representative watershed in China, the changes of different observed and simulated hydro-meteorological variables and their possible causes are analyzed on an inter-annual scale based on ground based observations and remotely sensed data of hydrology, meteorology and underlying surface characteristics from 1956 to 2016. The results show that the annual natural runoff of Guanting hydrological station in the main stream of the Yongding River, Cetian hydrological station and Xiangshuibao hydrological station in the tributary of the Yongding River all have a significant decreasing trend and abrupt changes, and all the abrupt change points of the annual natural runoff series of the three hydrological stations appear in the early 1980s. On the inter-annual scale, the water balance model with double parameters is unable to effectively simulate the natural surface runoff after the abrupt change points. The annual average precipitation after the abrupt change points decreases by no more than 10%, compared with that before the abrupt change points. However, the precipitation from July to August, which is the main runoff-production period, decreases by more than 25%, besides the intra-annual temporal distribution of precipitation becoming uniform and a significant decrease in effective rainfall, which is the source of the runoff. Meanwhile, the NDVI in the basin show an increasing trend, while the groundwater level and land water storage decrease significantly. These factors do not lead only to the continuous reduction of the annual natural runoff in the Yongding River mountain area from 1956 to 2016, but also result in significant changes of the hydro-meteorological relationship in the basin.

TI  - Empirical Approach for Modelling Tree Phenology in Mixed Forests Using Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenological events are good indicators of the effects of climate change, since phenological phases are sensitive to changes in environmental conditions. Although several national phenological networks monitor the phenology of different plant species, direct observations can only be conducted on individual trees, which cannot be easily extended over large and continuous areas. Remote sensing has often been applied to model phenology for large areas, focusing mostly on pure forests in which it is relatively easier to match vegetation indices with ground observations. In mixed forests, phenology modelling from remote sensing is often limited to land surface phenology, which consists of an overall phenology of all tree species present in a pixel. The potential of remote sensing for modelling the phenology of individual tree species in mixed forests remains underexplored. In this study, we applied the seasonal midpoint (SM) method with MODIS GPP to model the start of season (SOS) and the end of season (EOS) of six different tree species in Slovenian mixed forests. First, substitute locations were identified for each combination of observation station and plant species based on similar environmental conditions (aspect, slope, and altitude) and tree species of interest, and used to retrieve the remote sensing information used in the SM method after fitting the best of a Gaussian and two double logistic functions to each year of GPP time series. Then, the best thresholds were identified for SOS and EOS, and the results were validated using cross-validation. The results show clearly that the usual threshold of 0.5 is not best in most cases, especially for estimating the EOS. Despite the difficulty in modelling the phenology of different tree species in a mixed forest using remote sensing, it was possible to estimate SOS and EOS with moderate errors as low as <8 days (Fagus sylvatica and Tilia sp.) and <10 days (Fagus sylvatica and Populus tremula), respectively.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this project report, the main outcomes relevant to the Sino-European Dragon-4 cooperation project ID 32235 "Microwave satellite measurements for coastal area and extreme weather monitoring" are reported. The project aimed at strengthening the Sino-European research cooperation in the exploitation of European Space Agency, Chinese and third-party mission Earth Observation (EO) microwave satellite data. The latter were exploited to perform an effective monitoring of coastal areas, even under extreme weather conditions. An integrated multifrequency/polarization approach based on complementary microwave sensors (e.g., Synthetic Aperture Radar, scatterometer, radiometer), together with ancillary information coming from independent sources, i.e., optical imagery, numerical simulations and ground measurements, was designed. In this framework, several tasks were addressed including marine target detection, sea pollution, sea surface wind estimation and coastline extraction/classification. The main outcomes are both theoretical (i.e., new models and algorithms were developed) and applicative (i.e., user-friendly maps were provided to the end-user community of coastal area management according to smart processing of remotely sensed data). The scientific relevance consists in the development of new algorithms, the effectiveness and robustness of which were verified on actual microwave measurements, and the improvement of existing methodologies to deal with challenging test cases.

TI  - Geohazard characterization using remote sensing to model flash floods of the southeast Sinai, Egypt
T2  - INTERPRETATION-A JOURNAL OF SUBSURFACE CHARACTERIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods have led to disruptions of human activities and the destruction of properties particularly in the Nuweiba region of southeast Sinai. Despite the arid nature of Sinai, flash floods still pose a great hazard to the region. Using remote sensing characterization, geohazard models were developed to identify flash flood areas; delineate and discriminate morphological features, active channels areas, and soil physiography with a view to categorize risk areas exposed to flash floods hazards in a hazard map; and proffer measures for mitigation. The characterization was achieved using a workflow model developed from spatial data sets of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) and the red-green-blue (RGB) composites from Landsat bands 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+). The data were used to investigate and assess flash flood areas for morphological attributes, watershed basin characterization, and generation of false color composite from the Landsat 7 ETM+ 7, 4, and 2 RGB bands, and the principal component analysis band from a composite of 742 RGB. Multivariate analysis of generated raster layer attributes provided enhancements and attribute discrimination for delineating areas of active flood channels, upslope zones, and soil physiography discrimination from their spectral reflectance. The results are presented in an integrated approach of remote sensing with geographic information systems (GIS) and indicate that the soil types and geologic units contribute greatly toward activation of these flash floods, which is triggered by intense rainstorms. Components of the generated map attributes of SRTM DEM, gradient of DEM, and Landsat 7 ETM+ composite of 742 bands in GIS were used to generate a hazard map using spatial analysis to depict the nature and scale of the issues identified. Due to the flash flood vulnerabilities, the study area was classified into stable/low-, moderate-, and high-risk areas. Mitigation measures to control flash floods were proposed to enable adequate preparations to mitigate impending flash flood disasters.

TI  - The Positive Worldview of Teenage Schoolchildren as a Predictor of a Safe Educational Environment
T2  - REVISTA ROMANEASCA PENTRU EDUCATIE MULTIDIMENSIONALA
M3  - Article
AB  - The content of the article was determined by the problem of positive worldview formation of teenage schoolchildren as a predictor of a safe educational environment. The lack of qualitative characteristics of the educational environment and, in particular, its safety presupposes great difficulties in the personal development of schoolchildren during the period of maturation. Improving the level of psychological safety and psychological culture in the socio-cultural space is a preventative means of maintaining personal mental health. The early providing of purposeful psychological aid based on the principles of humanity and pragmatism determines the change in the mental reality of a person and limits the identification of psychopathological symptoms of development. The research was conducted on the basis of comprehensive schools of Kryvyi Rih city (Ukraine). To accomplish the task a comparative method of research organization (a cross section of data in different age groups of schoolchildren of the sample) was used. The methods employed in the research were designed to measure happiness in general, to estimate peculiarities of behavioral reactions in situations of uncertainty, to identify stress factors as positive worldview, confidence and constructive activity. For deeper analysis of the obtained data and revealing of dependence between indicators of worldview trends and the age of respondents a correlation analysis was carried out. The received data can be a basis for further research work in peculiarities of strategies of behavior of teenage schoolchildren.

M3  - Article
AB  - Anxiety and depression have become extremely widespread, with an average rate of anxiety and depression disorders of 7.3% and 4.4% respectively. Such conditions are associated with stress, feeling of emptiness and meaningless of existence, guilt and fear of death. Various mechanisms can be used for coping with stress. In many cases, people suffering from anxiety or depression require assistance of a psychologist, psychotherapist or psychiatrist. Meaning and value psychotherapy is an important element of anxiety and depression treatment. This work overviews the role Theology plays in meaning and value psychotherapy of anxiety and depression disorders. It demonstrates that Psychology and Theology use the same methods for combating anxiety and depression. The first stage of therapeutic effect comes through acceptance, i.e. grace. The second stage involves establishing a value-focused worldview. The final stages of therapeutical and religious influence pursue different goals. Psychotherapy is aimed at helping people realize their place in the society, making their nearest future meaningful and discovering a way out of a certain difficult situation. Religious influence, however, strives for achieving a higher meaning and finding an ultimate pathway.

TI  - The Role of Recent (1985-2014) Patterns of Land Abandonment and Environmental Factors in the Establishment and Growth of Secondary Forests in the Iberian Peninsula
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmland abandonment has been a widespread land-use change in the Iberian Peninsula since the second half of the 20th century, leading to the establishment of secondary forests across the region. In this study, we aimed to address changes in the recent (1985-2014) emergence patterns of these forests and examine how environmental factors affected their growth by considering differences in leaf-habit types. We used a combination of Landsat-derived land-cover maps and aboveground biomass (AGB) maps from the European Space Agency to assess the secondary forest establishment and growth, respectively, in the study region. We also obtained a set of topographic, climatic and landscape variables from diverse GIS layers and used them for determining changes over time in the environmental drivers of forest establishment and AGB using general linear models. The results highlight that secondary forest cover was still increasing in the Iberian Peninsula at a rate above the European average. Yet, they also indicate a directional change in the emergence of secondary forests towards lower and less steep regions with higher water availability (mean rainfall and SPEI) and less forest cover but are subjected to greater drought events. In addition, these environmental factors differentially affect the growth of forests with different leaf-habit types: i.e., needleleaf secondary forests being less favoured by high temperature and precipitation, and broadleaf deciduous forests being most negatively affected by drought. Finally, these spatial patterns of forest emergence and the contrasting responses of forest leaf-habits to environmental factors explained the major development of broadleaf evergreen compared to broadleaf deciduous forests and, especially, needleleaf secondary forests. These results will improve the knowledge of forest dynamics that have occurred in the Iberian Peninsula in recent decades and provide an essential tool for understanding the potential effects of climate warming on secondary forest growth.

TI  - Comparative Study of a Series of <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc(CO)<sub>3</sub> Mannosylated Dextran Derivatives for Sentinel Lymph Node Detection
T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node detection (SLND) is rapidly entering common practice in the management of patients with tumors. The introduction of mannose molecules to Tc-99m-labeled dextrans, so far, showed that the sentinel node could trap these agents due to their recognition by the mannose receptors of lymph node macrophages. The current study aimed to synthesize, characterize, and biologically evaluate a series of mannosylated dextran derivatives labeled with Tc-99m for potential use in SLND. The compounds were designed to have a dextran with a molecular weight of 10-500 kDa as a backbone, S-derivatized cysteines, efficient SNO chelators, and mannose moieties for binding to mannose receptors. They were successfully synthesized, thoroughly characterized using NMR techniques, and labeled with the fac-[Tc-99m(CO)(3)](+) synthon. Labeling with high yields and radiochemical purities was achieved with all derivatives. In vivo biodistribution and imaging studies demonstrated high uptake in the first lymph node and low uptakes in the following node and confirmed the ability to visualize the SLN. Among the compounds studied, Tc-99m-D75CM demonstrated the most attractive biological features, and in combination with the high radiochemical yield and stability of the compound, its further evaluation as a new radiopharmaceutical for sentinel lymph node detection was justified.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Impervious Surfaces from Remotely Sensed Data Using Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The large scale quantification of impervious surfaces provides valuable information for urban planning and socioeconomic development. Remote sensing and GIS techniques provide spatial and temporal information of land surfaces and are widely used for modeling impervious surfaces. Traditionally, these surfaces are predicted by computing statistical indices derived from different bands available in remotely sensed data, such as the Landsat and Sentinel series. More recently, researchers have explored classification and regression techniques to model impervious surfaces. However, these modeling efforts are limited due to lack of labeled data for training and evaluation. This in turn requires significant effort for manual labeling of data and visual interpretation of results. In this paper, we train deep learning neural networks using TensorFlow to predict impervious surfaces from Landsat 8 images. We used OpenStreetMap (OSM), a crowd-sourced map of the world with manually interpreted impervious surfaces such as roads and buildings, to programmatically generate large amounts of training and evaluation data, thus overcoming the need for manual labeling. We conducted extensive experimentation to compare the performance of different deep learning neural network architectures, optimization methods, and the set of features used to train the networks. The four model configurations labeled U-Net_SGD_Bands, U-Net_Adam_Bands, U-Net_Adam_Bands+SI, and VGG-19_Adam_Bands+SI resulted in a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.1582, 0.1358, 0.1375, and 0.1582 and an accuracy of 90.87%, 92.28%, 92.46%, and 90.11%, respectively, on the test set. The U-Net_Adam_Bands+SI Model, similar to the others mentioned above, is a deep learning neural network that combines Landsat 8 bands with statistical indices. This model performs the best among all four on statistical accuracy and produces qualitatively sharper and brighter predictions of impervious surfaces as compared to the other models.

M3  - Review
AB  - A 57-year-old Japanese woman underwent partial mastectomy of the right breast and sentinel lymph node biopsy in July 2005. The diagnosis was mucinous carcinoma with negative margins and no lymph node metastases(pT1cN0M0, pStage Ⅰ A). Postoperative adjuvant therapy included radiation therapy and oral administration of anastrozole for 5 years. In December 2015, we observed enlargement of left supraclavicular lymph nodes; a needle biopsy revealed lymph node metastases from breast cancer. We administered toremifene and the swelling disappeared. The patient was subsequently referred to the hospital for urinary frequency in November 2016. Imaging demonstrated a bladder tumor. Transurethral biopsy of bladder revealed adenocarcinoma with mucin production consistent with breast primary. After systemic chemotherapy(UFT, eribulin), endocrine therapy(fulvestrant), and molecular targeted therapy(palbociclib), her urologic symptoms were relieved. However, 2 years and 8 months after diagnosis of bladder metastasis, the patient showed disease progression and decided to discontinue all chemotherapy and pursue palliative care. We also present a review and discussion of the relevant literature.

TI  - Sentinel-1&2 Multitemporal Water Surface Detection Accuracies, Evaluated at Regional and Reservoirs Level
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water stock monitoring is a major issue for society on a local and global scale. Sentinel-1&2 satellites provide frequent acquisitions to track water surface dynamics, proxy variables to enable water surface volume monitoring. How do we combine such observations along time for each sensor? What advantages and disadvantages of single-date, monthly or time-windowed estimations? In this context, we analysed the impact of merging information through different types and lengths of time-windows. Satellite observations were processed separately on optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) water detectors at 10 m resolution. The analysis has been applied at two scales. First, validating with 26 large scenes (110 x 110 km) in different climatic zones in France, time-windows yielded an improvement on radar detection (F1-score improved from 0.72 to 0.8 for 30 days on average logic) while optical performances remained stable (F1-score 0.89). Second, validating reservoir area estimations with 29 instrumented reservoirs (20-1250 ha), time-windows presented in all cases an improvement on both optical and radar error for any window length (5-30 days). The mean relative absolute error in optical area detection improved from 16.9% on single measurements to 12.9% using 15 days time-windows, and from 22.15% to 15.1% in radar detection). Regarding reservoir filling rates, we identified an increased negative bias for both sensors when the reservoir is nearly full. This work helped to compare accuracies of separate optical and radar capabilities, where optical statistically outperforms radar at both local and large scale to the detriment of less frequent measurements. Furthermore, we propose a geomorphological indicator of reservoirs to predict the quality of radar area monitoring (R-2 = 0.58). In conclusion, we suggest the use of time-windows on operational water mapping or reservoir monitoring systems, using 10-20 days time-windows with average logic, providing more frequent and faster information to water managers in periods of crisis (e.g., water shortage) compared to monthly estimations.

TI  - Analysis of a Landscape Intensely Modified by Agriculture in the Tiete-Jacare Watershed, Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic actions influence landscapes, and the resulting mosaic is a mix of natural and anthropogenic elements that vary in size, shape, and pattern. Considering this, our study aimed to analyse the land use and land cover changes in the Tiete-Jacare watershed (Sao Paulo state, Brazil), using the random forest (RF) algorithm and Sentinel-2 satellite data from 2016 to 2018 to detect landscape changes. By overlapping the environmental data and the proposed model evaluation, it was possible to observe the landscape structure, produce information about the state of this region, and assess the environmental responses to anthropic impacts. The land use and land cover analysis identified eight classes: exposed soil, citriculture, pasture, silviculture, sugar cane, urban area, vegetation, and water. The RF classification for the three years reached high accuracy with a kappa index of 0.87 in 2016, 0.85 in 2017, and 0.85 in 2018. The model developed was essential for the temporal analysis since it allowed us to comprehend the driving forces that act in this landscape and contribute to the discussions about their impacts over time. The results showed a predominance of agricultural activities over the three years, with approximately 900.000 ha (76% of the area), mainly covered by sugarcane cultivation.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the response of a cold-regions deltaic wetland ecosystem in northwestern Canada to two separate and differing seasonal wetting cycles. The goal of this paper was to examine the nature of reflected electromagnetic energy measured by earth observation (EO) satellites, and to assess whether seasonal wetland hydroperiod and episodic flooding events impact the information retrieved by the Sentinel-2 sensors. The year 2018 represents a year characterized by a large spring freshet and ice-jam flooding, while 2019 represents a year characterized more by summer open-water flooding. We applied the Modified Normalized Difference Wetness Index (MNDWI) to address the effects of the wetting cycles. The response of the vegetative cover was tracked using the fraction of the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and the Leaf Area Index (LAI). All three indices were viewed through the lens of cover classes as derived through a previously published study by the authors. The study provides a framework for designing longer-term studies where multiple intra- and inter-annual hydrological cycles can be accessed via EO data. Future studies will enable the examination of lag times inherent in the response to the various water sources applied to spectral response and incorporate this EO approach into a monitoring framework.

TI  - Relationship between Fire Events and Land Use Changes in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the land use and land cover changes in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, for the period of 2002 through 2017, to determine if forested areas were burned or converted to other land uses, to analyze the use of fire as a catalyst and mechanism for land cover change, and to determine if there was a relationship between land use changes and gross domestic product (GDP). MapBiomas classifications and MODIS data were analyzed using the Google Earth Engine. The results of the analysis found that there were minimal changes in the forested areas in Sao Paulo during the study period; however, there was a 5% increase in natural forest and a 75% increase in planted forest cover. On the other hand, there was a 128% increase in sugarcane, and nearly a 50% decrease in pasture land coverage, suggesting that land was converted from pasture to more profitable agricultural land. Finally, there was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.96) between the increase in sugarcane and the GDP, and a negative correlation between the frequency of fire events and economic production (r = -0.62). Overall, there was a decline in fire events in Sao Paulo, with fire events occurring in less than 2% of the total observed land area by 2017. This overall declining trend in fire events are likely the direct result of increases in green harvest methods, which prevent the need for pre-harvest burning.

TI  - Sino-EU Earth Observation Data to Support the Monitoring and Management of Agricultural Resources
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Novel approaches and algorithms to estimate crop physiological processes from Earth Observation (EO) data are essential to develop more sustainable management practices in agricultural systems. Within this context, this paper presents the results of different research activities carried out within the ESA-MOST Dragon 4 programme. The paper encompasses two research avenues: (a) the retrieval of biophysical variables of crops and yield prediction; and (b) food security related to different crop management strategies. Concerning the retrieval of variables, results show that LAI, derived by radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion, when assimilated into a crop growth model (i.e., SAFY) provides a way to assess yields with a higher accuracy with respect to open loop model runs: 1.14 t center dot ha(-1) vs 4.42 t center dot ha(-1) RMSE for assimilation and open loop, respectively. Concerning food security, results show that different pathogens could be detected by remote sensing satellite data. A k coefficient higher than 0.84 was achieved for yellow rust, thus assuring a monitoring accuracy, and for the diseased samples k was higher than 0.87. Concerning permanent crops, neural network (NN) algorithms allow classification of the Pseudomonas syringae pathogen on kiwi orchards with an overall accuracy higher than 91%.

TI  - OPTICAL AND SAR IMAGERY INTEGRATION BASED ON CLOUD COMPUTING FOR LAND COVER MAPPING IN THE CERRADO
T2  - REVISTA GEOARAGUAIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The land cover mapping is of great relevance for the environmental monitoring and land management. Time series from the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) of Sentinel-1 (S-1) and the MSI/Sentinel-2 (S-2) optical sensor provide promising conditions for the land cover mapping due to their spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we explored the hypothesis that the combination of S-1 and S-2 time series allows higher accuracy in the land cover mapping in Cerrado biome. The images were classified using the Random Forest algorithm in the Google Earth Engine cloud processing platform. The classifications obtained using only the S-2 data (kappa = 89.99) showed higher accuracy than those with the S-1 data (kappa = 75.78). The classification efficiency increased by combining the S-1 and S-2 data (kappa = 93.07). The results found here suggest that the shortwave infrared band, the VH polarization from SAR data, and the Cellulose absorption index (CAI) and Hall Cover index were the most significant variables in the land cover mapping of the Cerrado biome.

TI  - Substandard and Falsified Medicines: Proposed Methods for Case Finding and Sentinel Surveillance
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The World Health Organization and others warn that substandard and falsified medicines harm health and waste money, especially in low- and middle-income countries. However, no country has measured the market-wide extent of the problem, and no standardized methods exist to estimate the prevalence of either substandard or falsified medicines. This is, in part, because the task seems overwhelming; medicine markets are huge and diverse, and testing medicines is expensive. Many countries do operate some form of postmarket surveillance of medicine, but their methods and goals differ. There is currently no clear guidance on which surveillance method is most appropriate to meet specific public health goals. In this viewpoint, we aimed to discuss the utility of both case finding and risk-based sentinel surveillance for substandard and falsified medicines, linking each to specific public health goals. We posit that choosing the system most appropriate to the goal, as well as implementing it with a clear understanding of the factors driving the production and sale of substandard and falsified medicines, will allow for surveillance resources to be concentrated most efficiently. We adapted principles used for disease outbreak responses to suggest a case-finding system that uses secondary data to flag poor-quality medicines, proposing risk-based indicators that differ for substandard and falsified medicines. This system potentially offers a cost-effective way of identifying "cases" for market withdrawal, enhanced oversight, or another immediate response. We further proposed a risk-based sentinel surveillance system that concentrates resources on measuring the prevalence of substandard and falsified medicines in the risk clusters where they are most likely to be found. The sentinel surveillance system provides base data for a transparent, spreadsheet-based model for estimating the national prevalence of substandard and falsified medicines. The methods we proposed are based on ongoing work in Indonesia, a large and diverse middle-income country currently aiming to achieve universal health coverage. Both the case finding and the sentinel surveillance system are designed to be adaptable to other resource-constrained settings.

TI  - Surgery for cervical cancer: consensus & controversies
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Surgery plays an important role in the management of early-stage cervical cancer. Type III radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection using open route is the standard surgical procedure. There is level I evidence against the use of laparoscopic/robotic approach for radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer. Emerging data support the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy and nerve sparing radical hysterectomy in carefully selected patients with early-stage disease. In locally advanced cervical cancer patients, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by radical surgery yields inferior disease-free survival compared to definitive concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Therefore, definitive concurrent chemoradiation is the standard treatment for locally advanced disease. Fertility preserving surgery is feasible in highly selected young patients. Role of less-radical surgical procedures in patients' with low-stage disease with good prognostic factors is under evaluation.

TI  - Soil Temperature in Disturbed Ecosystems of Central Siberia: Remote Sensing Data and Numerical Simulation
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated changes in the temperature regime of post-fire and post-technogenic cryogenic soils of Central Siberia using remote sensing data and results of numerical simulation. We have selected the time series of satellite data for two variants of plots with disturbed vegetation and on-ground cover: natural ecosystems of post-fire plots and post-technogenic plots with reclamation as well as dumps without reclamation. Surface thermal anomalies and temperature in soil horizons were evaluated from remote data and numerical simulation and compared with summarized experimental data. We estimated the influence of soil profile disturbances on the temperature anomalies forming on the surface and in soil horizons based on the results of heat transfer modeling in the soil profile. According to remote sensing data, within 20 years, the thermal insulation properties of the vegetation cover restore in the post-fire areas, and the relative temperature anomaly reaches the level of background values. In post-technogenic plots, conditions are more "contrast" comparing to the background, and the process of the thermal regime restoration takes a longer time (>60 years). Forming "neo-technogenic ecosystems" are distinct in special thermal regimes of soils that differ from the background ones both in reclamated and in non-reclamated plots. An assumption was made of the changes in the moisture content regime as the main factor causing the long-term existence of thermal anomalies in the upper soil horizons of disturbed plots. In addition, we discussed the formation of transition zones ("ecotones") along the periphery of the disturbed plots due to horizontal heat transfer.

TI  - Digital Building-Height Preparation from Satellite Stereo Images
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Buildings are considered prominent objects for understanding the pattern of growth in an urban setting. Remote sensing technology plays a vital role in facilitating data generation pertaining to various urban applications. Digital surface models represent the elevation of the earth surface features, and can be obtained from stereo images, radar, laser scanning, and so on. Photogrammetric techniques applied to optical stereo satellite images are economical and fast ways to generate height information of buildings. In this work, a quantitative and qualitative analysis of digital surface models generated from Cartosat-1 stereo images is compared with openly available data. The study finds that it is possible to acquire about 50 percent of building heights with acceptable error limits. The experimental results indicate that the quality of height information is suitable for applications to assess urban development at a macro scale, but not for individual building-level modeling.

TI  - Land Use and Degradation in a Desert Margin: The Northern Negev
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Degradation in a range of land uses was examined across the transition from the arid to the semi-arid zone in the northern Negev desert, representative of developments in land use taking place throughout the West Asia and North Africa region. Primary production was used as an index of an important aspect of dryland degradation. It was derived from data provided by Landsat measurements at 0.1 ha resolution over a 2500 km(2) study region-the first assessment of the degradation of a large area of a desert margin at a resolution suitable for interpretation in terms of human activities. The Local NPP Scaling (LNS) method enabled comparisons between the observed NPP and the potential, nondegraded, reference NPP. The potential was calculated by normalizing the actual NPP to remove the effects of environmental conditions that are not related to anthropogenic degradation. Of the entire study area, about 50% was found to have a significantly lower production than its potential. The degree of degradation ranged from small in pasture, around informal settlements, minimally managed dryland cropping, and a pine plantation, to high in commercial cropping and extreme in low-density afforestation. This result was unexpected as degradation in drylands is often attributed to pastoralism, and afforestation is said to offer remediation and prevention of further damage.

TI  - Assessing Suitability of Sentinel-2 Bands for Monitoring of Nutrient Concentration of Pastures with a Range of Species Compositions
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and timely assessment of pasture quantity and quality (i.e., nutritive characteristics) is vital for effective pasture management. Remotely sensed data can be used to predict pasture quantity and quality. This study investigated the ability of Sentinel-2 multispectral bands, convolved from proximal hyperspectral data, in predicting various pasture quality and quantity parameters. Field data (quantitative and spectral) were gathered for experimental plots representing four pasture types-perennial ryegrass monoculture and three mixtures of swards representing increasing species diversity. Spectral reflectance data at the canopy level were used to generate Sentinel-2 bands and calculate normalised difference indices with each possible band pair. The suitability of these indices for prediction of pasture parameters was assessed. Pasture quantity parameters (biomass and Leaf Area Index) had a stronger influence on overall reflectance than the quality parameters. Indices involving the 1610 nm band were optimal for acid detergent fibre, crude protein, organic matter and water-soluble carbohydrate concentration, while being less affected by biomass or LAI. The study emphasises the importance of accounting for the quantity parameters in the spectral data-based models for pasture quality predictions. These explorative findings inform the development of future pasture quantity and quality models, particularly focusing on diverse swards.

TI  - Statistical Seasonal Prediction of European Summer Mean Temperature Using Observational, Reanalysis, and Satellite Data
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Statistical climate prediction has sometimes demonstrated higher accuracy than coupled dynamical forecast systems. This study tests the applicability of springtime soil moisture (SM) over Europe and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of three North Atlantic (NA) regions as statistical predictors of European mean summer temperature (t2m). We set up two statistical-learning (SL) frameworks, based on methods commonly applied in climate research. The SL models are trained with gridded products derived from station, reanalysis, and satellite data (ERA-20C, ERA-Land, CERA, COBE2, CRU, and ESA-CCI). The predictive potential of SM anomalies in statistical forecasting had so far remained elusive. Our statistical models trained with SM achieve high summer t2m prediction skill in terms of Pearson correlation coefficient (r), with r >= 0.5 over central and eastern Europe. Moreover, we find that the reanalysis and satellite SM data contain similar information that can be extracted by our methods and used in fitting the forecast models. Furthermore, the predictive potential of SSTs within different areas in the NA basin was tested. The predictive power of SSTs might increase, as in our case, when specific areas are selected. Forecasts based on extratropical SSTs achieve high prediction skill over south Europe. The combined prediction, using SM and SST predictor data, results in r >= 0.5 over all European regions south of 50 degrees N and east of 5 degrees W. This is a better skill than the one achieved by other prediction schemes based on dynamical models. Our analysis highlights specific NA midlatitude regions that are more strongly connected to summer mean European temperature.Significance Statement The prediction of summer temperature is important for the estimation of weather related risks relevant for the society. Specifically for economy, agriculture, and implications on human health. Due to the chaotic system, and in the absence of only a single agent controlling the climate system, physics based dynamical models do not estimate correctly seasonal mean temperature. We tested whether a statistical model could achieve better predictions of summer temperature over Europe. Our data-driven model uses information from datasets of North Atlantic sea surface temperatures and European soil moisture, and achieves predictions with higher skill compared to physical numerical models. Moreover, we identified the regions in the North Atlantic Ocean that are more strongly related to the high prediction skill of European summer temperature. These findings suggest that statistical models should be used in operational seasonal forecasting.

TI  - Soil Salinity Inversion in Coastal Corn Planting Areas by the Satellite-UAV-Ground Integration Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is a significant factor affecting corn growth in coastal areas. How to use multi-source remote sensing data to achieve the target of rapid, efficient and accurate soil salinity monitoring in a large area is worth further study. In this research, using Kenli District of the Yellow River Delta as study area, the inversion of soil salinity in a corn planting area was carried out based on the integration of ground imaging hyperspectral, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) multispectral and Sentinel-2A satellite multispectral images. The UAV and ground images were fused, and the partial least squares inversion model was constructed by the fused UAV image. Then, inversion model was scaled up to the satellite by the TsHARP method, and finally, the accuracy of the satellite-UAV-ground inversion model and results was verified. The results show that the band fusion of UAV and ground images effectively enrich the spectral information of the UAV image. The accuracy of the inversion model constructed based on the fused UAV images was improved. The inversion results of soil salinity based on the integration of satellite-UAV-ground were highly consistent with the measured soil salinity (R-2 = 0.716 and RMSE = 0.727), and the inversion model had excellent universal applicability. This research integrated the advantages of multi-source data to establish a unified satellite-UAV-ground model, which improved the ability of large-scale remote sensing data to finely indicate soil salinity.

TI  - Variations in aeolian landform patterns in the Gonghe Basin over the last 30 years
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind erosion, or the transportation and deposition of sand into desert dunes and aeolian loess, is one of the most important aeolian activities. The progression of aeolian landforms expands arid and barren landscapes, leading to the degradation of adjacent areas. The Gonghe Basin, as a typical plateau with abundant sand sources, is highly sensitive to changes in the local climate conditions. In order to quantify the spatial-temporal variations in the aeolian landforms in the Gonghe Basin, we conducted field surveys and also analyzed twelve remote sensing (Landsat5 TM and Landsat8 OLI) images that sample the Gonghe Basin from 1989 to 2019. In the Gonghe Basin, we identified aeolian landforms such as climbing dunes on the windward slopes of the foothills, checkerboard dunes in the southeastern part of the basin, flat dunes, parabolic dunes and crescent dunes on the east and west sides of Longyangxia Reservoir, shrubby sandbanks on the valley slope in Shazhuyu, Tanggemu, and Indel, and sandy thickets at the bottom of the valley near the Dalian Sea, the Longyangxia Reservoir, and the tributaries of the Yellow River. From 1989 to 2005, the area of the aeolian regions expanded by 816.7 km(2), with an annual conversion rate of 0.05%. From 2015 to 2019, the area of the aeolian regions shrunk by 2411.9 km(2), with an annual conversion rate of -0.15%. The number and size of the fixed and semi-fixed dunes (e.g. the shrubby sandbanks on the valley slope and the sandy thickets at the bottom of the valley) were more stable than those of the mobile dunes (e.g. the checkerboard dunes, the flat dunes, the crescent dunes, the parabolic dunes, and the climbing dunes). The fixed and semi-fixed dunes were arranged in an irregular ring shape, and the location of the center of gravity of this ring did not change significantly from 1989 to 2019; in this time, the mobile dunes migrated to the northwest.

TI  - Optimization of Rocky Desertification Classification Model Based on Vegetation Type and Seasonal Characteristic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building a high-precision, stable, and universal automatic extraction model of the rocky desertification information is the premise for exploring the spatiotemporal evolution of rocky desertification. Taking Guizhou province as the research area and based on MODIS and continuous forest inventory data in China, we used a machine learning algorithm to build a rocky desertification model with bedrock exposure rate, temperature difference, humidity, and other characteristic factors and considered improving the model accuracy from the spatial and temporal dimensions. The results showed the following: (1) The supervised classification method was used to build a rocky desertification model, and the logical model, RF model, and SVM model were constructed separately. The accuracies of the models were 73.8%, 78.2%, and 80.6%, respectively, and the kappa coefficients were 0.61, 0.672, and 0.707, respectively. SVM performed the best. (2) Vegetation types and vegetation seasonal phases are closely related to rocky desertification. After combining them, the model accuracy and kappa coefficient improved to 91.1% and 0.861. (3) The spatial distribution characteristics of rocky desertification in Guizhou are obvious, showing a pattern of being heavy in the west, light in the east, heavy in the south, and light in the north. Rocky desertification has continuously increased from 2001 to 2019. In conclusion, combining the vertical spatial structure of vegetation and the differences in seasonal phase is an effective method to improve the modeling accuracy of rocky desertification, and the SVM model has the highest rocky desertification classification accuracy. The research results provide data support for exploring the spatiotemporal evolution pattern of rocky desertification in Guizhou.

TI  - Environmental risk analysis of surface water based on multi-source data in Tianjin Binhai New Area, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study on environmental risk of surface water is of great practical significance for the ecological security of water environment and water pollution treatment, and it can provide a certain reference basis for risk prevention and control of water environment. The Tianjin Binhai New Area faces severe water shortage and serious water pollution, but few studies have been reported on surface water environment risk in this area. Therefore, in this study, based on Gaofen-6 remote sensing image, the factors including land use, landscape index, population density, and enterprise source are integrated to develop the evaluation model of surface water environment risk index. It is developed using analytic hierarchy process from two aspects of hazard of risk source and sensitivity of risk receptor. The comprehensive risk of Tianjin Binhai New Area is classified using mean standard deviation method. The result indicates that the developed model could better quantify the impact of various factors on the surface water environment, and comprehensively and accurately depict the spatial distribution of surface water environmental risk. Generally, the areas of higher and high risk grades are mainly concentrated on the west of Binhai Street, Beitang Street, and Hangzhou Road Street. The risk grade in most other areas is medium, and it is low in coastal and northernmost areas. This study not only clarifies the distribution of surface water environmental risks in Binhai New Area, but also develops an evaluation model, which can provide reference for the evaluation of water environmental risks in other areas. Through the investigation and research on the current situation of water pollution, social and economic development, and other factors of the streets and towns in Binhai New Area, it is found that in recent years, the urbanization of Binhai Street, Beitang Street, and Hangzhou Road Street has developed rapidly, and the intensity of human activities is high, which has a great impact on the water environment. The research results are consistent with the actual situation, which can provide theoretical and technical support for the prevention, control, and management of water environmental risks in Binhai New Area.

TI  - The Water Availability on the Chinese Loess Plateau since the Implementation of the Grain for Green Project as Indicated by the Evaporative Stress Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation coverage on the Loess Plateau (LP) of China has clearly increased since the implementation of the Grain for Green Project in 1999, but there is a debate about whether the improved greenness was achieved at the expense of the balance between the supply and demand of water resources. Therefore, developing reliable indicators to evaluate the water availability is a prerequisite for maintaining ecological sustainability and ensuring the persistence of vegetation restoration. This study was designed to evaluate water availability on the LP during 2000-2015, using the evaporative stress index (ESI) derived from a remote sensing dataset. The relative dependences of the ESI on climatic and biological factors (including temperature, precipitation and land cover change) were also analyzed. The results showed that the leaf area index (LAI) in most regions of the LP showed a significant increasing trend (p < 0.05), and larger gradients of increase were mainly detected in the central and eastern parts of the LP. The evapotranspiration also exhibited an increasing trend in the central and eastern parts of the LP, with a gradient greater than 10 mm/year. However, almost the whole LP exhibited a decreased ESI from 2000 to 2015, and the largest decrease occurred on the central and eastern LP, indicating a wetting trend. The soil moisture storage in the 0-289-cm soil profiles showed an increasing trend in the central and eastern LP, and the area with an upward trend enlarged with the soil depth. Further analysis revealed that the decreased ESI on the central and eastern LP mainly depended on the increase in the LAI compared with climatic influences. This work not only demonstrated that the ESI was a useful indicator for understanding the water availability in natural and managed ecosystems under climate change but also indicated that vegetation restoration might have a positive effect on water conservation on the central LP.

TI  - Spatiotemporal fusion method to simultaneously generate full-length normalized difference vegetation index time series (SSFIT)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatiotemporal resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series imagery is required for monitoring vegetation dynamics with dense observations and spatial details, and in recent years, many spatiotemporal data fusion methods have been proposed to fulfill this need. However, strict data requirements and inappropriate modeling strategies often limit their performance, particularly under poor conditions of available input data. In this study, we proposed a Spatiotemporal fusion method to Simultaneously generate Fulllength normalized difference vegetation Index Time series (SSFIT) with a high spatial resolution and frequent coverage. The utilization of temporal information across sensors contributes to its two distinct features: (1) no cloud-free high-spatial-resolution image is required and (2) high-spatial-resolution images on multiple prediction dates are generated at the same time. Comparison experiments were conducted by simulating ideal and challenging conditions of input time-series data in two characteristic areas, and the proposed methods were also compared with four typical methods: The Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF), Fit-FC (regression model Fitting, spatial Filtering and residual Compensation), and Improved FSDAF. The results demonstrate that SSFIT yields a better overall prediction accuracy and efficiency under ideal input conditions (average root mean square error of 0.1037 and 0.0713, average correlation coefficient of 0.9180 and 0.7875, and computation time of 109 and 120 s, computed in the two test areas) and is more robust against the decrease in available input data under challenging conditions. SSFIT is thus expected to be extended to various remote sensing products and support applications for monitoring land surface dynamics.

TI  - Cropland Suitability Assessment Using Satellite-Based Biophysical Vegetation Properties and Machine Learning
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The determination of cropland suitability is a major step for adapting to the increased food demands caused by population growth, climate change and environmental contamination. This study presents a novel cropland suitability assessment approach based on machine learning, which overcomes the limitations of the conventional GIS-based multicriteria analysis by increasing computational efficiency, accuracy and objectivity of the prediction. The suitability assessment method was developed and evaluated for soybean cultivation within two 50 x 50 km subsets located in the continental biogeoregion of Croatia, in the four-year period during 2017-2020. Two biophysical vegetation properties, leaf area index (LAI) and a fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), were utilized to train and test machine learning models. The data derived from a medium-resolution satellite mission PROBA-V were prime indicators of cropland suitability, having a high correlation to crop health, yield and biomass in previous studies. A variety of climate, soil, topography and vegetation covariates were used to establish a relationship with the training samples, with a total of 119 covariates being utilized per yearly suitability assessment. Random forest (RF) produced a superior prediction accuracy compared to support vector machine (SVM), having the mean overall accuracy of 76.6% to 68.1% for Subset A and 80.6% to 79.5% for Subset B. The 6.1% of the highly suitable FAO suitability class for soybean cultivation was determined on the sparsely utilized Subset A, while the intensively cultivated agricultural land produced only 1.5% of the same suitability class in Subset B. The applicability of the proposed method for other crop types adjusted by their respective vegetation periods, as well as the upgrade to high-resolution Sentinel-2 images, will be a subject of future research.

TI  - Evaluating the impacts of major cyclonic catastrophes in coastal Bangladesh using geospatial techniques
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyclonic catastrophes frequently devastate coastal regions of Bangladesh that host around 35 million people which represents two-thirds of the total population. They have caused many problems like agricultural crop loss, forest degradation, damage to built-up areas, river and shoreline changes that are linked to people's livelihood and ecological biodiversity. There is an absence of a comprehensive assessment of the major cyclonic disasters of Bangladesh that integrates geospatial technologies in a single study. This study aims to integrate geospatial technologies with major disasters and compares them, which has not been tried before. This paper tried to identify impacts that occurred in the coastal region by major catastrophic events at a vast level using different geospatial technologies. It focuses to identify the impacts of major catastrophic events on livelihood and food production as well as compare the impacts and intensity of different disasters. Furthermore, it compared the losses among several districts and for that previous and post-satellite images of disasters that occurred in 1988, 1991, 2007, 2009, 2019 were used. Classification technique like machine learning algorithm was done in pre- to post-disaster images. For quantifying change in the indication of different factors, indices including NDVI, NDWI, NDBI were developed. "Change vector analysis" equation was performed in bands of the images of pre- and post-disaster to identify the magnitude of change. Also, crop production variance was analyzed to detect impacts on crop production. Furthermore, the changes in shallow to deep water were analyzed. There is a notable change in shallow to deep water bodies after each disaster in Satkhira and Bhola district but subtle changes in Khulna and Bagerhat districts. Change vector analysis revealed greater intensity in Bhola in 1988 and Satkhira in 1991. Furthermore, over the years 2007 and 2009 it showed medium and deep intense areas all over the region. A sharp decrease in Aus rice production is witnessed in Barishal in 2007 when cyclone "Sidr" was stricken. The declination of potato production is seen in Khulna district after the 1988 cyclone. A huge change in the land-use classes from classified images like water body, Pasture land in 1988 and water body, forest in 1991 is marked out. Besides, a clear variation in the settlement was observed from the classified images. This study explores the necessity of using more geospatial technologies in disastrous impacts assessment around the world in the context of Bangladesh and, also, emphasizes taking effective, proper and sustainable disaster management and mitigation measures to counter future disastrous impacts.

TI  - Assessing Climate Change Trends and Their Relationships with Alpine Vegetation and Surface Water Dynamics in the Everest Region, Nepal
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayas, especially the Everest region, are highly sensitive to climate change. Although there are research works on this region related to cryospheric work, the ecological understandings of the alpine zone and climate impacts are limited. This study aimed to assess the changes in surface water including glacier lake and streamflow and the spatial and temporal changes in alpine vegetation and examine their relationships with climatic factors (temperature and precipitation) during 1995-2019 in the Everest region and the Dudh Koshi river basin. In this study, Landsat time-series data, European Commission's Joint Research Center (JRC) surface water data, ECMWF Reanalysis 5th Generation (ERA5) reanalysis temperature data, and meteorological station data were used. It was found that the glacial lake area and volume are expanding at the rates of 0.0676 and 0.0198 km(3)/year, respectively; the average annual streamflow is decreasing at the rate of 2.73 m(3)/s/year. Similarly, the alpine vegetation greening as indicated by normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is increasing at the rate of 0.00352 units/year. On the other hand, the annual mean temperature shows an increasing trend of 0.0329 degrees C/year, and the annual precipitation also shows a significant negative monotonic trend. It was also found that annual NDVI is significantly correlated with annual temperature. Likewise, the glacial lake area expansion is strongly correlated with annual minimum temperature and annual precipitation. Overall, we found a significant alteration in the alpine ecosystem of the Everest region that could impact on the water-energy-food nexus of the Dudh Koshi river basin.

M3  - Article
AB  - Ramos, GP, Nakamura, FY, Penna, EM, Mendes, TT, Mahseredjian, F, Lima, AM, Garcia, ES, Prado, LS, and Coimbra, CC. Comparison of physical fitness and anthropometrical profiles among Brazilian female soccer national teams from U15 to senior categories. J Strength Cond Res 35(8): 2302-2308, 2021-This study aimed to compare anthropometric and physical fitness of Brazilian female national team soccer players from the U15 to senior categories, and to compare the physical performance between selected and nonselected players. Subjects included 231 athletes (U15, n = 46, U17, n = 49, U20, n = 98, and Senior, n = 38). Body mass, height, sum of skinfolds, squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), 20-m linear sprint, and Yo-Yo IR1 were assessed. The U15 players were shorter than all other groups (p < 0.01) and lighter than U20 players (p < 0.01). Regarding physical tests, Senior athletes presented higher SJ compared with U20, and both showed higher CMJ and SJ compared with the U15 and U17 (p < 0.05). Senior athletes were also faster than players of all other categories in 20-m sprint (p < 0.01) and covered the greatest distance in the Yo-Yo IR1 (p < 0.05). U20 were better in the Yo-Yo IR1 than the younger groups (p < 0.05). When comparing selected and nonselected players, no differences were identified in anthropometric measures (p > 0.05). However, selected players from U17, U20, and Senior teams showed better performance in Yo-Yo IR1 than nonselected ones (p < 0.05). Finally, selected senior athletes also presented higher CMJ and SJ than nonselected players (p < 0.05). These results suggest that, although there is a tendency for maintenance in anthropometric measures from the age of 15 years, there are substantial improvements in speed, lower-body power, and aerobic capacity from U20 age group. In addition, it seems that intermittent aerobic fitness contributes to the selection of players to international tournaments in national teams.

TI  - Miracles and Methods
T2  - BIBLICAL THEOLOGY BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Prominent scholars in the field of historical Jesus research have argued that historians should be willing to accept all sorts of miracles that are convincingly attested to in the sources. The present article agrees with this view in principle but argues that, if analysed with the ordinary source-critical methods of conventional historical scholarship, there are significant and systematic differences in the source-critical strength of the stories. Miracles that fit inside a modern scientific worldview seem to have a stronger foundation in the sources than miracles that do not. The difference is quite clear when one compares the stories about how Jesus raised the dead, but it is also visible when one compares stories of other miracles. There are at least two ways of explaining these differences. One is that they are created by the scepticism of the modern scientific worldview of this writer. The other is that the differences exist in the sources because some of the miracle stories go back to memories of real events, while others do not.

TI  - The role of regional chemotherapy for advanced limb melanoma in the era of potentially effective systemic therapies
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - To review the current role of regional chemotherapy in the management of advanced limb melanoma. Articles reporting the results of isolated limb infusion (ILI) were identified by performing a comprehensive literature search using the PubMed database. Keywords included isolated limb infusion, in-transit melanoma and melphalan. No publication date restrictions were applied. ILI data were compared with those from current systemic therapy clinical trials and the previously reviewed isolated limb perfusion (ILP) literature. Regional chemotherapy is today required in fewer patients because effective systemic therapies now provide an alternative treatment for those who develop extensive local melanoma recurrence or in-transit metastases (ITMs). However, regional chemotherapy may be a valuable treatment option when the side-effects of systemic therapies are of concern, or after systemic treatment failure. ILP achieves overall response rates (ORRs) of 64-100% and complete response rates (CRRs) of 25-89%. ILI achieves ORRs of 41-91% and CRRs of 6-39%. ILP and ILI can have a low risk of serious morbidity. Early results from treatment with ILP or ILI in conjunction with systemic immune therapies suggest that these modalities can be safely combined, which may be useful in patients with refractory limb disease. Regional chemotherapy remains important in the armamentarium of clinicians managing patients with unresectable limb melanoma and may be preferable in those who are frail, elderly or who are at high risk from complications of systemic therapies. The efficacy of combining regional chemotherapy with systemic immune therapy is currently being assessed.

TI  - Nearshore Benthic Mapping in the Great Lakes: A Multi-Agency Data Integration Approach in Southwest Lake Michigan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Laurentian Great Lakes comprise the largest assemblage of inland waterbodies in North America, with vast geographic, environmentally complex nearshore benthic substrate and associated habitat. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, originally signed in 1972, aims to help restore and protect the basin, and ecosystem monitoring is a primary objective to support adaptive management, environmental policy, and decision making. Yet, monitoring ecosystem trends remains challenging, potentially hindering progress in lake management and restoration. Consistent, high-resolution maps of nearshore substrate and associated habitat are fundamental to support management needs, and the nexus of high-quality remotely sensed data with improvements to analytical methods are increasing opportunities for large-scale nearshore benthic mapping at project-relevant spatial resolutions. This study attempts to advance the integration of high-fidelity data (airborne imagery and lidar, satellite imagery, in situ observations, etc.) and machine learning to identify and classify nearshore benthic substrate and associated habitat using a case study in southwest Lake Michigan along Illinois Beach State Park, Illinois, USA. Data inputs and analytical methods were evaluated to better understand their implications with respect to the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) classification hierarchy, resulting in an approach that could be easily applied to other shallow coastal environments. Classification of substrate and biotic components were iteratively classified in two Tiers in which classes with increasing specificity were identified using different combinations of airborne and satellite data inputs. Classification accuracy assessments revealed that for the Tier 1 substrate component (3 classes), average overall accuracy was 90.10 +/- 0.60% for 24 airborne data combinations and 89.77 +/- 1.02% for 12 satellite data combinations, whereas the Tier 1 biotic component (2 classes) average overall accuracy was 93.58 +/- 0.91% for 24 airborne data combinations and 92.67 +/- 0.71% for 11 satellite data combinations. The Tier 2 result for the substrate component (2 classes) was 93.28% for 2 airborne data combinations and 95.25% for the biotic component (2 classes). The study builds on foundational efforts to move towards a more integrated data approach, whereby data strengths and limitations for mapping nearshore benthic substrate and associated habitat, expressed through classification accuracy, were evaluated within the context of the CMECS classification hierarchy, and has direct applicability to critical monitoring needs in the Great Lakes.

TI  - Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy of Anorthosite Samples From Near Manicouagan Crater, Canada, as Analogue for Remote Sensing of Mercury and Other Terrestrial Solar System Objects
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated mid-infrared reflectance spectra of anorthosite samples from Mt. Briand near the Manicouagan impact structure. Microprobe analyses of the plagioclase minerals reveal that they have a similar chemical composition (labradoritic), which is corroborated by the location of the Christiansen Feature at around 7.96 mu m (1256 cm(-1)). However, their respective spectral shapes differ from each other in the region of the reststrahlen bands. This is linked to the degree of Al,Si order within the plagioclase minerals, which also correlates with the previously assumed distance of the sample site to the impact melt. Powdering and sieving led to remarkable changes in the spectra resulting from different mechanical stability of minerals contained in the sample. Our data show that even very weakly shocked (6-10 GPa, shockstage S2) anorthosites could show spectra of Al,Si disordered plagioclase which we attribute to post shock heating after the impact shock. Consequently, the degree of Al,Si order has to be taken into account in the interpretation of remote sensing data. A comparison of synthetic linear mixture with an average Mercury spectrum reveals the possible presence of more or less anorthositic material with reduced degree of Al,Si order of the plagioclase component on Mercury's surface. The results of our study are helpful for the interpretation of data returned by space missions, especially for MERTIS - an infrared spectrometer on its way to Mercury.Plain Language Summary The studied rocks, which contain predominantly the feldspar mineral plagioclase, are very common in our Solar System, for example, on the Moon and probably also on Mercury. The surface of planets without atmosphere, like Moon and Mercury are constantly the target of asteroid impacts. These impacts cause changes in the constituents of the rocks. The studied samples are from the area near a meteorite crater and show weak effects of the former meteorite impact. The infrared spectra of the samples have different shapes. This shape does not correlate with the chemical composition, but with the distribution of aluminum and silicon ions in the plagioclase components of the investigated samples. This distribution is often underestimated in remote sensing. Our study shows that this distribution of these ions is related to a previously assumed distance of the sample location from the impact. The results are useful for interpreting remote sensing data coming back from space missions. In our case, in particular, from an infrared spectrometer on its way to the planet Mercury called MERTIS. The study also presents a spectrum calculated from various mineral spectra comparable to the samples analyzed. This spectrum shows similarities to an average Mercury surface spectrum and suggests that the feldspars on the Mercury surface have a very disordered ion distribution.

TI  - Changes of extreme climate and its effect on net primary productivity in Inner Mongolia
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Inner Mongolia is an important ecological security barrier for northern China. It is of great significance to understand the changes of extreme climate and its impacts on the net primary productivity (NPP) for the prevention of climate disasters and ecological protection. In this study, based on temperature and precipitation data and MODIS NPP data in Inner Mongolia, the temporal and spatial variations of extreme temperature and precipitation events and their effects on NPP were analyzed using linear trend analysis, GIS and correlation analysis. The results showed that the indices of both extreme high temperature and extreme precipitation showed an upward trend, while the index of extreme low temperature witnessed a downward trend. From 2000 to 2017, the annual NPP of Inner Mongolia increased significantly, with the greatest increase in eastern regions. The NPP in Inner Mongolia was more affected by extreme precipitation than extreme temperature, with the influence of extreme precipitation depending on vegetation types. Specifically, the extreme precipitation event had the greatest impacts on desert steppe, followed by typical steppe, shrubland, gobi desert, sandy vegetation, and field crops.

TI  - Sensitivity of Radiative Flux Simulations to Ice Cloud Parameterization over the Equatorial Western Pacific Ocean Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies suggest explanations of the observed cancellation of shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) cloud radiative effects (CREs) at the top of the atmosphere over tropical oceans where deep convection prevails, such as interactions among cloud microphysics, radiation, and dynamics. However, simulations based on general circulation models (GCMs) show disagreement in terms of the net (SW + LW) CREs over tropical deep convective ocean regions. One of the GCM uncertainty sources is the parameterization of ice cloud bulk optical properties. In this study, a combination of active and passive satellite daytime cloud retrievals is used to study the sensitivity of radiation flux calculations to ice cloud parameterization over the equatorial western Pacific Ocean region. Three ice cloud schemes are tested. The first is a widely used scheme that assumes hexagonal column ice particles. The second scheme treats ice particles as aggregates of surface-roughened hexagonal columns. The third scheme best matches the cloud ice mass-dimension relation in the cloud microphysics scheme by assuming a mixture of two ice particle habits. The results show that the hexagonal-column-based scheme has the weakest SW CRE but strongest LW CRE among the three. In addition, cloud optical thickness and effective radius are used to cluster cold-top single-layer ice clouds into three types, which resemble thin cirrus, detrained anvil clouds, and deep convective cores, respectively. In agreement with previous studies, cloud SW heating overwhelms LW cooling in the upper portion of anvil-like clouds.

TI  - Coverage and Rainfall Response of Biological Soil Crusts Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Data in a Central European Temperate Dry Acid Grassland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are thin microbiological vegetation layers that naturally develop in unfavorable higher plant conditions (i.e., low precipitation rates and high temperatures) in global drylands. They consist of poikilohydric organisms capable of adjusting their metabolic activities depending on the water availability. However, they, and with them, their ecosystem functions, are endangered by climate change and land-use intensification. Remote sensing (RS)-based studies estimated the BSC cover in global drylands through various multispectral indices, and few of them correlated the BSCs' activity response to rainfall. However, the allocation of BSCs is not limited to drylands only as there are areas beyond where smaller patches have developed under intense human impact and frequent disturbance. Yet, those areas were not addressed in RS-based studies, raising the question of whether the methods developed in extensive drylands can be transferred easily. Our temperate climate study area, the 'Lieberoser Heide' in northeastern Germany, is home to the country's largest BSC-covered area. We applied a Random Forest (RF) classification model incorporating multispectral Sentinel-2 (S2) data, indices derived from them, and topographic information to spatiotemporally map the BSC cover for the first time in Central Europe. We further monitored the BSC response to rainfall events over a period of around five years (June 2015 to end of December 2020). Therefore, we combined datasets of gridded NDVI as a measure of photosynthetic activity with daily precipitation data and conducted a change detection analysis. With an overall accuracy of 98.9%, our classification proved satisfactory. Detected changes in BSC activity between dry and wet conditions were found to be significant. Our study emphasizes a high transferability of established methods from extensive drylands to BSC-covered areas in the temperate climate. Therefore, we consider our study to provide essential impulses so that RS-based biocrust mapping in the future will be applied beyond the global drylands.

TI  - Environmental determinants of <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>, link with the diarrheal diseases, and indication of vulnerability criteria in tropical West Africa (Kapore, Burkina Faso)
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summary In 2017, diarrheal diseases were responsible for 1.57 million deaths, principally in Sub-Saharan Africa. Many diarrheal diseases are caused by the presence of enteric pathogens in surface water including Escherichia coli (E. coli), a frequently used indicator of the presence of these pathogens. Yet, few studies have been carried out in West Africa to verify this link or to study the relationship between diarrheal diseases, E. coli and environmental parameters. These diarrheal diseases also influenced by socio-health vulnerabilities. This case study addresses the dynamics of E. coli along with another fecal indicator bacteria, enterococci, as well as diarrheal diseases (from three health centers) and socio-health vulnerability (from three villages and Fulani settlements) and their relationship with hydro-meteorological parameters derivable by satellite. The study site is located in the Bagre reservoir in Burkina Faso where Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and E. coli were monitored over one year. Water was generally polluted by bacteria of fecal origin throughout the year and more so during the rainy season. We observed a significant relationship between E. coli and enterococci. E. coli concentrations were strongly correlated to, and predicted by, precipitation, satellite reflectance in the NIR band by Sentinel-2, and SPM measured in-situ. Diarrheal diseases were also strongly correlated with these variables as well as E. coli. Vulnerability of the population to diarrhea increases during the rainy season. The microbiological health risk is more important during the rainy season, from June to September, and especially concerns the Fulani settlements.In 2017, diarrheal diseases were responsible for 606 024 deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa. This situation is due to domestic and recreational use of polluted surface waters, deficits in hygiene, access to healthcare and drinking water, and to weak environmental and health monitoring infrastructures. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is an indicator for the enteric pathogens that cause many diarrheal diseases. The links between E. coli, diarrheal diseases and environmental parameters have not received much attention in West Africa, and few studies have assessed health risks by taking into account hazards and socio-health vulnerabilities. This case study, carried out in Burkina Faso (Bagre Reservoir), aims at filling this knowledge gap by analyzing the environmental variables that play a role in the dynamics of E. coli, cases of diarrhea, and by identifying initial vulnerability criteria. A particular focus is given to satellite-derived parameters to assess whether remote sensing can provide a useful tool to assess the health hazard. Samples of surface water were routinely collected to measure E. coli, enterococci and suspended particulate matter (SPM) at a monitoring point (Kapore) during one year. In addition, satellite data were used to estimate precipitation, water level, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and SPM. Monthly epidemiological data for cases of diarrhea from three health centers were also collected and compared with microbiological and environmental data. Finally, semi-structured interviews were carried out to document the use of water resources, contact with elements of the hydrographic network, health behavior and condition, and water and health policy and prevention, in order to identify the initial vulnerability criteria. A positive correlation between E. coli and enterococci in surface waters was found indicating that E. coli is an acceptable indicator of fecal contamination in this region. E. coli and diarrheal diseases were strongly correlated with monsoonal precipitation, in situ SPM, and Near Infra-Red (NIR) band between March and November. Partial least squares regression showed that E. coli concentration was strongly associated with precipitation, Sentinel-2 reflectance in the NIR and SPM, and that the cases of diarrhea were strongly associated with precipitation, NIR, E. coli, SPM, and to a lesser extent with NDVI. Moreover, E. coli dynamics were reproduced using satellite data alone, particularly from February to mid-December (R-2 = 0.60) as were cases of diarrhea throughout the year (R-2 = 0.76). This implies that satellite data could provide an important contribution to water quality monitoring. Finally, the vulnerability of the population was found to increase during the rainy season due to reduced accessibility to healthcare and drinking water sources and increased use of water of poor quality. During this period, surface water is used because it is close to habitations, easy to use and free from monetary or political constraints. This vulnerability is aggravated by marginality and particularly affects the Fulani, whose concessions are often close to surface water (river, lake) and far from health centers.

TI  - Retrieving Water Turbidity in Araucanian Lakes (South-Central Chile) Based on Multispectral Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing was used as an early alert tool for water clarity changes in five Araucanian Lakes in South-Central Chile. Turbidity records are scarce or unavailable over large and remote areas needed to fully understand the factors associated with turbidity, and their spatial-temporal representation remains a limitation. This work aimed to develop and validate empirical models to estimate values of turbidity from Landsat images and determine the spatial distribution of estimated turbidity in the selected Araucanian Lakes. Secchi disk depth measurements were linked with turbidity measurements to obtain a turbidity dataset. This in turn was used to develop and validate a set of empirical models to predict turbidity based on four single bands and 16 combination bands from 15 multispectral Landsat images. The best empirical models predicted turbidity over the range of 0.3-12.3 NTUs with RMSE values around 0.31-1.03 NTU, R-2 (Index of Agreement IA) around 0.93-0.99 (0.85-0.97) and mean bias error (MBE) around (-0.36-0.44 NTU). Estimation maps to analyze the temporal-spatial turbidity variation in the lakes were constructed. Finally, it was found that the meteorological conditions may affect the variation of turbidity, mainly precipitation and wind speed. The data indicate that the turbidity has slightly increased in winter-spring. These models will be used in the future to reconstruct large datasets that allow analyzing transparency trends in those lakes.

TI  - Seasonal InSAR Displacements Documenting the Active Layer Freeze and Thaw Progression in Central-Western Spitsbergen, Svalbard
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In permafrost areas, the active layer undergoes seasonal frost heave and thaw subsidence caused by ice formation and melting. The amplitude and timing of the ground displacement cycles depend on the climatic and ground conditions. Here we used Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) to document the seasonal displacement progression in three regions of Svalbard. We retrieved June-November 2017 time series and identified thaw subsidence maxima and their timing. InSAR measurements were compared with a composite index model based on ground surface temperature. Cyclic seasonal patterns are identified in all areas, but the timing of the displacement progression varies. The subsidence maxima occurred later on the warm western coast (Kapp Linne and Ny-angstrom lesund) compared to the colder interior (Adventdalen). The composite index model is generally able to explain the observed patterns. In Adventdalen, the model matches the InSAR time series at the location of the borehole. In Kapp Linne and Ny-angstrom lesund, larger deviations are found at the pixel-scale, but km or regional averaging improves the fit. The study highlights the potential for further development of regional InSAR products to represent the cyclic displacements in permafrost areas and infer the active layer thermal dynamics.

TI  - Monitoring Total Suspended Sediment Concentration in Spatiotemporal Domain over Teluk Lipat Utilizing Landsat 8 (OLI)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended sediment (TSS) is a water quality parameter that is used to understand sediment transport, aquatic ecosystem health, and engineering problems. The majority of TSS in water bodies is due to natural and human factors such as brought by river runoff, coastal erosion, dredging activities, and waves. It is an important parameter that should be monitored periodically, particularly over the dynamic coastal region. This study aims to monitor spatiotemporal TSS concentration over Teluk Lipat, Malaysia. To date, there are two commonly used methods to monitor TSS concentration over wide water regions. Firstly, field sampling is known very expensive and time-consuming method. Secondly, the remote sensing technology that can monitor spatiotemporal TSS concentration freely. Although remote sensing technology could overcome these problems, universal empirical or semiempirical algorithms are still not available. Most of the developed algorithms are on a regional basis. To measure TSS concentration over the different regions, a new regional algorithm needs to develop. To do so, two field trip was conducted in the study area concurrent with the passing of Landsat 8. A total of 30 field samples were collected from 30 sampling points during the first field trip and 30 samples from 30 samplings from the second field trip. The samples were then analyzed using an established method to develop the TSS algorithm. The data obtained from the first field trip were then used to develop a regional TSS algorithm using the regression analysis technique. The developed algorithm was then validated by using data obtained from the second field trip. The results demonstrated that TSS in the study area is highly correlated with three Landsat 8 bands, namely green, near-infrared (NIR), and short-wavelength (SWIR) bands, with R-2 = 0.79. The TSS map is constructed using the algorithm. Analyses of the image suggest that the highest TSSs are mainly observed along the coastal line and over the river mouth. It suggested that the main contributing factors over the study area are river runoff and wave splash.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of Long NDVI Timeseries from AVHRR, MODIS and Landsat Sensors over Landslide-Prone Locations in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The existence of several NDVI products in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) makes it challenging to identify the ideal sensor for vegetation monitoring as an important factor for landslide detection studies. A pixel-based analysis of the NDVI time series was carried out to compare the performances of five NDVI products, including ETM+, OLI, MODIS Series, and AVHRR sensors in QTP. Harmonic analysis of time series and wavelet threshold denoising were used for reconstruction and denoising of the five NDVI datasets. Each sensor performance was assessed based on the behavioral similarity between the original and denoised NDVI time series, considering the preservation of the original shape and time series values by computing correlation coefficient (CC), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and signal to noise ratio (SNR). Results indicated that the OLI slightly outperformed the other sensors in all performance metrics, especially in mosaic natural vegetation, grassland, and cropland, providing 0.973, 0.015, 0.022, and 27.220 in CC, MAE, RMSE, and SNR, respectively. AVHRR showed similar results to OLI, with the best results in the predominant type of land covers (needle-leaved, evergreen, closed to open). The MODIS series performs lower across all vegetation classes than the other sensors, which might be related to the higher number of artifacts observed in the original data. In addition to the satellite sensor comparison, the proposed analysis demonstrated the effectiveness and reliability of the implemented methodology for reconstructing and denoising different NDVI time series, indicating its suitability for long-term trend analysis of different natural land cover classes, vegetation monitoring, and change detection.

TI  - Comparing performance of inter-sensor NDVI for the detection of floating macroalgal blooms in the Yellow Sea
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - There are many complains against macroalgal bloom (MAB) from all over the world for its high negative economic impacts. Early and precise detection of MAB occurance can reduce huge economic loss in tourism and marine business. Thus, this study aims to detect the MAB in the Yellow Sea (YS) by comparing performance of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) and Landsat-8 sensors from 2014 to 2019. The largest MAB during this period was identified from Landsat-8 sensors along the coast of Sheyang and Qingdao of China in 2018. The locations of MABs were almost nearby areas during the begining phase of MABs in consecutive years. In successive years huge and dense MABs reached the brink of shoreline of Qingdao. In Landsat-8 images in most cases larger total areas of MABs were detected including very small pathches which could not be detected from GOCI due to low spatial resolution. The findings of this study will be helpful for scientists to choose between GOCI and Landsat-8 based on the objectives of their study.

TI  - Multitemporal Analysis of Land Use Changes and Their Effect on the Landscape of the Jerte Valley (Spain) by Remote Sensing
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the interest of institutions in land use has increased, creating the need to determine the changes in use through spatial-temporal and statistical analysis. This study analyzes the changes over the last 40 years, based on a cartography of landscape units obtained from the study of geo-environmental parameters in the Jerte Valley (Spain) with satellite images, Landsat 5 and 7. Subsequently, through the analysis of spatial patterns and diversity and fragmentation indices, and with the Fragstat software, the landscape was characterized from 1994 to the present. The results show that wooded areas decreased slightly, crops increased in altitude and major environmental disturbances (mainly forest fires) negatively affected the environmental mosaic. Land uses affect the landscape by developing larger tesserae (+5 ha), which are less fragmented (-0.15), but more isolated (0.12). This study demonstrates that landscape metrics can be used to understand changes in spatial pattern, help in decision making to implement appropriate management measures in the conservation of traditional land uses, and allow the maintenance of connecting areas between fragments to avoid the loss of natural corridors to increase landscape quality.

TI  - Remote Sensing Calculation of the Influence of Wildfire on Erosion in High Mountain Areas
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is one of the most important environmental problems of the moment, especially in areas affected by wildfires. In this paper, we study pre-fire and post-fire erosion using remote sensing techniques with Sentinel-2 satellite images and LiDAR. The Normalized Burn Ratio is used to determine the areas affected by the fire that occurred on 18 August 2016 in the Natural Reserve of Garganta de los Infiernos (Caceres). To calculate the erosion, the multi-criteria analysis is carried out from the RUSLE. Once all calculations were performed, there was a considerable increase in sediment production from 16 June 2016 (pre-fire) with an erosion of 31 T/ha.year to 16 June 2017 of 74 T/ha year for areas of moderate fire severity, and an increase from 11 T/ha.year in 2016 to 70 T/ha.year for areas with a very high severity. From the NDVI, it was possible to verify that this also affected the recovery of post-fire vegetation, decreasing the NDVI index 0.36 in areas of moderate severity and 0.53 in areas of very high severity.

TI  - Using Climate Model Simulations to Constrain Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - We compare atmospheric temperature changes in satellite data and in model ensembles performed under phases 5 and 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6). In the lower stratosphere, multidecadal stratospheric cooling during the period of strong ozone depletion is smaller in newer CMIP6 simulations than in CMIP5 or satellite data. In the troposphere, however, despite forcing and climate sensitivity differences between the two CMIP ensembles, their ensemble-average global warming over 1979-2019 is very similar. We also examine four properties of tropical behavior governed by basic physical processes. The first three are ratios between trends in water vapor (WV) and trends in sea surface temperature (SST), lower-tropospheric temperature (TLT), and mid- to upper-tropospheric temperature (TMT). The fourth property is the ratio between TMT and SST trends. All four ratios are tightly constrained in CMIP simulations but diverge markedly in observations. Model trend ratios between WV and temperature are closest to observed ratios when the latter are calculated with datasets exhibiting larger tropical warming of the ocean surface and troposphere. For the TMT/SST ratio, model-data consistency depends on the combination of observations used to estimate TMT and SST trends. If model expectations of these four covariance relationships are realistic, our findings reflect either a systematic low bias in satellite tropospheric temperature trends or an overestimate of the observed atmospheric moistening signal. It is currently difficult to determine which interpretation is more credible. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals anomalous covariance behavior in several observational datasets and illustrates the diagnostic power of simultaneously considering multiple complementary variables.

TI  - Multiple Air Quality Monitoring Evidence of the Impacts of Large-scale Social Restrictions during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Jakarta, Indonesia
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is a top contributor to global mortality. Air quality issues abound in developing Asian countries, but during COVID-19 lockdowns, urban air quality improved due to the reduction in public mobility and fuel consumption. In Indonesia, the Large-Scale Social Restriction (LSSR) program was implemented to prevent the wider spread of COVID-19, especially in large urban areas. It was not a total lockdown program but had the purpose of reducing urban public mobility. This study investigated the effects of social restrictions on air quality in Jakarta, Indonesia. Data were obtained from our long-term monitoring of fine (PM2.5) and coarse particulate matter (PM2.5-10) and compositions collected at a site in South Jakarta. Other data were obtained from the environmental protection agency's (EPA's) air quality monitoring station in Central Jakarta including PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, and O-3. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) in Jakarta measured by a sun photometer and satellite data were used to assess the spatial distribution of AOD across Jakarta. During the first LSSR implementation period from 15 March to 30 May 2020, there were decreased average SO2, CO, NO, NO2, and NOx concentrations of 40 to 60% compared to the same period in 2019. However, O-3 increased by 33% likely due to reduction in NOx emissions. The PM2.5 decline reached similar to 40%, but a similar decline was not observed for PM10. Elemental and black carbon concentration data showed reductions that ranged from 30% to more than 50%. Consistent with the PM observations, both ground and satellite based AOD showed reductions in the aerosol column burden over the city. The ground based AOD values showed moderate correlations with PM2.5. The results confirmed that significant reduction in public mobility was highly associated with the improvement of local air quality which useful to derive future control strategies.

AB  - We present a comprehensive analysis of pre-seismic anomalies as computed from the ground and space-based techniques during the recent Samos earthquake in Greece on 30 October 2020, with a magnitude M = 6.9. We proceed with a multi-parametric approach where pre-seismic irregularities are investigated in the stratosphere, ionosphere, and magnetosphere. We use the convenient methods of acoustics and electromagnetic channels of the Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere-Coupling (LAIC) mechanism by investigating the Atmospheric Gravity Wave (AGW), magnetic field, electron density, Total Electron Content (TEC), and the energetic particle precipitation in the inner radiation belt. We incorporate two ground-based IGS GPS stations DYNG (Greece) and IZMI (Turkey) for computing the TEC and observed a significant enhancement in daily TEC variation around one week before the earthquake. For the space-based observation, we use multiple parameters as recorded from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. For the AGW, we use the SABER/TIMED satellite data and compute the potential energy of stratospheric AGW by using the atmospheric temperature profile. It is found that the maximum potential energy of such AGW is observed around six days before the earthquake. Similar AGW is also observed by the method of wavelet analysis in the fluctuation in TEC values. We observe significant energetic particle precipitation in the inner radiation belt over the earthquake epicenter due to the conventional concept of an ionospheric-magnetospheric coupling mechanism by using an NOAA satellite. We first eliminate the particle count rate (CR) due to possible geomagnetic storms and South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) by the proper choice of magnetic field B values. After the removal of the statistical background CRs, we observe a significant enhancement of CR four and ten days before the mainshock. We use Swarm satellite outcomes to check the magnetic field and electron density profile over a region of earthquake preparation. We observe a significant enhancement in electron density one day before the earthquake. The parameters studied here show an overall pre-seismic anomaly from a duration of ten days to one day before the earthquake.

TI  - Retrieval of betalain contents based on the coupling of radiative transfer model and SVM model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Betalain (Bt) is as a class of edible natural pigments and important biochemical aparmeter can explain the physiological response and the resistance of plants caused by different environmental stress factors. Hyperspectral spectroscopy has been widely used to estimate plant pigments contents accurately and non-destructively. However, there is very little research about hyperspectral remote sensing estimation and inversion of betalain contents. The algorithm of Bt content inversion with viable universality is the key to improving the practicality of quantitative remote sensing. Therefore, in this study, based on the radioactive transfer mechanism and SVM model, the optical characteristics of Bt and other factors of Suaeda salsa are analyzed, and a coupling model (PROSAIL + SVM) of simulated canopy reflectivity and factor contents is established. The model was then applied to the remote sensing inversion. Results demonstrated that Bt content was sensitive to the spectral range between 460 and 592 nm, particularly between 530 and 550 nm where the sensitivity index reached 0.7. Optimized indices; NDSI473nm,475nm, RSI473nm,475nm and NDPI473nm,475nm, calculated by simulated spectral reflectance had a significant correlation with Bt content (R= ?0.80, p < 0.001). Moreover, simulated Sentinel-2A reflectance of the Blue (B2) and Green (B3) bands showed sensitivity of 66% and 68%, respectively. Spectral indices NDPI b2, b3, NDSI b2, b3, RSIb2, b3 showed correlation of ? 0.71. The PROSAIL + SVM model developed from simulated hyperspectral reflectance, estimated Bt content with high R2 (0.82), indicating that the precision of the model was higher and the universality was stronger. A model composed of optimized indices (NDSI473nm, 475nm, RSI473nm, 475nm and NDPI473nm, 475nm) showed promising estimation ability with low RMSE (0.39 ?g?cm? 2) with R2 = 0.78 and RPD = 1.99. When the PROSAIL + SVM model was extended to multispectral images (Sentinel-2A), the model estimated the Bt content at moderate to good levels (R2 = 0.68). The results indicated that optimized hyperspectral and multispectral NDPI, NDSI, RSI have significant correlation with betalain content of S. salsa, suggesting these indices might be used to quantify Bt content with high accuracy, thereby alleviating the ill-posed inverse problem and improving sensitivity. Not only would this enhance the application of quantitative remote sensing technology in betalain research, but the results also pose positive application for precision agriculture in detecting Bt pigments in crops, as a surrogate for evaluating the health condition of crops.

TI  - Style transfer-based domain adaptation or vegetation segmentation with optical imagery
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Style transfer methods are an important task for domain adaptation of optical imagery to improve the performance of deep learning models when using different sensor systems. For the transformation between datasets, cycle-consistent adversarial networks achieve good results. However, during the style transfer process, characteristic spectral information that is essential for the analysis of vegetation could get lost. This issue is especially important since optical airborne- and spaceborne-based sensors are frequently used to investigate vegetation ground coverage and its condition. In this paper, we present a cycle-consistent adversarial domain adaptation method with four input channels for the segmentation of vegetation areas using index-based metrics. We show that our method preserves the specific ratio between the near-IR and RGB bands and improves the segmentation network performance for the target domain. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI  - Sustainable Recovery of Secondary and Critical Raw Materials from Classified Mining Residues Using Mycorrhizal-Assisted Phytoextraction
T2  - METALS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, mycorrhizal-assisted phytoextraction (MAP, Helianthus annuus-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus intraradices-Zn-volcanic ashes) was applied for the recovery of secondary and critical raw materials (SRMs and CRMs, respectively) from Joda West (Odisha, India) mine residues, within a novel multidisciplinary management strategy. Mine residues were preliminarily characterized by using advanced analytical techniques, and subsequently mapped, classified and selected using multispectral satellite Sentinel-2A images and cluster analysis. Selected mine residues were treated by MAP at laboratory scale, and the fate of several SRMs (e.g., Zn, Cr, As, Ni, Cu, Ca, Al, K, S, Rb, Fe, Mn) and CRMs (such as Ga, Ti, P, Ba and Sr) was investigated. Bioconcentration factors in shoots (BCS) and roots (BCR) and translocation factors (TF) were: 5.34(P) > BCS > 0.00(Al); 15.0(S) > BCR > 0.038(Ba); 9.28(Rb) > TF > 0.02(Ti). Results were used to predict MAP performance at larger scale, simulating a Vegetable Depuration Module (VDM) containing mine residues (1 m(3)). Estimated bio-extracting potential (BP) was in the range 2417 g/m(3) (K) > BP> 0.14 g/m(3) (As), suggesting the eventual subsequent recovery of SRMs and CRMs by hydrometallurgical techniques, with final purification by selective electrodeposition, as a viable and cost-effective option. The results are promising for MAP application at larger scale, within a circular economy-based approach.

TI  - PLANT STRUCTURAL POPULATION AND DYNAMICS OF DEGRADED ECOSYSTEMS IN SOUTHERN BENOUE OF NORTH CAMEROON
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOSYSTEMS AND ECOLOGY SCIENCE-IJEES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the structure and dynamics of vegetation was carried out in the ecosystems of southern Benoue in northern Cameroon. The general objective of this work is to characterize the structure of the vegetation and to assess the degradation of the ecosystems. The inventory methods chosen include biodiversity survey techniques commonly used in ecological studies. A total of 36 100 m x 100 m quadrat plots were established in four plant formation: reserve, forest gallery, field and anthropized savanna to take dendrometric parameters such as size, diameter at breast height of all woody species. Landsat satellite images were processed and analyzed between 1989 and 2019 using Google Earth and GIS software, QGIS 10.12.1.The vegetation presents a physiognomy of open forest with a diametral L-shaped structure reflecting the dominance of individuals of small DBH and a vertical "U" structure reversed from sites and plant formations reflecting a low representation of juvenile and adult individuals. As for the diachronic study by remote sensing, it emerges from the variations of land use elements an increase in field (by 29%, 10% and 20%), of the grassy savannah (by 2%, 14% and 8 %) and buildings and bare soil (by 5%, 8% and 2%) and a decrease in shrub savannah (by -31%, -23% and -14%), in wooded savannah (by -2%) , -5% and -12%) and gallery forest (-4%, -5% and -4%) respectively for Garoua 3, Lagdo and Ngong. Overall, our zone is marked by an accentuated state of degradation of the vegetation with a current state of cover of the grassy savanna of 38%, of the field of 28%, of the shrub savannah of 16%, of the wooded savanna and the frame and bare floors of 7% each, the forest gallery of 5% and the open water of 4%.These results open up better prospects for the development of planning and development mechanisms of this area not yet deeply explored for the bases of a good management strategy.

TI  - Climate-driven phenological changes in the Russian Arctic derived from MODIS LAI time series 2000-2019
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic surface temperature has increased at approximately twice the global rate over the past few decades and is also projected to warm most in the 21st century. However, the mechanism of Arctic vegetation response to this warming remains largely uncertain. Here, we analyse variations in the seasonal profiles of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Leaf Area Index (LAI) and ERA-interim cumulative near-Surface Air Temperature (SAT(sigma)) over the northern Russia, north of 60 degrees N for 2000-2019. We find that commonly used broad temporal interval (seasonal) trends cannot fully represent complex interannual variations of the LAI profile over the growing season. A sequence of narrow temporal interval (weekly) LAI trends form an inverted S-shape over the course of the growing season with enhanced green-up and senescence, but balanced during the growing season's peak. Spatial patterns of weekly LAI trends match with those of weekly SAT(sigma) trends during the green-up, while the drivers of the browning trends during senescence remain unclear. Geographically the area with the statistically significant temperature-driven enhanced green-up is restricted by a large patch carrying significant positive SAT(sigma) trends, which includes North Siberian Lowland, Taimyr, Yamal and adjacent territories. The strength, duration and timing of the changes depend on vegetation type: enhanced green-up is most pronounced in tundra, while enhanced senescence is pronounced in forests. Continued release of the climatic constraints will likely increase the capacity both of the environment (i.e. permafrost thawing) and vegetation (i.e. appearance of more productive woody species), and transform LAI seasonal shifts to change of LAI seasonal amplitude.

TI  - A Novel Hybrid Learning System Using Modified Breaking Ties Algorithm and Multinomial Logistic Regression for Classification and Segmentation of Hyperspectral Images
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - A new methodology, the hybrid learning system (HLS), based upon semi-supervised learning is proposed. HLS categorizes hyperspectral images into segmented regions with discriminative features using reduced training size. The technique utilizes the modified breaking ties (MBT) algorithm for active learning and unsupervised learning-based regressors, viz. multinomial logistic regression, for hyperspectral image categorization. The probabilities estimated by multinomial logistic regression for each sample helps towards improved segregation. The high dimensionality leads to a curse of dimensionality, which ultimately deteriorates the performance of remote sensing data classification, and the problem aggravates further if labeled training samples are limited. Many studies have tried to address the problem and have employed different methodologies for remote sensing data classification, such as kernelized methods, because of insensitiveness towards the utilization of large dataset information and active learning (AL) approaches (breaking ties as a representative) to choose only prominent samples for training data. The HLS methodology proposed in the current study is a combination of supervised and unsupervised training with generalized composite kernels generating posterior class probabilities for classification. In order to retrieve the best segmentation labels, we employed Markov random fields, which make use of prior labels from the output of the multinomial logistic regression. The comparison of HLS was carried out with known methodologies, using benchmark hyperspectral imaging (HI) datasets, namely "Indian Pines" and "Pavia University". Findings of this study show that the HLS yields the overall accuracy of {99.93% and 99.98%}(Indian Pines) and {99.14% and 99.42%}(Pavia University) for classification and segmentation, respectively.

TI  - Deep Hashing Using Proxy Loss on Remote Sensing Image Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the improvement of various space-satellite shooting methods, the sources, scenes, and quantities of remote sensing data are also increasing. An effective and fast remote sensing image retrieval method is necessary, and many researchers have conducted a lot of work in this direction. Nevertheless, a fast retrieval method called hashing retrieval is proposed to improve retrieval speed, while maintaining retrieval accuracy and greatly reducing memory space consumption. At the same time, proxy-based metric learning losses can reduce convergence time. Naturally, we present a proxy-based hash retrieval method, called DHPL (Deep Hashing using Proxy Loss), which combines hash code learning with proxy-based metric learning in a convolutional neural network. Specifically, we designed a novel proxy metric learning network, and we used one hash loss function to reduce the quantified losses. For the University of California Merced (UCMD) dataset, DHPL resulted in a mean average precision (mAP) of up to 98.53% on 16 hash bits, 98.83% on 32 hash bits, 99.01% on 48 hash bits, and 99.21% on 64 hash bits. For the aerial image dataset (AID), DHPL achieved an mAP of up to 93.53% on 16 hash bits, 97.36% on 32 hash bits, 98.28% on 48 hash bits, and 98.54% on 64 bits. Our experimental results on UCMD and AID datasets illustrate that DHPL could generate great results compared with other state-of-the-art hash approaches.

AB  - In this letter, a texture classification-based nonlocal means polarimetric SAR (NLM PolSAR) filter is introduced and named as texture classification-based filter (TBF). In this process, a classification algorithm that identifies the data into textural variations and heterogeneity due to speckle noise is presented. Also, a similarity metric is derived to estimate the patch similarity of K-distributed covariance matrices. Hence, a filter is proposed that processes the classified data suitably using NLM patch-based filters with either K- or Wishart distribution patch similarity metrics. The filtering performance of TBF is being analyzed on full-pol single-look RADARSAT-2 and four-look Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) data.

T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - The fire happened in the Amazon in 2019 attracted worldwide attention. There are many problems to be solved with respect to the fire. Where exactly was the burning area concentrated? The duration and calamity degree also need to be explored. It is unclear whether there was a serious meteorological drought with less abnormal precipitation. Based on the MOD14A2 fire products, MCD64A1 burning sites, precipitation, surface cover types and other multi -source data, we investigated the spatial and temporal variations of the 2019 fire in the Amazon using the geographic information system and remote sensing technology. The spatiotemporal correlation between the 2019 fire and precipitation was analyzed. The cause of fire was reasonably presumed using Spearman correlation coefficient and spatial correlation analysis method. The results showed that the fires in the Amazon had obvious temporal and spatial variations. Fires usually happened during the period from the end of July to the end of September, and were mainly distributed in Brazil and Bolivia in the southern part of the study area. Fires mainly occurred in the evergreen broad-leaved forest and savanna. There was a significant negative correlation between precipitation and the number of fires with a delay of 1-2 months, which affected the temporal distribution of fires. However, the spatial correlation coefficient was close to 0, indicating no direct spatial correlation between precipitation and fire. Moreover, some fires were distributed in the area where human activities were frequent, which was probably related to human factors.

TI  - Urban Heat Island and Its Regional Impacts Using Remotely Sensed Thermal Data-A Review of Recent Developments and Methodology
T2  - LAND
M3  - Review
AB  - Many novel research algorithms have been developed to analyze urban heat island (UHI) and UHI regional impacts (UHIRIP) with remotely sensed thermal data tables. We present a comprehensive review of some important aspects of UHI and UHIRIP studies that use remotely sensed thermal data, including concepts, datasets, methodologies, and applications. We focus on reviewing progress on multi-sensor image selection, preprocessing, computing, gap filling, image fusion, deep learning, and developing new metrics. This literature review shows that new satellite sensors and valuable methods have been developed for calculating land surface temperature (LST) and UHI intensity, and for assessing UHIRIP. Additionally, some of the limitations of using remotely sensed data to analyze the LST, UHI, and UHI intensity are discussed. Finally, we review a variety of applications in UHI and UHIRIP analyses. The assimilation of time-series remotely sensed data with the application of data fusion, gap filling models, and deep learning using the Google Cloud platform and Google Earth Engine platform also has the potential to improve the estimation accuracy of change patterns of UHI and UHIRIP over long time periods.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed trends in patient safety incidents (PSIs) and the factors associated with the PSIs by analyzing 2017-2019 Patient Safety Report data in Korea. We extracted 2940 records in 2017, 5889 in 2018, and 7386 in 2019, from hospitals with more than 200 beds, and used all 16,215 cases for analysis. SPSS 25.0 was used for a multi-nominal logistic regression analysis. The PSI trend analysis, the standardized Jonckheere-Terpstra test was significant. On analyzing the probability of adverse events based on near misses, the significant variables were patient age, the season when PSIs occurred, incident reporter, hospital size, the location of PSIs, the type of PSIs, and medical department. Additionally, the factors that were likely to precipitate sentinel events based on near misses were patient sex, patient age, incident reporter, the type of PSIs, and medical department. To prevent sentinel events in PSIs, female and older patients are required to pay close attention. Moreover, it is necessary to establish a patient safety reporting system in which not only all medical personnel, but also patients, generally, can actively participate in patient safety activities and report voluntarily.

TI  - Impervious Surfaces Mapping at City Scale by Fusion of Radar and Optical Data through a Random Forest Classifier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization increases the amount of impervious surfaces, making accurate information on spatial and temporal expansion trends essential; the challenge is to develop a cost- and labor-effective technique that is compatible with the assessment of multiple geographical locations in developing countries. Several studies have identified the potential of remote sensing and multiple source information in impervious surface quantification. Therefore, this study aims to fuse datasets from the Sentinel 1 and 2 Satellites to map the impervious surfaces of nine Pakistani cities and estimate their growth rates from 2016 to 2020 utilizing the random forest algorithm. All bands in the optical and radar images were resampled to 10 m resolution, projected to same coordinate system and geometrically aligned to stack into a single product. The models were then trained, and classifications were validated with land cover samples from Google Earth's high-resolution images. Overall accuracies of classified maps ranged from 85% to 98% with the resultant quantities showing a strong linear relationship (R-squared value of 0.998) with the Copernicus Global Land Services data. There was up to 9% increase in accuracy and up to 12 % increase in kappa coefficient from the fused data with respect to optical alone. A McNemar test confirmed the superiority of fused data. Finally, the cities had growth rates ranging from 0.5% to 2.5%, with an average of 1.8%. The information obtained can alert urban planners and environmentalists to assess impervious surface impacts in the cities.

TI  - Impact of Land Use Change Due to Urbanisation on Surface Runoff Using GIS-Based SCS-CN Method: A Case Study of Xiamen City, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urban development results in visible changes in land use due to increase in impervious surfaces from human construction and decrease in pervious areas. Urbanisation influences the hydrological cycle of an area, resulting in less infiltration, higher flood peak, and surface runoff. This study analysed the impact of land use change due to urbanisation on surface runoff, using the geographic information system (GIS)-based soil conservation service curve number (SCS-CN) method, during the period of rapid urban development from 1980 to 2015 in Xiamen, located in south-eastern China. Land use change was analysed from the data obtained by classifying Landsat images from 1980, 1990, 2005, and 2015. Results indicated that farmland decreased the most by 14.01%, while built-up areas increased the most by 15.7%, from 1980 to 2015. Surface runoff was simulated using the GIS-based SCS-CN method for the rainfall return periods of 5, 10, 20, and 50 years. The spatial and temporal variation of runoff was obtained for each land use period. Results indicate that the increase in surface runoff was highest in the period of 1990-2005, with an increase of 10.63%. The effect of urbanisation can be realised from the amount of runoff, contributed by built-up land use type in the study area, that increased from 14.2% to 27.9% with the rise of urban expansion from 1980 to 2015. The relationship between land use and surface runoff showed that the rapid increase in constructed land has significantly influenced the surface runoff of the area. Therefore, the introduction of nature-based solutions such as green infrastructure could be a potential solution for runoff mitigation and reducing urban flood risks in the context of increasing urbanization.

TI  - Recent Trends in SST, Chl-<i>a</i>, Productivity and Wind Stress in Upwelling and Open Ocean Areas in the Upper Eastern North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The global upper ocean has been warming during the last decades accompanied with a chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and productivity decrease. Whereas subtropical gyres show similar trends, Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems are thought to increase in productivity due to increased trade winds. This study analyzes recent trends in sea surface temperature (SST), Chl-a, net primary production (NPP) and meridional wind stress in the Eastern North Atlantic subtropical gyre (NASE) in order to examine if the global trends can be detected in open ocean and upwelling areas and how the ocean biota responds. Satellite data of such variables of the last 15-40 years were analyzed to calculate mean trends in upwelling areas in the Canary upwelling system and open ocean areas around the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands. Our results show significant warming in the area with a maximum of 2.7 degrees C per century for the Azores. Moreover, a general decreasing trend for Chl-a and NPP seems to be more evident in the permanent upwelling areas, which will be responsible for a loss of 0.13% of the global NPP per century. Our results also highlight a significant expansion of the oceanic desert area of 10% with an increase in unproductive days of up to 84 days in the last 20 years. The competitive relationship of stratification and wind stress in the Canary upwelling system might be a more plausible explanation for the decrease in Chl-a and NPP in upwelling areas linked to the increase in upwelling favorable wind stress and the surface warming.

TI  - "A DISUNITED KINGDOM": THE MUSLIM DIASPORA OF GREAT BRITAIN IN SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION
T2  - MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The present world is characterized by the growth of conflicts. Dividing lines and fractures are increasingly appearing in societies. Migration reinforces such phenomena. The West is no longer an area of stability and prosperity. Moreover, in the last two decades, the problem of integrating the descendants of migrants into society has become clear. In this regard, the scientific discussions of cultural identity acquire a high practical significance. The paper presents an analysis of the scientific discourse on the Muslim issue in the UK. The choice of the case is due to the fact that the UK is a typical Western state, where there is a steady trend to strengthen the cleavage of society. At the same time, it is noted that migration has become one of the key processes in the history of the United Kingdom. The authors apply the concepts of a divided society and responsible development. It is noted that in practice multiculturalism is changing to interculturalism as a more adequate concept of solving existing problems. According to the authors, the ethno-religious discourse on the issue of the Muslim diaspora in the UK consists of four areas: migration, school and higher education, gender, and radicalization of young people. Discourses on the problems of migration policy and functioning of diasporas, Muslim education, gender equality, and radicalization of Islamic youth can be considered derived from a higher discourse - the discourse of identity, which is based on value-worldview aspects. In conclusion, it is noted that negative processes are taking place in British society, which are of strategic importance for responsible development. According to the authors, success in overcoming divisions in British society will depend on coordinated planned actions at all levels (international, national, regional, local). "Indigenous" residents and the Muslim diaspora need to build a model of partnership, which implies mutual responsibility. The analysis of scientific discourses presented in the article inspires moderate optimism, as it offers well-founded and concrete solutions to the existing problems of British society. Although British society is divided, British scientific discourse has a common platform where researchers of different backgrounds and faiths successfully engage in dialogue.

TI  - Spatial Assessment of Para Rubber (<i>Hevea</i> <i>brasiliensis</i>) above Ground Biomass Potentials in Songkhla Province, Southern Thailand
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, Songkhla Province of Thailand has been recognized as a convenient hub of rubber industry development, accompanied by an attendant abundance of rubber tree plantations. A spatialized assessment of the rubber tree was carried out to estimate its aboveground biomass potentials using remote sensing techniques and ecosystem modeling procedures. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite-based estimations of the net primary productivity were derived and complemented with a calculated generic model, to quantify the respective above ground biomass potentials para rubber. Above ground biomass assessment findings revealed a mean value of 82.1 tonnes C ha(-1) and an aggregate of 31. 9 million tonnes C ha(-1) which is the theoretical potential, this is segregated into energy usable, and other economic purpose biomass potentials, with corresponding value ranges of 1624.1 to 6,041,531.2 million tonnes C ha(-1) and 85.5 to 317,975.6 thousand tonnes C ha(-1) respectively. Besides the theoretical above ground biomass potential (entire biomass accumulation ratio) commonly evaluated, the other potentials, which include naturally obtainable biomass usable for energy generation and the remaining share of the feedstock for non-energy uses, have been brought to light. Songkhla province has the potential for good carbon sink and sustainable supply of different pools of feedstock from the rubber tree that reinforces each other in providing a comprehensive view of biomass in energy and non-energy opportunities. The socioeconomic production and value chain analysis of the identified biomass pools needs to be evaluated; this will consequently guide policy toward a comprehensive rubber sector sustainable development.

T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Community-based ecotourism is an appropriate approach which is effectively preserved mangrove sustainability. As an effort to identify the priority areas of mangrove development, mangrove density levels need to be analyzed. The distribution of mangroves with the lowest average density value needs to be prioritized as a preservation and conservation strategy through community-based ecotourism concept. This article aims to identify the distribution of mangroves using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) model in North Halmahera Regency, Indonesia. Also, discuss the sustainable livelihoods' perspective. This study adopted a mixed-method. Data processing is divided into two stages: first stage, mapping the distribution of mangroves based on density levels; second stage, triangulation. Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) in 2013 and 2021 were used as primary data to get the NDVI value, and categorized mangrove density level in Pilawang Cape, Kumo Island, Kakara Island, Maiti Island, and Tagalaya Island. The findings show that Pilawang Cape has the lowest NDVI value. The average NDVI value in 2021 is 0.22 which can be categorized as a rare mangrove forest according to the mangrove standard damage criteria. Thus, Mangrove area in Pilawang Cape needs to be prioritized as a preservation and conservation strategy through community-based ecotourism concept.

TI  - Land-use changes in Northern Ukraine: patterns and dynamics of illegal amber mining during 1986-2016
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Political instability and economic crises may trigger informal, unsustainable and often illegal land use, leading to land degradation. One of the most recent and striking examples of such a phenomenon within Europe is demonstrated by the Polissia region in Northern Ukraine, famous for its amber deposits. Amid severe political disturbances and subsequent economic recession in Ukraine in 2014 and 2015, amber mining flourished in the region. However, the extent and spatial pattern of degraded land caused by amber mining over the entire region has remained unknown. To fill this gap and track land surface changes, we used multi-source satellite imagery. We found a gradual decrease of the area without vegetation cover, as a proxy for degraded land, from the late Soviet period until 2014 in most of the analysed administrative districts of Polissia. In contrast to this, we identified substantial conversion of forest and agricultural land to bare soil that occurred between 2014 and 2016, which can be attributed to the rush of illegal amber mining in the region. The estimated total area of affected land on the produced Landsat-based map for 2016 was 1066 ha, 60% of which occurred in 2014-2016. Land cover classification within a key study area suggests that utilization of very high-resolution images from the WorldView-2 satellite enables more accurate mapping of land degradation and identification of small mining sites. Further monitoring of land-use change caused by amber mining is essential to improving understanding of long-lasting environmental impacts on regional ecosystems and biodiversity.

TI  - Coastal Wetland Shoreline Change Monitoring: A Comparison of Shorelines from High-Resolution WorldView Satellite Imagery, Aerial Imagery, and Field Surveys
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline change analysis is an important environmental monitoring tool for evaluating coastal exposure to erosion hazards, particularly for vulnerable habitats such as coastal wetlands where habitat loss is problematic world-wide. The increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery and emerging developments in analysis techniques support the implementation of these data into shoreline monitoring. Geospatial shoreline data created from a semi-automated methodology using WorldView (WV) satellite data between 2013 and 2020 were compared to contemporaneous field-surveyed Global Position System (GPS) data. WV-derived shorelines were found to have a mean difference of 2 +/- 0.08 m of GPS data, but accuracy decreased at high-wave energy shorelines that were unvegetated, bordered by sandy beach or semi-submergent sand bars. Shoreline change rates calculated from WV imagery were comparable to those calculated from GPS surveys and geospatial data derived from aerial remote sensing but tended to overestimate shoreline erosion at highly erosive locations (greater than 2 m yr(-1)). High-resolution satellite imagery can increase the spatial scale-range of shoreline change monitoring, provide rapid response to estimate impacts of coastal erosion, and reduce cost of labor-intensive practices.

TI  - Contemporary management of locoregionally advanced melanoma in Australia and New Zealand and the role of adjuvant systemic therapy
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Australia and New Zealand have the highest incidence and mortality rates for melanoma in the world. Local surgery is still the standard treatment of primary cutaneous melanoma, and it is therefore important that surgeons understand the optimal care pathways for patients with melanoma. Accurate staging is critical to ensure a reliable assessment of prognosis and to guide treatment selection. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) plays an important role in staging and the provision of reliable prognostic estimates for patients with cutaneous melanoma. Patients with stage III melanoma have a substantial risk of disease recurrence following surgery, leading to poor long-term outcomes. Systemic immunotherapies and targeted therapies, known to be effective for stage IV melanoma, have now also been shown to be effective as adjuvant post-surgical treatments for resected stage III melanoma. These patients should be made aware of this and preferably managed in an integrated multidisciplinary model of care, involving the surgeon, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists. This review considers the impact of a recent update to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, the role of SNB for patients with high-risk primary melanoma and recent advances in adjuvant systemic therapies for high-risk patients.

TI  - Prediction of Recurrence of Completely Resected Pancreatic Solid Pseudopapillary Neoplasms in Pediatric Patients: A Single Center Analysis
T2  - CHILDREN-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Many previous studies have investigated the risk factors for the recurrence of pancreatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs), although a consensus has not yet been reached, despite this effort. We aimed to identify the predictive factors for recurrence in patients with SPNs who underwent complete surgical resection of the tumor. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the records of pediatric patients with SPNs who underwent surgical resection at a single center between 2001 and 2018. Results: During the study period, 47 patients with SPNs underwent radical resection of the tumor. The median age of the patients was 14 (8-18) years. R0 resection was confirmed in every case and none of the patients presented with systemic metastasis at the time of diagnosis. The median follow-up period was 53.1 (30.8-150.8) months. Of the 47 patients, only two (4.2%) experienced recurrence. Using comparative analysis, we found that some factors such as a large tumor size, peripancreatic tissue invasion, and capsule invasion did not increase the risk of recurrence of SPNs. Lymph node metastasis was the only significant factor for recurrence in our study (p = 0.043). Conclusion: During our single center analysis, we found that only lymph node metastasis was a predictive factor for recurrence of SPNs among patients who underwent complete tumor resection. Long-term follow-up is required to determine whether SPNs will recur if lymph node metastasis is observed after surgery. Furthermore, therapeutic benefits of routine lymphadenectomy or sentinel lymph node biopsy should be investigated in future studies to reduce the risk of recurrence in patients with SPNs.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical space characteristics of infrared hyperspectral hyperspectral atmospheric sounder data are indirectly determined by spectral pertbrrnance indicators of the sounder, and are related to the interested atmospheric parameter and its variation. Based on removing those invalid channels whose atmospheric parameter sounding signal-to-noise are too low, the sounding altitude, sounding altitude resolution, sounding vertical asymmetry and sounding vertical coverage of water vapor and ozone are evaluated for FY-4A satellite infrared hyper-spectral atmospheric sounder GIIRS data. Then they are compared with the vertical space characteristics of atmospheric temperature sounding. The results show that, 1) similar to atmospheric temperature, FY-4A GIIRS can sound the vertical distribution of atmospheric water vapor, where the vertical coverage of water vapor sounding is troposphere lower than 12km (the sounding peak altitude is below 11 km) , and atmospheric temperature can sound the entire troposphere and lower-and-middle stratosphere. 2) FY-4A GIIRS can sound total ozone in 10-21 km, and the sounding altitudes are distributed concentratedly near 16. 4 km. This study is helpful to grasp the application ability of FY-4A GIIRS infrared hyperspectral data from the perspective of sounding vertical space characteristics.

TI  - Characterization of Urban Heat Islands Using City Lights: Insights from MODIS and VIIRS DNB Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An urban heat island (UHI) is a phenomenon whereby the temperature in an urban area is significantly warmer than it a rural area. To further advance the characterization and understanding of UHIs within urban areas, nighttime light measured by the Day/Night Band (DNB) onboard the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and the land surface temperature (LST) data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) combined with principal component analysis (PCA) are used here. Beijing (highly developed) and Pyongyang (less developed) are selected as the two case studies. Linear correlation analysis is first used, with higher correlations being found between DNB and LST data at nighttime than between population and LST data for both cities, although none of the correlation coefficients are particularly high because of noise. Principal component analysis (PCA), a method that can remove random noise, is used to extract more useful information. Two types of PCA are conducted, focusing on spatial (S) and temporal (T) patterns. The results of the S-mode PCA reveal that the typical temporal variation is a seasonal cycle for both LST and DNB data in Beijing and Pyongyang. Furthermore, there are monthly cycles for DNB data related to the moon phase in two cities. The T-mode PCA results show important spatial information, while the spatial pattern of the first mode explains over 50% of the variation. This study is among the first to demonstrate the advantages of using urban light to study the spatial variation of urban heat, especially for nighttime urban temperatures measured from space, at the street and neighborhood scales.

TI  - Assessment of Snowfall Accumulation from Satellite and Reanalysis Products Using SNOTEL Observations in Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of snowfall, snow water equivalent (SWE), and precipitation rate measurements from 39 snow telemetry (SNOTEL) sites in Alaska were used to assess the performance of various precipitation products from satellites, reanalysis, and rain gauges. Observation of precipitation from two water years (2018-2019) of a high-resolution radar/rain gauge data (Stage IV) product was also utilized to give insights into the scaling differences between various products. The outcomes were used to assess two popular methods for rain gauge undercatch correction. It was found that SWE and precipitation measurements at SNOTELs, as well as precipitation estimates based on Stage IV data, are generally consistent and can provide a range within which other products can be assessed. The time-series of snowfall and SWE accumulation suggests that most of the products can capture snowfall events; however, differences exist in their accumulation. Reanalysis products tended to overestimate snow accumulation in the study area, while the current combined passive microwave remote sensing products (i.e., IMERG-HQ) underestimate snowfall accumulation. We found that correction factors applied to rain gauges are effective for improving their undercatch, especially for snowfall. However, no improvement in correlation is seen when correction factors are applied, and rainfall is still estimated better than snowfall. Even though IMERG-HQ has less skill for capturing snowfall than rainfall, analysis using Taylor plots showed that the combined microwave product does have skill for capturing the geographical distribution of snowfall and precipitation accumulation; therefore, bias adjustment might lead to reasonable precipitation estimates. This study demonstrates that other snow properties (e.g., SWE accumulation at the SNOTEL sites) can complement precipitation data to estimate snowfall. In the future, gridded SWE and snow depth data from GlobSnow and Sentinel-1 can be used to assess snowfall and its distribution over broader regions.

TI  - Automated Flood Depth Estimates from Online Traffic Sign Images: Explorations of a Convolutional Neural Network-Based Method
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood depth monitoring is crucial for flood warning systems and damage control, especially in the event of an urban flood. Existing gauge station data and remote sensing data still has limited spatial and temporal resolution and coverage. Therefore, to expand flood depth data source taking use of online image resources in an efficient manner, an automated, low-cost, and real-time working frame called FloodMask was developed to obtain flood depth from online images containing flooded traffic signs. The method was built on the deep learning framework of Mask R-CNN (regional convolutional neural network), trained by collected and manually annotated traffic sign images. Following further the proposed image processing frame, flood depth data were retrieved more efficiently than manual estimations. As the main results, the flood depth estimates from images (without any mirror reflection and other inference problems) have an average error of 0.11 m, when compared to human visual inspection measurements. This developed method can be further coupled with street CCTV cameras, social media photos, and on-board vehicle cameras to facilitate the development of a smart city with a prompt and efficient flood monitoring system. In future studies, distortion and mirror reflection should be tackled properly to increase the quality of the flood depth estimates.

TI  - A Systematic Review on the Integration of Remote Sensing and GIS to Forest and Grassland Ecosystem Health Attributes, Indicators, and Measures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - It is important to protect forest and grassland ecosystems because they are ecologically rich and provide numerous ecosystem services. Upscaling monitoring from local to global scale is imperative in reaching this goal. The SDG Agenda does not include indicators that directly quantify ecosystem health. Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can bridge the gap for large-scale ecosystem health assessment. We systematically reviewed field-based and remote-based measures of ecosystem health for forests and grasslands, identified the most important ones and provided an overview on remote sensing and GIS-based measures. We included 163 English language studies within terrestrial non-tropical biomes and used a pre-defined classification system to extract ecological stressors and attributes, collected corresponding indicators, measures, and proxy values. We found that the main ecological attributes of each ecosystem contribute differently in the literature, and that almost half of the examined studies used remote sensing to estimate indicators. The major stressor for forests was "climate change", followed by "insect infestation"; for grasslands it was "grazing", followed by "climate change". "Biotic interactions, composition, and structure" was the most important ecological attribute for both ecosystems. "Fire disturbance" was the second most important for forests, while for grasslands it was "soil chemistry and structure". Less than a fifth of studies used vegetation indices; NDVI was the most common. There are monitoring inconsistencies from the broad range of indicators and measures. Therefore, we recommend a standardized field, GIS, and remote sensing-based approach to monitor ecosystem health and integrity and facilitate land managers and policy-makers.

TI  - Atmospheric Impacts of COVID-19 on NO<sub>x</sub> and VOC Levels over China Based on TROPOMI and IASI Satellite Data and Modeling
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - China was the first country to undergo large-scale lockdowns in response to the pandemic in early 2020 and a progressive return to normalization after April 2020. Spaceborne observations of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), including formaldehyde (HCHO), glyoxal (CHOCHO), and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), reveal important changes over China in 2020, relative to 2019, in response to the pandemic-induced shutdown and the subsequent drop in pollutant emissions. In February, at the peak of the shutdown, the observed declines in OVOC levels were generally weaker (less than 20%) compared to the observed NO2 reductions (-40%). In May 2020, the observations reveal moderate decreases in NO2 (-15%) and PAN (-21%), small changes in CHOCHO (-3%) and HCHO (6%). Model simulations using the regional model MAGRITTEv1.1 with anthropogenic emissions accounting for the reductions due to the pandemic explain to a large extent the observed changes in lockdown-affected regions. The model results suggest that meteorological variability accounts for a minor but non-negligible part (similar to-5%) of the observed changes for NO2, whereas it is negligible for CHOCHO but plays a more substantial role for HCHO and PAN, especially in May. The interannual variability of biogenic and biomass burning emissions also contribute to the observed variations, explaining e.g., the important column increases of NO2 and OVOCs in February 2020, relative to 2019. These changes are well captured by the model simulations.

TI  - Comparisons of Satellite and Modeled Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll Concentrations in the Baltic Sea with In Situ Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the most frequently used satellite data are surface chlorophyll concentration (Chl) and temperature (SST). These data can be degraded in some coastal areas, for example, in the Baltic Sea. Other popular sources of data are reanalysis models. Before satellite or model data can be used effectively, they should be extensively compared with in situ measurements. Herein, we present results of such comparisons. We used SST and Chl from model reanalysis and satellites, and in situ data measured at eight open Baltic Sea stations. The data cover time interval from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2019, but some satellite data were not always available. Both the model and the satellite SST data had good agreement with in situ measurements. In contrast, satellite and model estimates of Chl concentrations presented large errors. Modeled Chl presented the lowest bias and the best correlation with in situ data from all Chl data sets evaluated. Chl estimates from a regionally tuned algorithm (SatBaltic) had smaller errors in comparison with other satellite data sets and good agreement with in situ data in summer. Statistics were not as good for the full data set. High uncertainties found in chlorophyll satellite algorithms for the Baltic Sea highlight the importance of continuous regional validation of such algorithms with in situ data.

TI  - A Fully Automatic, Interpretable and Adaptive Machine Learning Approach to Map Burned Area from Remote Sensing
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper proposes a fully automatic algorithm approach to map burned areas from remote sensing characterized by human interpretable mapping criteria and explainable results. This approach is partially knowledge-driven and partially data-driven. It exploits active fire points to train the fusion function of factors deemed influential in determining the evidence of burned conditions from reflectance values of multispectral Sentinel-2 (S2) data. The fusion function is used to compute a map of seeds (burned pixels) that are adaptively expanded by applying a Region Growing (RG) algorithm to generate the final burned area map. The fusion function is an Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator, learnt through the application of a machine learning (ML) algorithm from a set of highly reliable fire points. Its semantics are characterized by two measures, the degrees of pessimism/optimism and democracy/monarchy. The former allows the prediction of the results of the fusion as affected by more false positives (commission errors) than false negatives (omission errors) in the case of pessimism, or vice versa; the latter foresees if there are only a few highly influential factors or many low influential ones that determine the result. The prediction on the degree of pessimism/optimism allows the expansion of the seeds to be appropriately tuned by selecting the most suited growing layer for the RG algorithm thus adapting the algorithm to the context. The paper illustrates the application of the automatic method in four study areas in southern Europe to map burned areas for the 2017 fire season. Thematic accuracy at each site was assessed by comparison to reference perimeters to prove the adaptability of the approach to the context; estimated average accuracy metrics are omission error = 0.057, commission error = 0.068, Dice coefficient = 0.94 and relative bias = 0.0046.

TI  - RSPD: A Novel Remote Sensing Index of Plant Biodiversity Combining Spectral Variation Hypothesis and Productivity Hypothesis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant diversity (PD) plays an important role in maintaining the healthy function of an ecosystem through affecting the productivity, stability, and nutrient utilization of a terrestrial ecosystem. Remote sensing is a vital way to monitor the status and changes of PD. Most of the existing methods rely on a field botany survey to construct a statistical relationship between PD and remote sensing observations. However, a field botany survey is too costly to be applied widely. In this study, we constructed a new remote sensing index of PD (RSPD), combining the spectral variation hypothesis and productivity hypothesis. Concretely, the RSPD integrated the multi-band spectral reflectance and several spectral greenness, moisture, and red-edge vegetation indices with the principles of Shannon information entropy and Euclidean distance. The RSPD was evaluated by comparing the classical coefficient of variation (CV) method and the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices based on vegetation classification results. Two cases were selected, where Case I was in Beijing and Case II was located in part of Huai'an, China. Sentinel-2 data in three years of 2016, 2018, and 2020 and higher-resolution Pleiades-1 data in 2018 were also utilized. The results demonstrate that: (1) the RSPD is basically consistent with the CV in spatiotemporal variation; (2) the RSPD outperforms the CV as compared with Shannon and Simpson diversity indices that are based on vegetation classification results with Sentinel-2 and Pleiades-1 data; (3) the RSPD outperforms the CV as compared with visual interpretations with Google Earth image. The suggested index can reflect the richness and evenness of plant species, which is inherent in its calculation formula. Moreover, it has a great potential for large-scale regional and long-term series monitoring.

TI  - NATURAL HABITAT OF BALI STARLING (Leucopsar rothschildi) IN BALI BARAT NATIONAL PARK, INDONESIA.
T2  - Biotropia
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indonesian tropical savannas and dry forests provide habitats to various endemic wildlife. Unfortunately, a few of these endemic species are now seriously threatened and are red listed in the conservation status of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Among these species, the Bali starling or Bali mynah Leucopsar rotschildi, locally known as Jalak Bali, is now mostly restricted to the Bali Barat National Park. Given the high extinction risk faced by such species, conservation programs require multidisciplinary approaches that would address both the biological attributes of the species itself and their habitat requirements. Regrettably, for many species, their habitat ecology remains inadequately understood. Hence, this study aimed to: 1. characterize the Bali starling habitat in terms of structure and floristic composition; and 2. document evidences of vegetation cover changes in the Bali Barat National Park. Analysis of remote sensing imagery and field sampling for vegetation attributes were conducted to address these objectives. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated from Landsat imageries using red and near infrared bands. Tree cover percentage data were downloaded from Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) of the University of Maryland's website. Results showed that forest and savanna are the dominant land cover types in the Bali Barat National Park. However, their distribution is somewhat dynamic with changes in vegetation cover and greenness found across the years which increase the cover of woody plants is the general trend. The Bali starling in the Bali Barat National Park is mostly found at or near distinct vegetation boundaries, such as the borders between savanna and forest, savanna and cropland, savanna and shrubland, settlement and cropland and, between forest and shrubland. Although Cekik in Jembrana, Bali and Brumbun Bay in West Bali, as the conservation sites for Bali starling, are both planted with tree species providing shelter and food for Bali starling, the bird has not been seen in the two areas since the 1990s. These results further confirm the importance of examining the habitat patterns of endemic birds within a landscape that are influenced by multiple factors interacting in space and time. Addressing data inadequacy in habitat patterns of endemic species distribution is crucial in developing conservation management strategies. Hence, evaluating the habitat remnants of the Bali starling is vital for its conservation and needed reintroduction and eventual release to its natural habitat.

TI  - Applications of the Advanced Radiative Transfer Modeling System (ARMS) to Characterize the Performance of Fengyun-4A/AGRI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study applies the Advanced Radiative Transfer Modeling System (ARMS), which was developed to accelerate the uses of Fengyun satellite data in weather, climate, and environmental applications in China, to characterize the biases of seven infrared (IR) bands of the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the Chinese geostationary meteorological satellite, Fengyun-4A. The AGRI data are quality controlled to eliminate the observations affected by clouds and contaminated by stray lights during the mid-night from 1600 to 1800 UTC during spring and autumn. The mean biases, computed from AGRI IR observations and ARMS simulations from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Final analysis data (FNL) as input, are within -0.7-1.1 K (0.12-0.75 K) for all seven IR bands over the oceans (land) under clear-sky conditions. The biases show seasonal variation in spatial distributions at bands 11-13, as well as a strong dependence on scene temperatures at bands 8-14 and on satellite zenith angles at absorption bands 9, 10, and 14. The discrepancies between biases estimated using FNL and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis-5 (ERA5) are also discussed. The biases from water vapor absorption bands 9 and 10, estimated using ERA5 over ocean, are smaller than those from FNL. Such discrepancies arise from the fact that the FNL data are colder (wetter) than the ERA5 in the middle troposphere (upper-troposphere).

TI  - Regional-Scale Systematic Mapping of Archaeological Mounds and Detection of Looting Using COSMO-SkyMed High Resolution DEM and Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - "Tells" are archaeological mounds formed by deposition of large amounts of anthropogenic material and sediments over thousands of years and are the most important and prominent features in Near and Middle Eastern archaeological landscapes. In the last decade, archaeologists have exploited free-access global digital elevation model (DEM) datasets at medium resolution (i.e., up to 30 m) to map tells on a supra-regional scale and pinpoint tentative tell sites. Instead, the potential of satellite DEMs at higher resolution for this task was yet to be demonstrated. To this purpose, the 3 m resolution imaging capability allowed by the Italian Space Agency's COSMO-SkyMed Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) constellation in StripMap HIMAGE mode was used in this study to generate DEM products of enhanced resolution to undertake, for the first time, a systematic mapping of tells and archaeological deposits. The demonstration is run at regional scale in the Governorate of Wasit in central Iraq, where the literature suggested a high density of sites, despite knowledge gaps about their location and spatial distribution. Accuracy assessment of the COSMO-SkyMed DEM is provided with respect to the most commonly used SRTM and ALOS World 3D DEMs. Owing to the 10 m posting and the consequent enhanced observation capability, the COSMO-SkyMed DEM proves capable to detect both well preserved and levelled or disturbed tells, standing out for more than 4 m from the surrounding landscape. Through the integration with CORONA KH-4B tiles, 1950s Soviet maps and recent Sentinel-2 multispectral images, the expert-led visual identification and manual mapping in the GIS environment led to localization of tens of sites that were not previously mapped, alongside the computation of a figure as up-to-date as February 2019 of the survived tells, with those affected by looting. Finally, this evidence is used to recognize hot-spot areas of potential concern for the conservation of tells. To this purpose, we upgraded the spatial resolution of the observations up to 1 m by using the Enhanced Spotlight mode to collect a bespoke time series. The change detection tests undertaken on selected clusters of disturbed tells prove how a dedicated monitoring activity may allow a regular observation of the impacts due to anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., road and canal constructions or ploughing).

TI  - Sentinel-2 Imagery Monitoring Vine Growth Related to Topography in a Protected Designation of Origin Region
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing satellite platforms provide accurate temporal and spatial information useful in viticulture with an increasing interest in their use. This study aims to identify the possibilities of freely available and with frequent revisit time Sentinel-2 satellites, to monitor vine growth at regional scale on a vine-growing Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) zone during the growing season of the year 2019. This study aims to: (i) investigate through several Vegetation Indices (VIs) the vine growth differences across the zone and relations with topographic parameters; (ii) identify VIs that best recognize differences on subzones of different climatic conditions; (iii) explore the effectiveness of the Sentinel-2 data monitoring management applications. A total of 27 vineyards were selected for field and satellite data collection. Several VIs have been calculated per vineyard from a 20-date time series dataset. VIs showed high negative correlation with topographic parameter of elevation on the flowering stage. The analysis of variance between the VIs of the subzones showed that these regions have statistically significant differences, that most VIs can expose on the flowering and harvest stage, and only Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and VIs using Red-Edge bands during the veraison period. Sentinel-2 data show great effectiveness on monitoring management applications (tillage and trimming).

TI  - Predicting ecosystem shift in a Salt Lake by using remote sensing indicators and spatial statistics methods (case study: Lake Urmia basin)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The consequences of unsustainable human activities on the environment are often delayed, when it is too late to compensate. New approaches are based on the use of "spatial statistics" of leading indicators to measure the "critical slowing down" in a degraded ecosystem, when it is reaching to a tipping point. This research predicts the tipping points in the ecosystem of Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) based on spatial statistics. By Remote Sensing (RS) indicators, their effectiveness in assessing the state of the ecosystem was evaluated in a 16-years period (2002-2017). Seven spectral indicators (NDVI, NDWIv,NDWIw,NDSI,SRDI, NMDI and MVWR) were extracted from ten MODIS images. Ability of the indicators to identify critical point in time-series was investigated by five spatial statistic methods (Moran's-I, Getis-Ord-Gi, Gearys-C, variance, and skewness). The results showed that Moran's-I is more successful in predicting the ecosystem tipping point(s) in comparison with other methods. In addition, the ability to predict ecosystem trends by the autocorrelation of MVWR is higher than other indicators. According to results, the tipping points of LUB occurred in the years of 2008 to 2010 and 2015. For further studies, it is recommended to use radar indicators for identifying tipping points of the similar vulnerable ecosystems.

TI  - A Novel Mosaic Method for Spaceborne ScanSAR Images Based on Homography Matrix Compensation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and efficient image mosaicking is essential for generating wide-range swath images of spaceborne scanning synthetic aperture radar (ScanSAR). However, the existing methods cannot guarantee the accuracy and efficiency of stitching simultaneously, especially when mosaicking multiple large-area images. In this paper, we propose a novel image mosaic method based on homography matrix compensation to solve the mentioned problem. A set of spaceborne ScanSAR images from the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite were selected to test the performance of the new method. First, images are preprocessed by an improved Wallis filter to eliminate intensity inconsistencies. Then, to reduce the enormous computational redundancy of registration, the overlapping areas of adjacent images are coarsely extracted using geolocation technologies. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of stitching and maintain the original information and resolution of images, we deduce a compensation of homography matrix to implement downsampled images registration and original-size images projection. After stitching, the transitions at the edges of the images were smooth and seamless, the information and resolution of the original images were preserved successfully, and the efficiency of the mosaic was improved by approximately one thousand-fold. The validity, high efficiency and reliability of the method are verified.

TI  - The Role of Remote Sensing for the Assessment and Monitoring of Forest Health: A Systematic Evidence Synthesis
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Forests are increasingly subject to a number of disturbances that can adversely influence their health. Remote sensing offers an efficient alternative for assessing and monitoring forest health. A myriad of methods based upon remotely sensed data have been developed, tailored to the different definitions of forest health considered, and covering a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. The purpose of this review paper is to identify and analyse studies that addressed forest health issues applying remote sensing techniques, in addition to studying the methodological wealth present in these papers. For this matter, we applied the PRISMA protocol to seek and select studies of our interest and subsequently analyse the information contained within them. A final set of 107 journal papers published between 2015 and 2020 was selected for evaluation according to our filter criteria and 20 selected variables. Subsequently, we pair-wise exhaustively read the journal articles and extracted and analysed the information on the variables. We found that (1) the number of papers addressing this issue have consistently increased, (2) that most of the studies placed their study area in North America and Europe and (3) that satellite-borne multispectral sensors are the most commonly used technology, especially from Landsat mission. Finally, most of the studies focused on evaluating the impact of a specific stress or disturbance factor, whereas only a small number of studies approached forest health from an early warning perspective.

TI  - Assimilation of Leaf Area Index and Soil Water Index from Satellite Observations in a Land Surface Model in Hungary
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS) is applied over the Carpathian Basin at the Hungarian Meteorological Service to monitor the above-ground biomass, surface fluxes (carbon and water), and the associated root-zone soil moisture at the regional scale (spatial resolution of 8 km x 8 km) in quasi-real-time. In this system the SURFEX model is used, which applies the vegetation growth version of the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere (ISBA-A-gs) photosynthesis scheme to describe the evolution of vegetation. SURFEX is forced using the outputs of the ALADIN numerical weather prediction model run operationally at the Hungarian Meteorological Service. First, SURFEX is run in an open-loop (i.e., no assimilation) mode for the period 2008-2015. Secondly, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) method is used to assimilate Leaf Area Index (LAI) Spot/Vegetation (until May 2014) and PROBA-V (from June 2014) and Soil Water Index (SWI) ASCAT/Metop satellite measurements. The benefit of LDAS is proved over the whole country and to a selected site in West Hungary (Hegyhatsal). It is demonstrated that the EKF can provide useful information both in wet and dry seasons as well. It is shown that the data assimilation is efficient to describe the inter-annual variability of biomass and soil moisture values. The vegetation development and the water and carbon fluxes vary from season to season and LDAS is a capable tool to monitor the variability of these parameters.

TI  - Near-Coast Tide Model Validation Using GNSS Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), a Case Study in the Pertuis Charentais (France)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, uncertainties related to the determination of ocean tides remain a major issue for the exploitation of altimetry data in coastal areas. Using Sea Surface Height (SSH) observations from a new GNSS-based system mounted on an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), we develop a crossover methodology to assess tide models under altimetry tracks. To this purpose, we address the Pertuis Charentais area, a semi enclosed sea located in the centre of the Bay of Biscay (France), as a field and modelling case study. We have developed a barotropic model configuration, based on SCHISM platform, using tidal elevations of an up-to-date regional atlas as boundary conditions. To test the impact of boundary conditions, we propose a second configuration where we applied uniform empirical biases in phases and amplitudes on M3 and MN4 constituents. In addition, the survey was designed to highlight the contribution of third and fourth-diurnal waves that are strongly amplified on the shelf and is used to assess model performances under the pass 216 of Sentinel-3A. Our results show that the second configuration reduces the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) of the survey crossover residuals by more than 60%, leading to half of the residuals below 2.5 cm. This improved solution also reduces by 20% the RMSE computed with data from tide gauges located in the inner part of the Pertuis Charentais. Therefore, our study reinforces the importance for coastal tide modelling of an accurate tidal forcing, especially for shallow water waves. We finally discuss the impact of the remaining M4 error on crossover residual heights. By introducing an empirical correction term based on M4 observations at tide gauges, we further reduce the RMSE of crossover residuals by 15-25%. With this innovative study, we demonstrate the interest of combining crossover validation methods and USV systems to spatially extend our understanding of coastal areas dynamics. This will be crucial in the scope of the future SWOT mission, for which the tide correction accuracy must be assessed over the large-extent areas covered by swaths observations.

TI  - VEGETATION CHARACTERISTICS OF PAMPA AND CERRADO BIOMES MONITORED BY NDVI
T2  - REVISTA GEOARAGUAIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of spatial and time variations of vegetation has been realized from Remote sensing data, especially vegetation indices (IV). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an of the IV most applied in these studies and uses reflectance data in the spectral bands of red and infrared, in order to identify the biophysical and structural characteristics of the vegetation. In this sense, the objective was to monitor and compare the phenological characteristics of the grassland in the Pampa and Cerrado biomes from ndvi time profiles for the period from 2001 to 2019. Modis sensor data - MOD13Q1 product, available free of charge by the SATVeg Web tool, were used. From the NDVI time profiles analyzed, it was identified that the grassland in the Pampa and Cerrado biomes have similar characteristics, with higher biomass production between spring and summer and lower between autumn and winter, with values ranging from 0.20 to 0.88 in the Cerrado and 0.34 and 0.88 in the Pampa. The data allowed us to conclude that the growth phases of the vegetation vary according to the climatic factors of each biome: precipitation in the Cerrado and temperature in the Pampa.

TI  - Antimicrobial Resistance in Loggerhead Sea Turtles (<i>Caretta caretta</i>): A Comparison between Clinical and Commensal Bacterial Isolates
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Gram negative organisms are frequently isolated from Caretta caretta and may contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. In this study, commensal bacteria isolated from oral and cloacal samples of 98 healthy C. caretta were compared to clinical isolates isolated from the wounds of 102 injured animals, in order to investigate the presence of antimicrobial resistance bacteria in free-living loggerheads from the Adriatic Sea. A total of 410 bacteria were cultured and differences were noted in the isolated genera, as some of them were isolated only in healthy animals, while others were isolated only from injured animals. When tested for susceptibility to antimicrobials, clinical isolates showed highly significant differences in the antimicrobial resistance rates vs. commensal isolates for all the drugs tested, except for doxycycline. The detection of high antimicrobial resistance rates in loggerhead sea turtles is of clinical and microbiological significance since it impacts both the choice of a proper antibiotic therapy and the implementation of conservation programs. Gram negative organisms are frequently isolated from Caretta caretta turtles, which can act as reservoir species for resistant microorganisms in the aquatic environment. C. caretta, which have no history of treatment with antimicrobials, are useful sentinel species for resistant microbes. In this culture-based study, commensal bacteria isolated from oral and cloacal samples of 98 healthy C. caretta were compared to clinical isolates from the wounds of 102 injured animals, in order to investigate the presence of AMR bacteria in free-living loggerheads from the Adriatic Sea. A total of 410 isolates were cultured. Escherichia coli and genera such as Serratia, Moraxella, Kluyvera, Salmonella were isolated only in healthy animals, while Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, Klebsiella and Morganella were isolated only from the wounds of the injured animals. When tested for susceptibility to ampicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefuroxime, gentamicin, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin, the clinical isolates showed highly significant differences in AMR rates vs. commensal isolates for all the drugs tested, except for doxycycline. The detection of high AMR rates in loggerheads is of clinical and microbiological significance since it impacts both the choice of a proper antibiotic therapy and the implementation of conservation programs.

TI  - A Global Empirical Model of the Ion Temperature in the Ionosphere for the International Reference Ionosphere
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a suggestion for improvement of the ion temperature (Ti) model in the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). We have re-examined ion temperature data (primarily available from NASA's Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF)from older satellites and combined them with newly available data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), the Communication Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS), and from the recently launched Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON). We have compiled these data into a unified database comprising in total Ti data from 18 satellites. By comparisons with long term records of ion temperature from the three incoherent scatter radars (ISRs) (Jicamarca, Arecibo, and Millstone Hill), it was found that an intercalibration is needed to achieve consistency with the ISR data and among individual satellite data sets. This database with thus corrected data has been used for the development of a new global empirical model of Ti with inclusion of solar activity variation. This solar activity dependence is represented by an additive correction term to the Ti global pattern. Due to the limited data coverage at altitudes above 1000 km, the altitude range described by the model ranges from 350 km to 850 km covering only the region where generally Ti is higher than the neutral temperature (Tn) and lower than the electron temperature (Te). This approach is consistent with the current description of Ti in the IRI model. However, instead of one anchor point at 430 km altitude as in the current IRI, our approach includes anchor points at 350, 430, 600, and 850 km. At altitudes above 850 km Ti is merged using a gradient derived from the model at 600 and 850 km, with the electron temperature described by the IRI-2016/TBT-2012 option. Comparisons with the ISR data (Jicamarca, Arecibo, Millstone Hill, and Kharkiv) for high and low solar activity and equinox show that the proposed Ti model captures local time variation of Ti at different altitudes and latitudes better than the current IRI-2016 Ti model.

TI  - Assessing Forest Type and Tree Species Classification Using Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR Data in Southern Sweden
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The multitemporal acquisition of images from the Sentinel-1 satellites allows continuous monitoring of a forest. This study focuses on the use of multitemporal C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to assess the results for forest type (FTY), between coniferous and deciduous forest, and tree species (SPP) classification. We also investigated the temporal stability through the use of backscatter from multiple seasons and years of acquisition. SAR acquisitions were pre-processed, histogram-matched, smoothed, and temperature-corrected. The normalized average backscatter was extracted for interpreted plots and used to train Random Forest models. The classification results were then validated with field plots. A principal component analysis was tested to reduce the dimensionality of the explanatory variables, which generally improved the results. Overall, the FTY classifications were promising, with higher accuracies (OA of 0.94 and K = 0.86) than the SPP classification (OA of 0.66 and K = 0.54). The use of merely winter images (OA = 0.89) reached, on average, results that were almost as good as those using of images from the entire year. The use of images from a single winter season reached a similar result (OA = 0.87). We conclude that multiple Sentinel-1 images acquired in winter conditions are feasible to classify forest types in a hemi-boreal Swedish forest.

TI  - Bayesian Change Point Detection of Vegetation Cover Dynamics of Akure Forest Reserve, Ondo State in Southwestern, Nigeria
T2  - Journal of Applied Sciences & Environmental Management
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses satellite acquired vegetation index data to monitor changes in Akure forest reserve. Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series datasets were extracted from Landsat images; extraction was performed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The datasets were analyzed using Bayesian Change Point (BCP) to monitor the abrupt changes in vegetation dynamics associated with deforestation. The BCP shows the magnitude of changes over the years, from the posterior data obtained. BCP focuses on changes in the long-range using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, this returns posterior probability at > 0.5% of a change point occurring at each time index in the time series. Three decades of Landsat data were classified using the random forest algorithm to assess the rate of deforestation within the study area. The results shows forest decrease in 2000 (97.7%), 2010 (89.4%), 2020 (84.7%) and non-forest increase 2000 (2.0%), 2010 (10.6%), 2020 (15.3%). Kappa coefficient was also used to determine the accuracy of the classification.

TI  - Retrieval of Land-Use/Land Cover Change (LUCC) Maps and Urban Expansion Dynamics of Hyderabad, Pakistan via Landsat Datasets and Support Vector Machine Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use/land cover change (LUCC) is an important problem in developing and under-developing countries with regard to global climatic changes and urban morphological distribution. Since the 1900s, urbanization has become an underlying cause of LUCC, and more than 55% of the world's population resides in cities. The speedy growth, development and expansion of urban centers, rapid inhabitant's growth, land insufficiency, the necessity for more manufacture, advancement of technologies remain among the several drivers of LUCC around the globe at present. In this study, the urban expansion or sprawl, together with spatial dynamics of Hyderabad, Pakistan over the last four decades were investigated and reviewed, based on remotely sensed Landsat images from 1979 to 2020. In particular, radiometric and atmospheric corrections were applied to these raw images, then the Gaussian-based Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel was used for training, within the 10-fold support vector machine (SVM) supervised classification framework. After spatial LUCC maps were retrieved, different metrics like Producer's Accuracy (PA), User's Accuracy (UA) and KAPPA coefficient (KC) were adopted for spatial accuracy assessment to ensure the reliability of the proposed satellite-based retrieval mechanism. Landsat-derived results showed that there was an increase in the amount of built-up area and a decrease in vegetation and agricultural lands. Built-up area in 1979 only covered 30.69% of the total area, while it has increased and reached 65.04% after four decades. In contrast, continuous reduction of agricultural land, vegetation, waterbody, and barren land was observed. Overall, throughout the four-decade period, the portions of agricultural land, vegetation, waterbody, and barren land have decreased by 13.74%, 46.41%, 49.64% and 85.27%, respectively. These remotely observed changes highlight and symbolize the spatial characteristics of "rural to urban transition" and socioeconomic development within a modernized city, Hyderabad, which open new windows for detecting potential land-use changes and laying down feasible future urban development and planning strategies.

TI  - Do tigers hunt during the day? Diel activity of the asian tiger mosquito, <i>Aedes albopictus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae), in urban and suburban habitats of North America
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summary The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an invasive mosquito which is now established in at least 40 states in the USA. Lack of efficient surveillance and control methods against Ae. albopictus, in addition to human-aided accidental transportations, have played a great role in its rapid expansion. Although surveillance measures are becoming more systematic and effective, control of this species still poses a great challenge. Aedes albopictus is difficult to control in the larval stage because it primarily develops in artificial containers that are widespread in peridomestic habitats. These habitats are not only ubiquitous in these environments, they are also cryptic, inaccessible, and extremely difficult to control. Therefore, control of Ae. albopictus in these environments often relies on adult control measures which utilize insecticides dispersed through ultra-low volume equipment as a cold aerosol space spray. These adulticide applications are often conducted at night against endemic mosquito species which are primarily active between dawn and dusk. However, since Ae. albopictus has been traditionally classified as a day-biting mosquito, mosquito control specialists have had doubts about the efficacy of a nocturnal application against a diurnally active mosquito. These uncertainties about intervention efforts become even more important during public health outbreaks of mosquito-borne pathogens such as chikungunya, dengue, or Zika viruses when protection of public health is of paramount importance in peridomestic habitats. Our investigations provide evidence that Ae. albopictus exhibits activity throughout the day and night and that nighttime adulticide applications may indeed be effective against this species, and should not be disregarded.Background Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) impacts human outdoor activity because of its aggressive biting behavior, and as a major vector of mosquito-borne diseases, it is also of public health importance. Although most mosquito species exhibit crepuscular activity by primarily host seeking at dawn and dusk, Ae. albopictus has been traditionally characterized as a diurnal or day-biting mosquito. With the global expansion and increased involvement of Ae. albopictus in mosquito-borne diseases, it is imperative to elucidate the diel activity of this species, particularly in newly invaded areas. Methodology and principal findings Human sweep netting and carbon dioxide-baited rotator traps were used to evaluate the diel activity of Ae. albopictus in two study sites. Both trapping methods were used in New Jersey's Mercer County, USA (temperate/urban), while only human sweep netting was used in Florida's Volusia County, USA (subtropical/suburban). Human sweep netting was performed to determine adult mosquito activity at Sunrise, Solar Noon, Sunset, and Lunar Midnight. Because New Jersey is in a temperate area, diel activity was investigated during the early season (3-19 July), peak season (25 July-19 September), and late season (22 September- 22 October). Aedes albopictus showed the highest activity during peak and late seasons at Solar Noon (P < 0.05). At Sunrise and Sunset during the peak season, Ae. albopictus activity was similar. Lunar Midnight activity was significantly lower than Sunrise and Solar Noon (P < 0.05) but was similar to that of Sunset. In the late season, the highest activity was observed during Solar Noon while the least activity was observed during Sunrise and Lunar Midnight (P<0.05). Bottle rotator traps used in conjunction with the human sweep net technique exhibited similar results. Seasonal activity was not differentiated in Florida due to the consistent subtropical climate. The highest adult activity was observed at Sunrise using human sweep netting, but it was not significantly different from Solar Noon and Sunset. The lowest adult activity was observed at Lunar Midnight; however, it was not significantly different from Solar Noon and Sunset. These results provide evidence that the diel activity of Ae. albopictus, contrary to the common perception of its diurnal activity, is much more varied. Conclusion/Significance Involvement of Ae. albopictus in the transmission of debilitating mosquito-borne pathogens such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika virus, coupled with its affinity to thrive in human peridomestic environments, substantiates that our findings have global implications in areas where Ae. albopictus populations established. It also highlights the importance of behavioral studies of vector species which will not only help mosquito control professionals plan the timing of their control efforts but also provides empirical evidence against conventional wisdoms that may unjustly persist within public health stewards.

TI  - Association of Cardiovascular Disease and Long-Term Exposure to Fine Particulate Matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in the Southeastern United States
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a well-documented association between ambient fine particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. Exposure to PM2.5 can cause premature death and harmful and chronic health effects such as heart attack, diabetes, and stroke. The Environmental Protection Agency sets annual PM2.5 standards to reduce these negative health effects. Currently above an annual average level of 12.0 mu g/m is considered unhealthy. Methods. We examined the association of long-term exposure to PM2.5 and CVD in a cohort of 44,610 individuals who resided in 12 states recruited into the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). The SCCS was designed to recruit Black and White participants who received care from Federally Qualified Health Centers; hence, they represent vulnerable individuals from low-income families across this vast region. This study tests whether SCCS participants who lived in locations exposed to elevated ambient levels of PM2.5 concentrations were more likely to report a history of CVD at enrollment (2002-2009). Remotely sensed satellite data integrated with ground monitoring data provide an assessment of the average annual PM2.5 in urban and rural locations where the SCCS participants resided. We used multilevel logistic regression to estimate the associations between self-reported CVD and exposure to elevated ambient levels of PM2.5. Results. We found a 13.4 percent increase in the odds of reported CVD with exposure to unhealthy levels of PM2.5 exposure at enrollment. The SCCS participants with medical histories of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking had, overall, 385 percent higher odds of reported CVD than those without these clinical risk factors. Additionally, Black participants were more likely to live in locations with higher ambient PM2.5 concentrations and report high levels of clinical risk factors, thus, they may be at a greater future risk of CVD. Conclusions: In the SCCS participants, we found a strong relation between exposures to high ambient levels of PM2.5 and self-reported CVD at enrollment.

TI  - Optical Classification of Lower Amazon Waters Based on In Situ Data and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical water types (OWTs) were identified from an in situ dataset of concomitant biogeochemical and optical parameters acquired in the Amazon River and its tributaries, in the Lower Amazon region, at different hydrological conditions from 2014 to 2017. A seasonal bio-optical characterization was performed. The k-means classification was applied to the in situ normalized reflectance spectra (rn(lambda)), allowing the identification of four OWTs. An optical index method was also applied to the rn(lambda) defining the thresholds of the OWTs. Next, level-3 Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument images representative of the seasonal discharge conditions were classified using the identified in situ OWTs as reference. The differences between Amazon River and clearwater tributary OWTs were dependent on the hydrological dynamics of the Amazon River, also showing a strong seasonal variability. Each OWT was associated with a specific bio-optical and biogeochemical environment assessed from the corresponding absorption coefficient values of colored dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)) and particulate matter (a(p)), chlorophyll-a and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations, and a(CDOM)/a(p) ratio. The rising water season presented a unique OWT with high SPM concentration and high relative contribution of a(p) to total absorption compared to the other OWTs. This bio-optical characterization of Lower Amazon River waters represents a first step for developing remote sensing inversion models adjusted to the optical complexity of this region.

TI  - Spatio-Environmental Analysis of <i>Vespula germanica</i> Nest Records Explains Slow Invasion in South Africa
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Social wasp invasions can spread quickly and have serious impacts if they reach new regions with favourable climatic conditions. However, in areas less suitable to them, invasion patterns can show factors that may prevent their spread. We use nest records of the German wasp from the southern tip of South Africa, to map and analyse what habitats they seem to prefer. Factors investigated included temperature, rainfall, and moisture availability. We find that this invasive wasp prefers moister and cooler conditions, and because these habitats are patchy in the region they have invaded in South Africa, they can only spread slowly unassisted, and utmost between 50 and 200 km with the assistance of humans. This is the likely reason for the very slow invasion seen in South Africa. The spatial patterns we quantify here make it possible to use a remote-sensing approach to determine the suitability of an area for future invasions. Predicting the likelihood of invasions will greatly aid management actions. Public awareness around the potential accidental transport of the German wasp and similar species should also be undertaken. Investigating the distributions of invasive species in marginal habitats can give clues to the factors constraining invasive spread. Vespula germanica is the most widely distributed of all the invasive Vespids, which in the Southern Hemisphere typically have large extensive invasive populations. In contrast, the invasion into South Africa has been slow and is still confined to a small geographic area. Here we analyse the distribution of all recent nest records in South Africa (n = 405). The distance to main rivers, mean annual rainfall, summer normalised difference moisture index (NDMI) values, and mean annual temperatures (average, minimum, maximum, and summer maximum temperature) was measured for every nest. We find that value ranges of these variables are different between the value ranges recorded for nests, the general distribution area of the wasp, and the area of absence. Optimised Hot Spot Analysis was used to quantify spatial structure in the measured climatic variables. Generally, factors related to moisture stress set the environmental limits of V. germanica's landscape distribution. Due to the strong preference of nesting sites close to river courses, for higher rainfall conditions, medium to medium-high NDMI values, and lower mean annual temperatures, it is unlikely that V. germanica will be able to spread uniformly where it is currently found in South Africa.

TI  - Improved Rainfall Data in the Philippines through Concurrent Use of GPM IMERG and Ground-Based Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of accurate and reliable rainfall data that are applicable to various phenomenological, climatological, and modeling studies is important, especially in the Philippines, which is considered to be highly vulnerable to natural hazards and a changing climate. The presented strategy involved constructing a dataset consisting of synoptic data, automatic rain gauge (ARG) measurements, and satellite data that are co-registered, consistent, and formatted in the same manner. Although sparse in number, the synoptic stations provide the most accurate rainfall information and were used as the baseline for creating the dataset. The ARGs that are within a distance of 1 km to the synoptic stations were used to determine the correction factors needed to make the synoptic and ARG data consistent. Subsequently, the corrected ARGs were used to make the satellite IMERG data consistent with both ARG and synoptic data. In case of the latter, only IMERG pixels with at least 10 ARGs within the relatively large footprint of the satellite sensor were used in estimating the required correction parameters derived from a combination of a power transform and linear regression correction techniques. The final results show good agreement of synoptic and corrected ARG data with correlation coefficients of 0.94 and 0.97 for the 10 day and monthly data, respectively, and improvement in the linear regression slope from 0.67 to 0.90 for 10 day data, and 0.70 to 0.94 for monthly data. In addition, the corrected ARG data agree well with the corrected IMERG data, with correlation coefficients of 0.88 and 0.93 for the 10 day and monthly data, respectively, and an improvement in slope from 0.66 to 0.87 for 10 day data, and 0.74 to 0.99 for monthly data. The merit of using a combined dataset is illustrated through comparative analyses of the IMERG data and spatially interpolated synoptic and ARG data. The results show general agreements in spatial patterns of rainfall across the datasets, especially in areas where in situ measurements are recorded. The observed discrepancy when ground data is limited emphasizes the need for satellite IMERG data to obtain the true spatial patterns of rainfall distribution.

TI  - An integrated surveillance network for antimicrobial resistance, India
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo assess the preparedness of veterinary laboratories in India to participate in an integrated antimicrobial resistance surveillance network and to address gaps in provision identified. MethodsThe Indian Council of Medical Research and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research collaborated: (i) to select eight nationally representative veterinary microbiology laboratories whose capacity for participating in an integrated antimicrobial resistance surveillance network would be assessed using a standardized tool; (ii) to identify gaps in provision from the assessment findings; and (iii) to develop a plan, and take the necessary steps to address these gaps in consultation with participating organizations. FindingsThe main gaps in provision identified were: (i) a lack of dedicated funding for antimicrobial resistance surveillance; (ii) the absence of standard guidelines for antimicrobial susceptibility testing; (iii) a shortage of reference strains for testing and quality assurance; and (iv) the absence of mechanisms for sharing data. We addressed these gaps by creating a veterinary standard operating procedure for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, by carrying out a validation exercise to identify problems with implementing the procedure and by conducting capacity-building workshops for veterinary laboratories. Conclusion Antimicrobial resistance surveillance networks depend on the availability of accurate, quality-controlled testing. The challenges identified in creating an integrated surveillance network for India can be overcome by developing a comprehensive plan for improving laboratory capacity in human, veterinary and environmental sectors that is supported by the necessary funds. The study's findings may provide guidance for other low-and middle-income countries planning to develop a similar network.

TI  - DenseResUNet: An Architecture to Assess Water-Stressed Sugarcane Crops from Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A single most immense abiotic stress globally affecting the productivity of all the crops is water stress. Hence, timely and accurate detection of the water-stressed crops is a necessary task for high productivity. Agricultural crop production can be managed and enhanced by spatial and temporal evaluation of water-stressed crops through remotely sensed data. However, detecting water-stressed crops from remote sensing images is a challenging task as various factors impacting spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs) at the canopy and landscape scales, as well as the fact that the water stress detection threshold is crop-specific, there has yet to be substantial agreement on their usage as a pre-visual signal of water stress. This research takes the benefits of freely available remote sensing data and convolutional neural networks to perform semantic segmentation of water-stressed sugarcane crops. Here an architecture `DenseResUNet' is proposed for water-stressed sugarcane crops using segmentation based on encoder-decoder approach. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the replacement of classical convolution operation in the UNet with the dense block. The layers of a dense block are residual modules with a dense connection. The proposed model achieved 61.91% mIoU, and 80.53% accuracy on segmenting the water-stressed sugarcane fields. This study compares the proposed architecture with the UNet, ResUNet, and DenseUNet models achieving mIoU of 32.20%, 58.34%, and 53.15%, respectively. The results of this study reveal that the model has the potential to identify water-stressed crops from remotely sensed data through deep learning techniques.

TI  - Remote Detection of Cyanobacterial Blooms and Chlorophyll-a Analysis in a Eutrophic Reservoir Using Sentinel-2
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful cyanobacterial blooms have been one of the most challenging ecological problems faced by freshwater bodies for more than a century. The use of satellite images as a tool to analyze these blooms is an innovative technology that will facilitate water governance and help develop measures to guarantee water security. To assess the viability of Sentinel-2 for identifying cyanobacterial blooms and chlorophyl-a, different bands of the Sentinel-2 satellite were considered, and those most consistent with cyanobacteria analysis were analyzed. This analysis was supplemented by an assessment of different indices and their respective correlations with the field data. The indices assessed were the following: Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Differences Vegetation Index (NDVI), green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (gNDVI), Normalized Soil Moisture Index (NSMI), and Toming's Index. The green band (B3) obtained the best correlating results for both chlorophyll (R-2 = 0.678) and cyanobacteria (R-2 = 0.931). The study by bands of cyanobacteria composition can be a powerful tool for assessing the physiology of strains. NDWI gave an R-2 value of 0.849 for the downstream point with the concentration of cyanobacteria. Toming's Index obtained a high R-2 of 0.859 with chlorophyll-a and 0.721 for the concentration of cyanobacteria. Notable differences in correlation for the upstream and downstream points were obtained with the indices. These results show that Sentinel-2 will be a valuable tool for lake monitoring and research, especially considering that the data will be routinely available for many years and the images will be frequent and free.

TI  - The Use of Minimal Invasive Surgery versus Open Approach in Hospitalized Cases.
T2  - Chirurgia (Bucharest, Romania : 1990)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Backgtound: The progress in development and application of Minimal Invasive Surgery (MIS) requires clinical and managerial decisions that must be evidence based; the current available scientific evidence for the Romanian medical practice is missing. Our study aims to analyze the use of MIS and open surgery in Romania and the impact of the type of surgery on the hospitalization. Methodology: A cross-sectional study analyzed the activity of the Romanian hospitals reporting primary Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) data at the patient level in the period 2008-2018; all episodes of abdominal and thoracic surgical interventions which may be performed either by MIS or an open approach were extracted from the DRG National database (www.drg.ro). A comparative analysis in terms of the volume of activity and their impact on the hospital average length of stay (ALOS) has been performed. Results: The pattern of use for MIS and open surgery interventions was changed in 2008-2018; MIS procedures doubled while open surgery interventions did not follow the same growth rate; ALOS for the MIS procedures decreased annually at a faster rate as compared to the ALOS for the open surgery and the gap between the two gradually increased in favour of the MIS interventions. The most pronounced shortening of ALOS after MIS procedures has been found for Gallbladder Surgery (by 7.95 days), Gastric Surgery (by 5.64 days) and Incisional Hernia surgery (by 4.33 days). Meanwhile, the reimbursement level for the MIS versus open surgery interventions did not changed over the analyzed period. Conclusions: MIS is significantly reducing the ALOS in Romania with a potential positive influence on the national healthcare budget. However, the pattern of use for MIS interventions is not financial incentives based and calls for in-depth analysis on other factors belonging rather to specific pathology, technology or medical practice (experience in using MIS, endowment, safety, efficacy, surgical approach area etc.) is urgently required.

T2  - REVISTA ROMANEASCA PENTRU EDUCATIE MULTIDIMENSIONALA
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the field of production, politics and education pose new requirements for foreign language training of professional personnel. The need for highly qualified specialists, including non-philological specialties, has increased. Taking into account the need to prepare future workers for professional activities, taking into account the new requirements of the information society, the main emphasis in vocational education should be placed precisely on information and communication technologies (ICT). The main task of vocational training is the preparation of qualified competitive personnel with a high level of professional knowledge, abilities, skills and mobility that meet the requirements of scientific and technological progress and market relations in the economy, the upbringing of socially active members of society, the formation of their scientific worldview, creative thinking. The study of this article may be of interest to the world scientific community, given that today the language issue has become especially acute, given the significant pace of globalization of the countries of the world, and information technologies have become a part of the life of every person. Thus, the question arises of obtaining positive results in the study of foreign languages using ICT. The purpose of the article is to analyse theoretically the possibilities of using information and communication technologies as a means of professional foreign language training and to test experimentally conceptual authorial provisions on the example of civil defence specialists. According to this goal, the research was aimed at practical verification of the feasibility of using ICT in the process of teaching foreign languages on the example of an educational institution.

TI  - Land-Use and Land-Cover Changes in Dong Trieu District, Vietnam, during Past Two Decades and Their Driving Forces
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use and land-cover (LULC) change analyses are useful in understanding the changes in our living environments and their driving factors. Modeling changes of LULC in the future, together with the driving factors derived through analyzing the trends of past LULC changes, bring the opportunity to assess and orientate the current and future land-use policies. As the entryway of Quang Ninh province, Vietnam, Dong Trieu locale has experienced significant LULC changes during the past two decades. In this study, the spatial distribution of six Level I LULC classes, forest, cropland, orchards, waterbody, built-up, and barren land, in Dong Trieu district at 2000, 2010, and 2019 were obtained from Landsat imageries by maximum likelihood technique. The most significant changes observed over the past twenty years are a decrease of barren land (9.1%) and increases of built-up (8.1%) and orchards (6.8%). Driving factor analysis indicated that the changes of cropland and built-up were dependent on distance from road (DFR), distance from main road (DFMR), distance from urban (DFU), distance from water (DFW), elevation, slope, and population density. The changes of forest were dependent on all the driving forces listed above, except DFMR. The orchards mainly appeared near the high-population-density area. The transformation of the waterbody was affected by geography (elevation and slope) and population density. The higher the population density, the less barren the land would appear.

Experience proven by the disciplines offered in geotechnology in the undergraduate geography course at the University of the State of Amazonas (UEA) in Manaus and inland cities from 2013 to 2019. Several potentialities have been identified with the installation of the geotechnology room as use of several software in the disciplines. This is not a reality of the municipalities of the interior of Amazonas, almost in its entirety, there are difficulties due to lack of laboratory. However, we work in the face of local reality and possibilities, so that students learn as geotechnologies and make use of didactic resources. The importance of geotechnologies has been used with the greater use of academic studies and the use in schools by interns and graduates.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and biopsy is a promising technique for visualizing and evaluating lymph node status in cancer. This approach has been recommended for low-risk endometrial cancer (EC) patients by authoritative international guidelines, but it has not been performed broadly in China and worldwide. This work aims to describe detailed SLN mapping and biopsy procedures to promote the clinical application. SLN mapping and postoperative pathologic ultrastaging were conducted in a patient with low-risk EC using indocyanine green (ICG) dye to track the SLNs under laparoscopy and resecting them completely for ultrastaging. In conclusion, this protocol describes details of ICG injection, and SLN mapping and biopsy in EC patients based on the experiences gained during clinical practice.

TI  - The Dynamic of Vegetation Growth with Regular Climate and Climatic Fluctuations in a Subtropical Mountainous Island, Taiwan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is an integrative indicator of environmental change, and remotely-sensed data provide a powerful way to monitor land surface vegetation responses to climatic fluctuations across various spatiotemporal scales. In this study, we synthesize the local climate, mainly temperature and precipitation, and large-scale atmospheric anomalies, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-connected dynamics, on a vegetative surface in a subtropical mountainous island, the northwest Pacific of Taiwan. We used two decadal photosynthetically active vegetation cover (PV) data (2001-2020) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data to portray vegetation dynamics at monthly, seasonal, and annual scales. Results show that PV is positively related to both temperature and precipitation at a monthly timescale across various land cover types, and the log-linear with one-month lagged of precipitation reveals the accumulation of seasonal rainfall having a significant effect on vegetation growth. Using TIMESAT, three annual phenological metrics, SOS (start of growing season), EOS (end of growing season), and LOS (length of growing season), have been derived from PV time series and been related to seasonal rainfall. The delayed SOS was manifestly influenced by a spring drought, <40 mm during February-March. The later SOS led to a ramification on following late EOS, shorter LOS, and reduction of annual NPP. Nevertheless, the summer rainfall (August-October) and EOS had no significant effects on vegetation growth owing to abundant rainfall. Therefore, the SOS associated with spring rainfall, instead of EOS, played an advantageous role in regulating vegetation development in this subtropical island. The PCA (principal component analysis) was applied for PV time series and explored the spatiotemporal patterns connected to local climate and climatic fluctuations for entire Taiwan, North Taiwan, and South Taiwan. The first two components, PC1 and PC2, explained most of data variance (94-95%) linked to temporal dynamics of land cover (r > 0.90) which was also regulated by local climate. While the subtle signals of PC3 and PC4 explained 0.1-0.4% of the data variance, related to regional drought (r = 0.35-0.40) especially in central and southwest Taiwan and ENSO-associated rainfall variation (r = -0.40--0.37). Through synthesizing the relationships between vegetation dynamics and climate based on multiple timescales, there will be a comprehensive picture of vegetation growth and its cascading effects on ecosystem productivity.

TI  - Remote Sensing Estimation of Bamboo Forest Aboveground Biomass Based on Geographically Weighted Regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bamboo forests are widespread in subtropical areas and are well known for their rapid growth and great carbon sequestration ability. To recognize the potential roles and functions of bamboo forests in regional ecosystems, forest aboveground biomass (AGB)-which is closely related to forest productivity, the forest carbon cycle, and, in particular, carbon sinks in forest ecosystems-is calculated and applied as an indicator. Among the existing studies considering AGB estimation, linear or nonlinear regression models are the most frequently used; however, these methods do not take the influence of spatial heterogeneity into consideration. A geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, as a spatial local model, can solve this problem to a certain extent. Based on Landsat 8 OLI images, we use the Random Forest (RF) method to screen six variables, including TM457, TM543, B7, NDWI, NDVI, and W7B6VAR. Then, we build the GWR model to estimate the bamboo forest AGB, and the results are compared with those of the cokriging (COK) and orthogonal least squares (OLS) models. The results show the following: (1) The GWR model had high precision and strong prediction ability. The prediction accuracy (R-2) of the GWR model was 0.74, 9%, and 16% higher than the COK and OLS models, respectively, while the error (RMSE) was 7% and 12% lower than the errors of the COK and OLS models, respectively. (2) The bamboo forest AGB estimated by the GWR model in Zhejiang Province had a relatively dense spatial distribution in the northwestern, southwestern, and northeastern areas. This is in line with the actual bamboo forest AGB distribution in Zhejiang Province, indicating the potential practical value of our study. (3) The optimal bandwidth of the GWR model was 156 m. By calculating the variable parameters at different positions in the bandwidth, close attention is given to the local variation law in the estimation of the results in order to reduce the model error.

TI  - Uncertainty Analysis of Multisource Land Cover Products in China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based land cover products play a crucial role in sustainability. There are several types of land cover products, such as qualitative products with discrete classes, semiquantitative products with several classes at a predetermined ratio, and quantitative products with land cover fractions. The proportions of land cover types in the grids with coarse resolution should be considered when used at the regional scale (e.g., modeling and remote sensing inversion). However, uncertainty, which varies with spatial distribution and resolution, needs to be studied further. This study used MCD12, ESA CCI, and MEaSURES VCF land cover data as indicators of qualitative, semiquantitative, and quantitative products, respectively, to explore the uncertainty of multisource land cover data. The methods of maximum area aggregation, deviation analysis, and least squares regression were used to investigate spatiotemporal changes in forests and nontree vegetation at diverse pixel resolutions across China. The results showed that the average difference in forest coverage for the three products was 8%, and the average deviation was 11.2%. For forest cover, the VCF and ESA CCI exhibited high consistency. For nontree vegetation, the ESA CCI and MODIS exhibited the lowest differences. The overall uncertainty in the temporal and spatial changes of the three products was relatively small, but there were significant differences in local areas (e.g., southeastern hills). Notably, as the spatial resolution decreased, the three products' uncertainty decreased, and the resolution of 0.1 degrees was the inflection point of consistency.

M3  - Review
AB  - Pelvic lymph node dissection is an important step in radical prostatectomy (RP). Extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND), currently employed for patients with intermediate- or high-risk PCa, may lead to overtreatment, prolong the operation time, and increase the risks of complications. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) is defined as the first metastasis lymph node from the primary tumor. In addition, SLN distribution is essential for overall lymph node dissection. However, due to the complex and diverse lymphatic drainage pathways and the inaccuracy of lymphatic tracing technology, SLN distribution and dissection have always been controversial. This review focuses on the application of pelvic SLN tracing technique in radical prostatectomy.

TI  - Shifting Contribution of Climatic Constraints on Evapotranspiration in the Boreal Forest
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The global evapotranspiration (ET) shows an increasing trend with global warming in recent decades, while ET variation in different regions is still uncertain. Boreal forest ecosystem, as one of the most sensitive regions to climate change, are still poorly understood due to the sparse observation and the changing of ET in the boreal forest has been covered up for lower values compared to lower-latitude regions. Based on the PT-JPL model, we estimated the ET in the boreal forest during 1982-2015. The annual ET showed an increasing trend (0.5073 mm year(-1)). Seventy percentage of the boreal forest area is increasing which mainly occurred in Central Canada, Alaska, Central Siberia and Northern Europe, while 24% is decreasing, which occurred in the southern Siberia, Northern Mongolia and Northern Canada. The quantification of basic climatic factors shows that atmospheric demand is the main factor with an increasing trend which is accordance with the (a) increasing temperature; (b) annual precipitation is increasing providing increasing water supply for boreal forest. Factorial experiments were also conducted and showed that the climatic constraints that contribute mainly to ET have gradually shifted from net radiation to moisture restriction in the boreal forest. The moisture control tendency indicated that ET in the boreal forest was gradually controlled by humidity rather than energy, suggesting a limited water supply and an intensifying water cycle in the boreal forest.

TI  - Strip Layering Diagram-Based Optimum Continuously Varying Pulse Interval Sequence Design for Extremely High-Resolution Spaceborne Sliding Spotlight SAR
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Applying a continuous varying pulse interval (CVPI) sequence is of significance for an extremely high resolution (EHR) spaceborne sliding spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for complete data acquisition. An optimum CVPI sequence should be the one leading to the minimum movement of the echoes of interest in a pulse train. However, such an optimization can be hardly conducted using the traditional timing diagram. Aiming at solving this problem, this article introduces a new graphic tool, referred to as the strip layering diagram, to achieve an optimum CVPI sequence for an EHR spaceborne sliding spotlight SAR. The basic rationale is to explicitly employ a new parameter eta to directly control the movement of the echoes of interest in a pulse train. The new strip layering diagram consists of two layered subdiagrams: one is the candidate subdiagram, consisting of the candidate strips presenting all the CVPI sequence candidates restricted by the data acquisition geometry; the other is the feasibility subdiagram, consisting of the feasibility strips marking all the feasible regions where the echoes of interest are not submerged by the transmitted pulses or contaminated by the nadir echoes. An optimum CVPI sequence can be accurately and efficiently achieved by sketching a line segment satisfying four conditions inside the strip layering diagram. The detailed comparisons between the new diagram and the traditional timing diagram are also provided, followed by computer simulations to validate the presented approaches.

TI  - Dam Siting: A Review
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Dams can effectively regulate the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources, where the rationality of dam siting determines whether the role of dams can be effectively performed. This paper reviews the research literature on dam siting in the past 20 years, discusses the methods used for dam siting, focuses on the factors influencing dam siting, and assesses the impact of different dam functions on siting factors. The results show the following: (1) Existing siting methods can be categorized into three types-namely, GIS/RS-based siting, MCDM- and MCDM-GIS-based siting, and machine learning-based siting. GIS/RS emphasizes the ability to capture and analyze data, MCDM has the advantage of weighing the importance of the relationship between multiple factors, and machine learning methods have a strong ability to learn and process complex data. (2) Site selection factors vary greatly, depending on the function of the dam. For dams with irrigation and water supply as the main purpose, the site selection is more focused on the evaluation of water quality. For dams with power generation as the main purpose, the hydrological factors characterizing the power generation potential are the most important. For dams with flood control as the main purpose, the topography and geological conditions are more important. (3) The integration of different siting methods and the siting of new functional dams in the existing research is not sufficient. Future research should focus on the integration of different methods and disciplines, in order to explore the siting of new types of dams.

TI  - Improved modelling of soil NO<i> <sub>x</sub> </i> emissions in a high temperature agricultural region: role of background emissions on NO<sub>2</sub> trend over the US
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - EPA reports a steady decline of US anthropogenic NO (x) emissions in 2005-2019 summers, while NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) from the OMI satellite over large spatial domains have flattened since 2009. To better understand the contributing factors to a flattening of the OMI NO2 trends, we investigate the role of soil and lightning NOx emissions on this apparent disagreement. We improve soil NO (x) emissions estimates using a new observation-based temperature response, which increases the linear correlation coefficient between GEOS-Chem simulated and OMI NO2 VCDs by 0.05-0.2 over the Central US. Multivariate trend analysis reveals that soil and lightning NO (x) combined emissions trends change from -3.95% a(-1) during 2005-2009 to 0.60% a(-1) from 2009 to 2019, thereby rendering the abrupt slowdown of total NO (x) emissions reduction. Non-linear inter-annual variations explain 6.6% of the variance of total NO (x) emissions. As background emissions become relatively larger with uncertain inter-annual variations, the NO2 VCDs alone at the national scale, especially in the regions with vast rural areas, will be insufficient to discern the trend of anthropogenic emissions.

TI  - Machine Learning Prediction of Quartz Forming-Environments
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Trace elements of quartz document the physical-chemical evolutions of quartz growth, which has been a great and most applied tool in the study of geological settings in quartz-forming environments. A classic method is using graphic diagram plots visualizing the quartz trace element discriminations and trends, examples including the Al-Ti diagram (Rusk, 2012, ) and the Ti-Al-Ge diagram (Schron et al., 1988, ). However, those diagrams are limited to two dimensions and cannot show the information in a higher dimension. In the study, we thus used a machine learning-based approach to evaluate quartz trace elements, and visualized them for the first time in the high-dimensional diagrams. We revisited 1,626 quartz samples from nine geological environments from previous studies, and applied a support vector machine to characterize values of the contained trace elements, including Al, Ti, Li, Ge, and Sr. We demonstrate that support vector machines can identify the crystallization environment of quartz with a significantly higher accuracy than the traditional plotting methods. Our work can massively improve the confidence on distinguishing quartz origin from different geological environments with a high efficiency. The method may also be applicable for other minerals, and we anticipate our research is a starting point for investigating mineral trace elements with machine learning techniques. Our quartz classifier can be accessed via .

TI  - Profiling of Dust and Urban Haze Mass Concentrations during the 2019 National Day Parade in Beijing by Polarization Raman Lidar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The polarization-Raman Lidar combined sun photometer is a powerful method for separating dust and urban haze backscatter, extinction, and mass concentrations. The observation was performed in Beijing during the 2019 National Day parade, the particle depolarization ratio at 532 nm and Lidar ratio at 355 nm are 0.13 +/- 0.05 and 52 +/- 9 sr, respectively. It is the typical value of a mixture of dust and urban haze. Here we quantify the contributions of cross-regional transported natural dust and urban haze mass concentrations to Beijing's air quality. There is a significant correlation between urban haze mass concentrations and surface PM2.(5) (R = 0.74, p < 0.01). The contributions of local emissions to air pollution during the 2019 National Day parade were insignificant, mainly affected by regional transport, including urban haze in North China plain and Guanzhong Plain (Hebei, Tianjin, Shandong, and Shanxi), and dust aerosol in Mongolia regions and Xinjiang. Moreover, the trans-regional transmission of natural dust dominated the air pollution during the 2019 National Day parade, with a relative contribution to particulate matter mass concentrations exceeding 74% below 4 km. Our results highlight that controlling anthropogenic emissions over regional scales and focusing on the effects of natural dust is crucial and effective to improve Beijing's air quality.

TI  - Evaluating the Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Irrigation Water Components for Water Resources Management Using Geo-Informatics Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal distribution of irrigation water components was evaluated at the canal command area in Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) by using a remote sensing-based geo-informatics approach. Satellite-derived MODIS product-based Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was used for the estimation of the actual evapotranspiration (ETa). The ground data-based advection aridity method (AA) was used to calibrate and validate the model. Statistical analysis of the SEBAL based ETa and AA shows the mean values of 87.1 mm and 47.9 mm during Kharif season (May-November) and 100 mm and 77 mm during the Rabi Season (December-April). Mean NSEs of 0.72 and 0.85 and RMSEs 34.9 and 5.76 during the Kharif and the Rabi seasons were observed for ETa and AA, respectively. Rainfall data were calibrated with the point observatory data of the metrological stations. The average annual ETa was found 899 mm for defined four cropping years (2011-2012 to 2014-2015) with the minimum average value of 63.3 mm in January and the maximum average value of 110.6 mm in August. Average of the sum of net canal water use (NCWU) and rainfall during the study period of four years was 548 mm (36% of ETa). Seasonal analysis revealed 39% and 61% of groundwater extraction proportion during Rabi and Kharif seasons, dependent upon the occurrence of rainfall and crop phenology. Overall, the results provide insight into the interrelationships between key water resources management components and the variation of these through time, offering information to improve the strategic planning and management of available water resources in this region.

TI  - Analysis of land surface temperature variation based on MODIS data a case study of the agricultural pastural ecotone of northern China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural pastural ecotone of northern China (APENC), as one of the world?s four agro-pastural ecotones, is a typical fragile ecological zone and sensitive zone responding to global climate change. The thermal environment pattern of APENC has been dramatically changed due to intensive human disturbances, especially the land use/land cover change induced by a series of ecological restoration projects implementation after 1999. Few studies focused on land surface temperature (LST) variation in this region due to the lack of long time series remote sensing data. The spatial, temporal and trend characteristics of LST were quantitatively analyzed at different timescales based on a long-term sequence of MODIS data in APENC (2003?2020). Results showed that (i) the thermal pattern of APENC was dominated by high LST areas and very high LST areas at an annual and seasonal timescale. These regions mainly distributed in Yellow River Basin, southeast boundary and vast plains in the northeast. The high value of absolute variability (AV) mainly occurred in the western of Yinshan-Greater Khingan Mountains and northeast of APENC. Meanwhile, the AV was largest in winter and then decreased from spring to fall. The fluctuation degree of AV was largest in summer while the slightest in fall. (ii) The LST exhibited insignificantly and rapidly warming during 2003?2007 and 2012?2014, respectively. Whereas the significant cooling trend occurred during 2007?2012 and 2014?2020. (iii) The LST showed a warming trend at an annual, spring and winter timescale since the increasing trend in nighttime was faster than the decreasing trend of LST in daytime. The cooling trend occurred in fall and summer because the decreasing range of LST in daytime was greater than the increasing nighttime trend. These results will provide an important regional demonstration for climate change study of arid and semi-arid region and a reference for agricultural and livestock production for APENC.

TI  - Assessment of Empirical Algorithms for Shallow Water Bathymetry Using Multi-Spectral Imagery of Pearl River Delta Coast, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pearl River Delta (PRD), as one of the most densely populated regions in the world, is facing both natural changes (e.g., sea level rise) and human-induced changes (e.g., dredging for navigation and land reclamation). Bathymetric information is thus important for the protection and management of the estuarine environment, but little effort has been made to comprehensively evaluate the performance of different methods and datasets. In this study, two linear regression models-the linear band model and the log-transformed band ratio model, and two non-linear regression models-the support vector regression model and the random forest regression model-were applied to Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery for bathymetry mapping in 2019 and 2020. Results suggested that a priori area clustering based on spectral features using the K-means algorithm improved estimation accuracy. The random forest regression model performed best, and the three-band combinations outperformed two-band combinations in all models. When the non-linear models were applied with three-band combination (red, green, blue) to L8 and S2 imagery, the Root Mean Square Error (Mean Absolute Error) decreased by 23.10% (35.53%), and the coefficient of determination (Kling-Gupta efficiency) increased by 0.08 (0.09) on average, compared to those using the linear regression models. Despite the differences in spatial resolution and band wavelength, L8 and S2 performed similarly in bathymetry estimation. This study quantified the relative performance of different models and may shed light on the potential combination of multiple data sources for more timely and accurate bathymetry mapping.

TI  - Prospects for Long-Term Agriculture in Southern Africa: Emergent Dynamics of Savannah Ecosystems from Remote Sensing Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydro-climatic resilience is an essential element of food security. The miombo ecosystem in Southern Africa supports varied land uses for a growing population. Albedo, Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC), Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), and precipitation remote-sensing data for current climate were jointly analyzed to explore vegetation dynamics and water availability feedbacks. Changes in the surface energy balance tied to vegetation status were examined in the light of an hourly albedo product with improved atmospheric correction derived for this study. Phase-space analysis shows that the albedo's seasonality tracks the landscape-scale functional stability of miombo and woody savanna with respect to precipitation variations. Miombo exhibits the best adaptive traits to water stress which highlights synergies among root-system water uptake capacity, vegetation architecture, and landscape hydro-geomorphology. This explains why efforts to conserve the spatial structure of the miombo forest in sustainable farming of seasonal wetlands have led to significant crop yield increases. Grass savanna's high vulnerability to water stress is illustrative of potential run-away impacts of miombo deforestation. This study suggests that phase-space analysis of albedo, SIF, and FVC can be used as operational diagnostics of ecosystem health.

M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the temporal and spatial changes of grassland vegetation cover and its response to human activities in Qinghai Province by trend analysis method, linear correlation analysis, and geographical weighted regression method, based on Landsat 8 OLI, GIMMS NDVI 3G data, MODIS data and statistical data from 1982 to 2018. The results showed that: ( 1) From 1982 to 2018, NDVI, of grassland in Qinghai Province showed an overall decreasing trend, with an average rate of 1.2x10-4. (2) The NDVIn was sensitive to grazing intensity in the southwest and central parts of Qinghai Province, while it was not sensitive in the northeast. This may be related to the complementary advantages of agriculture and animal husbandry and the implementation of ecological engineering. ( 3) The regression coefficients between NDVI,,,; and per capita GDP, traffic, residential area, and total human population were 0.20, 0.11, 0.04 and 0.03, respectively. The local regression coefficients of per capita GDP and grassland NDVI, x were high in the west and low in the east, while that for other regression relationships were high in the west and east and low in the east region. This is mainly due to the rich mineral resources in the west and a transportation hub and population gathering area in the east.

TI  - Large-Scale River Mapping Using Contrastive Learning and Multi-Source Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - River system is critical for the future sustainability of our planet but is always under the pressure of food, water and energy demands. Recent advances in machine learning bring a great potential for automatic river mapping using satellite imagery. Surface river mapping can provide accurate and timely water extent information that is highly valuable for solid policy and management decisions. However, accurate large-scale river mapping remains challenging given limited labels, spatial heterogeneity and noise in satellite imagery (e.g., clouds and aerosols). In this paper, we propose a new multi-source data-driven method for large-scale river mapping by combining multi-spectral imagery and synthetic aperture radar data. In particular, we build a multi-source data segmentation model, which uses contrastive learning to extract the common information between multiple data sources while also preserving distinct knowledge from each data source. Moreover, we create the first large-scale multi-source river imagery dataset based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data, along with 1013 handmade accurate river segmentation mask (which will be released to the public). In this dataset, our method has been shown to produce superior performance (F1-score is 91.53%) over multiple state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed contrastive learning model in mapping river extent when we have limited and noisy data.

TI  - Lymph Node Staging with a Combined Protocol of <SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG PET/MRI and Sentinel Node SPECT/CT: A Prospective Study in Patients with FIGO I/II Cervical Carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is present in a minority of patients with early stages of cervical carcinomas. As conventional imaging including PET/CT has shown limited sensitivity, systematic lymphadenectomies are often conducted for staging purposes. Therefore, the aim of this prospective study was to analyze the impact of F-18-FDG PET/MRI in addition to sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy on lymph node (LN) status. Methods: Forty-two women with an initial diagnosis of Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) IA-IIB cervical carcinoma were included between March 2016 and April 2019. Each patient underwent preoperative whole-body F-18-FDG PET/MRI and SLN imaging with SPECT/CT after intracervical injection of Tc-99m-labeled nanocolloid. Systematic lymphadenectomy and SLN biopsy served as the reference standard. Staging using PET/MRI was performed by nuclear medicine and radiology experts working in consensus. Results: One patient was excluded from surgical staging because of liver metastases newly diagnosed on PET/MRI. The overall prevalence of LNM in the remaining 41 patients was 29.3% (12/41). Five of 12 patients with LNMhad solely small metastases with a maximum diameter of 5 mm. The consensus interpretation showed PET/MRI to have a specificity of 100% (29/29; 95% CI, 88.3%-100%) for LNM staging but a low sensitivity, 33.3% (4/12; 95% CI, 12.8%-60.9%). LN size was the most important factor for the detectability of metastases, since only LNMs larger than 5 mm could be identified by PET/MRI (sensitivity, 57.1% for.5 mm and 0% for <= 5 mm). Paraaortic LNM was evaluated accurately in 3 of the 4 patients with paraaortic LN metastasis. SLNs were detectable by SPECT/CT in 82.9% of the patients or 69.0% of the hemipelves. In cases with an undetectable SLN on SPECT/CT, the malignancy rate was considerably higher (31.2% vs. 19.3%). The combination of PET/MRI and SLN SPECT/CT improved the detection of pelvic LNM from 33.3% to 75%. Conclusion: F-18-FDG PET/MRI is a highly specific N-staging method and improves LNM detection. Because of the limited sensitivity in frequently occurring small LNMs, PET/MRI should be combined with SLN mapping. The proposed combined protocol helps to decide whether extensive surgical staging is necessary in patients with FIGO I/II cervical cancer.

TI  - Using remote sensing to assess plant health and drought response in game reserves and adjacent farmland overtime in the Eastern Cape, South Africa
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study described in this article was to investigate the vegetation health and drought response of naturally occurring Albany thicket and neighbouring farmland vegetation, that appears in an area of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Google Earth Engine was used to manipulate Landsat 5, 7 and 8 datasets to produce a 30-year temporal dataset, after which the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI) were then applied to create a time series analysis. The Mann-Kendall and Spearman correlation statistical tests were used on the time series to observe trends and correlations between the NDVI and the NDWI datasets. The Spearman correlation test results showed that there were high correlations between the NDVI and the NDWI datasets (all above 0.805). Furthermore, the Man-Kendall test showed that all the datasets had positively increasing trends, while the NDVI datasets all had monotonic positive trends. Large differences in the NDVI and the NDWI were seen for the different vegetation types during times of drought, and farmland was the most severely affected with an average of 19% decrease in the NDVI and an average of 71% decrease in the NDWI.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Land Use and Land Cover Changes in Urban Areas Using Remote Sensing Images and GIS Analysis: The Case Study of Opole, Poland
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion is a dynamic and complex phenomenon, often involving adverse changes in land use and land cover (LULC). This paper uses satellite imagery from Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI, and GIS technology to analyse LULC changes in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. The research was carried out in Opole, the capital of the Opole Agglomeration (south-western Poland). Maps produced from supervised spectral classification of remote sensing data revealed that in 20 years, built-up areas have increased about 40%, mainly at the expense of agricultural land. Detection of changes in the spatial pattern of LULC showed that the highest average rate of increase in built-up areas occurred in the zone 3-6 km (11.7%) and above 6 km (10.4%) from the centre of Opole. The analysis of the increase of built-up land in relation to the decreasing population (SDG 11.3.1) has confirmed the ongoing process of demographic suburbanisation. The paper shows that satellite imagery and GIS can be a valuable tool for local authorities and planners to monitor the scale of urbanisation processes for the purpose of adapting space management procedures to the changing environment.

TI  - Long-Term Community Dynamics Reveal Different Trajectories for Two Mid-Atlantic Maritime Forests
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Maritime forests are threatened by sea-level rise, storm surge and encroachment of salt-tolerant species. On barrier islands, these forested communities must withstand the full force of tropical storms, hurricanes and nor'easters while the impact is reduced for mainland forests protected by barrier islands. Geographic position may account for differences in maritime forest resilience to disturbance. In this study, we quantify two geographically distinct maritime forests protected by dunes on Virginia's Eastern Shore (i.e., mainland and barrier island) at two time points (15 and 21 years apart, respectively) to determine whether the trajectory is successional or presenting evidence of disassembly with sea-level rise and storm exposure. We hypothesize that due to position on the landscape, forest disassembly will be higher on the barrier island than mainland as evidenced by reduction in tree basal area and decreased species richness. Rate of relative sea-level rise in the region was 5.9 +/- 0.7 mm yr(-1) based on monthly mean sea-level data from 1975 to 2017. Savage Neck Dunes Natural Area Preserve maritime forest was surveyed using the point quarter method in 2003 and 2018. Parramore Island maritime forest was surveyed in 1997 using 32 m diameter circular plots. As the island has been eroding over the past two decades, 2016 Landsat imagery was used to identify remaining forested plots prior to resurveying. In 2018, only plots that remained forested were resurveyed. Lidar was used to quantify elevation of each point/plot surveyed in 2018. Plot elevation at Savage Neck was 1.93 +/- 0.02 m above sea level, whereas at Parramore Island, elevation was lower at 1.04 +/- 0.08 m. Mainland dominant species, Acer rubrum, Pinus taeda, and Liquidambar styraciflua, remained dominant over the study period, with a 14% reduction in the total number of individuals recorded. Basal area increased by 11%. Conversely, on Parramore Island, 33% of the former forested plots converted to grassland and 33% were lost to erosion and occur as ghost forest on the shore or were lost to the ocean. Of the remaining forested plots surveyed in 2018, dominance switched from Persea palustris and Juniperus virginiana to the shrub Morella cerifera. Only 46% of trees/shrubs remained and basal area was reduced by 84%. Shrub basal area accounted for 66% of the total recorded in 2018. There are alternative paths to maritime forest trajectory which differ for barrier island and mainland. Geographic position relative to disturbance and elevation likely explain the changes in forest community composition over the timeframes studied. Protected mainland forest at Savage Neck occurs at higher mean elevation and indicates natural succession to larger and fewer individuals, with little change in mixed hardwood-pine dominance. The fronting barrier island maritime forest on Parramore Island has undergone rapid change in 21 years, with complete loss of forested communities to ocean or conversion to mesic grassland. Of the forests remaining, dominant evergreen trees are now being replaced with the expanding evergreen shrub, Morella cerifera. Loss of biomass and basal area has been documented in other low elevation coastal forests. Our results indicate that an intermediate shrub state may precede complete loss of woody communities in some coastal communities, providing an alternative mechanism of resilience.

TI  - Where Does Moisture Come From Over the Congo Basin?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Congo Basin hosts the world's second largest rainforest and is a major rainfall center. However, the primary sources of moisture needed to maintain this forest, either from evapotranspiration (ET) or advection from the ocean, remain unclear. We use satellite observations of the deuterium content of water vapor (delta D), solar induced fluorescence (SIF), precipitation, and atmospheric reanalysis to examine the relative contribution of ET to moisture in the free troposphere. We find that SIF, an indicator of photosynthesis, covaries with delta D in early rainy seasons, suggesting that ET is an important contributor to atmospheric moisture in both the spring and fall rainy seasons. However, the relative contribution of ET to the free tropospheric moisture varies between the two rainy seasons. Observed delta D relative to a range of observationally constrained, isotopic mixing models representative of water vapor coming from land suggests that 83% +/- 9% of the free tropospheric moisture come from ET in February, and 45% +/- 13% in April, versus 59% +/- 12% in August and 31% +/- 12% in October. Reanalysis indicate that this difference between seasons is due to increased advection of ocean air during the fall season, thus reducing the relative contribution of ET to the Congo Basin in the fall. In addition, ET is the primary atmospheric moisture source in the winter and summer dry seasons, consistent with estimates reported in literature. Our results highlight the importance of ET from the Congo rainforest as an important source of moisture for initiating the rainy seasons.Plain Language Summary The Congo Basin hosts the world's second largest rainforest and is a major rainfall center. It has been unclear whether moisture from the adjacent oceans or from evapotranspiration of the rainforests is its main moisture source, especially for initiating the rainy seasons. Using a suite of satellite data, we show that evapotranspiration, especially transpiration, is important for atmospheric moisture throughout the year. However, the relative contribution of ocean moisture from transport increases prior to fall rainy season and not prior to the spring rainy season, indicating that the relative contribution of ET to atmospheric moisture is higher in spring than in fall. Our finding highlights the importance of the rainforests in maintaining and modulating atmospheric humidity.

TI  - Co-Designing Health Service Evaluation Tools That Foreground First Nation Worldviews for Better Mental Health and Wellbeing Outcomes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - It is critical that health service evaluation frameworks include Aboriginal people and their cultural worldviews from design to implementation. During a large participatory action research study, Elders, service leaders and Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal researchers co-designed evaluation tools to test the efficacy of a previously co-designed engagement framework. Through a series of co-design workshops, tools were built using innovative collaborative processes that foregrounded Aboriginal worldviews. The workshops resulted in the development of a three-way survey that records the service experiences related to cultural safety from the perspective of Aboriginal clients, their carer/s, and the service staff with whom they work. The surveys centralise the role of relationships in client-service interactions, which strongly reflect their design from an Aboriginal worldview. This paper provides new insights into the reciprocal benefits of engaging community Elders and service leaders to work together to develop new and more meaningful ways of servicing Aboriginal families. Foregrounding relationships in service evaluations reinstates the value of human connection and people-centred engagement in service delivery which are central to rebuilding historically fractured relationships between mainstream services and Aboriginal communities. This benefits not only Aboriginal communities, but also other marginalised populations expanding the remit of mainstream services to be accessed by many.

TI  - Impacts of land use changes on the habitat of Asian elephants in the Nangun River Basin.
T2  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change exerts a significant effect on the Asian elephant' s habitat, and understanding the impact mechanism is a prerequisite for effective protection for this endangered species. To explore the spatiotemporal processes and mechanisms of land use changes and their impacts on the Asian elephant's habitat, LandTrendr algorithm was used to detect annual natural forest disturbances in Nangun River Basin, a China-Myanmar cross border region, based on Landsat time-series images for 1988 to 2018 together with land use/land cover classification maps of 1988 and 2018. The Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) model was employed to evaluate the habitat suitability of the Nangun River Basin for Asian elephants. The results show that (1) from 1988 to 2018, land use changes were mainly characterized by rubber plantation expansion and severe natural forest loss, and the areas of disturbed forest differed greatly between China and Myanmar. (2) Drastic deforestation resulted from remarkable rubber plantation expansion led to the area loss, and the decline of connectivity of the Asian elephant's habitat. (3) The Asian elephant's habitat in the basin was gradually encroached from the edge to the interior so that the upstream and downstream suitable habitats were isolated because of severe deforestation in the cross-border regions between China and Myanmar. Thus, reversing the expansion of tropical cash crops like rubber trees, to restore the habitat connectivity between China and Myanmar through establishing a cross-border basin-wide natural reserve is a critical path to protect Asian elephant and to mitigate human-elephant conflict.

TI  - Dual-Comb Ranging and Its Applications
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - Significance Distance measurement is a common basic technology in the field of geometric measurement and has broad applications in scientific research and industry. Currently, high-precision distance measurement is normally achieved using the interferometric method, and the distance results can be directly traced to the optical wavelength. However, the phase ambiguity hinders the application of the traditional interferometric method in long-distance absolute positioning, such as space missions, including tight formation-flying satellites, antenna measurement, spacecraft rendezvous and docking, as well as precision manufacturing and assembly, including aircraft manufacturing, satellite equipment manufacturing, and synthetic aperture optical system assembly. Fortunately, invention of the optical frequency comb (OFC) provides great opportunities for geometric measurements.In recent years, several OFC-based methods have been proposed for the measurement of distances, e. g., the intermode beat, dispersive interferometry, pulse alignment, and dual-comb methods. Compared with conventional methods, OFC-based methods are capable of resolving the problem of phase ambiguity and measuring the absolute distance. Among them, the dual -comb ranging method makes full use of the characteristics of OFC in the time and frequency domains and exhibits reasonable dynamics, precision, and unambiguity range. The dual -comb method opens up a new direction for distance measurement and is expected to bring great benefits to optical metrology. Since 2009, many advances have been achieved in dual -comb ranging techniques. However, there are still several challenges involving principle research and industrial applications. Hence, it is necessary to summarize progress of the dual-comb ranging technique to guide future development in this field more rationally.Progress The progress of the dual -comb ranging method is illustrated in Fig. 1. The concept of dual -comb was first proposed in 2002 by Schiller, and was first applied to absolute distance measurement in 2009 by Coddington et al from NIST. Recently, the proposed dual -comb ranging method primarily uses fiber combs as the light source and achieves absolute distance measurement based on two principles, namely, time-of-flight-based and phase-based ranging. Optimizing the parameter model and suppressing the frequency noise of a dual-comb system are two key technologies to achieve high-precision distance measurement. Here, the time -of-flight ranging method mainly focuses on the former, while achieving the phase -ranging method is based on the latter. Since 2013, domestic and foreign researchers have explored the performance improvement, function expansion, and applications of the dual-comb ranging method, including the dead-zone elimination of dual-comb ranging, nonambiguity range extension, improvement of ranging precision and response speed, dual-comb multi-degree-of-freedom sensing, and instrumentation and applications of the dual-comb ranging technique. Since 2018, research on the microresonatorbased dual-comb ranging method has been reported. The microcomb has the characteristics of miniaturization and easy on-chip integration. Compared with the fiber comb, the microcomb offers a better application prospect in the field of ranging, and provides new opportunities for further developments of dual-comb ranging.Conclusions and Prospects In summary, the dual-comb ranging technique provides an efficient tool for absolute distance measurement with a large unambiguity range, high precision, and high speed, and it has also become a hot spot in the field of ranging. Such an overall performance brings great benefits to various tasks in optical metrology. With the continuous in-depth and detailed explorations of dual -comb ranging, it is expected to become a portable instrument product widely used in scientific research and industry.

TI  - Polarimetric Model-Based Decomposition with Refined Double-Bounce Orientation Angle and Scattering Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oriented manmade targets can produce significant cross-polarization power. The scattering mechanism interpretation of them is still challenging. Within the framework of traditional scattering models, the scattering mechanism of oriented manmade targets will be interpreted as volume scattering. Recently, many advanced approaches have been proposed to mitigate the cross-polarization terms of the coherency matrix or distribute the power of cross-polarization to new scattering models, such as orientation angle compensation and multiple scattering components decomposition. Among these methods, the general model-based decomposition with physically meaningful double-bounce and odd-bounce scattering models has been proposed by modeling their independent orientation angles and becomes a widely accepted method. However, the two vital parameters of generalized scattering models: double- and odd-bounce orientation angles are derived through nonlinear optimization procedure. These generalized models lead to a heavy computation burden for parameters inversion. In this paper, we disclose the latent relationship between the double-bounce orientation angle and polarization orientation angle by data fitting experiments. With this simplified relationship, a refined double-bounce scattering model is established. Then, the odd-bounce orientation angle can be derived through equations. In this way, the nonlinear optimization procedure can be converted to a linear solution. A fast generalized model-based decomposition is developed thereafter. The main contribution of this work is to inherit the generalized models while speeding up the parameter calculation procedure. The comparison studies are carried out with X-band airborne PiSAR, L-band spaceborne ALOS-2, and C-band spaceborne Radarsat-2 PolSAR datasets. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed decomposition achieves improved interpretation performance from both visual and quantitative investigations especially for oriented built-up areas.

TI  - Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Cooperative Inversion Algorithm Applied to GF-5 Satellite

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper carried out CO2 inversion experiments based on the remote sensing data from the greenhouse gases monitoring instrument (GMI) on the GF-5 satellite in China, calculated the CO2 profile samples according to the differences in China's regional characteristics, and constructed the representative sample set suitable for China's regional characteristics. Then, it substituted the CO2 profile obtained by statistical inversion as the initial value into the physical inversion method to form a new algorithm for synergistic statistics and physical methods. By analyzing the inversion results of the new algorithm, we conclude that the collaborative inversion algorithm improves the accuracy by 47.7% on the basis of using the physical inversion algorithm alone, and the correlation between the inversion results of the new algorithm and the observation results provided by the international satellite of the same type, OCO-2, reaches 88.5%.

TI  - Optimal Bands Combination Selection for Extracting Garlic Planting Area with Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Garlic is one of the main economic crops in China. Accurate and timely extraction of the garlic planting area is critical for adjusting the agricultural planting structure and implementing rural policy actions. Crop extraction methods based on remote sensing usually use spectral-temporal features. Still, for garlic extraction, most methods simply combine all multi-temporal images. There has been a lack of research on each band's function in each multi-temporal image and optimal bands combination. To systematically explore the potential of the multi-temporal method for garlic extraction, we obtained a series of Sentinel-2 images in the whole garlic growth cycle. The importance of each band in all these images was ranked by the random forest (RF) method. According to the importance score of each band, eight different multi-temporal combination schemes were designed. The RF classifier was employed to extract garlic planting area, and the accuracy of the eight schemes was compared. The results show that (1) the Scheme VI (the top 39 bands in importance score) achieved the best accuracy of 98.65%, which is 6% higher than the optimal mono-temporal (February, wintering period) result, and (2) the red-edge band and the shortwave-infrared band played an essential role in accurate garlic extraction. This study gives inspiration in selecting the remotely sensed data source, the band, and phenology for accurately extracting garlic planting area, which could be transferred to other sites with larger areas and similar agriculture structures.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Differentiation of Land Surface Thermal Landscape in Yangtze River Delta Region, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Advancements in the integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta are changing the structure and function of the surface thermal landscape and triggering a series of ecological and environmental problems. Therefore, examining the spatiotemporal differentiation characteristics and evolution laws of this land surface thermal landscape has great theoretical and practical significance in the context of optimizing functional zoning and realizing the harmonious development of the economy, society and nature. The paper uses the LST (land surface temperature) data retrieved by MODIS (MOD11A2) remote sensing satellites in 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2019 to extract a land surface thermal rating map of the Yangtze River Delta region, and to analyze the spatiotemporal differentiation in the land surface thermal landscape, combining of the land surface thermal landscape strip profile and thermal landscape pattern indices. The results show that the LST in the Yangtze River Delta region has increased in the past 12 years, the proportion of middle-, sub-high- and high-temperature zones increased by 33.42%, and the high-temperature zone has gradually extended into inland areas. The high-temperature zones in the areas surrounding core cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou have expanded. The corridor effect of thermal changes on the surface is obvious. The degree of aggregation in the lower-temperature areas has gradually decreased. The degree of aggregation in the higher-temperature regions has increased. The patch types of thermal landscape pattern increase, and the distribution of landscape area among various types tends to be even. this trend is most significant in optimized development region.

TI  - A New Copper Stress Vegetation Index NCSVI Explores the Sensitive Range of Corn Leaves Spectral Under Copper Pollution
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, heavy metal pollution in the soil is becoming more and more serious in China. Hyperspectral remote sensing has become a hot spot in the research of heavy metal pollution in crops by reason of its characteristics such as high spectral resolution and integrated maps with spectral. The spectral of crops will change slightly after being contaminated by heavy metals, how to explore the sensitive bands in the leaves spectral stresses by heavy metal pollution is a current research direction. In this study, a new copper stress vegetation index (NCSVI) was proposed to explore the sensitive range of corn leaves spectral under copper stress. By designing corn stress experiments with different gradients, the spectral and the contents of Cu2+ in corn leaves under each copper stress concentration were determined. First, the spectral of corn leaves were divided into 11 sub-band intervals, NCSVI were constructed by spectral reflectance corresponded to the middle wavelength of each sub-band interval. Then, the Pearson correlation coefficient and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) between NCSVI and the contents of Cu2+ in each corn leaves was calculated, combined with three conventional vegetation indexes of water band index (WBI) , modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index (MCARI) and normalized water index (NDWI). Finally, the corn leaves spectral which obtained under the same experimental conditions in other year were selected for verification to confirm the stability and effectiveness of NCSVI. The results show that among the 11 sub-band intervals, only the four sub-band intervals of a green peak, red edge, near the valley, and near peak A, the absolute value of the correlation coefficient between NCSVI and Cu2+ contents of corn leaves were higher than 0. 9, respectively to -0.94, -0.97, -0.94, -0.96, as for RMSE, the root mean square error were less than 15, reached to 12.57, 8.71, 12.71 and 10.06. However, the highest correlation coefficient of WBI, MCARI and NDWI only reached to 0.75. The smallest RMSE was 24.21. Indicating that NCSVI corresponded to the four subintervals had a better indicator of copper pollution in corn leaves. The above results were verified by corn experiments under the same conditions in a different year, and it was found that among the 11 subintervals, only four subintervals of a green peak, red edge, near the valley, and near peak A had its absolute value of the coefficient R between NCSVI and the contents of Cu2+ in corn leaves were greater than 0.9, respectively to - 0 9, - 0.97, -0.97 and -0.93, as for RMSE, the root mean square error were less than 1. 55, reached to 1.50, 0.85, 0.78 and 1.29, which were higher than WBI, MCARI and NDWI, and with the same sensitive sub-band intervals in the experiment of 2016, indicating that NCSVI could detect the sensitive range of corn leaves spectral stressed by Cu2+, with the characteristics of high efficiency and good stability. The NCSVI index proposed in this paper can be used as a method to monitor copper pollution in corn leaves, and provide some theoretical supports for the research of heavy metal pollution in other crops.

TI  - Combining FY-3D MWTS-2 with AMSU-A Data for Inter-Decadal Diurnal Correction and Climate Trends of Atmospheric Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave temperature sounding observations from polar-orbiting meteorological satellites have been widely used for research on climate trends of atmospheric temperature at different heights around the world. Taking the Amazon rainforest as the target area, this study combined the Microwave Temperature Sounder-2 (MWTS-2) data onboard the Chinese FengYun-3D (FY-3D) satellite with the Advanced Microwave Sounding unit-A (AMSU-A) data onboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the European Meteorological Operational (MetOp) polar-orbiting meteorological satellites (i.e., NOAA-15, -18, -19, MetOp-A, -B). The double difference method was used to estimate and thus eliminate the inter-sensor bias, and a decadal diurnal correction was used to reduce the impact of different local equator crossing times on climate trends. The "no-rain" conditions were determined for AMSU-A data by channels 1 and 15, and for MWTS-2 data by channels 1 and 7. Finally, the decadal linear trends of atmospheric temperature from 1998 to 2020 were obtained after applying the inter-sensor bias calibration and inter-decadal diurnal correction to AMSU-A and MWTS-2 data from NOAA-15, -18, -19; MetOp-A, -B; and FY-3D. A warming trend was found in the AMSU-A window and tropospheric channels (1-9 and 15) and a cooling trend in stratospheric channels (10-14). The warming (cooling) trends of channels 7-9 (10) were relatively small. The warming (cooling) trends of AMSU-A channels 1-6 (14-15) were significantly reduced after the inter-decadal diurnal correction.

TI  - Multi-Scene Building Height Estimation Method Based on Shadow in High Resolution Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately building height estimation from remote sensing imagery is an important and challenging task. However, the existing shadow-based building height estimation methods have large errors due to the complex environment in remote sensing imagery. In this paper, we propose a multi-scene building height estimation method based on shadow in high resolution imagery. First, the shadow of building is classified and described by analyzing the features of building shadow in remote sensing imagery. Second, a variety of shadow-based building height estimation models is established in different scenes. In addition, a method of shadow regularization extraction is proposed, which can solve the problem of mutual adhesion shadows in dense building areas effectively. Finally, we propose a method for shadow length calculation combines with the fish net and the pauta criterion, which means that the large error caused by the complex shape of building shadow can be avoided. Multi-scene areas are selected for experimental analysis to prove the validity of our method. The experiment results show that the accuracy rate is as high as 96% within 2 m of absolute error of our method. In addition, we compared our proposed approach with the existing methods, and the results show that the absolute error of our method are reduced by 1.24 m-3.76 m, which can achieve high-precision estimation of building height.

TI  - Validation of FY-3D MERSI-2 Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) Datasets Using Ground-Based PWV Data from AERONET
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The medium resolution spectral imager-2 (MERSI-2) is one of the most important sensors onboard China's latest polar-orbiting meteorological satellite, Fengyun-3D (FY-3D). The National Satellite Meteorological Center of China Meteorological Administration has developed four precipitable water vapor (PWV) datasets using five near-infrared bands of MERSI-2, including the P905 dataset, P936 dataset, P940 dataset and the fusion dataset of the above three datasets. For the convenience of users, we comprehensively evaluate the quality of these PWV datasets with the ground-based PWV data derived from Aerosol Robotic Network. The validation results show that the P905, P936 and fused PWV datasets have relatively large systematic errors (-0.10, -0.11 and -0.07 g/cm(2)), whereas the systematic error of the P940 dataset (-0.02 g/cm(2)) is very small. According to the overall accuracy of these four PWV datasets by our assessments, they can be ranked in descending order as P940 dataset, fused dataset, P936 dataset and P905 dataset. The root mean square error (RMSE), relative error (RE) and percentage of retrieval results with error within +/-(0.05+0.10*PWVAERONET) (PER10) of the P940 PWV dataset are 0.24 g/cm(2), 0.10 and 76.36%, respectively. The RMSE, RE and PER10 of the P905 PWV dataset are 0.38 g/cm(2), 0.15 and 57.72%, respectively. In order to obtain a clearer understanding of the accuracy of these four MERSI-2 PWV datasets, we compare the accuracy of these four MERSI-2 PWV datasets with that of the widely used MODIS PWV dataset and AIRS PWV dataset. The results of the comparison show that the accuracy of the MODIS PWV dataset is not as good as that of all four MERSI-2 PWV datasets, due to the serious overestimation of the MODIS PWV dataset (0.40 g/cm(2)), and the accuracy of the AIRS PWV dataset is worse than that of the P940 and fused MERSI-2 PWV datasets. In addition, we analyze the error distribution of the four PWV datasets in different locations, seasons and water vapor content. Finally, the reason why the fused PWV dataset is not the one with the highest accuracy among the four PWV datasets is discussed.

TI  - Estimation of Evapotranspiration and Its Components across China Based on a Modified Priestley-Taylor Algorithm Using Monthly Multi-Layer Soil Moisture Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although soil moisture (SM) is an important constraint factor of evapotranspiration (ET), the majority of the satellite-driven ET models do not include SM observations, especially the SM at different depths, since its spatial and temporal distribution is difficult to obtain. Based on monthly three-layer SM data at a 0.25 degrees spatial resolution determined from multi-sources, we updated the original Priestley Taylor-Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) algorithm to the Priestley Taylor-Soil Moisture Evapotranspiration (PT-SM ET) algorithm by incorporating SM control into soil evaporation (E-s) and canopy transpiration (T). Both algorithms were evaluated using 17 eddy covariance towers across different biomes of China. The PT-SM ET model shows increased R-2, NSE and reduced RMSE, Bias, with more improvements occurring in water-limited regions. SM incorporation into T enhanced ET estimates by increasing R-2 and NSE by 4% and 18%, respectively, and RMSE and Bias were respectively reduced by 34% and 7 mm. Moreover, we applied the two ET algorithms to the whole of China and found larger increases in T and E-s in the central, northeastern, and southern regions of China when using the PT-SM algorithm compared with the original algorithm. Additionally, the estimated mean annual ET increased from the northwest to the southeast. The SM constraint resulted in higher transpiration estimate and lower evaporation estimate. E-s was greatest in the northwest arid region, interception was a large fraction in some rainforests, and T was dominant in most other regions. Further improvements in the estimation of ET components at high spatial and temporal resolution are likely to lead to a better understanding of the water movement through the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum.

TI  - Effects of Assimilating Clear-Sky FY-3D MWHS2 Radiance on the Numerical Simulation of Tropical Storm Ampil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new advanced microwave humidity sounder FY-3D MWHS2 radiance has been assimilated under the clear-sky conditions by implementing its data assimilation interface. The case of the tropical storm Ampil in 2018 is selected to address the effectiveness of the new-built module in the initialization and forecast of typhoons. Apart from the experiment assimilating both the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) data and the FY-3D MWHS2 radiance data, an experiment with only GTS data is also conducted for comparison. The results show that the bias correction of this humidity sounder is effective, and the analysis field after assimilating its radiance data matches well with the observation. The increment of specific humidity below the middle layers is evident after the assimilation of the radiance data. Besides, the geopotential height increment and the specific humidity increment at 500 hPa and 850 hPa, respectively, are favorable, resulting in more accurate rain belt distribution and a higher fraction skill score (FSS). In the deterministic forecast, the track error of the FY-3D MWHS2 experiment is consistently less than 90 km.

TI  - A Cross-Direction and Progressive Network for Pan-Sharpening
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a cross-direction and progressive network, termed CPNet, to solve the pan-sharpening problem. The full processing of information is the main characteristic of our model, which is reflected as follows: on the one hand, we process the source images in a cross-direction manner to obtain the source images of different scales as the input of the fusion modules at different stages, which maximizes the usage of multi-scale information in the source images; on the other hand, the progressive reconstruction loss is designed to boost the training of our network and avoid partial inactivation, while maintaining the consistency of the fused result with the ground truth. Since the extraction of the information from the source images and the reconstruction of the fused image is based on the entire image rather than a single type of information, there is little loss of partial spatial or spectral information due to insufficient information processing. Extensive experiments, including qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our model can maintain more spatial and spectral information compared to the state-of-the-art pan-sharpening methods.

TI  - Ship Classification in SAR Images With Geometric Transfer Metric Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are still many challenges to be resolved in the task of ship classification in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, such as limited number of labeled samples in SAR domain, large variance in the same subcategory, small variance among different subcategories, etc. Transfer metric learning (TML) has the potential to mitigate those issues in the domain of interest (target domain, TD) by leveraging knowledge/information from other related domains (source domain, SD). In this article, we proposed a novel TML method, termed as geometric transfer metric learning (GTML), which achieves discriminative information preservation (DIP), geometric structure preservation (GSP), and handles the domain shift (DS) simultaneously by integrating pairwise constraints (PC), joint distribution adaptation (JDA), and manifold regularization (MR) into a unified optimization function, aiming to make full use of their complementarity to improve SAR ship classification performance. In practice, we proposed two simple but effective optimization strategies, termed as GTML-A and GTML-R, to construct optimization function. We also proposed two solutions for two typical real-world application scenarios, that is, the task of: 1) zero-labeled sample (ZLS) and 2) scarce-labeled samples (SLS) in SAR domain. The experiments conducted on both tasks show that the proposed GTML outperforms most of state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Poverty Mapping in the Dian-Gui-Qian Contiguous Extremely Poor Area of Southwest China Based on Multi-Source Geospatial Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on the spatial distribution of poverty is of great significance to the formulation and implementation of the government's targeted poverty alleviation policy. Traditional poverty mapping is mainly based on household survey data and statistical data, which cannot describe the spatial distribution of poverty well. This paper presents a study of mapping the integrated poverty index (IPI) in the Dian-Gui-Qian contiguous extremely poor area of southwest China. Based on multiple independent spatial variables extracted from NPP/VIIRS nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing data, digital elevation model (DEM), land cover information, open street map, and city accessibility data, eight algorithms were employed and compared to determine the optimal model for IPI estimation. Among these machine learning algorithms, traditional multiple linear regression had the lowest accuracy compared with the other seven machine learning algorithms and XGBoost showed the best performance. Feature selection was performed to reduce overfitting and five variables were finally selected. The final developed XGBoost model achieved an MAE of 0.0454 and an R2 of 0.68. The IPI map derived from the developed XGBoost model characterized the spatial pattern of poverty in the Dian-Gui-Qian contiguous extremely poor area well, which provided a good reference for the poverty alleviation work and public resources allocation in the study area. This study can also serve as a template for poverty mapping in other areas using remote sensing data.

TI  - Burned Area Mapping over the Southern Cape Forestry Region, South Africa Using Sentinel Data within GEE Cloud Platform
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Planted forests in South Africa have been affected by an increasing number of economically damaging fires over the past four decades. They constitute a major threat to the forestry industry and account for over 80% of the country's commercial timber losses. Forest fires are more frequent and severe during the drier drought conditions that are typical in South Africa. For proper forest management, accurate detection and mapping of burned areas are required, yet the exercise is difficult to perform in the field because of time and expense. Now that ready-to-use satellite data are freely accessible in the cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE), in this study, we exploit the Sentinel-2-derived differenced normalized burned ratio (dNBR) to characterize burn severity areas, and also track carbon monoxide (CO) plumes using Sentinel-5 following a wildfire that broke over the southeastern coast of the Western Cape province in late October 2018. The results showed that 37.4% of the area was severely burned, and much of it occurred in forested land in the studied area. This was followed by 24.7% of the area that was burned at a moderate-high level. About 15.9% had moderate-low burned severity, whereas 21.9% was slightly burned. Random forests classifier was adopted to separate burned class from unburned and achieved an overall accuracy of over 97%. The most important variables in the classification included texture, NBR, and the NIR bands. The CO signal sharply increased during fire outbreaks and marked the intensity of black carbon over the affected area. Our study contributes to the understanding of forest fire in the dynamics over the Southern Cape forestry landscape. Furthermore, it also demonstrates the usefulness of Sentinel-5 for monitoring CO. Taken together, the Sentinel satellites and GEE offer an effective tool for mapping fires, even in data-poor countries.

TI  - Radiometric Normalization for Cross-Sensor Optical Gaofen Images with Change Detection and Chi-Square Test
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the number of cross-sensor images increases continuously, the surface reflectance of these images is inconsistent at the same ground objects due to different revisit periods and swaths. The surface reflectance consistency between cross-sensor images determines the accuracy of change detection, classification, and land surface parameter inversion, which is the most widespread application. We proposed a relative radiometric normalization (RRN) method to improve the surface reflectance consistency based on the change detection and chi-square test. The main contribution was that a novel chi-square test automatically extracts the stably unchanged samples between the reference and subject images from the unchanged regions detected by the change-detection method. We used the cross-senor optical images of Gaofen-1 and Gaofen-2 to test this method and four metrics to quantitatively evaluate the RRN performance, including the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), spectral angle cosine, structural similarity, and CIEDE2000 color difference. Four metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RRN method, especially the reduced percentage of RMSE after normalization was more than 80%. Comparing the radiometric differences of five ground features, the surface reflectance curve of two Gaofen images showed more minor differences after normalization, and the RMSE was smaller than 50 with the reduced percentages of about 50-80%. Moreover, the unchanged feature regions are detected by the change-detection method from the bitemporal Sentinel-2 images, which can be used for RRN without detecting changes in subject images. In addition, extracting samples with the chi-square test can effectively improve the surface reflectance consistency.

TI  - Genome-Wide Identification of <i>heat shock protein 10/60</i> Genes in Japanese Flounder (<i>Paralichthys olivaceus</i>) and Their Regulated Expression After Bacterial Infection
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat shock proteins 10/60 (hsp10/60) are a family of conserved ubiquitously expressed heat shock proteins which are produced by cells in response to exposure to stressful conditions. Besides the chaperone and housekeeping functions, they are also known to be involved in immune response during bacterial infection. In this study, we identified and annotated 10 hsp10/60 genes through bioinformatic analysis in Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Among them one member of hsp10 (hspe) family and nine members of hsp60 (hspd) family were identified. Phylogenetic and selection pressure analysis showed that the hsp10/60 genes were evolutionarily constrained and their function was conserved. Besides, hsp10/60 genes were involved in different embryonic and larval stages and acted as the sentinel role in an unchallenged organism. In addition, we also observed the expression patterns of hsp10/60 genes after Edwardsiella tarda infection, for the first time in Japanese flounder. Eight out of 10 genes were differentially expressed after bacterial challenges, the significantly regulated expressions of flounder hsp10/60 genes after bacterial infections suggested their involvement in immune response in flounder. Our results provide valuable information for clarifying the evolutionary relationship, and early insights of the immune functions of hsp10/60 genes in Japanese flounder.

M3  - Article
AB  - Factors such as low spatial resolution and material heterogeneity result in the issue of mixed pixels in images, which makes pixel-level data processing and applications unable to meet the practical requirements. Spectral unmixing extracts information of endmembers and abundances at the sub-pixel level and offers technical support for fine quantitative analysis of data in real applications. This paper introduces research advances of spectral unmixing theories, methods, and applications in recent years. Technical research results include linear and nonlinear mixture models, and methods under the principle frameworks of geometry, regularized optimization, and statistical machine learning. Moreover, improvements provided by spectral unmixing for other techniques such as classification, and theoretical and practical values of spectral unmixing in handling problems from remote sensing to indoor applications such as medical science arc analyzed. Finally, drawbacks in spectral unmixing technical and application researches and the necessity of their synergistic development arc summarized.

TI  - Seasonal evolution of supraglacial lakes and rivers on the southwest Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial lakes and rivers dominate the storage and transport of meltwater on the southwest Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) surface. Despite functioning as interconnected hydrologic networks, supraglacial lakes and rivers are commonly studied as independent features, resulting in an incomplete understanding of their collective impact on meltwater storage and routing. We use Landsat 8 satellite imagery to assess the seasonal evolution of supraglacial lakes and rivers on the southwest GrIS during the 2015 melt season. Remotely sensed meltwater areas and volumes are compared with surface runoff simulations from three climate models (MERRA-2, MAR 3.6 and RACMO 2.3), and with in situ observations of proglacial discharge in the Watson River. We find: (1) at elevations >1600 m, 21% of supraglacial lakes and 28% of supraglacial rivers drain into moulins, signifying the presence of high-elevation surface-to-bed meltwater connections even during a colder-than-average melt season; (2) while supraglacial lakes dominate instantaneous surface meltwater storage, supraglacial rivers dominate total surface meltwater area and discharge; (3) the combined surface area of supraglacial lakes and rivers is strongly correlated with modeled surface runoff; and (4) of the three models examined here, MERRA-2 runoff yields the highest overall correlation with observed proglacial discharge in the Watson River.

TI  - Variation in Vegetation and Its Driving Force in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River in China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal and spatial characteristics of vegetation in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (MRYR) were analyzed from 1999 to 2015 by trend analysis, co-integration analysis, partial correlation analysis, and spatial analysis using MODIS-NDVI time series remote sensing data. The average NDVI of the MRYR increased from 0.72 to 0.80, and nearly two-thirds of the vegetation showed a significant trend of improvement. At the inter-annual scale, the relationship between NDVI and meteorological factors was not significant in most areas. At the inter-monthly scale, NDVI was almost significantly correlated with precipitation, relative humidity, and sunshine hours, and the effect of precipitation and sunshine hours on NDVI showed a pronounced lag. When the altitude was less than 2500 m, NDVI increased with elevation. NDVI increased gradually as the slope increased and decreased gradually as the slope aspect changed from north to south. NDVI decreased as the population density and per capita GDP increased and was significantly positively correlated with afforestation policy. These findings provide new insights into the effects of climate change and human activities on vegetation growth.

TI  - Measuring the patterns of urban spatial growth of coastal cities in developing countries by geospatial metrics
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of the paper is to understand the spatial behavior and structure of coastal cities based on their socioeconomic development levels quantitatively. The geospatial metrics were used to describe the urban growth patterns in cities of Izmir, Kocaeli, Antalya, Tekirdag, Mersin, Samsun, canakkale, Giresun, and Sinop in Turkey. The land-use data was obtained from satellite imagery of 1987s, 2000s, and 2015s. The results indicate that as the socioeconomic level of coastal cities increases, urban patterns become more complex and their centrality decreases. The linear growth along the road increases, while the linear growth along coast is decreasing. While the coastal city in the lower-level development has more dynamic behavior, the one in upper-level development has stabilized effects. The density, as a key policy indicator in urban spatial growth, has impressively contributed to the interpretation of the spatial behaviors. The results are significant for decision-makers to support appropriate strategies for sustainable land use and rethinking land use policies of coastal cities.

TI  - PLC-C: An Integrated Method for Sentinel-2 Topographic and Angular Normalization
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Topographic and angular corrections on Sentinel-2 imagery are crucial for the generation of consistent surface reflectance. We propose a novel topographic-angular integrated normalization approach based on the combination of the path length correction (PLC) and C-factor approaches. The PLC-C normalization approach is a semiphysical method with limited use of auxiliary data: only a digital elevation model and a fixed set of kernel coefficients, ensuring its transferability for operational implementation. For the validation, we used two Sentinel-2A images over a mountainous area observed in backward (BS) and forward scattering (FS) directions from laterally adjacent orbit swaths. PLC-C significantly reduced both the topographic and directional anisotropy effects: the overlapping ratio between BS and FS observations was increased from 84.1% to 92.8% for the near-infrared band, and from 81.0% to 93.1% for the red band; the coefficient of variation of the reflectances across different aspects, which was used as a criterion of topographic effects, was reduced from 9.8%/12.2% to 3.6%/5.7% in BS/FS direction for the near-infrared band, and from 8.1%/9.7% to 4.5%/4.2% for the red band. PLC-C will contribute to the generation of analysis ready data from Sentinel-2 top of canopy reflectance.

TI  - Predictors of Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Postoperatively Upgraded Invasive Breast Carcinoma Patients
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Routine sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) is not necessary for breast-conserving surgery (BCS)-treated ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) but is indicated for underestimated invasive carcinoma (IC) postoperatively. In this retrospective study, we aimed to investigate the factors contributing to SLN metastasis in underestimated IC patients with an initial diagnosis of DCIS by core needle biopsy. We found that only the features related to IC, including an IC tumor size (>0.5 cm) and the presence of LVI, could be used as risk predictors of SLN metastasis. In the absence of any predictors, the incidence of positive SLNs was very low (2.6%) in the total population and extremely low (1.3%) in the BCS subgroup. Therefore, we suggest that SLNB may be omitted in patients who initially underwent BCS without risk predictors on final pathological assessment. However, further prospective studies are warranted before its clinical application. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) usually need not be simultaneously performed with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for patients diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) by preoperative core needle biopsy (CNB), but must be performed once there is invasive carcinoma (IC) found postoperatively. This study aimed to investigate the factors contributing to SLN metastasis in underestimated IC patients with an initial diagnosis of DCIS by CNB. We retrospectively reviewed 1240 consecutive cases of DCIS by image-guided CNB from January 2010 to December 2017 and identified 316 underestimated IC cases with SLNB. Data on clinical characteristics, radiologic features, and final pathological findings were examined. Twenty-three patients (7.3%) had SLN metastasis. Multivariate analysis indicated that an IC tumor size > 0.5 cm (odds ratio: 3.11, p = 0.033) and the presence of lymphovascular invasion (odds ratio: 32.85, p < 0.0001) were independent risk predictors of SLN metastasis. In the absence of any predictors, the incidence of positive SLNs was very low (2.6%) in the total population and extremely low (1.3%) in the BCS subgroup. Therefore, omitting SLNB may be an acceptable option for patients who initially underwent BCS without risk predictors on final pathological assessment. Further prospective studies are necessary before clinical application.

TI  - Remote Sensing Assessment of Marine Primary Productivity and Fishery Resources in the Daya Bay, China
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine primary productivity (PP) is closely related with fishery resources. This study benefited a lot by providing the reference for the use of remote sensing data to inverse PP and then to assess fishery resources in typical offshore fishery waters. The paper adopted the inversion analysis of the primary productivity (PP) in the Daya Bay, China applying the vertical generalized production model (VGPM) with ocean color and sea surface temperature (SST) provided by MODIS-Aqua. On the basis of modified VGPM model, fishery resources in the Daya Bay were evaluated according to the Tait model, Cushing model, and trophic dynamics model. Results showed that the seasonal variation of PP was obvious in the bay, the average PP reached the highest in summer (1595.60 mg C.m(-2).d(-1)) and the second in autumn (1274.67 mg C.m(-2).d(-1)). The space distribution of PP decreased gradually from nearshore (greater than 1000 mg C.m(-2).d(-1)) to offshore and outside (800 similar to 1000 mg C.m(-2).d(-1)) of the bay. As one of the most significant influencing factors to PP, chlorophyll a (Chl-a) showed similar characteristics of spatiotemporal distribution. Comparing results of different estimation models, it was found that density of fishery resources assessed by Cushing model matched well with the in-situ investigation data of fishery resources. Marine primary productivity and fishery resources in the Daya Bay were mainly influenced by Chl-a distribution, cage culture and petrochemical sewage (Liu, 2011).

TI  - Satellite-Derived Estimation of Grassland Aboveground Biomass in the Three-River Headwaters Region of China during 1982-2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term estimation of grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) is important for grassland resource management in the Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR) of China. Due to the lack of reliable grassland AGB datasets since the 1980s, the long-term spatiotemporal variation in grassland AGB in the TRHR remains unclear. In this study, we estimated AGB in the grassland of 209,897 km(2) using advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR), MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), meteorological, ancillary data during 1982-2018, and 75 AGB ground observations in the growth period of 2009 in the TRHR. To enhance the spatial representativeness of ground observations, we firstly upscaled the grassland AGB using a gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) model from ground observations to a 1 km spatial resolution via MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), meteorological and ancillary data, and the model produced validation results with a coefficient of determination (R-2) equal to 0.76, a relative mean square error (RMSE) equal to 88.8 g C m(-2), and a bias equal to -1.6 g C m(-2) between the ground-observed and MODIS-derived upscaled AGB. Then, we upscaled grassland AGB using the same model from a 1 km to 5 km spatial resolution via AVHRR NDVI and the same data as previously mentioned with the validation accuracy (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 57.8 g C m(-2), and bias = -0.1 g C m(-2)) between the MODIS-derived reference and AVHRR-derived upscaled AGB. The annual trend of grassland AGB in the TRHR increased by 0.37 g C m(-2) (p < 0.05) on average per year during 1982-2018, which was mainly caused by vegetation greening and increased precipitation. This study provided reliable long-term (1982-2018) grassland AGB datasets to monitor the spatiotemporal variation in grassland AGB in the TRHR.

TI  - Quantifying Urban Vegetation Dynamics from a Process Perspective Using Temporally Dense Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban vegetation can be highly dynamic due to the complexity of different anthropogenic drivers. Quantifying such dynamics is crucially important as it is a prerequisite to understanding its social and ecological consequences. Previous studies have mostly focused on the urban vegetation dynamics through monotonic trends analysis in certain intervals, but not considered the process which provides important insights for urban vegetation management. Here, we developed an approach that integrates trends with dynamic analysis to measure the vegetation dynamics from the process perspective based on the time-series Landsat imagery and applied it in Shenzhen, a coastal megacity in southern China, as an example. Our results indicated that Shenzhen was turning green from 2000-2020, even though a large-scale urban expansion occurred during this period. Approximately half of the city (49.5%) showed consistent trends in greening, most of which were located in the areas within the ecological protection baseline. We also found that 35.3% of the Shenzhen city experienced at least a one-time change in urban greenness that was mostly caused by changes in land cover types (e.g., vegetation to developed land). Interestingly, 61.5% of these lands showed trends in greening in the recent change period and most of them were distributed in build-up areas. Our approach that integrates trends analysis and dynamic process reveals information that cannot be discovered by monotonic trends analysis alone, and such information can provide insights for urban vegetation planning and management.

TI  - Cloud Detection Using an Ensemble of Pixel-Based Machine Learning Models Incorporating Unsupervised Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing imagery, such as that provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat satellites, has been widely used to study environmental protection, hazard analysis, and urban planning for decades. Clouds are a constant challenge for such imagery and, if not handled correctly, can cause a variety of issues for a wide range of remote sensing analyses. Typically, cloud mask algorithms use the entire image; in this study we present an ensemble of different pixel-based approaches to cloud pixel modeling. Based on four training subsets with a selection of different input features, 12 machine learning models were created. We evaluated these models using the cropped LC8-Biome cloud validation dataset. As a comparison, Fmask was also applied to the cropped scene Biome dataset. One goal of this research is to explore a machine learning modeling approach that uses as small a training data sample as possible but still provides an accurate model. Overall, the model trained on the sample subset (1.3% of the total training samples) that includes unsupervised Self-Organizing Map classification results as an input feature has the best performance. The approach achieves 98.57% overall accuracy, 1.18% cloud omission error, and 0.93% cloud commission error on the 88 cropped test images. By comparison to Fmask 4.0, this model improves the accuracy by 10.12% and reduces the cloud omission error by 6.39%. Furthermore, using an additional eight independent validation images that were not sampled in model training, the model trained on the second largest subset with an additional five features has the highest overall accuracy at 86.35%, with 12.48% cloud omission error and 7.96% cloud commission error. This model's overall correctness increased by 3.26%, and the cloud omission error decreased by 1.28% compared to Fmask 4.0. The machine learning cloud classification models discussed in this paper could achieve very good performance utilizing only a small portion of the total training pixels available. We showed that a pixel-based cloud classification model, and that as each scene obviously has unique spectral characteristics, and having a small portion of example pixels from each of the sub-regions in a scene can improve the model accuracy significantly.

TI  - Secchi depth inversion and its temporal and spatial variation analysis-A case study of nine plateau lakes in Yunnan Province of China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Secchi depth (SD) can directly reflect the state of lake water quality, and it is the key to control and improve the lake environment at mastering long-term and large-scale. In this research, deep neural networks algorithm was used to derive SD of 9 major plateau lakes in Yunnan Province from January 2001 to December 2018 based on MODIS remote sensing images, and explored the spatial-temporal variation characteristics with SD by geospatial analysis. The results showed that: (1) The inversion model proposed in this paper had a good performance (RMSE = 0.1359, MAE = 0.1134), which can objectively reflect SD status in the lake. (2) The temporal variation characteristics showed that SD of all lakes has a downward trend with a mean comprehensive change rate of -0.25 m/decade. (3) The spatial variation characteristics showed that the region of higher SD has a larger decline rate, and the trend in the region with lower SD was relatively stable. SD near urban and residential areas was relatively low, and declined fast. (4) Human activities would become an important factor to affect SD changes in the plateau lakes of Yunnan Province, and it was also the main factor causing lake pollution in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.

TI  - Subsidence Monitoring Base on SBAS-InSAR and Slope Stability Analysis Method for Damage Analysis in Mountainous Mining Subsidence Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface subsidence caused by coal mining has a great impact on the geological and ecological environments and causes damage to houses, roads, and industrial buildings. In order to understand the subsidence pattern in the mountainous mining regions, three mining faces of the Zhangjiamao mining area in the north of Shaanxi province, northwestern China are taken as case study. Firstly, the small baseline subset (SBAS) technology is used to process 12 images obtained in the mining area to investigate the subsidence data from December 2019 to April 2020. The boundary of surface deformation of the mining area interpreted by the SBAS-InSAR technology is inconsistent with the theoretical boundary suggested by coal mine subsidence theories. Especially, there are some areas in which the real subsidence are larger than estimated area. This discrepancy must be corrected as steep slopes near the theoretical boundary may increase the likelihood of landslides. Our research indicates that: (1) The accumulated displacement and the maximum deformation rate reached -120.759 mm and -270.012 mm/yr in the study area, and the subsidence boundary of the three mining faces is revealed; (2) the combination of the predicted boundary and slope stability analysis can effectively identify the landslide region at the edge of subsidence boundary; (3) the field surveys have proved the effectiveness of this method. The mining area subsidence revealed by our research helps to further understand the impact of land subsidence caused by mining in the mountainous areas and provides a practical method to predict subsidence boundaries and the likelihood for landslides.

TI  - A Preliminary Geothermal Prospectivity Mapping Based on Integrated GIS, Remote-Sensing, and Geophysical Techniques around Northeastern Nigeria
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial mapping of potential geothermal areas is an effective tool for a preliminary investigation and the development of a clean and renewable energy source around the globe. Specific locations within the Earth's crust display some manifestations of sub-surface geothermal occurrences, such as hot springs, a volcanic plug, mud volcanoes, and hydrothermal alterations, that need to be investigated further. The present area of investigations also reveals some of these manifestations. However, no attempt was made to examine the prospectivity of this terrain using the efficient GIS-based multicriteria evaluation (MCE) within the scope of the Analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The integration of remote sensing, Geographic information system (GIS), and other geophysical methods (Magnetic and gravity) was performed to map the promising geothermal areas. Multiple input data sets such as aero-magnetic, aero-gravity, aero-radiometric, digital elevation model (DEM), geological map, and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data were selected, processed, and use to generate five thematic layers, which include heat flow, temperature gradients, integrated lineaments, residual gravity, and lithology maps. The five thematic layers were standardized and synthesized into a geothermal prospectivity map. The respective ranks and weight of the thematic layers and their classes were assigned based on expert opinion and knowledge of the local geology. This research aims to apply an efficient method to evaluate the factors influencing the geothermal energy prospects, identify and map prospective geothermal regions, and, finally, create a geothermal prospectivity model.

TI  - Optimization of Modelling Population Density Estimation Based on Impervious Surfaces
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Population data are key indicators of policymaking, public health, and land use in urban and ecological systems; however, traditional censuses are time-consuming, expensive, and laborious. This study proposes a method of modelling population density estimations based on remote sensing data in Hefei. Four models with impervious surface (IS), night light (NTL), and point of interest (POI) data as independent variables are constructed at the township scale, and the optimal model was applied to pixels to obtain a finer population density distribution. The results show that: (1) impervious surface (IS) data can be effectively extracted by the linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) method; (2) there is a high potential of the multi-variable model to estimate the population density, with an adjusted R-2 of 0.832, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.420 from 10-fold cross validation recorded; (3) downscaling the predicted population density from the township scale to pixels using the multi-variable stepwise regression model achieves a more refined population density distribution. This study provides a promising method for the rapid and effective prediction of population data in interval years, and data support for urban planning and population management.

More specifically, the focus was on the possibility that the associations these social worldviews had with attitudes toward peace may be mediated by the ideological attitudes of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation as well as the perceived threat from the Palestinians in a large community sample of Israelis (N = 1,236). The results of a serial parallel multiple mediation analysis revealed partial support for our hypotheses. As expected, the association that the dangerous social worldview had with attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians was mediated by right-wing authoritarianism and perceived threat from the Palestinians. However, the association that the competitive social worldview had with attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians differed from our expectations. More specifically, the competitive social worldview had a negative indirect association with attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians through both right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation but there was also an unexpected positive indirect association through perceived threat from the Palestinians. Discussion focuses on the implications of these results for understanding the roles that ideological attitudes and perceived threat may play in the connections between the social worldviews of Israelis and their attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Organic Carbon Contents in Croplands of Bavaria from SCMaP Soil Reflectance Composites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For food security issues or global climate change, there is a growing need for large-scale knowledge of soil organic carbon (SOC) contents in agricultural soils. To capture and quantify SOC contents at a field scale, Earth Observation (EO) can be a valuable data source for area-wide mapping. The extraction of exposed soils from EO data is challenging due to temporal or permanent vegetation cover, the influence of soil moisture or the condition of the soil surface. Compositing techniques of multitemporal satellite images provide an alternative to retrieve exposed soils and to produce a data source. The repeatable soil composites, containing averaged exposed soil areas over several years, are relatively independent from seasonal soil moisture and surface conditions and provide a new EO-based data source that can be used to estimate SOC contents over large geographical areas with a high spatial resolution. Here, we applied the Soil Composite Mapping Processor (SCMaP) to the Landsat archive between 1984 and 2014 of images covering Bavaria, Germany. Compared to existing SOC modeling approaches based on single scenes, the 30-year SCMaP soil reflectance composite (SRC) with a spatial resolution of 30 m is used. The SRC spectral information is correlated with point soil data using different machine learning algorithms to estimate the SOC contents in cropland topsoils of Bavaria. We developed a pre-processing technique to address the issue of combining point information with EO pixels for the purpose of modeling. We applied different modeling methods often used in EO soil studies to choose the best SOC prediction model. Based on the model accuracies and performances, the Random Forest (RF) showed the best capabilities to predict the SOC contents in Bavaria (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 1.24%, RPD = 1.77, CCC = 0.78). We further validated the model results with an independent dataset. The comparison between the measured and predicted SOC contents showed a mean difference of 0.11% SOC using the best RF model. The SCMaP SRC is a promising approach to predict the spatial SOC distribution over large geographical extents with a high spatial resolution (30 m).

TI  - Monitoring Land Use Changes and Their Future Prospects Using GIS and ANN-CA for Perak River Basin, Malaysia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural landscapes have changed significantly through anthropogenic activities, particularly in areas that are severely impacted by climate change and population expansion, such as countries in Southeast Asia. It is essential for sustainable development, particularly efficient water management practices, to know about the impact of land use and land cover (LULC) changes. Geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing were used for monitoring land use changes, whereas artificial neural network cellular automata (ANN-CA) modeling using quantum geographic information systems (QGIS) was performed for prediction of LULC changes. This study investigated the changes in LULC in the Perak River basin for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020. The study also provides predictions of future changes for the years 2030, 2040, and 2050. Landsat satellite images were utilized to monitor the land use changes. For the classification of Landsat images, maximum-likelihood supervised classification was implemented. The broad classification defines four main classes in the study area, including (i) waterbodies, (ii) agricultural lands, (iii) barren and urban lands, and (iv) dense forests. The outcomes revealed a considerable reduction in dense forests from the year 2000 to 2020, whereas a substantial increase in barren lands (up to 547.39 km(2)) had occurred by the year 2020, while urban land use has seen a rapid rise. The kappa coefficient was used to assess the validity of classified images, with an overall kappa coefficient of 0.86, 0.88, and 0.91 for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020, respectively. In addition, ANN-CA simulation results predicted that barren and urban lands will expand in the future at the expense of other classes in the years 2030, 2040, and 2050. However, a considerable decrease will occur in the area of dense forests in the simulated years. The study successfully presents LULC changes and future predictions highlighting significant pattern of land use change in the Perak River basin. This information could be helpful for land use administration and future planning in the region.

TI  - Understanding Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Land Use/Land Cover Change under Urbanization in Wuhan, China, 2000-2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring land use structure and dynamics is critical for urban planning and management. This study attempts to understand the Wuhan development mode since the beginning of the 21st century by profoundly investigating the spatio-temporal patterns of land use/land cover (LULC) change under urbanization in Wuhan, China, from 2000 to 2019, based on continuous time series mapping using Landsat observations with a support vector machine. The results indicated rapid urbanization, with large LULC changes triggered. The built-up area increased by 982.66 km(2) (228%) at the expense of a reduction of 717.14 km(2) (12%) for cropland, which threatens food security to some degree. In addition, the natural habitat shrank to some extent, with reductions of 182.52 km(2), 23.92 km(2) and 64.95 km(2) for water, forest and grassland, respectively. Generally, Wuhan experienced a typical urbanization course that first sped up, then slowed down and then accelerated again, with an obvious internal imbalance between the 13 administrative districts. Hanyang, Hongshan and Dongxihu specifically presented more significant land dynamicity, with Hanyang being the active center. Over the past 19 years, Wuhan mainly developed toward the east and south, with the urban gravity center transferred from the northwest to the southeast of Jiang'an district. Lastly, based on the predicted land allocation of Wuhan in 2029 by the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model, the future landscape dynamic pattern was further explored, and the result shows a rise in the northern suburbs, which provides meaningful guidance for urban planners and managers to promote urban sustainability.

TI  - Use of Multiplatform SAR Imagery in Mining Deformation Monitoring with Dense Vegetation Coverage: A Case Study in the Fengfeng Mining Area, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground deformation related to mining activities may occur immediately or many years later, leading to a series of mine geological disasters, such as ground fissures, collapses, and even mining earthquakes. Deformation monitoring has been carried out with techniques, such as multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MTInSAR). Over the past decade, MTInSAR has been widely used in monitoring mining deformation, and it is still difficult to retrieve mining deformation over dense vegetation areas. In this study, we use multiple-platform SAR images to retrieve mining deformation over dense vegetation areas. The high-quality interferograms are selected by the coherence map, and the mining deformation is retrieved by the MSBAS-InSAR technique. SAR images from TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1A, Radarsat-2, and PALSAR-2 over the Fengfeng mining area, Heibei, China, are used to retrieve the deformation of mining activities covered with dense vegetation. The results show that the subsidence in the Fengfeng mining area reaches up to 90 cm over the period from July 2015 to April 2016. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the results from InSAR and leveling is 83.5 mm/yr at two mining sites, i.e., Wannian and Jiulong Mines.

TI  - Using Multisource Satellite Data to Investigate Lake Area, Water Level, and Water Storage Changes of Terminal Lakes in Ungauged Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake area, water level, and water storage changes of terminal lakes are vital for regional water resource management and for understanding local hydrological processes. Nevertheless, due to the complex geographical conditions, it is difficult to investigate and analyze this change in ungauged regions. This study focuses on the ungauged, semi-arid Gahai Lake, a typical small terminal lake in the Qaidam Basin. In addition to the scant observed data, satellite altimetry is scarce for the excessively large fraction of outlier points. Here, we proposed an effective and simple algorithm for extracting available lake elevation points from CryoSat-2, ICESat-2 and Sentinel-3. Combining with the area data from Landsat, Gaofen (GF), and Ziyuan (ZY) satellites, we built an optimal hypsographic curve (lake area versus water level) based on the existing short-term data. Cross-validation was used to validate whether the curve accurately could predict the lake water level in other periods. In addition, we used multisource high-resolution images including Landsat and digital maps to extract the area data from 1975 to 2020, and we applied the curve to estimate the water level for the corresponding period. Additionally, we adopted the pyramidal frustum model (PFM) and the integral model (IM) to estimate the long-term water storage changes, and analyzed the differences between these two models. We found that there has been an obvious change in the area, water level, and water storage since the beginning of the 21st century, which reflects the impact of climate change and human activities on hydrologic processes in the basin. Importantly, agricultural activities have caused a rapid increase in water storage in the Gahai Lake over the past decade. We collected as much multisource satellite data as possible; thus, we estimated the long-term variations in the area, water level, and water storage of a small terminal lake combining multiple models, which can provide an effective method to monitor lake changes in ungauged basins.

TI  - Adaptive Threshold Model in Google Earth Engine: A Case Study of <i>Ulva prolifera</i> Extraction in the South Yellow Sea, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An outbreak of Ulva prolifera poses a massive threat to coastal ecology in the Southern Yellow Sea, China (SYS). It is a necessity to extract its area and monitor its development accurately. At present, Ulva prolifera monitoring by remote sensing imagery is mostly based on a fixed threshold or artificial visual interpretation for threshold selection, which has large errors. In this paper, an adaptive threshold model based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) is proposed and applied to extract U. prolifera in the SYS. The model first applies the Floating Algae Index (FAI) or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) algorithm on the preprocessed remote sensing images and then uses the Canny Edge Filter and Otsu threshold segmentation algorithm to extract the threshold automatically. The model is applied to Landsat8/OLI and Sentinel-2/MSI images, and the confusion matrix and cross-sensor comparison are used to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of the model. The verification results show that the model extraction of U. prolifera based on the FAI algorithm has higher accuracy (R-2 = 0.99, RMSE = 5.64) and better robustness. However, when the average cloud cover is more than 70% in the image (based on the statistical results of multi-year cloud cover information), the model based on the NDVI algorithm has better applicability and can extract the algae distributed at the edge of the cloud. When the model uses the FAI algorithm, it is named FAI-COM (model based on FAI, the Canny Edge Filter, and Otsu thresholding). And when the model uses the NDVI algorithm, it is named NDVI-COM (model based on NDVI, the Canny Edge Filter, and Otsu thresholding). Therefore, the final extraction results are generated by supplementing NDVI-COM results on the basis of FAI-COM extraction results in this paper. The F1-score of U. prolifera extracted results is above 0.85. The spatiotemporal distribution of U. prolifera in the South Yellow Sea from 2016 to 2020 is obtained through the model calculation. Overall, the coverage area of U. prolifera shows a decreasing trend over the five years. It is found that the delay in recovery time of Porphyra yezoensis culture facilities in the Northern Jiangsu Shoal and the manual salvage and cleaning-up of U. prolifera in May are among the reasons for the smaller interannual scale of algae in 2017 and 2018.

TI  - Combined Block Adjustment for Optical Satellite Stereo Imagery Assisted by Spaceborne SAR and Laser Altimetry Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To ensure the accuracy of large-scale optical stereo image bundle block adjustment, it is necessary to provide well-distributed ground control points (GCPs) with high accuracy. However, it is difficult to acquire control points through field measurements outside the country. Considering the high planimetric accuracy of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and the high elevation accuracy of satellite-based laser altimetry data, this paper proposes an adjustment method that combines both as control sources, which can be independent from GCPs. Firstly, the SAR digital orthophoto map (DOM)-based planar control points (PCPs) acquisition is realized by multimodal matching, then the laser altimetry data are filtered to obtain laser altimetry points (LAPs), and finally the optical stereo images' combined adjustment is conducted. The experimental results of Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3) images prove that this method can achieve an accuracy of 7 m in plane and 3 m in elevation after adjustment without relying on GCPs, which lays the technical foundation for a global-scale satellite image process.

TI  - Improving the snowpack monitoring in the mountainous areas of Sweden from space: a machine learning approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Under a warming climate, an improved understanding of the water stored in snowpacks is becoming increasingly important for hydropower planning, flood risk assessment and water resource management. Due to inaccessibility and a lack of ground measurement networks, accurate quantification of snow water storage in mountainous terrains still remains a major challenge. Remote sensing can provide dynamic observations with extensive spatial coverage, and has proved a useful means to characterize snow water equivalent (SWE) at a large scale. However, current SWE products show very low quality in the mountainous areas due to very coarse spatial resolution, complex terrain, large spatial heterogeneity and deep snow. With more high-quality satellite data becoming available from the development of satellite sensors and platforms, it provides more opportunities for better estimation of snow conditions. Meanwhile, machine learning provides an important technique for handling the big data offered from remote sensing. Using the overuman Catchment in Northern Sweden as a case study, this paper explores the potentials of machine learning for improving the estimation of mountain snow water storage using satellite observations, topographic factors, land cover information and ground SWE measurements from the spatially distributed snow survey. The results show that significantly improved SWE estimation close to the peak of snow accumulation can be achieved in the catchment using the random forest regression. This study demonstrates the potentials of machine learning for better understanding the snow water storage in mountainous areas.

TI  - Spectral analysis of seasonal rock and vegetation changes for detecting karst rocky desertification in southwest China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Karst rocky desertification (KRD) has become a major long-term problem for the ecological environment in karst areas of southwest China. The aim of this study was to monitor and evaluate the level of rocky desertification in Pingguo County, Guangxi Province, southwest China, by tracking the seasonal spectral changes in rock and vegetation cover. Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images and field measurements of karst areas were collected and a novel karst rocky desertification index (KRDI) was constructed as an indicator of rocky desertification based on greenness, humidity, and brightness. Then, the time-spectrum feature space (TSFS) model was used to determine the level of rocky desertification. The main findings were as follows. (1) KRDI is a good indicator of karst rocky desertification; the highest KRDI value was obtained for severe rocky desertification, followed by moderate rocky desertification, with slight rocky desertification exhibiting the lowest KRDI value. (2) KRDI values exhibited some differences in different seasons, with the lowest KRDI occurring in summer and the highest in winter. (3) The TSFS model can accurately monitor and identify different levels of rocky desertification. The selected key indicators performed well, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.90 and overall accuracy of 0.92. Therefore, the proposed index, combining spectral information with spatiotemporal information, is a promising method for extracting information on karst rocky desertification, with significant application potential for areas with similar geology.

TI  - Rapid Reclamation and Degradation of <i>Suaeda salsa</i> Saltmarsh along Coastal China's Northern Yellow Sea
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Suaeda salsa saltmarshes are an important coastal wetland habitat of China's northern Yellow Sea, which plays a critical role in sequestering carbon (blue carbon), protecting shorelines, maintaining biodiversity, and has substantial economic value (e.g., ecotourism). However, the area of S. salsa has been rapidly declining due to several different threats from reclamation and invasive species that impact its natural succession. Here, we map the changes in the distribution of the S. salsa saltmarshes along the northern Yellow Sea of China (NYSC) at 5-year intervals by applying the supervised maximum likelihood method to analyze Landsat images from 1988 to 2018 and investigate the potential impact of three important factors on habitat change by analyzing the temporal changes in S. salsa saltmarshes with other land covers. S. salsa saltmarsh areas have decreased by 63% (264 km(2) ha to 99 km(2)), and the average loss of S. salsa saltmarshes was 5.5 km(2)/year along the NYSC over the past three decades. There have been many dramatic declines in the two main distribution areas of S. salsa saltmarshes with a 77% loss of habitat area in Liaodong Bay (from 112 km(2) to 26 km(2)) and a 52% loss in the Yellow River Delta wetland-Guangli-Zhima estuarine wetland (from 137 km(2) to 65 km(2)). Land reclamation is the most important impact factor in the loss of S. salsa saltmarshes, while there have been limited effects of natural succession and smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) invasion. In light of the important ecological services and economic value of the S. salsa habitat, emergency conservation actions (e.g., habitat restoration, strictly supervision) are needed to limit the rapid habitat loss, which should include the immediate cessation of extensive land reclamation along the NYSC.

TI  - Sensitive Feature Evaluation for Soil Moisture Retrieval Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data with Few In-Situ Measurements: A Case Study of the Continental US
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays an important role for understanding Earth's land and near-surface atmosphere interactions. Existing studies rarely considered using multi-source data and their sensitiveness to SM retrieval with few in-situ measurements. To solve this issue, we designed a SM retrieval method (Multi-MDA-RF) using random forest (RF) based on 29 features derived from passive microwave remote sensing data, optical remote sensing data, land surface models (LSMs), and other auxiliary data. To evaluate the importance of different features to SM retrieval, we first compared 10 filter or embedded type feature selection methods with sequential forward selection (SFS). Then, RF was employed to establish a nonlinear relationship between the in-situ SM measurements from sparse network stations and the optimal feature subset. The experiments were conducted in the continental U.S. (CONUS) using in-situ measurements during August 2015, with only 5225 training samples covering the selected feature subset. The experimental results show that mean decrease accuracy (MDA) is better than other feature selection methods, and Multi-MDA-RF outperforms the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN), with the R and unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) values being 0.93 and 0.032 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. In comparison with other SM products, Multi-MDA-RF is more accurate and can well capture the SM spatial dynamics.

TI  - Mapping Regional Soil Organic Matter Based on Sentinel-2A and MODIS Imagery Using Machine Learning Algorithms and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have attempted to predict soil organic matter (SOM), whereas mapping high-precision and high-resolution SOM maps remains a challenge due to the difficulty of selecting appropriate satellite data sources and prediction algorithms. This study aimed to investigate the influence of different remotely sensed images and machine learning algorithms on SOM prediction. We constructed two comparative experiments, i.e., full-band and common-band variable datasets of Sentinel-2A and MODIS images using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The predictive performances of random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector regression (SVR) algorithms were evaluated, and the SOM map was generated for the Songnen Plain. Results showed that the model based on the full-band Sentinel-2A dataset achieved the best performance. The application of Sentinel-2A data resulted in mean relative improvements (RIs) of 7.67% and 5.87%, respectively. The RF achieved a lower root mean squared error (RMSE = 0.68%) and a higher coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.67) in all of the predicted scenarios than ANN and SVR. The resultant SOM map accurately characterized the SOM spatial distribution. Therefore, the Sentinel-2A data have obvious advantages over MODIS due to their higher spectral and spatial resolutions, and the combination of the RF algorithm and GEE is an effective approach to SOM mapping.

TI  - Combined Multi-Time Series SAR Imagery and InSAR Technology for Rice Identification in Cloudy Regions
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing technology to monitor farmland is currently the mainstream method for crop research. However, in cloudy and misty regions, the use of optical remote sensing image is limited. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology has many advantages, including high resolution, multi-mode, and multi-polarization. Moreover, it can penetrate clouds and mists, can be used for all-weather and all-time Earth observation, and is sensitive to the shape of ground objects. Therefore, it is widely used in agricultural monitoring. In this study, the polarization backscattering coefficient on time-series SAR images during the rice-growing period was analyzed. The rice identification results and accuracy of InSAR technology were compared with those of three schemes (single-time-phase SAR, multi-time-phase SAR, and combination of multi-time-phase SAR and InSAR). Results show that VV and VH polarization coherence coefficients can well distinguish artificial buildings. In particular, VV polarization coherence coefficients can well distinguish rice from water and vegetation in August and September, whereas VH polarization coherence coefficients can well distinguish rice from water and vegetation in August and October. The rice identification accuracy of single-time series Sentinel-1 SAR image (78%) is lower than that of multi-time series SAR image combined with InSAR technology (81%). In this study, Guanghan City, a cloudy region, was used as the study site, and a good verification result was obtained.

TI  - Impacts of atmospheric and oceanic factors on monthly and interannual variations of polynya in the East Siberian Sea and Chukchi Sea
T2  - ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As a key region of Northeast Passage, the polynya along the Siberian coast in the East Siberian and Chukchi Seas is important to local dynamic and thermodynamic processes, sea ice production and marine ecosystem. The detailed variations of polynya and the contributions of atmospheric and oceanic factors to the polynya have not been explored quantitatively. AMSR-E satellite data from January to April during the period 2003-2011 were used to study the impacts of wind stress and ocean heat transport on variations of polynya in the East Siberian Sea and Chukchi Sea. The study region was divided into six domains. Four sets of AMSR-E data with resolutions of 6.25 km and 12.5 km were compared based on two algorithms of sea ice concentration (referred to as 6.25 km-IC and 12.5 km-IC) and sea ice thickness (referred to as 6.25 km-h and 12.5 km-h). The monthly and yearly polynya areas in the four cases and six domains had remarkable differences. The two cases of 6.25 km-h and 12.5 km-h had larger areas of polynya than the other two cases of 6.25 km-IC and 12.5 km-IC. The difference in polynya area between the 6.25 km-h and 12.5 km-h cases was much smaller than the difference between the 6.25 km-IC and 12.5 km-IC cases. The study of atmospheric and oceanic mechanisms on polynya is influenced significantly by the sensitivity of polynya areas. In general, the impact of wind stress and ocean heat transport on the polynyas had noticeable monthly and interannual variations and was dependent on the locations of the polynyas. The alongshore and offshore wind had stronger correlations with the polynya area than ocean heat transport. Although the higher resolution (6.25 km) AMSR-E data are best for the study of atmospheric and oceanic impacts on polynya area, the coarse resolution (12.5 km) AMSR-E data based on sea ice thickness can also be used. Wind direction dominated the polynya area in the East Siberian Sea and wind speed dominated the polynya area in the Chukchi Sea. The variation in ocean heat transport was influenced mainly by variation in volume transport rather than variation in water temperature.

TI  - Efficient Building Extraction for High Spatial Resolution Images Based on Dual Attention Network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Building extraction with high spatial resolution images becomes an important research in the field of computer vision for urban-related applications. Due to the rich detailed information and complex texture features presented in high spatial resolution images, the distribution of buildings is non-proportional and their difference of scales is obvious. General methods often provide confusion results with other ground objects. In this paper, a building extraction framework based on deep residual neural network with a self-attention mechanism is proposed. This mechanism contains two parts: one is the spatial attention module, which is used to aggregate and relate the local and global features at each position (short and long distance context information) of buildings; the other is channel attention module, in which the representation of comprehensive features (in-cludes color, texture, geometric and high-level semantic feature) are improved. The combination of the dual attention modules makes buildings can be extracted from the complex backgrounds. The effectiveness of our method is validated by the experiments counted on a wide range high spatial resolution image, i.e., Jilin-1 Gaofen 02A imagery. Compared with some state-of-the-art segmentation methods, i.e., DeepLab-v3+, PSPNet, and PSANet algorithms, the proposed dual attention network-based method achieved high accuracy and intersection-over-union for extraction performance and show finest recognition integrity of buildings.

TI  - Dynamic Cooling Effects of Permanent Urban Green Spaces in Beijing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) play a critical role in human thermal comfort, energy consumption and urban ecology. Although the heat mitigation capability of UGSs has been frequently reported, many of the current understandings are based on short-term observations, and the long-term temporal dynamics of UGS cooling effects are still lacking. This gap may cause over- or underestimation and largely ignores how the cooling effects change with climate change and urban growth. Accordingly, we used Landsat-based time series data to analyze the changes in permanent UGS greenness, surface-cooling effects and their biophysical responses in Beijing in the past 40 years (1984-2020). The results demonstrate segmented changes in UGS surface cooling that were mainly linked to the responses of canopy transpiration and albedo to vegetation conditions. During a rapid greening of UGSs in the recent two decades, transpiration cooling dominated albedo-induced warming to provide a discernable cooling enhancement. In addition, such enhancement showed seasonal differences ranging from less than 1 degrees C to more than 2 degrees C, and the most evident enhancement occurred on summer days (similar to 2.4 degrees C) when vegetation is most needed to provide cooling. The highlighted dynamics of UGSs help urban planners better balance the maintenance costs and the environmental gains for UGS management.

TI  - Automated Rain Detection by Dual-Polarization Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rain Signatures on C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired over ocean are common and can dominate the backscattered signal from the ocean surface. In many cases, the inability to decipher between ocean and rain signatures can disturb the analysis of SAR scenes for maritime applications. This study relies on Sentinel-1 SAR acquisitions in the Interferometric Wide swath mode and high-resolution measurements from ground-based weather radar to document the rain impact on the radar backscattered signal in both co- and cross-polarization channels. The dark and bright rain signatures are found in connection with the timeliness of the rain cells. In particular, the bright patches are demonstrated by the hydrometeors (graupels, hails) in the melting layer. In general, the radar backscatter under rain increases with rain rate for a given sea state and decreases when the sea state strengthens. The rain also has a stronger impact on the radar signal in both polarizations when the incidence angle increases. The complementary sensitivity of the SAR signal of rain in both channels is then used to derive a filter to locate the areas in SAR scenes where the signal is not dominated by rain. The filter optimized to match the rain observed by the ground-based weather radar is more efficient when both polarization channels are considered. Case studies are presented to discuss the advantages and limitations of such a filtering approach.

TI  - Capability of Existing Drought Indices in Reflecting Agricultural Drought in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A variety of drought indices have been constructed to monitor agricultural drought using ground-based observations and satellite data. The drought indices focus on diverse aspects of agricultural drought and may have diverse applicability in different regions. We calculated seven popular drought indices and evaluated their performances on monitoring agricultural drought in the main agricultural regions of China (i.e., Northeast China, the North China Plain, the middle-and-lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the Sichuan Basin). The independent assessment data used here included three aspects: soil moisture, vegetation photosynthesis (i.e., sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, SIF), and crop yield. Results show that drought indices with one-month time scale are more sensitive to topsoil moisture than drought indices with longer time scales. Drought indices based on regular meteorological data (DImet) and synthesized drought indices (DIsyn) show better performances on capturing drought impacts on the SIF than other drought indices. DIsyn is more appropriate for predicting drought impact on crop yield than other drought indices. In addition, drought impact on vegetation photosynthesis and crop yield is lessened in humid or irrigated regions. Our study sheds light on agricultural drought researches in the future.Plain Language Summary Agricultural drought intensively affects crop growth and food security, and may be more severe under the global warming in the future. However, the different drought indices may bring in incomparable results because of inconsistent definitions of agricultural drought and different algorithms. Our study evaluated the capabilities of seven drought indices to detect drought impact in four major agricultural regions of China. Three aspects of agricultural drought were selected as assessment data: soil moisture, vegetation photosynthesis, and crop yield. Our results show that drought indices based on meteorological data generally show better performances in capturing drought impact, and incorporating abundant data sources will extend the applicability of drought indices to detect different aspects of agricultural drought impact. The impact of drought on vegetation is negligible in regions with humid climate or irrigation. This study shows the applicability of different types of drought indices to monitor agricultural drought impact in different regions, which is instructive for the applications of drought indices and the development of drought index in the future.

TI  - Simultaneously estimating surface soil moisture and roughness of bare soils by combining optical and radar data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Both radar and optical signals are sensitive to the change of surface soil moisture (SSM) and surface roughness properties (such as root mean squared height- RMSH), and the accuracy of retrieved SSM from single radar and optical remote sensing data is influenced by the spatiotemporal change of surface roughness. Here, we attempt to explore a method to simultaneously estimate SSM and RMSH of bare soil by combining optical and radar data, so as to weaken the effect of surface roughness on SSM inversion results. To achieve this goal, two satellite synchronous ground experiments were carried out, collecting 88 sampling plots each with an area of 50 m ? 50 m. Radar backscattering coefficient and spectral reflectance are uniformly corrected to a fixed observation direction and solar incident direction respectively, which can eliminate the difference of satellite signal resulted from various sun-satellite geometry. Combining radar backscattering and optical reflectance model, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data are used to simultaneously retrieve SSM and RMSH of bared soils, and some conclusions are given as below: 1) a strong correlation is observed for (radar and optical) satellite signals and soil surface parameters (SSM and RMSH); 2) a higher accuracy was obtained by the combined use of optical and radar data, indicated by the decreased root mean squared error of retrieved SSM (-0.045 cm3/cm3) and RMSH (-0.8 cm); 3) the further improvement of retrieved SSM and RMSH was achieved by introducing their initial values, revealing that the prior knowledge of soil properties is also beneficial to improve the retrieval accuracy. This study proposed an framework for simultaneous estimation of SSM and RMSH by combining optical and radar data, and its feasibility is verified by experimental data.

TI  - Analysis of Influencing Factors in Wheat/Maize Canopy RVI and NDVI Acquisition Using Ground-Based Remote Sensing System
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Implement ground-based remote sensing technology in a large-scale sprinkler irrigation system can monitor crop growth status and has played an important role in detecting of crop water and nutrient demands and field management of crop production. Crop canopy has bidirectional reflectance characteristics, so different observation methods used in ground-based remote sensing will affect the accuracy of canopy spectral reflectance measurement. This study used a self-built ground-based remote sensing system to simulate the field observation conditions of large sprinkler irrigation machinery, obtained spectral reflectance information of wheat and maize canopy through multi-spectral optical sensors, and quantified the variation of the crop canopy information data caused by the canopy bidirectional reflection characteristics by the coefficient of variation CV, and analyzed the effect of the observation conditions on the crop canopy spectral reflectance measurements through influence factor weight W. Reflectance in the red band (650 nm) and reflectance in the near-infrared band (810 nm) of winter wheat at regreening to filling growth stages and summer maize at V7 to V14 growth stages were measured and recorded in 2019 season. Effect of various observation factors on the ratio of vegetation index (RVI) and the normalized index of vegetation (NDVI) was analyzed. Results showed that the correlation of observation height in 0.5 similar to 2.5 m, observation frequency in 2 similar to 60 min(-1) and moving speed in 0 similar to 4 m.min(-1) with the measurements of the canopy spectral reflectance characteristics were not significant (p>0.05); observation time in 8:0018:00, observation zenith angle at -60 degrees similar to 60 degrees, and observation azimuth angle from 0 degrees to 180 degrees had an extremely significant correlation with the measurements (p<0.01). Results of canopy spectral reflectance measurement for wheat and maize depended mainly on the degree of the canopy coverage. Under the same leaf area index (LAI), the canopy spectral reflectance would also be affected by the observation time, observation azimuth and observation zenith angle: canopy spectral reflectance had significant bidirectional reflection characteristics. In wheat crop, the coefficients of RVI and NDVI variation were 15%similar to 50% and 2%similar to 50%,respectively, while in maize, they were 10%similar to 33% and 18%similar to 39%, respectively. When measuring RVI and NDVI with wheat and maize crops, the desired time for the measurement could be 12:00-14:00 because the solar zenith angle is relatively stable. The observation angle should be in a fixed angle, and also the influence of shadow effect and hot spot effect should be noticed. When measuring RVI and NDVI of wheat during regreening to jointing stage and heading to the flowering stage, close attention should be paid to the effects of observation zenith angle and observation time, respectively. This study performed a quantitative analysis of measuring canopy spectral reflectance with wheat and maize crops. The results obtained in the study could provide technical support for accurate and effective measurement of the crop canopy spectral reflectance.

TI  - Fire Diurnal Cycle Derived from a Combination of the Himawari-8 and VIIRS Satellites to Improve Fire Emission Assessments in Southeast Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The violent and persistent wildfires that broke out along the southeast coast of Australia in 2019 caused a large number of pollutant emissions, which seriously affected air quality and the global climate. The existing two methods for estimating combustion emissions based on burned area and fire radiative power mainly use a medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) on the Aqua and Terra satellites. However, the low temporal resolution of MODIS and insensitivity to small fires lead to deviation in the estimation of fire emissions. In order to solve this problem, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with better performance is adopted in this paper, combined with the fire diurnal cycle information obtained by geostationary satellite Himawari-8, to explore the spatio-temporal model of biomass combustion emissions. Using this, a high-spatial- and -temporal-resolution fire emission inventory was generated for southeastern Australia from November 2019 to January 2020, which aims to fully consider the highly dynamic nature of fires and small fires (low FRP) that are much lower than the MODIS burned area or active fire detection limit, with emphasis on dry matter burned (DMB). We found that during the study period, the fire gradually moved from north to south, and the diurnal cycle of the fire in the study area changed greatly. The peak time of the fire gradually delayed as the fire moved south. Our inventory shows that the DMB in southeast Australia during the study period was about 146 Tg, with major burned regions distributed along the Great Dividing Range, with December 2019 being the main burning period. The total DMB we calculated is 0.5-3.1 times that reported by the GFAS (Global Fire Assimilation System) and 1.5 to 4 times lower than that obtained using the traditional "Burned Area Based Method (FINN)". We believe that the GFAS may underestimate the results by ignoring a large number of small fires, and that the excessive combustion rate used in the FINN may be a source of overestimation. Therefore, we conclude that the combination of high-temporal-resolution and high-spatial-resolution satellites can improve FRE estimation and may also allow further verification of biomass combustion estimates from different inventories, which are far better approaches for fire emission estimation.

TI  - Discovering Vegetation Recovery and Landslide Activities in the Wenchuan Earthquake Area with Landsat Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Post-seismic vegetation recovery is critical to local ecosystem recovery and slope stability, especially in the Wenchuan earthquake area where tens of thousands of landslides were triggered. This study executed a decadal monitoring of post-seismic landslide activities all over the region by investigating landslide vegetation recovery rate (VRR) with Landsat images and a (nearly) complete landslide inventory. Thirty thousand landslides that were larger than nine pixels were chosen for VRR analysis, to reduce the influence of mixed pixels and support detailed investigation within landslides. The study indicates that about 60% of landslide vegetation gets close to the pre-earthquake level in ten years and is expected to recover to the pre-earthquake level within 20 years. The vegetation recovery is significantly influenced by topographic factors, especially elevation and slope, while it is barely related to the distance to epicenter, fault ruptures, and rivers. This study checked and improved the knowledge of vegetation recovery and landslide stability in the area, based on a detailed investigation.

TI  - Urban Sprawl and Changes in Land-Use Efficiency in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, China from 2000 to 2020: A Spatiotemporal Analysis Using Earth Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable development in urban areas is at the core of the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Analysis of SDG indicator 11.3.1-Land-use efficiency based on functional urban boundaries-provides a globally harmonized avenue for tracking changes in urban settlements in different areas. In this study, a methodology was developed to map built-up areas using time-series of Landsat imagery on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. By fusing the mapping results with four available land-cover products-GlobeLand30, GHS-Built, GAIA and GLC_FCS-2020-a new built-up area product (BTH_BU) was generated for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, China for the time period 2000-2020. Using the BTH_BU product, functional urban boundaries were created, and changes in the size of the urban areas and their form were analyzed for the 13 cities in the BTH region from 2000 to 2020. Finally, the spatiotemporal dynamics of SDG 11.3.1 indicators were analyzed for these cities. The results showed that the urban built-up area could be extracted effectively using the BTH_BU method, giving an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 0.93 and 0.85, respectively. The overall ratio of the land consumption rate to population growth rate (LCRPGR) in the BTH region fluctuated from 1.142 in 2000-2005 to 0.946 in 2005-2010, 2.232 in 2010-2015 and 1.538 in 2015-2020. Diverged changing trends of LCRPGR values in cities with different population sizes in the study area. Apart from the megacities of Beijing and Tianjin, after 2010, the LCRPGR values were greater than 2 in all the cities in the region. The cities classed as either small or very small had the highest LCRPGR values; however, some of these cities, such as Chengde and Hengshui, experienced population loss in 2005-2010. To mitigate the negative impacts of low-density sprawl on environment and resources, local decision makers should optimize the utilization of land resources and improve land-use efficiency in cities, especially in the small cities in the BTH region.

TI  - Soil salinity inversion based on novel spectral index
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is one of the most important causes for land degradation and desertification and is an important threat to land management, farming activities, water quality, and sustainable development, with the management of saline soil crucial in arid and semi-arid areas. The salt-affected soil is predominant in the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR) in the Northwestern China. It influences the development of agricultural economy. Rapid and accurate measurement of the soil salt content (SSC) is significant for the soil salinization control. However, the traditional method of obtaining soil salt is time-consuming and laborious. Nowadays, it is an unprecedented perspective to monitor soil salinity through Sentinel-2A multispectral remote sensing image to construct three-dimensional spectral index. In this study, through soil salt data of 97 ground-truth measurements, Sentinel-2A data-derived spectral indices, based on particle swarm optimization support vector machine (PSO-SVM), gray wolf optimization support vector machine (GWO-SVM) and differential evolution support vector machine (DE-SVM) algorithm to construct a best soil salt inversion models. The results show that three-band (3D) spectral index has better correlation with soil salinity than single band and two-band (2D) spectral index, among TBI5 and TBI7 has a high correlation with the salinity of the soil, and the points are concentrated on the 1:1 line. Therefore, this approach could be applied to estimate the soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake region. The established models were validated using the Machine learning algorithm. The DE-SVM model performed the best by the three Model of accuracy with R-2, Bias, and SEPC2 of 0.56, - 2.03, and 8.62, respectively. Therefore through the soil salinity value predicted by the modeling constructs a linear relationship with the indexes TBI5 and TBI7, and draw the soil salt inversion map, soil salinity around the lake is relatively high, and decreases outward along the lake, which is consistent with the field. The result from this model will be useful for soil salinization monitoring in the study area and can provide theoretical support for the estimation of SSC in arid and semi-arid areas.

TI  - Roles of TAO/TRITON and Argo in Tropical Pacific Observing Systems: An OSSE Study for Multiple Time Scale Variability
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a series of ocean observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are conducted in support of the Tropical Pacific Observing System (TPOS) 2020 Project (TPOS 2020), which was established in 2014, with aims to develop a more sustainable and resilient observing system for the tropical Pacific. The experiments are based on an ocean data assimilation system that is under development at the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA) and the Environmental Modeling Center (EMC)/National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The atmospheric forcing and synthetic ocean observations are generated from a nature run, which is based on a modified CFSv2 with a vertical ocean resolution of 1 m near the ocean surface. To explore the efficacy of TAO/TRITON and Argo observations in TPOS, synthetic ocean temperature and salinity observations were constructed by sampling the nature run following their present distributions. Our experiments include a free run with no "observations" assimilated, and assimilation runs with the TAO/TRITON and Argo synthetic observations assimilated separately or jointly. These experiments were analyzed by comparing their long-term mean states and variabilities at different time scales [i.e., low-frequency (>90 days), intraseasonal (20-90 days), and high-frequency (<20 days)]. It was found that 1) both TAO/TRITON and especially Argo effectively improve the estimation of mean states and low-frequency variations; 2) on the intraseasonal time scale, Argo has more significant improvements than TAO/TRITON (except for regions close to TAO/TRITON sites); and 3) on the high-frequency time scale, both TAO/TRITON and Argo have evident deficits (although for TAO/TRITON, limited improvements were present close to TAO/TRITON sites).

TI  - How to Measure the Urban Park Cooling Island? A Perspective of Absolute and Relative Indicators Using Remote Sensing and Buffer Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban parks have been proven to cool the surrounding environment, and can thus mitigate the urban heat island to an extent by forming a park cooling island. However, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of park cooling islands is still required. Therefore, we studied 32 urban parks in Jinan, China and proposed absolute and relative indicators to depict the detailed features of the park cooling island. High-spatial-resolution GF-2 images were used to obtain the land cover of parks, and Landsat 8 TIR images were used to examine the thermal environment by applying buffer analysis. Linear statistical models were developed to explore the relationships between park characteristics and the park cooling island. The results showed that the average land surface temperature (LST) of urban parks was approximately 3.6 degrees C lower than that of the study area, with the largest temperature difference of 7.84 degrees C occurring during summer daytime, while the average park cooling area was approximately 120.68 ha. The park cooling island could be classified into four categories-regular, declined, increased, and others-based on the changing features of the surrounding LSTs. Park area (PA), park perimeter (PP), water area proportion (WAP), and park shape index (PSI) were significantly negatively correlated with the park LST. We also found that WAP, PP, and greenness (characterized by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) were three important factors that determined the park cooling island. However, the relationship between PA and the park cooling island was complex, as the results indicated that only parks larger than a threshold size (20 ha in our study) would provide a larger cooling effect with the increase in park size. In this case, increasing the NDVI of the parks by planting more vegetation would be a more sustainable and effective solution to form a stronger park cooling island.

TI  - Retrieval of Land Surface Temperature With Topographic Effect Correction From Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Data in Mountainous Areas
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of land surface temperature (LST) is crucial for ecological environment monitoring and climate change studies in mountainous areas. The current LST retrieval algorithms were developed without accounting for the topographic effect, which can only be used to retrieve LST over relatively flat surfaces. Due to the impact of 3-D structure of mountainous surfaces, rugged terrain makes the processes of thermal radiation more complex. In this study, a radiative transfer equation (RTE)-based single-channel algorithm was proposed to retrieve LST with topographic effect correction from the Landsat 8 thermal infrared (TIR) data in mountainous areas. This algorithm accounts for the changes in the thermal radiation components in the TIR RTE caused by the topographic effect. According to the analysis of simulation data, sky-view factor (SVF), atmospheric water vapor content, surface emissivity of target pixel, and average LST of the surrounding terrain have significant influence on the magnitude of the topographic effect. The differences between the LST retrieved without/with topographic effect correction from the Landsat 8 TIR data are related to SVF. The topographic effect should be taken into account in the LST retrieval algorithm when SVF is smaller than 0.7. The largest LST difference of approximately 1 K occurs in the deep valley. The results indicate that LST without topographic effect correction could be overestimated to be as high as 1 K. Due to a lack of in situ LST measurements, the performance of the LST retrieval algorithm in mountainous areas was only evaluated by comparing the brightness temperature (BT) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) simulated by the DART+MODTRAN model and the TIR RTE over mountainous surfaces at three subregions. There is a good consistency between BT at the TOA simulated by the DART+MODTRAN model and the TIR RTE over mountainous surfaces at the three subregions, with a root mean -squared error (RMSE) of less than 0.23 K.

TI  - Traffic Allocation for Heterogeneous Links in Satellite Data Relay Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient traffic allocation for heterogeneous links in satellite data relay networks (SDRNs) has been an attractive topic nowadays. However, different traffic types and link heterogeneity bring plenty of difficulties to the link delay evaluation which directly impacts the traffic allocation efficiency. Owing to the unique determination of the probability distribution of arrival processes, we succeed in characterizing any type of traffic with the help of the moment generating function (MGF). According to the alternation and discontinuity of satellite ground links (SGLs), we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo embedded service matrix construction method to model the SGL service. Being apt at combining service processes, the stochastic network calculus based min-plus convolution is employed to depict the relay service. By deriving the tight upper bounds of the delay in heterogeneous links based on the MGF, min-plus convolution, and Markov chain, respectively, taking advantage of the Chernoff bound and Union bound, we calculate the optimal traffic allocation ratio in terms of minimum system delay. Finally, numerous simulations are conducted to show the relationships among the optimal traffic allocation ratio, traffic type, and link heterogeneity.

TI  - AHI-Derived Daytime Cloud Optical/Microphysical Properties and Their Evaluations With the Collection-6.1 MOD06 Product
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud optical/microphysical properties (COMPs) with a high spatiotemporal resolution are required for monitoring the evolution of convective clouds, studying aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions, and evaluating cloud microphysics parameterization schemes in weather and climate models. This study applied the hispectral method, commonly used for COMP retrievals, to Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI)/Himawari-8 observations. The AHI daytime cloud optical thickness (tau) and cloud-top particle effective radius (Re) retrievals were then evaluated with the Collection-6.1 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer cloud product (MOD06) for a three-month period from June 1, 2017, to August 31, 2017. Overall, the AHI-retrieved COMP results are in good agreement with the MOD06 product. The correlation coefficients of tau and Re between the AHI retrievals and MOD06 products are 0.76-0.89 and 0.63-0.87, respectively. Overestimations are mainly observed in the 1.6-mu m Re (Re-1.6) and ice-phase 3.9-mu m Re (Re-3.9) retrievals. There are tau dependencies in the retrieval biases of tau and Re-1.6, as well as angular dependencies in the retrieval biases of tau and ice-phase Re-3.9. Moreover, the monthly mean composites for three COMP retrievals from the MOD06 and AM algorithms are compared. Significant differences are only found between the two Re-1.6 products. This study also finds that AHI-retrieved Re and tau values have a diurnal variation over land but not over oceans.

TI  - Neural Network-Based Urban Change Monitoring with Deep-Temporal Multispectral and SAR Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing-driven urban change detection has been studied in many ways for decades for a wide field of applications, such as understanding socio-economic impacts, identifying new settlements, or analyzing trends of urban sprawl. Such kinds of analyses are usually carried out manually by selecting high-quality samples that binds them to small-scale scenarios, either temporarily limited or with low spatial or temporal resolution. We propose a fully automated method that uses a large amount of available remote sensing observations for a selected period without the need to manually select samples. This enables continuous urban monitoring in a fully automated process. Furthermore, we combine multispectral optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from two eras as two mission pairs with synthetic labeling to train a neural network for detecting urban changes and activities. As pairs, we consider European Remote Sensing (ERS-1/2) and Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) for 1991-2011 and Sentinel 1 and 2 for 2017-2021. For every era, we use three different urban sites-Limassol, Rotterdam, and Liege-with at least 500 km(2) each, and deep observation time series with hundreds and up to over a thousand of samples. These sites were selected to represent different challenges in training a common neural network due to atmospheric effects, different geographies, and observation coverage. We train one model for each of the two eras using synthetic but noisy labels, which are created automatically by combining state-of-the-art methods, without the availability of existing ground truth data. To combine the benefit of both remote sensing types, the network models are ensembles of optical- and SAR-specialized sub-networks. We study the sensitivity of urban and impervious changes and the contribution of optical and SAR data to the overall solution. Our implementation and trained models are available publicly to enable others to utilize fully automated continuous urban monitoring.

TI  - Estimation of Population Size and Dispersal Pattern of Sterile Male <i>Aedes aegypti</i> Using Mark-Release-Recapture (MRR)
T2  - ATOM INDONESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes aegypti is currently emerging as a main vector of Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya transmission. Chemical control was reported to be less effective due to the resistance of this mosquito to some types of insecticides. Therefore, another vector control is needed which is most appropriate to be used, i.e. the sterile insect technique (SIT). Information about optimum range dispersal sterile male Aedes aegypti for optimalization SIT program are needed. This study was designed to determine the dispersal pattern and population estimation of Aedes aegypti sterilized with gamma rays using mark-release-recapture (MRR) method. After the male Aedes aegypti (pupal stage) was irradiated with 70 Gy of gamma rays, the mosquitoes were then marked with Rhodamine-B and released into the study site. MRR experiments were carried out in Batan Indah residential area, and the Aedes aegypti were released in center of the site. Mosquitoes were recaptured at 28 points spread over the Batan Indah Residence for 2, 4, 6, and 8 days after release by using BG-Sentinel Traps. The result showed that the population of Aedes aegypti in the site was estimated to be 5.402 (1.347-14.636; CI 95 %) with the furthest spread distance was 119 meters from the release point. This study also showed that the MRR experiment can be used to estimate the population size and dispersal pattern of Aedes aegypti movement in a given locality. The result of present study provide better understanding for optimalization mosquito-borne disease prevention based on SIT programs. (C) 2021 Atom Indonesia. All rights reserved

T2  - ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) is essential for good health and formation of vitamin D while overexposure poses a risk to public health. Therefore, it is important to provide information to the public about the level of solar UV radiation. The ultraviolet index (UVI) is used to help avoid the negative effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on humans and to optimize individual exposure. There is limited ground measurement of solar UV radiation, but satellite Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMIs) satellite products with a spatial resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees can be used to create UV index climatology at local noon time. In this study, we utilize OMI satellite products collected over the campus of King Abdulaziz University (KAU) (21.5 degrees North and 39.1 degrees East), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to estimate changes in exposure to UV over a period of 15 years (2004-2020). The results indicate a significantly increasing trend in UV index over this period. Between 2004 and 2020, daily "extreme" UV (UVI > 11, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO)) occurred on 46.60% of days. The frequency of low UVI (UVI < 2) was only about 0.06%. These results imply dangerous exposure levels to solar UV radiation on the KAU campus and call for safety measures to increase awareness and decrease direct exposure; for example, by implementing the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) general guidelines.

TI  - Glacier changes in Sind basin (1990-2018 of North-western Himalayas using earth observation data)
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess the short-temporal dynamics of glaciers in Sind watershed of Jhelum basin in North-western Himalayas. The spatio-temporal fluctuations in morphological parameters of glaciers were estimated for a period of 28 years from 1990 to 2018. This has been achieved by analyzing multi-temporal imageries from Landsat-5, Sentinel-2 and IRS LISS IV earth observation data using geospatial tools and supplemented with field observations. The total glaciated area of Sind basin has decreased from 56.73 Km(2) (1990) to 43.94 Km(2) (2018) with the loss of 22.5% during the period of 28 years. The number of glaciers has increased from 92 (1990) to 116 (2018) generally due to defragmentation of glaciers. Glaciers (> 1 Km(2)) have shown a maximum loss of -34.8% during the study period. Although contributing less to the total glacier area, glaciers found in low elevation zones (3800-4200 masl) have lost maximum area of around - 55.5%. Mean elevation of glaciers has increased from 4330 masl (1990) to 4390 masl (2018). Mean Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) of glaciers (> 0.5 Km(2)) has shifted from 4336 to 4432 masl with an annual upward shift of 3.4 m a(-1). The trend analysis of meteorological parameters (Temperature and Precipitation) using Mann-Kendall test reveals that the seasonal and annual temperature (both T-max and T-min) has shown a significant positive trend. While as precipitation (both annual and seasonal) has shown a negative trend. The continued glacier recession in the region is largely due to decreasing precipitation in the winter months (November-March) and increasing mean annual temperatures. The persistence of warming trend will result in continuous shrinkage and thinning of glaciers with drastic impacts on the hydrological regime of the region.

TI  - Advancing intraoperative magnetic tracing using 3D freehand magnetic particle imaging
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a routine procedure for nodal staging in penile cancer. Most commonly, this procedure is guided by radioactive tracers, providing various forms of preoperative and intraoperative guidance. This is further extended with fluorescence imaging using hybrid radioactive-fluorescence tracers. Alternatively, a magnetic-based approach has become available using superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). This study investigates a novel freehand magnetic particle imaging and navigation modality (fhMPI) for intraoperative localization, along with a hybrid approach, combining magnetic and fluorescence guidance. Materials and methods The fhMPI set-up was built with a surgical navigation device, optical tracking system and magnetometer probe. A dedicated reconstruction software based on a look-up-table method was used to reconstruct a superficial 3D volume of the SPION distribution in tissue. For fluorescence guidance, indocyanine green (ICG) was added to the SPIONs. The fhMPI modality was characterized in phantoms, ex vivo human skin and in vivo porcine surgery. Results Phantom and human skin explants illustrated that the current fhMPI modality had a sensitivity of 2.2 x 10(-2) mg/mL SPIONs, a resolving power of at least 7 mm and a depth penetration up to 1.5 cm. Evaluation during porcine surgery showed that fhMPI allowed for an augmented reality image overlay of the tracer distribution in tissue, as well as 3D virtual navigation. Besides, using the hybrid approach, fluorescence imaging provided a visual confirmation of localized nodes. Conclusion fhMPI is feasible in vivo, providing 3D imaging and navigation for magnetic nanoparticles in the operating room, expanding the guidance possibilities during magnetic sentinel lymph node procedures. Furthermore, the integration of ICG provides the ability to visually refine and confirm correct localization. Further clinical evaluation should verify these findings in human patients as well.

T2  - Natura Croatica
M3  - Article
AB  - This study of mosquitoes in Lika, geographically, geologically and climatically a very specific region, was conducted to gain insight into the composition and relative abundance of the mosquito fauna, as well as to check for the possible presence of invasive species. Sampling took place from July to September 2020. Mosquito larvae were captured from medium and small breeding sites using a 25 cm diameter net and a plastic dipper. Adult specimens were sampled in both urban and rural areas using CO2 baited CDC traps, CO2 baited BG Sentinel traps with BG Lure and human landing catch. The study was conducted at 69 sites. We collected 5,126 specimens (100 adults and 5,026 larvae) and demonstrated the presence of 16 mosquito species. CDC traps were almost five times more effective (quantity and quality) than BG Sentinel traps. The most common mosquito taxa caught in Lika were Culex pipiens complex (78.36% of all larvae) and Ae. geniculatus (30.26% of all adults). Both invasive mosquito species present in Croatia, Aedes albopictus and Ae. japonicus, were recorded, with Ae. albopic-tus being detected in Lika for the first time. Aedes japonicus was widespread, recorded in 23 localities. According to molecular analysis, only An. maculipennis s.s. was confirmed in the An. maculipennis complex. Within the Cx. pipiens complex, both Cx. pipiens biotypes, pipiens and molestus were con-firmed together with one single hybrid specimen. Analysis of mosquito occurrence with regard to altitude shows that most samples and species were collected between 601 and 700 m a.s.l., although the Shannon evenness index and Hill's index show the highest value in the range of 901 to 1140 m a.s.l. In this systematic study on the mosquito fauna in Lika, a significant species diversity, including invasive species, was found.

TI  - Simulating Future Groundwater Recharge in Coastal and Inland Catchments
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a primary source of drinking water in the Mediterranean, however, climate variability in conjunction with mismanagement renders it vulnerable to depletion. Spatiotemporal studies of groundwater recharge are the basis to develop strategies against this phenomenon. In this study, groundwater recharge was spatiotemporally quantified using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in one coastal and one inland hydrological basin in Greece. A double calibration/validation (CV) procedure using streamflow data and MODIS ET was conducted for the inland basin of Mouriki, whereas only ET values were used in the coastal basin of Anthemountas. Calibration and simulation recharge were accurate in both sites according to statistical indicators and previous studies. In Mouriki basin, mean recharge and runoff were estimated as 16% and 9%, respectively. In Anthemountas basin recharge to the shallow aquifer and surface runoff were estimated as 12% and 16%, respectively. According to the predicted RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, significant variations in groundwater recharge are predicted in the coastal zone for the period 2020-2040 with average annual recharges decreasing by 30% (RCP 4.5) and 25% (RCP 8.5). Variations in groundwater recharge in the inland catchment of Mouriki were insignificant for the simulated period. Anthemountas basin was characterized by higher runoff rates. Groundwater management in coastal aquifers should include detailed monitoring of hydrological parameters, reinforced groundwater recharge during winter and reduced groundwater abstraction during summer depending on the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater recharge.

TI  - American Society of Breast Surgeons' Practice Patterns for Patients at Risk and Affected by Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In 2017, the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) published expert panel recommendations for patients at risk for breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) and those affected by BCRL. This study sought to determine BCRL practice patterns. Methods A survey was sent to 2975 ASBrS members. Questions evaluated members' clinical practice type, practice duration, and familiarity with BCRL recommendations. Descriptive statistics, the chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test were used. Results Of the ASBrS members surveyed, 390 (13.1%) responded. Most of the breast surgeons (58.5%, 228/390) indicated unfamiliarity with recommendations. Nearly all respondents (98.7%, 385/390) educate at-risk patients. Most (60.2%, 234/389) instruct patients to avoid venipuncture, injection or blood pressure measurements in the at-risk arm, and 35.6% (138/388) recommend prophylactic compression sleeve use during air travel. Nearly all (97.7%, 380/389) encourage those at-risk to exercise, including resistance exercise (86.2%, 331/384). Most do not perform axillary reverse mapping (ARM) (67.9%, 264/389) or a lymphatic preventive healing approach (LYMPHA) (84.9%, 331/390). Most (76.1%, 296/389) screen at-risk patients for BCRL. The most frequently used screening tools include self-reported symptoms (81%, 255/315), circumferential tape measure (54%, 170/315) and bioimpedance spectroscopy (27.3%, 86/315). After a BCRL diagnosis, most (90%, 351/390) refer management to a lymphedema-certified physical therapist. For affected patients, nearly all encourage exercise (98.7%, 384/389). Many (49%, 191/390) refer affected patients for consideration of lymphovenous bypass or lymph node transfer. Conclusion Most respondents were unfamiliar with the ASBrS expert panel recommendations for patients at risk for BCRL and those affected by BCRL. Opportunities exist to increase awareness of best practices and to acquire ARM and LYMPHA technical expertise.

TI  - Dynamics of plantation forest development and ecosystem carbon storage change in coastal Bangladesh
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plantation forest has an immense potential for significantly contributing to the global carbon cycle for regulating climate change. Assessing the spatio-temporal distribution of plantation forest vegetation by analyzing Landsat land use/land cover (LULC) data can provide a logical basis for developing ecological and environmental policies to effectively manage ecosystem carbon storage in the future. The study aimed at assessing and predicting dynamics of plantation forest development and ecosystem carbon storage change in coastal Bangladesh over 1988-2041 under three future land management scenarios: business-as-usual (BAU), economic development (ED), and ecological protection-afforestation (EPA) by linking CA-Markov and InVEST models. Findings from LULC change analysis revealed that during 1988-2018, plantation forest increased by 984.9 km2 (68.34%) leading to an overall increase in regional carbon storage, of 3.30 Tg C. Over 2018-2041, plantation forest land could be increased by 249.90, 361.24, and 472.14 km2 under the BAU, ED, and EPA scenarios, respectively, that may potentially increase future carbon storage by 0.64 Tg C, 0.91 Tg C, and 3.77 Tg C, respectively. However, the three future land management scenarios may lead to shortages of regional food supply, of 5.96%, 13.69%, and 11.06% respectively. The suitability maps of different LULC types created in this study could be useful to find out the potential areas of plantation forest development in the future and would provide a scientific basis for further discussion by policymakers on future land use planning, to minimize the trade-offs between food security and climate change adaptation.

TI  - Predicting changes in land use/land cover and seasonal land surface temperature using multi-temporal landsat images in the northwest region of Bangladesh
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) variations are accelerated by rapid urbanization and significantly impacted global Land Surface Temperature (LST). The dynamic increase in LST results in the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. In this study, future LULC change scenarios, seasonal (summer & winter) LST variations, and LST distribution over different LULC classes were predicted using Landsat satellite images for 1999, 2009, and 2019 in Rajshahi District, Bangladesh. Cellular Automata (CA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) procedures were used to predict the LULC changes and seasonal LST variations for 2029 and 2039. In addition, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and Key Informants Interviews (KIIs) were conducted to identify the possible impacts of LULC change, LST shifts, and climate change on agricultural productivity and developed a sustainable land use management plan for the study area. Validation of the CA model demonstrated an excellent accuracy with a kappa value of 0.82. Similarly, the ANN model's validation using Mean Square Error (0.523 and 0.796 for summer) and Correlation coefficient (0.6023 and 0.831 for winter) values demonstrated a good prediction accuracy. The LULC prediction result indicated that the built-up area will be expanded by 58.03 km(2) and 79.90 km(2), respectively, from 2019 to 2029 and 2039. The predicted seasonal LST indicated that in 2029 and 2039, more than 23.30 % and 50.46 % of the summer and 3.02 % and 13.02 % of the winter seasons will likely be experienced LSTs greater than 35 degrees C. The results of public participation exposed that changes in LULC classes, variations in LST, and climate change significantly impact the regional biodiversity (loss of farmland and water bodies), reduce agricultural productivity, and increase extreme weather events (flood, heavy rainfall, and cold/warm temperature). This study provides the useful guidelines for agricultural officers, urban planners, and environmental engineers to understand the spatial configurations of built-up area enlargement and provide effective policy measures to conserve farming lands to ensure environmental sustainability.

TI  - High-accuracy continuous mapping of surface water dynamics using automatic update of training samples and temporal consistency modification based on Google Earth Engine: A case study from Huizhou, China
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water is experiencing significant changes due to anthropogenic activities and climate change. Recent studies have explored long-term surface water dynamics with the development of multi-source remote sensing data and mapping technology. However, cost-effective and time-saving reliable references for mapping surface water from remote sensing images at multiple times are still lacking. Further, negligence of abnormal changes in time-series surface water maps seriously affects surface water mapping accuracy. In this study, we propose a high-accuracy method for long-term mapping of surface water by automatic update of training samples and temporal consistency modification in surface water sequences. Taking the surface water in Huizhou from 1986 to 2020 as a case study, the method is applied and tested. Temporal training samples were updated through Robust Mahalanobis distances and statistical filtering. Combined with the random forest algorithm and the Google Earth Engine platform, annual surface water maps were generated. A method for temporal consistency detection in moving window and abnormal changes modification rule with intra-annual information are proposed to improve annual surface water mapping accuracy. The accuracy of surface water dynamics and abnormal water modifications were quantified as 89.8% and 95.7%, respectively. With our proposed method, the resultant maximum annual water areas of Huizhou were detected, with a statistically significant upward trend and net increase of 103.1 km(2) over 35 years. Reservoir construction and aquaculture expansion constitute the main sources of increased waters in this case study. It is demonstrated that our proposed method offers important advantages in terms of the accuracy of annual surface water maps and especially change monitoring.

TI  - Resistance and resilience of grasslands to drought detected by SIF in inner Mongolia, China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, stability of grassland ecosystem is facing serious challenges due to the occurrence of global warming and the increased frequency and intensity of extreme droughts. The stability of grassland ecosystem has two distinct components: 'resistance' and 'resilience'. However, the evaluation of resistance and resilience mechanisms is hindered by the lack of tools for accurately monitoring the response of grasslands to drought across spatio-temporal scales. In this study, the resistance and resilience of grassland ecosystem are investigated by combining multi-source data, including space-borne solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) estimated by flux towers, and MODIS visible near-infrared (VNIR) data. The characteristics of grassland ecosystem resistance and resilience to drought are obtained from the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, China, which suffered from a prolonged scarcity of rainfall in 2009. Space-borne SIF is found to be a beneficial tool for monitoring the seasonal dynamics of vegetation productivity compared to MODIS VNIR data. Space-borne SIF features a higher accuracy for monitoring the recovery time, resistance and resilience of grasslands to drought compared to MODIS VNIR data. Spatially, the resilience of Inner Mongolia grasslands to drought measured by SIF is greater than that measured by MODIS VNIR data, while the resistance of Inner Mongolia grasslands to drought measured by SIF is less than that measured by MODIS VNIR data. Moreover, areas with high resistance are located at the interlaced zone of grassland ecosystem and farmland or forest, where the resilience is low. These results demonstrate that space-borne SIF has great potential for monitoring the resistance and resilience of grasslands in response to drought over large regions.

TI  - Research on remote sensing prospecting technology based on multi-source data fusion in deep-cutting areas
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tectonically deep-cut areas are difficult to access due to the treacherous terrain, making it difficult to carry out fieldwork in these areas for geological prospecting. Liwu Copper-Zinc Mine is a medium-sized rich polymetallic deposit belonging to deep-cutting areas in tectonic structures. Complicated structures influence the ore development and formation in the region. With the introduction of remote sensing technology, geologic features and mineralisation abnormality information can be recognised effectively in such regions. This can provide scientific references for dividing potential metallogenic regions. Remote sensing images with sub-meter spatial resolutions were collected using the Worldview-2(WV-2) satellite to interpret mineralisation-related geologic bodies and analyse the distribution relationships of mineralisation-controlling structures. Multispectral near-infrared spectral information was acquired through the Landsat-8. Meanwhile, the alteration information of two hydrothermal solutions in the study area related to hydroxide radicals and iron staining was extracted via principal component analysis (PCA) based on Crosta technology. The alteration-related standard spectral information and the measured spectral information of known copper outcrops in the region were collected as guiding spectra. A comparative analysis between guiding spectra and GF-5 graphic information was conducted. Possible mineralisation information distributions in the study area were collected via a spectral angle mapper (SAM) and support vector machine (SVM). The results showed that the WV-2 images were able to accurately identify the mineralised geological bodies. The overall classification precisions of SAM- and SVM-based erratic rock mapping were 80.18% and 83.51%, respectively. The information on the hydroxyl iron staining anomaly had been well fitted to the actual alteration zone by field investigation. An analogy analysis between the multivariate remote sensing prospecting information collected by the above means and the existing typical mining areas in Liwu Region was conducted; the dense areas of mineral control structures and remote sensing anomalies were well integrated. The remote sensing metallogenic prediction model of the region was constructed on this basis. Meanwhile, the potential mineralisation was delineated at target zone 1. In conclusion, the presented technology is based on remote sensing data and the fusion of multi-resolutions. It can provide guidance and references for exploring potential metallogenic regions in deep-cutting areas, especially in fold-development regions.

TI  - Wetland mapping with multi-temporal sentinel-1 &-2 imagery (2017-2020) and LiDAR data in the grassland natural region of alberta
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - ABSTARCT In the Grassland Natural Region (GNR) of southern Alberta, wetlands are relatively small-sized disconnected prairie pothole marshes, swamps, and shallow open water habitats often surrounded by grasslands, parkland forests, agricultural lands, and urban areas. These wetlands are susceptible to climatic variability, resulting in temporally and spatially dynamic habitats that are difficult to map accurately. This study hypothesizes that seasonal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical imagery will capture temporal variations of wetlands in the spring/summer and fall months of 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. We propose that these data combined with topographic variability offered by LiDAR-derived topographic wetness index (TWI) shall result in the accurate delineation of the wetlands. Using a combination of open-access government databases, we generated ground and training data to develop the classification models and perform accuracy assessments. The wetland map products' overall accuracy results ranged from 63.2% to 75.7%. The pixel-based random forest (RF) classified dataset (Dataset 5 - multi-temporal (2017-2020) S1 SAR (VH) and S2 optical (B8 and B11) bands fused with TWI) had the highest overall accuracy (75.6%). The RF result significantly outperformed similar CART (Classification and Regression Trees) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifications, which had overall accuracies of 67.4% and 63.2%, respectively. In addition, the RF optimal wetland product had the best combination of F-score values for wetland and upland classes: 0.61 (marsh), 0.82 (open water), 0.75 (swamp), and 0.8 (uplands). Overall, the methodology adopted in this study is promising for mapping the spatial distribution of wetland habitats across the seasonally dynamic GNR of Alberta.

TI  - The Results of Sentinel Node Mapping for Patients with Clinically Early Staged Gastric Cancer Diagnosed with pT2/deeper Tumors
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel node (SN) mapping based on the SN concept has been applied to early gastric cancer. However, it is still controversial whether or not the oncological safety is ensured in case pathological stage was advanced in these patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of SN mapping in patients with clinically early staged gastric cancer diagnosed with pT2/deeper tumors. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 40 patients with a diagnosis of cT1N0 or cT2N0 single-lesion gastric cancer who were shown to have pT2 or deeper tumors after gastrectomy with SN mapping. We adopted a dual-tracer method using a radioactive colloid and blue dye to detect SNs. The diagnostic accuracy and distribution of SNs at each tumor site were analyzed. Results Of the 40 patients, 24 (60%) were postoperatively diagnosed as pT2, and 16 (40%) as pT3 or T4. SNs were detected in all patients. The false negative rate was 9% (1/11), and in that patient, the non-SN metastasis was observed within the SN basin. Diagnostic accuracy was 98% (39/40). Overall distribution of SNs was similar to that for patients with early gastric cancer. No significant differences in overall and recurrence-free survival were observed between the patients who underwent standard gastrectomy and those who underwent function-preserving gastrectomy, based on the results of SN mapping. Conclusions Our results confirmed validity of SN mapping for patients with clinically early staged gastric cancer diagnosed with pT2/deeper tumors after gastrectomy. Closed surveillance without additional surgical treatment is an option for these patients.

TI  - Impact of Choosing Wisely Recommendations on Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Postoperative Radiation Rates in Women Over Age 70 Years with Hormone-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In 2016, the Society of Surgical Oncology released a Choosing Wisely guideline recommending sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) omission in females >= 70 years of age with early-stage, hormone-positive, clinically node-negative invasive breast cancer. This study investigated the impact of this guideline on SLNB and radiotherapy rates, in addition to assessing temporal trends of nodal biopsy and factors associated with recurrence. Methods The study involved a retrospective review of women who met the guideline criteria and underwent partial mastectomy at a single institution between 2009 and 2018. Using the same inclusion criteria, the National Cancer Database was queried to obtain a separate dataset. Statistical analyses included univariate comparisons, and multivariate logistic regression modeling to predict radiotherapy delivery. Results In our institutional series, 487 patients were included, 274 (56.3%) of whom received radiotherapy. There were 414 patients (85.0%) who underwent SLNB, with a nodal positivity rate of 11%. SLNB correlated with higher rates of radiotherapy (63.5% vs. 15.1%, p < 0.001). Age <80 years was an independent predictor of radiotherapy receipt (odds ratio 3.0, 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.52). SLNB performance decreased after 2016 (88.4% vs. 78.4%, p = 0.003). Median follow-up was 4.8 years, with 19 (3.9%) documented recurrences. SLNB performance was not associated with recurrence (2.9% vs. 5.5%, p = 0.279), whereas radiotherapy resulted in reduced recurrence (1.1% vs. 6.1%, p = 0.002). One (0.2%) disease-related mortality was observed. Conclusion Recurrence rates and disease-related mortality remain low in this demographic regardless of treatment rendered. Omission of SLNB and radiotherapy should remain a consideration, and efforts in both patient and physician education should continue.

TI  - Crop mapping from image time series: Deep learning with multi-scale label hierarchies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to map agricultural crops by classifying satellite image time series. Domain experts in agriculture work with crop type labels that are organised in a hierarchical tree structure, where coarse classes (like orchards) are subdivided into finer ones (like apples, pears, vines, etc.). We develop a crop classification method that exploits this expert knowledge and significantly improves the mapping of rare crop types. The threelevel label hierarchy is encoded in a convolutional, recurrent neural network (convRNN), such that for each pixel the model predicts three labels at different level of granularity. This end-to-end trainable, hierarchical network architecture allows the model to learn joint feature representations of rare classes (e.g., apples, pears) at a coarser level (e.g., orchard), thereby boosting classification performance at the fine-grained level. Additionally, labelling at different granularity also makes it possible to adjust the output according to the classification scores; as coarser labels with high confidence are sometimes more useful for agricultural practice than fine-grained but very uncertain labels. We validate the proposed method on a new, large dataset that we make public. ZueriCrop covers an area of 50 km x 48 km in the Swiss cantons of Zurich and Thurgau with a total of 116 ' 000 individual fields spanning 48 crop classes, and 28,000 (multi-temporal) image patches from Sentinel-2. We compare our proposed hierarchical convRNN model with several baselines, including methods designed for imbalanced class distributions. The hierarchical approach performs superior by at least 9.9 percentage points in F1-score.

AB  - There is a necessity for new methods and technology for several agricultural applications and decision support systems. Technological development at the global, national, and regional level has shown a path for the application of spaceborne remote sensing for agriculture purposes. Remote sensing technology eases to detect areas within the plots for a reliable data supply to analyze the data. Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are capable to provide a reliable data supply throughout the year. The global repetition rate is up to 12 days. The datasets acquired from the Sentinel-1 platform facilitates a ground resolution of 20 x 20 m and these sufficient for the synchronization of spaceborne multispectral and radar datasets for enhanced agricultural cropland monitoring applications and decision support systems. Sentinel-1 data is a C-band radar data sets in dual-polarizations. The signal intensity changes over according to humidity in the soil or vegetation cover and the surface structure. The variations in signal information being recovered at the sensor end help in the informed decision making. Besides, SAR datasets are capable to provide information on the phenological stage of agricultural cropland along with crop-type differentiation for specific use cases. The synchronous utilization of spaceborne multispectral and radar datasets for enhanced agricultural cropland monitoring applications and decision support systems can be transformed into informative map products for several processes. The same technology can be beneficial for monitoring crop conditions during any disaster and early warning systems for proper management of available resources.

TI  - Novel approach for retrieving land-surface albedo: case study at the Nanling National Nature Reserve, Guangdong Province
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a novel method for retrieving land-surface albedo (LSA) based on 338 groups of meteorological and NPP-VIIRS albedo data. Results showed that the LSA retrieval model calibrated using therandom forest (RF) machine-learning regression algorithm performed well. The RF-based LSA retrieval model explained approximately 84% of the NPP-VIIRS albedo variation (R-2 = 0.8429; N = 236) and yielded satisfactory validation accuracy (RMSE = 0.0167; MRE = 15.82%; N = 102). The original and retrieved albedo were also compared with the MODIS albedo product, which further validated the accuracy and effectiveness of the approach (RMSE = 0.0091; RME = 8.2%).

TI  - Exploring machine learning potential for climate change risk assessment
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is exacerbating weather, and climate extremes events and is projected to aggravate multi sectorial risks. A multiplicity of climate hazards will be involved, triggering cumulative and interactive impacts on a variety of natural and human systems. An improved understanding of risk interactions and dynamics is required to support decision makers in their ability to better manage current and future climate change risks. To face this issue, the research community has been starting to test new methodological approaches and tools, including the application of Machine Learning (ML) leveraging the potential of the large availability and variety of spatio-temporal big data for environmental applications. Given the increasing attention on the application of ML methods to Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA), this review mapped out the state of art and potential of these methods to this field of research. Scientometric and systematic analysis were jointly applied providing an in-depth review of publications across the 2000-2020 timeframe. The resulting output from the analysis showed that a huge variety of ML algorithms have been already applied within CCRA, among them, the most recurrent are Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network. These algorithms are often applied in an ensemble or hybridized way to analyze most of all floods and landslides risk events. Moreover, the application of ML to deal with remote sensing data is consistent and effective across reviewed CCRA applications, allowing the identification and classification of targets and the detection of environmental and structural features. On the contrary concerning future climate change scenarios, literature seems not to be very widespread into scientific production, compared to studies evaluating risks under current conditions. The same lack can be noted also for the assessment of cascading and compound hazards and risks, since these concepts are recently emerging in CCRA literature but not yet in combination with ML-based applications.

TI  - Study of aerosol optical properties at two urban areas in the north of Vietnam with the implication for biomass burning impacts
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal distribution and characterization of aerosol optical properties in the north of Vietnam were investigated extensively using the long-term measurements obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (from 2010 to 2019) and two Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) stations (Nghia Do, Hanoi City, from 2010 to 2019 and Son La from 2012 to 2019) located in fast-developing urban areas. This study also analyzed the tendency of AOD over different wavelengths as well as the influences of meteorological parameters and boundary layer height (BLH) on AOD and angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE). The annual mean AOD(500) at Nghia Do and Son La stations were 0.81 and 0.78, respectively. Our results revealed the existence of particles emitted from anthropogenic activities in Hanoi and Son La with the dominance of fine particles (more than 90% of the AE(440-870) were larger than 1). Besides, a high percentage of AE(440-870) larger than or approximately 1.5 during the dry and transition months in Son La indicated the existence of biomass-burning aerosol particles due to forest fires and burning of agriculture residuals. The classification results for aerosol types showed the presence of both biomass burning and urban/industrial aerosol types at Nghia Do and Son La sites. Among the investigated meteorological parameters, surface solar radiation expressed a significant correlation with AE(440-870) in all three seasons at the two sites due to the secondary formation of fine particles induced by the high solar radiation condition. The impacts of meteorological parameters and BLH on AOD were not observed simultaneously during three seasons at Nghia Do and Son La stations.

TI  - Trend Analysis and Simulation of Human Vulnerability Based on Physical Factors of Riverbank Erosion Using RS and GIS
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to analyze the pattern of bank erosion and simulate the physical aspects of vulnerability in the lower Meghna River, Bangladesh using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS). The physical factors of vulnerability were analyzed using GIS-based Structured Query Language (SQL). A questionnaire survey, GPS survey and field observation survey were conducted for collecting the primary data in the study area. The secondary data were mainly satellite image collected from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website. Using time series Landsat images (MSS, TM and OLI-TIRS), this study analyzed 36 years of erosion and accretion process in the Mehendiganj Upazila region from 1980 to 2016. The result indicates that an enormous amount of land (4470.47 ha) was submerged by the river and average land loss rate was 124.18 ha/year. The study quantifies the number of vulnerable households beneath the present condition and how much it will be altered after a positive/negative change with the factors of vulnerability related to the households. Simulation data reveals that under the present physical condition, 43.88% of households were identified as severely vulnerable. The output of this study can be used in the classification of vulnerable households and for the improvement of the physical infrastructure development process near the erosion prone areas, also helps to mitigate environmental disaster in the developing countries.

TI  - Dynamics of recent landslides (<20 My) on Mars: Insights from high-resolution topography on Earth and Mars and numerical modelling
T2  - PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are common features found on steep slopes on Mars and the role of water in their formation is an open question. Our study focuses on three young martian landslides whose mechanism of formation is unknown and knowing their formation mechanism could give us key information on recent martian climate and/or tectonics. They are less than 5 km long, and formed during the Late Amazonian Epoch, with an age <20 Ma when Mars is thought to have had a hyperarid climate. To better understand the dynamics and formation mechanism of these landslides, we combine two approaches: geomorphic comparison between martian and terrestrial landslides using remote sensing data from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) and the Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS), and numerical modelling using a dry granular flow dynamical model. Our geomorphic analysis revealed two contrasting morphologies suggesting differing dynamics and formation mechanisms. Two of the three martian landslides resemble terrestrial rockslides, while the third is more akin to terrestrial mudslides. The numerical modelling, although not fully conclusive, broadly supports our interpretations from the morphological observations. We suggest that the two landslides resembling terrestrial rockslides could have been triggered by shaking by meteorite impact or marsquakes in the absence of water. On the contrary, we suggest liquid water (originating from ground-ice melted by geothermal heat flux) may have been involved in the initiation of the landslide resembling a terrestrial mudslide. Our results show the value of using morphological comparison between martian and terrestrial landslides combined with numerical modelling to inform the hypotheses of landslide-formation on Mars where in situ analysis is not usually possible.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There has been no comprehensive longitudinal study of pulmonary functions (PFTS) in ALS determining which measure is most sensitive to declines in respiratory muscle strength. Objective: To determine the longitudinal decline of PFTS in ALS and which measure supports Medicare criteria for NIV initiation first. Methods: Serial PFTs (maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), maximum inspiratory pressure measured by mouth (MIP) or nasal sniff pressure (SNIP), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)) were performed over 12 months on 73 ALS subjects to determine which measure showed the sentinel decline in pulmonary function. The rate of decline for each measure was determined as the median slope of the decrease over time. Medicare-based NIV initiation criteria were met if %FVC was <= 50% predicted or MIP was <= 60 cMH(2)O. Results: 65 subjects with at least 3 visits were included for analyses. All median slopes were significantly different than zero. MEP and sitting FVC demonstrated the largest rate of decline. Seventy subjects were analyzed for NIV initiation criteria, 69 met MIP criteria first; 11 FVC and MIP criteria simultaneously and none FVC criteria first. Conclusions: MEP demonstrated a steeper decline compared to other measures suggesting expiratory muscle strength declines earliest and faster and the use of airway clearance interventions should be initiated early. When Medicare criteria for NIV initiation are considered, MIP criteria are met earliest. These results suggest that pressure-based measurements are important in assessing the timing of NIV and the use of pulmonary clearance interventions.

TI  - Analytical Formula to Investigate the Modulation of Sloped Targets Using LiDAR Waveform
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between the properties of targets and the features of modulated waveforms is fundamental to remote sensing based on the full-waveform light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Developing a mathematical formula of modulated LiDAR waveforms is of great importance in establishing this relationship. In this study, we derive the mathematical formula of a laser echo waveform modulated by four typical targets: a rectangle, a square, a circle, and an equilateral triangle. By using these formulas, numerical calculations are performed to investigate the relationship between the properties of the targets and the features of the modulated waveform. The results show that, at a rotation angle of 80 degrees, the modulated waveform changes from a Gaussian form to a non-Gaussian form and finally returns to a Gaussian form as the target size increases. When the target center deviates from the laser spot center and the rotation angle increases, the modulated waveform varies from Gaussian to non-Gaussian form, the value of the peak intensity decreases, and the position of the peak intensity shifts. The specific trends of these changes are successfully explained in terms of the geometric characteristics of the target and the spatial intensity distribution of the incident laser. The distinct dependencies of modulated waveforms on geometric shape, size, center position, and rotation angle indicate a convenient method for identity extraction and target recognition in remote sensing using full-waveform LiDAR. This offers exciting implications for applications, such as topological mapping, environment monitoring, and aerial target detection and recognition.

TI  - Mapping the trends of forest cover change and associated drivers in Mau Forest, Kenya
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mau Forest in the Rift Valley in Kenya is the largest of the five major water towers in the country and also the largest indigenous montane forest in Eastern Africa. As such, the forest is an important natural resource base not only to the local economy but to the East African region at large. In spite of this, the forest has been highly degraded owing to immense anthropogenic pressure from the forest surrounding communities. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in forest cover and the driving forces leading to its change. Landsat TM images of 1984 and 1995, ETM+ of 2008, and OLI/TIRS of 2020 were used to depict the trend in forest cover for the period between 1984 and 2020. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and in-depth interviews were also used to get the perceptions and experiences of the local people regarding the trend in forest cover and the associated driving forces. The results from the qualitative data were integrated with those of remote sensing for assessment of trend in forest cover. The study findings indicate a decline of 25.2% of forest cover within the Mau Forest complex in a period four years shy of four decades, amounting to approximately 699 km(2) of tree cover. This trend was fueled by an increasing demand for agricultural land where farmlands increased by 69.9%, as well as logging-legal or illegal-where grassland area increased by 37.2%. Three major drivers of forest cover change identified by the participants include human settlements, logging and expansion of farmlands. We recommend that forest policymakers and managers involve the local community, as the main stakeholders, in all levels of decision making and management so as to promote sustainable use of forest resources and improved management of the forest.

TI  - PET/CT Variants and Pitfalls in Breast Cancers
T2  - SEMINARS IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - There are a number of normal variants and pitfalls which are important to consider when evaluating F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in breast cancer patients. Although FDG-PET is not indicated for the initial diagnosis of breast cancer, focally increased glucose metabolism within breast tissue represents a high likelihood for a neoplastic process and requires further evaluation. Focally increased glucose metabolism is not unique to breast cancer. Other malignancies such as lymphoma, metastases from solid tumors as well as inflammatory changes also may demonstrate increased glucose metabolism either within the breast or at other sites throughout the body. Importantly, benign breast disease may also exhibit increased glucose metabolism, limiting the specificity of FDG-PET. Breast cancer has a wide range of metabolic activity attributed to tumor heterogeneity and breast cancer subtype. Intracellular signaling pathways regulating tumor glucose utilization contribute to these pitfalls of PET/ CT in breast cancer. The evaluation of axillary lymph nodes by FDG-PET is less accurate than sentinel lymph node procedure, however is very accurate in identifying level II and III axillary lymph node metastases or retropectoral metastases. It is important to note that non-malignant inflammation in lymph nodes are often detected by modern PET/CT technology. Therefore, particular consideration should be given to recent vaccinations, particularly to COVID-19, which can commonly result in increased metabolic activity of axillary nodes. Whole body FDG-PET for staging of breast cancer requires specific attention to physiologic variants of FDG distribution and a careful comparison with co-registered anatomical imaging. The most important pitfalls are related to inflammatory changes including sarcoidosis, sarcoid like reactions, and other granulomatous diseases as well as secondary neoplastic processes.

TI  - Assessment of ocean wave spectrum using global Envisat/ASAR data and hindcast simulation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wave mode of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is designed for the global ocean wave observations. Despite the fact that the significant wave height inferred from SAR measurements has been validated against model output and in-situ data, SAR' s primary and unique capability for operational 2-dimensional spectral description of sea state remains to be fully evaluated. In this study, we extended the previous assessment approaches by introducing a new SAR image spectral parameter, the Mean rAnge Cross-Spectrum (MACS) that focuses on the isolated wave scales along the radar line-of-sight direction. MACS is an efficient variable in that it characterizes the local wave spectra properties without need of the non-linear wave inversion procedure. The assessment is based on the multiple-year data acquired by Envisat/ASAR wave mode, along with the collocated WaveWatch III (WW3) hindcast and the in-situ buoy-observed wave spectra, for which the SAR forward transformation is systematically performed to obtain the simulated image spectra. Inter-comparison between SAR-measured and WW3-simulated MACS demonstrates that the consistency is wavelength (or wavenumber) dependent. Three typical wavelengths, around 62 m for windsea, 168 m for intermediate waves and 342 m for swell, are selected to present the MACS comparison in detail. Comparable magnitude of SAR-measured and the simulated MACS is observed for the intermediate waves and swell, while larger simulation values are predicted for the windsea waves. Spatial distribution of MACS agrees well between these two data sets for all wavelengths with high correlation coefficients (>0.8) in most of the global ocean. One exception is in the extratropics where the quantitative difference is particularly notable. In the contrary, when comparing SAR-measured and buoys-simulated MACS, the agreement increases towards the shorter (<100 m) wavelengths. We also found that the large-scale atmospheric/oceanic features persistent on SAR images lead to the overestimate of SAR MACS at long wavelengths, which is expected to bias the wave inversion. The wave spectra retrieval performance shall advance as long as such impact is properly resolved.

TI  - An Improved Algorithm for Estimating Surface Shortwave Radiation: Preliminary Evaluation With MODIS Products
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud parameters, as key inputs in radiative transfer algorithms, have a critical impact on surface shortwave radiation (SSR) computation. By introducing a parameterization of cloud transmittance and reflectance, based on radiative transfer simulations, this study improves the accuracy of an existing physically based model which severely underestimates SSR under thick cloud conditions. The cloud parameterization adopts the single-layer cloud model and simulates cloud transmittances and reflectances by varying cloud optical thickness, cloud particle size, and solar zenith angle. The revised model is applied to estimate instantaneous SSR using Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmospheric and land products. The retrieved SSR is evaluated against observation data from 41 Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) stations and is also compared with the MODIS official SSR product. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated instantaneous radiation is approximately 52 and 98 W m(-2) under clear-sky and all-sky conditions, respectively. The accuracy of the improved parameterization is higher than that of the original model, and there is no obvious underestimation of SSR in the case of high cloud optical thickness. Therefore, the new algorithm improves the accuracy of SSR estimates in the presence of thick clouds. Retrievals with the improved model also achieve higher accuracy than the MODIS official SSR product (MCD18A1). Finally, the reliable performance of the scheme at most BSRN stations illustrates that the improved model can be used to map SSR on a global scale.

T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing research on autumn vegetation phenology is limited to phenological responses to gradual climate change. Considerably less attention has been paid to extreme climate events, resulting in a substantial gap in our understanding of the climatic response mechanism of vegetation autumn phenology. Therefore, in the present study, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations to explore the responses of autumn phenology to extreme climate events (e.g., frost, heat, wetness, and drought) across the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2000 to 2018. We found that preseason drought and high heat stress generally induced early vegetation dormancy onset date (DOD) in most regions of the TP, whereas moderate heat and rainfall delayed the DOD in the agriculture and steppe ecoregions. Overall, cold and heat stress markedly affected the DOD in most ecoregions, whereas water stress (wetness and drought) mainly influenced the DOD in the meadow and steppe ecoregions. Modeling based on partial least squares regression (PLS), which considered these extreme climate events, predicted an earlier DOD (1.9-3.1 days earlier for RCP4.5 and 12.2-14.3 days earlier for RCP8.5) at the end of this century than traditional projections. Our findings demonstrate the combined influence of multiple extreme climate stress events on autumn vegetation phenology on the TP and highlight the need to integrate extreme climate events into future vegetation phenology models.

TI  - From expanding areas to stable areas: Identification, classification and determinants of multiple frequency urban heat islands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - People residing near stable urban heat islands (UHIs) experience a high long-term heat exposure, and the health consequences of such islands may be more severe than those of an expanding UHI; however, these areas are hidden in the overall heat island and not focused on. We developed a novel approach to identify the locations and ranges of stable UHIs by considering multiple frequency urban heat islands (MFUHIs). The MFUHIs were identified through multi-temporal remote sensing data and morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), and the approach was applied in the case area of Beijing, the capital city of China. Specifically, the MFUHIs in Beijing were classified according to the landscape characteristics, based on the field survey and remote sensing data. The landscape indicators included land-use types, biophysical parameters (normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), proportion of water areas, and impervious surface area (ISA)) and 3-D metrics (building density and building heights), which were considered causative factors. The relationship between the land surface temperature and landscape indicators was examined using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regressions and the Area Weighted Contribution Index (AWCI). The results showed that the MFUHIs in Beijing have four key zones, in which the surface temperature is more than 9 'C higher than the average temperature of the urban area, and the air temperature is 3.3-8.5 'C higher than the built-up temperature in the non-UHI area. The OLS regression and spatial statistics of the landscape indicators and surface temperature indicated that the regions in which area where MFUHIs occur could be characterised by a relatively high degree of impervious surface coverage, lack of green space and water area, and presence of low-rise and high-density buildings. The average number of building-floors in MFUHIs was between 1.93 and 2.64, and the number of floors in the entire study area was less than 3.6. Moreover, the building-densities in the MFUHIs were 16.25% to 27.62% higher than that in the whole study area. According to the result of the AWCI and field survey, the MFUHIs were classified into transportation, historical block, commercial, and city village high-temperature centre. The main findings indicated that certain regions between the city centre and rural areas, in which sound planning is not implemented, are the hotspots of UHI mitigation and risk elimination regions. The proposed approach can help policymakers develop targeted mitigation strategies in urban planning.

TI  - Constructing a 30m African Cropland Layer for 2016 by Integrating Multiple Remote sensing, crowdsourced, and Auxiliary Datasets
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite its essential importance to various spatial agriculture and environmental applications, the information on actual cropland area and its geographical distribution remain highly uncertain over Africa among remote-sensing products. Each of the African regions has its unique physical and environmental limiting factors to accurate cropland mapping, which leads to high spatial discrepancies among remote sensing cropland products. Since no dataset could cope with all limitations, multiple datasets initially derived from various remote sensing sensors and classification techniques must be integrated into a more accurate cropland product than individual layers. Here, in the current study, four cropland products, produced initially from multiple sensors (e.g. Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI, and PROBA-V) to cover the period (2015-2017), were integrated based on their cropland mapping accuracy to build a more accurate cropland layer. The four cropland layers' accuracy was assessed at Agro-ecological zones units via an intensive reference dataset (17,592 samples). The most accurate cropland layer was then identified for each zone to construct the final cropland mask at 30 m resolution for the nominal year of 2016 over Africa. As a result, the new layer was produced in higher cropland mapping accuracy (overall accuracy = 91.64% and cropland's F-score = 0.75). The layer mapped the African cropland area as 282 Mha (9.38% of the Continent area). Compared to earlier cropland synergy layers, the constructed cropland mask showed a considerable improvement in its spatial resolution (30 m instead of 250 m), mapping quality, and closeness to official statistics (R-2 = 0.853 and RMSE = 2.85 Mha). The final layer can be downloaded as described under the "Data Availability Statement" section.

TI  - <i>ReSVA:</i> A MATLAB method to co-register and mosaic airborne video-based remotely sensed data
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne remotely sensed data (e.g. hyperspectral imagery, thermal videography, full frame RGB photography) often requires post-processing to be combined into a series of images or a mosaic for analysis. This is generally accomplished through the use of position and attitude hardware (i.e. Global Navigation Satellite System - GNSS / Inertial Measurement Unit - IMU) in combination with specialized software. Occasionally, hardware failure in the GNSS/IMU instrumentation occurs, however the data are still recoverable through a correction process, which allows image registration to mosaic the data. Here we present a simple and flexible MATLAB (R) code package that has been developed to combine video-based remotely sensed data. It first applies an iterative image registration process to align all frames, using pre-existing GPS information if supplied by the user, and then grids the frame data together to develop a final, single mosaic dataset that can be used for analysis. An example of this method using airborne infrared video data of a wildfire is shown as a demonstration.MATLAB functions are easily adaptable to specific user needs and datasets.The method outputs the combined data and positional information in three separate MATLAB variables that can be readily used for analysis in MATLAB or exported for use in other software.

TI  - Adapting sudden landslide identification product (SLIP) and detecting real-time increased precipitation (DRIP) algorithms to map rainfall-triggered landslides in Western Cameroon highlands (Central-Africa)
T2  - GEOENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background NASA's developers recently proposed the Sudden Landslide Identification Product (SLIP) and Detecting Real-Time Increased Precipitation (DRIP) algorithms. This double method uses Landsat 8 satellite images and daily rainfall data for a real-time mapping of this geohazard. This study adapts the processing to face the issues of data quality and unavailability/gaps for the mapping of the recent landslide events in west-Cameroon's highlands. Methods The SLIP algorithm is adapted, by integrating the inverse Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to assess the soil bareness, the Modified Normalized Multi-Band Drought Index (MNMDI) combined with the hydrothermal index to assess soil moisture, and the slope inclination to map the recent landslide. Further, the DRIP algorithm uses the mean daily rainfall to assess the thresholds corresponding to the recent landslide events. Their probability density function (PDF) curves are superimposed and their intersections are used to propose sets of dichotomous variables before (1948-2018) and after the 28 October 2019 landslide event. In addition, a survival analysis is performed to correlate landslide occurrence to rainfall, with the first known event in Cameroon as starting point, and using the Cox model. Results From the SLIP model, the Landslide Hazard Zonation (LHZ) map gives an overall accuracy of 96%. Further, the DRIP model states that 6/9 ranges of probability are rainfall-triggered landslides at 99.99%, between June and October, while 3/9 ranges show only 4.88% of risk for the same interval. Finally, the survival probability for a known site is up to 0.68 for the best value and between 0.38 and 0.1 for the lowest value through time. Conclusions The proposed approach is an alternative based on data (un)availability, completed by the site's lifetime analysis for a more flexibility in observation and prediction thresholding.

TI  - A new hybrid method for epithermal gold exploration using multi-sensor satellite data in Sistan and Baluchestan Province (Iran)
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data provide a useful piece of information for initial identification of alteration zones, lithological units and structures in relation to mineralization, saving time and cost. In this research, silicic, argillic and propylitic alteration zones with gold mineralization in Taftan area in Sistan and Baluchestan province (Iran) were identified by thermal infrared (TIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR) and visible-near infrared (VNIR) bands of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat-8 data. Detecting altered and mineralized zones of epithermal gold were conducted using a conventional hybrid method of band ratio in false coloured composite (BR-FCC), and a new hybrid method including, constrained energy minimization in false coloured composite (CEM-FCC). The hybrid methods of the BR-FCC (BRs in RGB) identified the silicic area and places, containing clay and secondary iron minerals. Furthermore, the advanced argillic, argillic and propylitic alteration zones detected and derived in altered areas specifically to the northwest of Taftan, in Kharestan and Bidester deposits using the hybrid methods of the CEM-FCC (CEMs in RGB). Results of image processing showed two new prospective altered places to the northeast of Kharestan deposit and to the northwest of Taftan volcano.

TI  - Exploring Topographic Effects on Surface Parameters Over Rugged Terrains at Various Spatial Scales
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Topography is an inevitable factor when processing remote sensing data. Slope and aspect are sufficient for describing topographic conditions within a fine-scale pixel (e.g., 30 m); the resulting schematic is referred to as a sloping terrain and is modeled as a solo slope. A composite slope, which contains many solo slopes that are collectively referred to as rugged terrain, is needed for coarse-scale pixels (e.g., 1 km). However, many parameter estimation algorithms use topographic approximation methods, such as the assumption of a flat surface, assumption of a solo slope, omission of contributions from adjacent slopes, and usage of the terrain view factor (TVF) to approximate adjacent contributions. These topographic approximations can induce significant errors over mountain areas; however, errors caused by various approximation methods have not been comprehensively analyzed. This study summarizes radiative transfer (RT) processes over rugged terrains, proposes composite-slope models for surface parameters, and analyzes the influences of different topographic approximation methods on surface reflectance (rho), directional brightness temperature ( ${T_{b}}$ ), surface net radiation ( ${E_{n}}$ ), slope downward radiation ( ${E_{d}}$ ), absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), total emitted solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) by all leaves ( ${F_{e}}$ ), SIF observed at the top of the canopy ( ${F_{o}}$ ), broadband albedo (alpha), and broadband hemispherical emissivity (epsilon) at a series of spatial resolutions (30, 90, 270, 540, 1080, and 5400 m). Three surface types are tested: vegetation, soil, and snow. The results demonstrate that: 1) assumptions of a flat surface or a solo slope and the use of the TVF method induce significant errors (1%-58%) in all aforementioned parameters; 2) adjacent contributions can be neglected when simulating epsilon, APAR, ${F_{o}}$ , ${F_{e}}$ , and low-reflective rho; and 3) adjacent contributions should be considered for ${E_{n}}$ , ${E_{d}}$ , and high-reflective rho, and they are also significant when simulating alpha using fine-resolution data or over snow surfaces. These findings and the composite-slope models developed in this study benefit those who intend to conduct forward modeling and parameter estimation studies over rugged terrains.

TI  - Spatio-temporal modeling of PM<sub>2.5</sub> risk mapping using three machine learning algorithms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban air pollution is one of the most critical issues that affect the environment, community health, economy, and management of urban areas. From a public health perspective, PM2.5 is one of the primary air pollutants, especially in Tehran's metropolis. Owing to the different patterns of PM2.5 in different seasons, Spatio-temporal modeling and identification of high-risk areas to reduce its effects seems necessary. The purpose of this study was Spatio-temporal modeling and preparation of PM2.5 risk mapping using three machine learning algorithms (random forest (RF), AdaBoost, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD)) in the metropolis of Tehran, Iran. Therefore, in the first step, to prepare the dependent variable data, the PM2.5 average was used for the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Then, using remote sensing (RS) and a geographic information system (GIS), independent data such as temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind speed, rainfall, humidity, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), population density, street density, and distance to industrial centers were prepared as a seasonal average. To Spatio-temporal modeling using machine learning algorithms, 70% of the data were used for training and 30% for validation. The frequency ratio (FR) model was used as input to machine learning algorithms to calculate the spatial relationship between PM2.5 and the effective parameters. Finally, Spatio-temporal modeling and PM2.5 risk mapping were performed using three machine learning algorithms. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) results showed that the RF algorithm had the greatest modeling accuracy, with values of 0.926, 0.94, 0.949, and 0.949 for spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. According to the RF model, the most important variable in spring and autumn was NDVI. Temperature and distance to industrial centers were the most important variables in the summer and winter, respectively. The results showed that autumn, winter, summer, and spring had the highest risk of PM2.5, respectively.

TI  - Importance of individual sample of training data in modified possibilistic <i>c</i>-means classifier for handling heterogeneity within a specific crop
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing images, pixel-based classifiers use means or variance-covariance statistical parameters generated from training sample data sets. These parameters do not represent in totality about variations within the class. This research work enlightens each training sample's role in handling heterogeneity within the class instead of using statistical parameters (mean). Modified possibilistic c-means fuzzy algorithm, capable of single class mapping, has been experimented to handle heterogeneity within the class. The mapping of mustard, wheat, and grass classes has been conducted using multispectral temporal images of Sentinel-2A/2B of Banasthali, Rajasthan region. It has been observed that while using individual samples in place of statistical parameters in fuzzy-based classifiers, the individual class identified has been least affected due to heterogeneity within the class. Mean membership difference for favorable and non-favorable classes as well as F-score, kappa, and overall accuracy have been calculated. Through all these parameters, individual samples as mean outperformed other training approaches. (C) 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Indigenous land systems and emerging of Green Infrastructure planning in the Peruvian coastal desert: tensions and opportunities
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - For many, Green Infrastructure (GI) is a modern ecological planning concept focusing on stormwater runoff. This paper argues for the importance of Indigenous Knowledge (IK) in GI planning and policy through the case study of the Tumbes Basin. The Basin serves as home to a diverse array of Pre-Hispanic Indigenous networked agro-ecological practices and landscape interventions guided by a worldview marrying humans and landscapes dating back to immemorial times of human habitation in the Americas (similar to 36,000 BP). By 900 BCE-1100 CE this planned regional network was actively managing landslides, stormwater runoff, and riverine flooding, all challenges are currently being exacerbated by climate change and urban development. Today, this landscape-level network is one of the biggest GI systems in Peru and yet remains unacknowledged in emergent GI policy and planning. By examining existing Peruvian scholarship on landscape practices, and visualizing Pre-Hispanic landscape networks in the Tumbes Basin, this study makes the case for Peruvian GI policy to be guided by Indigenous Knowledge and governance systems. Such a transformation requires a deeper integration of Indigenous conceptualizations of GI with other infrastructure systems and regional urban planning and design.

TI  - Prognostic significance of occult lymph node metastases in breast cancer: a meta-analysis
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Occult metastases in axillary lymph nodes have been reported to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. However, studies on the prognostic value of occult metastases have shown controversial results. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of occult lymph node metastases in breast cancer. Methods Studies published until May, 2020, which retrospectively examined negative lymph nodes by stepsectioning and/or immunohistochemistry, were retrieved from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CNKI, and Cochrane Library databases. The pooled Relative Risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were calculated to examine the associations between occult metastases and prognosis. Results Patients with occult metastases in axillary lymph nodes had poorer five-year DFS (RR = 0.930; 95% CI = 0.907-0.954) and OS (RR = 0.972; 95% CI = 0.954-0.990). Furthermore, the DFS (RR = 0.887; 95% CI = 0.810-0.972) and OS (RR = 0.896; 95% CI = 0.856-0.939) of patients with occult metastases were significantly lower after a ten-year follow-up. Conclusions Occult metastases in the axillary lymph nodes are associated with poorer DFS andOS of patients with breast cancer. Occult metastases might serve as a predictive factor of survival outcomes in patients with breast cancer.

T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate, long time-series, high-resolution mapping of built-up land dynamics is essential for understanding urbanization and its environmental impacts. Despite advances in remote sensing and classification algorithms, built-up land mapping which only uses spectral data and derived indices remains prone to uncertainty. We mapped the extent of built-up land in the North China Plain, one of China's most important agricultural regions, from 1990 to 2019 at three-yearly intervals and 30 m spatial resolution. We applied Discrete Fourier Transformation to dense time-stack Landsat data to create Fourier predictors to reduce mapping uncertainty. As a result, we improved the overall accuracy of built-up land mapping by 8% compared to using spectral data and derived indices. In addition, a temporal correction algorithm applied to remove misclassified pixels further improved mapping accuracy to a consistently high level (>94%) over the time periods. A cross-product comparison showed that our maps achieved the highest accuracies across all years. The built-up land area in the North China Plain increased from 37,941 km(2) in 1990-1992 to 131,578 km(2) in 2017-2019. Consistent, high-accuracy, long time-series built-up land mapping provides a reliable basis for formulating policy and planning in one of the most rapidly urbanizing regions on this planet.

TI  - What if consumers saw the bigger picture? Systems thinking and the adoption of bio-based consumer products
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Systems thinking (ST) represents an important cognitive paradigm for the transition towards a circular bioeconomy, as greater awareness of the environmental impact of fossil-based products may lead to a switch to sustainable alternatives produced from secondary biomass which is not used as feed or food. However, the relationship between ST and the adoption of bio-based products, as well as the general mechanism of how ST affects environmental behavior, is not yet well-understood. The present study therefore aims to close these research gaps by conducting a survey-based experiment with a ST-motivated treatment, in which participants are asked to list as many consequences of their consumption behavior as possible (N=446 US consumers). Our findings suggest that the treatment is able to slightly activate a ST perspective, along with indirectly affecting consumer intentions to buy bio-based products by means of ST. Subsequent mediation analyses further reveal that an ecological worldview as well as variables from the norm-activation model function as mediators of the relationship between ST and purchase intention.

TI  - Regional differences in hourly rainfall characteristics over the southeastern extension of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The southeastern extension of the Tibetan Plateau (SETP) is distributed by the typical longitudinal mountains and has unique climate characteristics and significant regional differences. The diurnal cycles of rainfall amount, frequency, and intensity over the SETP in the warm seasons (May-September) were investigated using high-density hourly station rainfall data and the possible mechanisms were discussed by analysing the ERA5 reanalysis and satellite data. The largest amounts of rainfall appeared on the southern and western margins of the SETP, and the rainfall amount was relatively small at the higher elevations of the SETP. Located at the southern margins of the SETP, the adjacent western (Reg_W) and eastern (Reg_E) regions presented a similar rainfall amount, frequency, and intensity, but the diurnal features of the two regions were quite different. The rainfall amount, frequency, and intensity had dominant peaks in the late afternoon in Reg_W, while in the early morning in Reg_E. A secondary peak in the early morning can be found in Reg_W. The diurnal features of the two regions were closely related with the low-level atmospheric conditions and the distribution of clouds. The enhanced convergence of the anomalous southerly winds and sufficient water vapour after midnight contributed to the nocturnal rainfall at the southern edge of the SETP. In the afternoon, the lower surface air temperature and more stable stratification in Reg_E, as compared with Reg_W, were relatively unfavourable for the occurrence of afternoon convection.

TI  - The First Validation of Sentinel-3 OLCI Integrated Water Vapor Products Using Reference GPS Data in Mainland China
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The integrated water vapor (IWV) products collected from June 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020 from the ocean and land color instrument (OLCI) sensor, onboard the Sentinel-3 satellites, are evaluated against reference water vapor data estimated from ground-based 214 global positioning system (GPS) stations in the Mainland China. This is the first time to thoroughly evaluate the quality of Sentinel-3 OLCI IWV products by in situ GPS-measured IWV data from such a large spatial coverage as China. The validation results show that, under cloud-free conditions, the OLCI IWV measurements agree very well with the ground-based GPS water vapor data, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.03 mm for Sentinel-3A satellite and 3.13 mm for Sentinel-3B satellite. The dependence of OLCI IWV on various parameters was also analyzed. Analysis showed that the accuracy of inland OLCI IWV products was superior to that in coastal areas and that OLCI tended to overestimate IWV value in lower elevation and underestimate IWV value in higher elevation. The accuracy of OLCI IWV measurements increased as IWV decreased. Solar zenith angle analysis showed that the OLCI IWV product had a higher accuracy at a larger solar zenith angle. In spring and winter, the OLCI IWV observations had higher accuracy than those in summer and autumn. OLCI IWV tended to underestimate IWV value in most land cover types. Except for the polar climatic zone, the Sentinel-3 OLCI IWV products tended to overestimate IWV value. The validation results against previous studies were also discussed in this work.

TI  - Stepwise Limited Axillary Lymph Node Dissection Based on Lymphatic Drainage from the Breast to Decrease Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Comprehensive axillary surgery is associated with an elevated rate of morbidity. This trial aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of axillary dissection of lymph nodes from the breast (bALND) for the purpose of limiting the extent of surgery. Methods Patients enrolled from two tertiary referral centers from September 2018 to September 2019 were randomly allocated to two groups: bALND and standard axillary lymph node dissection (sALND). In the bALND group, the sentinel lymph node was filled with 0.1 ml methylene blue before resection. Then, bALND based on lymphatic drainage was subsequently performed. Lymph nodes at each breast lymphatic level and lymph nodes at Berg levels were sent for separate pathological examination. Arm lymphedema, locoregional recurrence, and distant metastasis were documented. Results In the bALND group, lymphatic vessels and subsequent-echelon lymph nodes from the breast were stained blue after injection of methylene blue in 404 (89.0%, 404/454) cases, and 57.8% (228/394) of the patients harbored fewer than four metastatic nodes. With a median follow-up of 18 months, the incidence of arm lymphedema was 6.6% (26/394) in the bALND group versus 13.7% (60/438) in the sALND group (p = 0.008), while regional recurrence presented no difference between the two surgical procedures (0.76% vs 0.68%, p = 0.896). Conclusion For node-positive breast cancer patients, bALND based on lymphatic drainage is a less radical axillary surgery that can eliminate morbidity without impairing cancer control.

TI  - A satellite-derived, ground-measurement-independent monthly PM<sub>2.5</sub> mass concentration dataset over China during 2000-2015
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Following the accelerated development of urbanization and industrialization, atmospheric particulate matter has become a significant threat to public health globally. Environmental health studies usually use the mass concentration of fine particles (PM2.5) as a base data to predict the health risks of particulate exposure. However, PM2.5 data from ground monitoring stations in China has not been provided until January 2013 by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China. Hence, an alternative dataset of PM2.5 spatiotemporal distributions extending to years earlier than 2013 is urgently needed, which is of great significance to atmospheric environment assessment and pollution prevention and control. Atmospheric aerosol products by the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) have been released since 2000, which provides the possibility to reconstruct historical PM2.5. However, most current methods do not have the ability to estimate PM2.5 mass concentration independently of ground observations. The PM2.5 mass concentration data set produced by PM2.5 remote sensing (PMRS) model based on physical processes does not depend on the ground observations, and also is not affected by the uncertainty of model emission sources or the completeness of chemical reaction mechanism. These ensure that the point-by-point validation for PM2.5 mass concentration data is more convincing, and the dataset can also be further used for model assimilation and artificial intelligence training to improve their predictions. In this study, we calculate the monthly PM2.5 mass concentration near the ground over land of China using aerosol inversion products (aerosol optical depth and fine-mode fraction) of MODIS and meteorological data (boundary layer height & relative humidity) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2) data set. The results show that, in China, 6 pollution centers mainly concentrated in the central and eastern regions. The highest PM2.5 mass concentration occurred in winter, whereas the pollution range was larger in summer. There are 63.4% of validation sites with biases within +/- 20 mu g m(-3), and the expected error is as +/-(15 mu g m(-3) + 30%) enveloped by the monthly mean PM2.5 mass concentrations. The monthly PM2.5 is stored as NETCDF format, with a spatial resolution of 1 degrees x1 degrees. The published data is available in .

TI  - Adaptive AOD Forecast Model Based on GNSS-Derived PWV and Meteorological Parameters
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is one of the basic parameters for determining the total aerosol content, and it exerts an important impact on regional environment pollution. To investigate the spatiotemporal variations of AOD, this study analyzes the relationship of AOD with precipitable water vapor (PWV) derived from a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and meteorological parameters and proposes an adaptive AOD forecasting (AAF) model. In this model, the initial AOD value is determined using an empirical AOD model that considers annual periodicity, and the AOD difference is fitted using PWV, temperature (T), and surface pressure (P). In addition, this model also considers the time autocorrelation of the AOD difference; the model coefficients can be adaptively updated with training data. AOD data at 550 nm derived from the aerosol robotic network (AERONET), second modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications (MERRA-2), and Copernicus atmosphere monitoring service (CAMS) for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area are utilized to validate the proposed AAF model. Numerical results show that: 1) the accuracy of AOD derived from MERRA-2 is superior to that obtained from CAMS; 2) AOD is negatively correlated with P, is positively correlated with PWV and T, and has a high time autocorrelation with the AOD difference at consecutive times; and 3) the proposed AAF model demonstrates better performance than the traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) model. The average root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and bias of the AAF model are 0.17, 0.14, and -0.04, respectively, and those of the MLR model are 0.31, 0.25, and 0.06, respectively. These results reveal that the proposed AAF model can estimate AOD with high precision and has considerable potential for application in AAF research.

TI  - RFI Source Detection Based on Reweighted <i>l</i><sub>1</sub>-Norm Minimization for Microwave Interferometric Radiometry
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radio frequency interference (RFI) seriously deteriorates the quality of the retrieval of geophysical parameters, e.g., Earth surface moisture and ocean salinity, measured in microwave interferometric radiometry (MIR). The accurate detection of RFI sources is crucial for locating these illegal sources and mitigating their impact. In this article, we propose a new method based on reweighted l(1)-norm minimization to detect RFI sources. First, we exploit the sparsity of RFI sources in the spatial domain and formulate the RFI detection as a problem of reweighted l(1)-norm minimization, by which the RFI signals can be well recovered and the background noises can be suppressed. Then, we present two algorithms, termed RL1 and NRL1, to achieve RFI source detection. The RL1 algorithm employs a fast iterative shrinkage thresholding (FIST) technique, and the NRL1 algorithm combines the FIST with a neighbor-reweighting strategy that helps to further enhance the RFI target regions. Finally, simulations and experiments using Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite data demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on the RFI-signal-to-background ratio (RSBR) in recovered images and the detection performance of RFI sources, compared with the existing RFI processing methods in MIR.

TI  - Precise inland surface altimetry (PISA) with nadir specular echoes from Sentinel-3: Algorithm and performance assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the recent years satellite radar altimetry has evolved from pulse-limited low resolution mode (LRM) to a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) high resolution mode. The SAR mode focusses and coherently sums all radar return echoes within the 2-s time window the target surface area is in the antenna beam. In principle the SAR processing improves along-track resolution. Land contamination has been a major concern for inland waters altimetry and SAR can reduce land interference. This paper shows that the physics of specular echoes from smooth inland waters leads to a very different approach which we call precise inland surface altimetry (PISA). PISA uses only echoes within the specular "flash" period, which is approximately the time the satellite nadir crosses over the water body. The processing is four orders of magnitude less than SAR. Land interference is negligible because specular water echoes are usually >50 dB greater than land. Sentinel-3 SRAL dataset on the salar de Uyuni (Bolivia) is used to evaluate PISA ranging precision. During inundation (wet months), echoes are at the theoretical maximum radar cross section (RCS), sigma = 129 dBsm, and ranging precision is -1 mm. In dry months the echoes are quasi-specular, with sigma = 70-100 dBsm, and ranging precision is -1 cm. The precision assessment is made with variate-differences, with pass-to-pass repeatability, and by comparison with GPS measurements. In addition to the salar de Uyuni analysis we gathered sigma statistics on five millions Sentinel-3 SRAL Ku-band altimeter bursts (one burst = 64 contiguous echoes) from 52 passes of Sentinel-3A track 167 over South America. We illustrate specular and quasi-specular waters on lakes, a river, and a fjord. Ranging precision is similar to Uyuni, in the 1 mm-1 cm range. Water surface slopes of 1-3 cm/km are detected. We propose a simple rule-set to distinguish specular waveforms (sigma >100 dBsm, sidelobes (with Hamming window) of -37 dB or lower) and quasi-specular (sigma >70 dBsm, sidelobes lower than -20 dB), and non-specular (sidelobes> - 20 dB). PISA is appropriate to specular and quasi-specular echoes.

TI  - Sentinel serosurveillance of backyard hens proved West Nile virus circulation in the western provinces of Turkey
T2  - VETERINARY MEDICINE AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus of a re-emergence importance with a wide range of vertebrate hosts. Granted, it causes asymptomatic infection, but fatal cases and neurologic disorders were also recorded, especially in humans, horses and some exposed birds. The virus is globally spread and birds are considered an amplifying and reservoir host of WNV, helping to spread the disease due to their close contact with main hosts. In this study, we aimed to detect the presence of antibodies against WNV in backyard hens that were reared in the western Anatolian part of Turkey. A total of 480 chicken sera were randomly collected from six provinces in the west of Turkey (Mugla, Izmir, Aydin, Afyonkarahisar, Kutahya and Manisa) with 80 samples from each province (40 in spring and 40 in fall seasons). They were tested by using a competitive ELISA method to identify the specific avian antibodies of IgG that produced against the WNV envelope proteins (pr-E). Twelve of 480 (2.5%) sera were found seropositive, three of these positive sera were detected from the Izmir province (3.75%) collected in the spring session and the other nine positive sera were detected from the Mugla province (11.25%) collected in the fall session. Both of these provinces are located seaside and have suitable climate conditions for vectors of infection. The results indicated that WNV infection is in circulation in these provinces, and that may put the other susceptible vertebrates under risk of infection.

TI  - Generous with individuals and selfish to the masses
T2  - NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR
M3  - Article
AB  - The seemingly rampant economic selfishness suggested by many recent corporate scandals is at odds with empirical results from behavioural economics, which demonstrate high levels of prosocial behaviour in bilateral interactions and low levels of dishonest behaviour. We design an experimental setting, the 'Big Robber' game, where a 'robber' can obtain a large personal gain by appropriating the earnings of a large group of 'victims'. In a large laboratory experiment (N = 640), more than half of all robbers took as much as possible and almost nobody declined to rob. However, the same participants simultaneously displayed standard, predominantly prosocial behaviour in Dictator, Ultimatum and Trust games. Thus, we provide direct empirical evidence showing that individual selfishness in high-impact decisions affecting a large group is compatible with prosociality in bilateral low-stakes interactions. That is, human beings can simultaneously be generous with others and selfish with large groups.Alos-Ferrer et al. introduce the Big Robber game to study selfish and generous behaviour within the same person. Most people were willing to steal half the earnings of a large group if their personal gain exceeded euro100, but the same people were generous towards individuals.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST), surface chlorophyll (SChl), Sea surface salinity (SSS), and total suspended solids (TSS) are some critical seawater quality parameters (SWQP) in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) of Bangladesh. The research objectives were to investigate the distribution of SST, SChl, SSS, and TSS in the Summer and Winter seasons of 2014, 2018, and 2020 and denominate the spatial and temporal variation of these parameters in the BoB. The MODIS-Aqua, VIIRS-SNPP level-3 ocean color, and Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS multitemporal images were used and the Geographical Information System (GIS), and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques were applied for inter-preting and mapping the output. The results asserted that temporally in the Summer season SChl and SSS increased by 11.02% and 7.96% respectively and TSS decreased by 14.25% from 2014 to 2020. On the other hand, in the Winter season, SST and SSS decreased by 3.37% and 3.38% respectively and SChl and TSS increased by 2.32% and 70.95% respectively from 2014 to 2020. Besides, in the Summer season, the maximum values of SST, SChl, and TSS were 30.16 degrees C, 2.61 mg/m(3), 268.45 mg/l respectively and in the Winter season, the maximum values were 25.06 degrees C, 2.93 mg/m(3), 192.31 mg/l respectively. Spatially, all the maximum values of SST, SChl, and TSS were concentrated in areas near the coastline. Contrary, the maximum values of SSS were 29.01 ppt and 31.21 ppt in the Summer and Winter seasons respectively and both values were coagulated in the open sea area. Seasonally, The SST and TSS were higher in the Summer season and SChl and SSS were higher in the Winter season for all the years in the BoB.

TI  - Identifying hydrothermally altered rocks using ASTER satellite imageries in Eastern Anti-Atlas of Morocco: a case study from Imiter silver mine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Imiter silver mine in the Eastern Anti-Atlas metallogenic province, Eastern Morocco, is a world-class silver ore deposit. This region has potential for undiscovered silver mineralisation and deserves a detailed remote-sensing study. In this study, Crosta, band ratios and mixture-tuned matched-filtering (MTMF) methods were applied to ASTER remote-sensing data. Argillic, phyllic and propylitic alteration zones were identified using specialised band ratios and Crosta techniques. Sub-pixel abundances of goethite, haematite, limonite, muscovite/illite, chlorite/epidote, jarosite and kaolinite/alunite were detected using MTMF algorithm. Accordingly, several alteration zones were identified and delimited in the central, northern, southern and northeastern parts of the study region, which can be considered as high prospective zones. GPS survey, analysis of thin and polish sections, XRD and geochemical survey verified the alteration zones and sulphide mineralisation in high prospective zones. This approach can be applied in other parts of the Eastern Anti-Atlas metallogenic province to explore hydrothermal ore deposits.

TI  - Debate: Postmastectomy Radiation Therapy in T1/2N1 Disease
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although postmastectomy radiation therapy is known to reduce local recurrence in patients with T1/2N1 breast cancer, some have postulated that not all patients require this treatment. In this era of genomic analyses and personalized therapy, clinicians have debated whether the toxicity of post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) can be avoided for some subsets of patients. However, the data in this regard remain controversial, particularly as surgeons de-escalate the surgical management of the axilla. Several ongoing clinical trials may provide a glimpse into optimal management in this scenario. However, the "right" answer to this debate currently remains unclear.

TI  - Invasive Lobular Breast Cancer: Data to Support Surgical Decision Making
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is thought be a unique entity with higher rates of multifocal/multicentric and bilateral disease. This study aimed to evaluate the true extent of the disease, risk of bilaterality, lymph node involvement, and impact of preoperative imaging to help guide surgical decision making. Methods A retrospective analysis identified patients treated for ILC between 2004 and 2017. Clinical staging and pathologic results were compared. Follow-up details including local recurrence, contralateral breast cancer (CBC), and survival outcomes were evaluated. Results The study identified 692 patients with ILC, including 43 patients (6%) with a diagnosis of CBC and 232 patients (33%) with a diagnosis of multifocal/multicentric disease at presentation. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) led to an identification of additional disease in 20% of the patients. Preoperative MRI resulted in a more accurate prediction of tumor size staging but did not improve the discordance between clinical and pathologic nodal staging. Overall, the rate of imaging occult lymph node disease was 24%. At the 6-year follow-up evaluation, a local recurrence had developed in 2.3%, a CBC in 2.3, and a distant metastasis in 9.4% of the patients. The overall survival rate was 96% at 3 years and 91% at 5 years. Conclusions Invasive lobular carcinoma is a distinct subset of cancer that poses a diagnostic staging challenge. The results of this study favor MRI for accurate tumor staging and for improving detection of multicentricity and bilaterality. However, clinicians should be aware of the higher likelihood of occult lymph node involvement with ILC and subsequent early metastasis.

TI  - Temporal variability in evapotranspiration and energy partitioning over a seasonally flooded scrub forest of the Brazilian Pantanal
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian Pantanal is the largest seasonal wetland in the world and it plays an important role in regulating the local and global water cycle and energy balance. The Pantanal landscape consists of a mosaic of temporary and permanent aquatic habitats, floodable and non-floodable pastures, and forests; however, patterns of energy exchange are poorly understood, especially for seasonally flooded forests. Thus, the main objective of this research was to assess the variability of evapotranspiration (ET) and to evaluate biophysical controls on ET for a seasonally flooded scrub-forest. We used eddy covariance to measure latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat fluxes and linked both micrometeorological and remote sensing data to assess the connection between water dynamics and phenology. Our data suggest that 72% of the net radiation (Rn) was consumed by LE + H, even during the dry season, indicating that trees can access deep water when surface water is limiting. The decoupling factor (0.63 +/- 0.08) suggests that the canopy is decoupled from the atmosphere and ET is essentially sensitive to Rn. The patterns of ET and vapor pressure deficit suggest that ET was more dependent on the Rn received and less dependent on stomatal control, but still exhibited a strong relationship with biotic factors such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI), which is sensitive to seasonal variations in leaf area index and canopy cover. Stomatal limitations of this seasonally flooded forest appear to be minimal, even in the dry season, presumably due to the relatively high-water table, the ability of trees to acquire subsurface water, and the predominance of secondary species with high rates of leaf gas exchange. These data indicate that seasonally flooded tropical forests of the Pantanal are consistent sources of water vapor to the atmosphere even during seasonal drought.

TI  - Formation, evolution, and drainage of short-lived glacial lakes in permafrost environments of the northern Teskey Range, Central Asia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Teskey Range of the Tien Shan (Kyrgyz Republic), five outburst flood disasters from short-lived glacial lakes in 2006, 2008, 2013, 2014, and 2019 caused severe damages in the downstream part. Short-lived glacial lakes in the Teskey Range grow rapidly and drain within a few months, due to closure and opening of an outlet ice tunnel in an ice-cored moraine complex at the glacier front. In addition to these factors, summer meltwater from the glacier can cause rapid growth. Outburst floods of this lake type are a major hazard in this region and differ from the morainedam failures common to the eastern Himalaya. To clarify how short-lived glacial lakes store and drain water over short periods, we use results from a field survey and satellite data to analyze the water level, area, volume, and discharge of Korumdu lake (2017-2019) as well as satellite data to monitor the appearance of 160 other short-lived lakes (2013-2018). Except in 2016, Korumdu lake appeared and drained within about 1 month during all the summers. Water level data recorded by a data logger and time-lapse camera images show that the lake appeared and expanded suddenly from July to August in 2017-2019. The timing of lake appearance indicates that the lake formed when an outlet ice tunnel (subsurface channel) drainage was blocked by depositions of an ice-debris mixture due to ice melting and not by freezing of stored water. For 2017, we used uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-derived digital surface models (DSMs) and water levels, finding that the lake's volume reached 234 000 m(3) within 29 d, and then the water discharged for 17 d at a maximum rate of 0.66 m(3)/s. This discharge rate is more than 20 times smaller than those found earlier (2006-2014) for four short-lived lakes of tunnel type in this region. We argue that this large variation in discharge rates is due to variation in the dimensions of the outlet ice tunnels. For the 160 other short-lived glacial lakes, we found that 117 formed during the ice-melt period from July to September. This timing and our findings for Korumdu lake show that these 117 lakes likely formed primarily because deposition of an ice-debris mixture blocked the outlet tunnel, though increased glacial melt would also have contributed. In the Teskey Range, the appearance of short-lived glacial lakes on the moraine complexes at glacier fronts is inevitable in summer when the melting rate is high Similar behavior of short-lived lakes may occur in other mountain regions of Central Asia, such as the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains, wherever ice-cored moraine complexes exist within mountain permafrost zone. Moreover, increasing temperatures may increase both tunnel size and lake-basin size (lake volume), leading to increased hazard potential from such lakes in the future.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Change Impact on Hydrological Process in the Upper Baro Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the hydrological process associated with Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) change is vital for decision-makers in improving human wellbeing. LU/LC change significantly affects the hydrology of the landscape, caused by anthropogenic activities. The scope of this study is to investigate the impact of LU/LC change on the hydrological process of Upper Baro Basin for the years 1987, 2002, and 2017. The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used for the simulation of the streamflow. The required data for the SWAT model are soils obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization; Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and LU/LC were obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The meteorological data such as Rainfall, Temperature, Sunshine, Humidity, and Wind Speeds were obtained from the Ethiopian National Meteorological Agency. Data on discharge were obtained from Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Electricity. Ecosystems are deemed vital. Landsat images were used to classify the LU/LC pattern using ERDAS Imagine 2014 software and the LU/LC were classified using the Maximum Likelihood Algorithm of Supervised Classification. The Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) global sensitivity method within SWAT Calibration and Uncertainty Procedures (SWAT-CUP) was used to identify the most sensitive streamflow parameters. The calibration was carried out using observed streamflow data from 01 January 1990 to 31 December 2002 and a validation period from 01 January 2003 to 31 December 2009. LU/LC analysis shows that there was a drastic decrease of grassland by 15.64% and shrubland by 9.56% while an increase of agricultural land and settlement by 18.01% and 13.01%, respectively, for 30 years. The evaluation of the SWAT model presented that the annual surface runoff increased by 43.53 mm, groundwater flow declined by 27.58 mm, and lateral flow declined by 5.63 mm. The model results showed that the streamflow characteristics changed due to the LU/LC change during the study periods 1987-2017 such as change of flood frequency, increased peak flows, base flow, soil erosion, and annual mean discharge. Curve number, an available water capacity of the soil layer, and soil evaporation composition factor were the most sensitive parameters identified for the streamflow. Both the calibration and validation results disclosed a good agreement between measured and simulated streamflow. The performance of the model statistical test shows the coefficient of determination (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) efficiency values 0.87 and 0.81 for calibration periods of 1990-2002 and 0.84 and 0.76 for the validation period of 2003 to 2009, respectively. Overall, LU/LC significantly affected the hydrological condition of the watershed. Therefore, different conservation strategies to maintain the stability and resilience of the ecosystem are vital.

TI  - Vygotsky's decolonial pedagogical legacy in the 21st century: back to the future
T2  - MIND CULTURE AND ACTIVITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This largely theoretical paper traces the continued influence that the work of Vygotsky has in studying teaching/learning in schools. The advent of the 21(st) century has led to a call for novel pedagogical models to enable children think in ways pertinent to our technologically based societies. Currently, the 4(th) Industrial revolution is playing out against the backdrop of climate change, a rise in right wing movements, and a call for decolonial education to challenge the hegemony of a colonial worldview. This paper presents an argument for how Vygotsky and the Neo-Vygotskian's work does not require a novel pedagogy, but rather, that we reclaim its relevance for the 21(st) century, illustrating how the concepts underpinning it can be used to decolonize contemporary pedagogy. The paper foregrounds aspects of Vygotsky's work and draws on Hedegaard's further developments to argue for a decolonial pedagogy that arises from this knowledge base. The problematic addressed in this paper relates to schooling in the 4(th) Industrial Revolution and suggests that schooling today must be about more than the acquisition of academic content; it must be geared toward developing critical, collaborative forms of thought capable of transforming both the child and the world. In this paper, I argue for the foundation of such a schooling in the work of Vygotsky and the Neo-Vygotskians, by articulating a decolonial pedagogy grounded on this body of work.

TI  - Drought effects on leaf fall, leaf flushing and stem growth in the Amazon forest: reconciling remote sensing data and field observations
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Large amounts of carbon flow through tropical ecosystems every year, from which a part is sequestered in biomass through tree growth. However, the effects of ongoing warming and drying on tree growth and carbon sequestration in tropical forest is still highly uncertain. Field observations are sparse and limited to a few sites, while remote sensing analysis shows diverging growth responses to past droughts that cannot be interpreted with confidence. To reconcile data from field observations and remote sensing, we collated in situ measurements of stem growth and leaf litterfall from inventory plots across the Amazon region and other neotropical ecosystems. These data were used to train two machine-learning models and to evaluate model performance on reproducing stem growth and litterfall rates. The models utilized multiple climatological variables and other geospatial datasets (terrain, soil and vegetation properties) as explanatory variables. The output consisted of monthly estimates of leaf litterfall (R-2 = 0.71, NRMSE = 9.4 %) and stem growth (R-2 = 0.54, NRMSE = 10.6 %) across the neotropics from 1982 to 2019 at a high spatial resolution (0.1 degrees). Modelled time series allow us to assess the impacts of the 2005 and 2015 droughts in the Amazon basin on regional scales. The more severe 2015 drought was estimated to have caused widespread declines in stem growth (-1.8a), coinciding with enhanced leaf fall (+1.4a), which were only locally apparent in 2005. Regions in the Amazon basin that flushed leaves at the onset of both droughts (+0.9a similar to +2.00) showed positive anomalies in remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index, while sun-induced fluorescence and vegetation optical depth were reduced. The previously observed counterintuitive response of canopy greenup during drought in the Amazon basin detected by many remote sensing analyses can therefore be a result of enhanced leaf flushing at the onset of a drought. The long-term estimates of leaf litterfall and stem growth point to a decline in stem growth and a simultaneous increase in leaf litterfall in the Amazon basin since 1982. These trends are associated with increased warming and drying of the Amazonian climate and could point to a further decline in the Amazon carbon sink strength.

TI  - Evaluating the VNIR-SWIR datasets of WorldView-3 for lithological mapping of a metamorphic-igneous terrain using support vector machine algorithm; a case study of Central Iran
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - WorldView-3 (WV-3) is the first high spatial resolution and super-spectral commercial satellite which has the capability in improve-ment of geological mapping. The VNIR-SWIR data of this satellite are evaluated in this study for mapping the lithological units of a metamorphic-igneous terrain in Chadormalu area, Central Iran, by the use of support vector machine (SVM) classification method. Applying principal component analysis (PCA) as an image transformation technique on the WV-3 data, and interpretation of its results, supported by field observations, petrography, and spectroscopy, lead to identifying training areas which are input to the SVM algorithm. This method not only produces a detailed lithological map of all exposed rock units, but also well discriminates diorite-gabbro diorite from granite, and gneissic granite from green schist and garnet mica schist, which are not revealed in 1:100,000 geological map of the area, published by Geological Survey of Iran (GSI), with overall accuracy of 88.36% and the Kappa coefficient of 0.86. Furthermore, the efficacy of each applied band of WV-3 is assessed in promoting classification accuracy using SVM method. Results show that band 7 of SWIR region has increased the overall accuracy 4.81% relative to SWIR dataset, and improves the classification accuracy of green schist and diorite. Moreover, bands 5, 6, and 8 of SWIR dataset are more efficient in improvement of the overall accuracies than other bands. This study concludes that WV-3 data provides a good facility to generate large scale geological maps owing to its high spatial and radiometric resolution and appropriate SWIR bands. (C) 2021 COSPAR.

TI  - Data reduction for inverse modeling: an adaptive approach v1.0
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of greenhouse gas (GHG) observing satellites has greatly expanded in recent years, and these new datasets provide an unprecedented constraint on global GHG sources and sinks. However, a continuing challenge for inverse models that are used to estimate these sources and sinks is the sheer number of satellite observations, sometimes in the millions per day. These massive datasets often make it prohibitive to implement inverse modeling calculations and/or assimilate the observations using many types of atmospheric models. Although these satellite datasets are very large, the information content of any single observation is often modest and non-exclusive due to redundancy with neighboring observations and due to measurement noise. In this study, we develop an adaptive approach to reduce the size of satellite datasets using geostatistics. A guiding principle is to reduce the data more in regions with little variability in the observations and less in regions with high variability. We subsequently tune and evaluate the approach using synthetic and real data case studies for North America from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite. The proposed approach to data reduction yields more accurate CO2 flux estimates than the commonly used method of binning and averaging the satellite data. We further develop a metric for choosing a level of data reduction; we can reduce the satellite dataset to an average of one observation per similar to 80-140 km for the specific case studies here without substantially compromising the flux estimate, but we find that reducing the data further quickly degrades the accuracy of the estimated fluxes. Overall, the approach developed here could be applied to a range of inverse problems that use very large trace gas datasets.

TI  - C-band radar data and in situ measurements for the monitoring of wheat crops in a semi-arid area (center of Morocco)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - A better understanding of the hydrological functioning of irrigated crops using remote sensing observations is of prime importance in semi-arid areas where water resources are limited. Radar observations, available at high resolution and with a high revisit time since the launch of Sentinel-1 in 2014, have shown great potential for the monitoring of the water content of the upper soil and of the canopy. In this paper, a complete set of data for radar signal analysis is shared with the scientific community for the first time to our knowledge. The data set is composed of Sentinel-1 products and in situ measurements of soil and vegetation variables collected during three agricultural seasons over drip-irrigated winter wheat in the Haouz plain in Morocco. The in situ data gather soil measurements (time series of half-hourly surface soil moisture, surface roughness and agricultural practices) and vegetation measurements collected every week/2 weeks including aboveground fresh and dry biomasses, vegetation water content based on destructive measurements, the cover fraction, the leaf area index, and plant height. Radar data are the backscattering coefficient and the interferometric coherence derived from Sentinel-1 GRDH (Ground Range Detected High Resolution) and SLC (Single Look Complex) products, respectively. The normalized difference vegetation index derived from Sentinel-2 data based on Level-2A (surface reflectance and cloud mask) atmospheric-effects-corrected products is also provided. This database, which is the first of its kind made available open access, is described here comprehensively in order to help the scientific community to evaluate and to develop new or existing remote sensing algorithms for monitoring wheat canopy under semi-arid conditions. The data set is particularly relevant for the development of radar applications including surface soil moisture and vegetation variable retrieval using either physically based or empirical approaches such as machine and deep learning algorithms.The database is archived in the DataSuds repository and is freely accessible via the following DOI: https://doi.org/10.23708/8D6WQC (Ouaadi et al., 2020a).

TI  - Investigating shallow water bottom feature using SAR data along Gulf of Khambhat, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal bathymetry often forms complex and transient morphology, especially along the tide-dominated regions like the Gulf of Khambhat (GoK), west coast of India. The high tidal currents within the gulf relentlessly modify the morphology of the bathymetric features that prompts for a frequently updated bathymetric information. The SAR estimated bathymetry represent updated depth values based on the transient bathymetric features observed from the SAR images. The present study has used ALOS PALSAR-1/2 data to update the depth of shallow water bottom features of GoK. The method involves modeling the gradient in the backscatter coefficient (sigma degrees) modulated by the slope of the bathymetric features with the satellite images. The slope corresponding to the bathymetric feature from hydrographic charts (initial guess bathymetry) and the simulated current velocity forms the input to the model. The bathymetry is updated by varying the slopes of the bathymetric features through iteration until the sigma degrees converges. The method is applied to update the depth of various bathymetric features observed from the SAR images of 2008, 2010, 2014 and 2018. We validated the updated depth from 2018 satellite data using available in situ measurements. The comparison of in situ observation with the hydrographic chart has resulted in RMSE of 3.2 m, while the RMSE have improved to 1.5 m when compared with the SAR updated bathymetry. The temporal dynamics of the bathymetric features are studied using the pair of 2008-10 and 2010-14 SAR images. Analysis has comprehended the morphodynamics of bathymetric features like lateral migration of tidal bars, erosion along the tidal channel periphery, and deposition at the tidal spits. We updated the depth of rapidly changing bathymetric features using the 2018 SAR images. The study shows its potential in operational usage to update the complex nearshore bathymetry from the SAR image.

TI  - Habitat monitoring and conservation prioritization of Western Hoolock Gibbon in upper Brahmaputra Valley, Assam, India
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed at predicting the potential habitat of Western Hoolock Gibbon (Hoolock hoolock) in the upper Brahmaputra River Valley, Assam, India, and identifying priority conservation areas for the species, taking canopy cover into account. We used the maximum entropy algorithm for the prediction of the potential habitat of the gibbon using its current distribution with 19 environmental parameters as primary predictors. Spatio-temporal analyses of the habitat were carried out using satellite-based remote sensing and GIS techniques for two decades (1998-2018) along with Terra Modis Vegetation Continuous Field product to examine land use land cover (LULC), habitat fragmentation, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and tree cover percentage of the study area. To identify the conservation priority area, we applied a cost-effective decision-making analysis using systematic conservation prioritization in R programming. The model predicted an area of 6025 km(2) under high potential habitat, a major part of which was found to overlap with dense forest (80%), followed by moderately open forest (74%) and open forest (66%). The LULC change matrix showed a reduction of forest area in the predicted high potential habitat during the study period, while agricultural class showed an increasing trend. The fragmentation analysis indicated that the number of patches and patch density increased from 2008 to 2018 in the 'very dense' and 'dense' canopy regions of the gibbon habitat. Based on the conservation priority analysis, a 640 km(2) area has been proposed to conserve a minimum of 10% of gibbon habitat. The current analysis revealed that in the upper Brahmaputra Valley most areas under dense forest and dense canopy have remained intact over the last two decades, at least within the high potential habitat zone of gibbons independent of the degree of area change in forest, agriculture and plantation.

TI  - A comprehensive approach for microbiota and health monitoring in mouse colonies using metagenomic shotgun sequencing
T2  - ANIMAL MICROBIOME
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Health surveillance of murine colonies employed for scientific purposes aim at detecting unwanted infection that can affect the well-being of animals and personnel, and potentially undermine scientific results. In this study, we investigated the use of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) metagenomic approach for monitoring the microbiota composition and uncovering the possible presence of pathogens in mice housed in specific pathogen-free (SPF) or conventional (non-SPF) facilities. Results Analysis of metagenomic NGS assay through public and free algorithms and databases allowed to precisely assess the composition of mouse gut microbiome and quantify the contribution of the different microorganisms at the species level. Sequence analysis allowed the uncovering of pathogens or the presence of imbalances in the microbiota composition. In several cases, fecal pellets taken from conventional facilities were found to carry gene sequences from bacterial pathogens (Helicobacter hepaticus, Helicobacter typhlonius, Chlamydia muridarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, Rodentibacter pneumotropicus, Citrobacter rodentium, Staphylococcus aureus), intestinal protozoa (Entamoeba muris, Tritrichomonas muris, Spironucleus muris) nematoda (Aspiculuris tetraptera, Syphacia obvelata), eukaryotic parasites (Myocoptes musculinus) and RNA virus (Norwalk virus). Thus, the use of NGS metagenomics can reduce the number of tests required for the detection of pathogens and avoid the use of sentinel mice. Conclusions In summary, in comparison with standard approaches, which require multiple types of test, NGS assay can detect bacteria, fungi, DNA and RNA viruses, and eukaryotic parasites from fecal pellets in a single test. Considering the need to protect animal well-being and to improve the success and reproducibility of preclinical studies, this work provides the proof-of-concept that the use of NGS metagenomics for health monitoring of laboratory mice is a feasible and dependable approach, that is able to broaden the current concept of health monitoring of laboratory mice from "pathogen surveillance" to a more inclusive "microbiota surveillance".

TI  - Fusion neural networks for plant classification: learning to combine RGB, hyperspectral, and lidar data
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne remote sensing offers unprecedented opportunities to efficiently monitor vegetation, but methods to delineate and classify individual plant species using the collected data are still actively being developed and improved. The Integrating Data science with Trees and Remote Sensing (IDTReeS) plant identification competition openly invited scientists to create and compare individual tree mapping methods. Participants were tasked with training taxon identification algorithms based on two sites, to then transfer their methods to a third unseen site, using field-based plant observations in combination with airborne remote sensing image data products from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). These data were captured by a high resolution digital camera sensitive to red, green, blue (RGB) light, hyperspectral imaging spectrometer spanning the visible to shortwave infrared wavelengths, and lidar systems to capture the spectral and structural properties of vegetation. As participants in the IDTReeS competition, we developed a two-stage deep learning approach to integrate NEON remote sensing data from all three sensors and classify individual plant species and genera. The first stage was a convolutional neural network that generates taxon probabilities from RGB images, and the second stage was a fusion neural network that "learns" how to combine these probabilities with hyperspectral and lidar data. Our two-stage approach leverages the ability of neural networks to flexibly and automatically extract descriptive features from complex image data with high dimensionality. Our method achieved an overall classification accuracy of 0.51 based on the training set, and 0.32 based on the test set which contained data from an unseen site with unknown taxa classes. Although transferability of classification algorithms to unseen sites with unknown species and genus classes proved to be a challenging task, developing methods with openly available NEON data that will be collected in a standardized format for 30 years allows for continual improvements and major gains for members of the computational ecology community. We outline promising directions related to data preparation and processing techniques for further investigation, and provide our code to contribute to open reproducible science efforts.

TI  - Re/turning to soil: becoming one-bodied with the Earth
T2  - CULTURAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper curates four experiential narratives and poetry by the five co-authors that illustrate epistemic and ontic shift from the Modern Western (ModWest) mindset to a holistic, embodied and animistic mindset. Coming from different cultural backgrounds, yet having been systemically influenced by the dominant ModWest views and values, each author has initiated an ongoing shift in consciousness, demonstrating how such transformations are possible. Affirming that a shift in consciousness is not simply a matter of cognitive change but is a thoroughly holistic process, the authors write in autobiographical narratives and poetry to capture and convey embodied and emplaced, experiential understanding and feelings, or 'felt sense.' Deep changes in the consciousness, such as these epistemic shifts, take the whole ensemble of "body + mind + heart + soul + spirit + the world" as the unit of change for learning. Through these writings, they sensuously and feelingly, existentially-and-spiritually and discursively explore possibilities of becoming one-bodied with the animate Earth. They call this the re-bonding project through which they address humanity's first-order bonding rupture between Humans and the Earth community.

TI  - Land-use changes concerning the riparian vegetation in Galela Lake, North Maluku, Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Galela Lake is the largest lake in the Halmahera Utara Regency, North Maluku Province, Indonesia, and is used for domestic water supply, irrigation, aquaculture, and tourism. However, its catchment has been cleared and developed for intensive agriculture. Therefore, there is a need to examine the land-use changes impacting the riparian vegetation of Galela Lake to establish a basis for the development of lake management plans. Research has been conducted at four research sites within the forest (Site I), farmland (Site II), a tourism area (Site III), and near the river inlet (Site IV). In each site, the riparian vegetation was surveyed from the lake banks to 500 m into the neighboring terrestrial habitat. Evidence for changes in the spatial distribution of land-use types in the vicinity of Galela Lake in 2002, 2015, and 2019 were obtained from Landsat images. Galela Lake (302.05 Ha) is exposed to various kinds of human use. During 2002-2019, barren land had been converted into build-up land, and much of the water body of the lake was converted into a riparian zone through the pressures of population growth. Ten of 89 plant species observed within the riparian vegetation around Galela Lake are included in The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List threatened species 2010. Coconut (Cocos nucifera), sugar palm (Arenga pinnata), fig (Ficus variegata), nutmeg (Myristica fragrans), and mango (Mangifera indica) were found to be the most important riparian trees. The second generation stands of riparian vegetation (pole and sapling strata) of several species exhibit potential as conservation plants for land and aquatic ecosystems, such as guest tree (Kleinhovia hospita), bamboo (Bambusa vulgaris), the figs (Ficus septica and F. variegata), and sugar palm (A. pinnata).

TI  - Development and evaluation of 0.05° terrestrial water storage estimates using Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) land surface model and assimilation of GRACE data
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of terrestrial water storage (TWS) at a high spatiotemporal resolution is important for reliable assessments of regional water resources and climate variability. Individual components of TWS include soil moisture, snow, groundwater, and canopy storage and can be estimated from the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) land surface model. The spatial resolution of CABLE is currently limited to 0.5 degrees by the resolution of soil and vegetation data sets that underlie model parameterizations, posing a challenge to using CABLE for hydrological applications at a local scale. This study aims to improve the spatial detail (from 0.5 to 0.05 degrees) and time span (1981-2012) of CABLE TWS estimates using rederived model parameters and high-resolution meteorological forcing. In addition, TWS observations derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission are assimilated into CABLE to improve TWS accuracy. The success of the approach is demonstrated in Australia, where multiple ground observation networks are available for validation. The evaluation process is conducted using four different case studies that employ different model spatial resolutions and include or omit GRACE data assimilation (DA). We find that the CABLE 0.05 degrees developed here improves TWS estimates in terms of accuracy, spatial resolution, and long-term water resource assessment reliability. The inclusion of GRACE DA increases the accuracy of groundwater storage (GWS) estimates and has little impact on surface soil moisture or evapotranspiration. Using im- proved model parameters and improved state estimations (via GRACE DA) together is recommended to achieve the best GWS accuracy. The workflow elaborated on in this paper relies only on publicly accessible global data sets, allowing the reproduction of the 0.05 degrees TWS estimates in any study region.

TI  - Channel-spatial attention-based pan-sharpening of very high-resolution satellite images
T2  - KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The pan-sharpening process aims to generate a new synthetic output image preserving the spatial details of panchromatic and spectral details of the multi-spectral image inputs. Recently, deep learning-based methods show substantial success in the remote sensing field mostly with the application of traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Most of the traditional CNN-based approaches treat all the channels equitably and cannot learn the correlation. Attention mechanism which can learn the correlations among the channels has been proven to be effective in super-resolution and object detection tasks. In this research, we introduced a novel deep learning framework, channel-spatial attention-based method for pan-sharpening (CSAPAN), by designing a Densely residual attention module (RAM). Besides, we train our model in the high-frequency domain and up-sample the low-resolution multispectral images by using the pixel shuffle method before stacking with the panchromatic images for further feature extraction. We evaluated our proposed CSAPAN along with traditional methods and CNN-based methods in reduced and full resolution and obtained satisfactory quantitative and qualitative results on Pleiades, Worldview-2, and QuickBird-2 satellite image datasets.

TI  - SCOPE 2.0: a model to simulate vegetated land surface fluxes and satellite signals
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Soil Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model aims at linking satellite observations in the visible, infrared, and thermal domains with land surface processes in a physically based manner, and quantifying the microclimate in vegetation canopies. It simulates radiative transfer in the soil, leaves, and vegetation canopies, as well as photosynthesis and non-radiative heat dissipation through convection and mechanical turbulence. Since the first publication 12 years ago, SCOPE has been applied in remote sensing studies of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), energy balance fluxes, gross primary production (GPP), and directional thermal signals. Here, we present a thoroughly revised version, SCOPE 2.0, which features a number of new elements: (1) it enables the definition of layers consisting of leaves with different properties, thus enabling the simulation of vegetation with an understorey or with a vertical gradient in leaf chlorophyll concentration; (2) it enables the simulation of soil reflectance; (3) it includes the simulation of leaf and canopy reflectance changes induced by the xanthophyll cycle; and (4) the computation speed has been reduced by 90% compared to earlier versions due to a fundamental optimization of the model. These new features improve the capability of the model to represent complex canopies and to explore the response of remote sensing signals to vegetation physiology. The improvements in computational efficiency make it possible to use SCOPE 2.0 routinely for the simulation of satellite data and land surface fluxes. It also strengthens the operability for the numerical retrieval of land surface products from satellite or airborne data.

TI  - The effect of water stress on net primary productivity in northwest China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) has been widely used as the indicator of vegetation function and exhibits large spatial and temporal variations caused by numerous factors. Northwest China (NWC) is one of the driest regions in China, and water supply is the key determinant of NPP here. However, studies on the effects of water stress on NPP in NWC at the regional scale are still relatively lacking. Thus, in this study, based on a set of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NPP and evapotranspiration (ET) datasets, we quantified the response of NPP to water stress, which is indicated by crop water stress index (CWSI). Regional average of annual NPP in NWC showed an increasing trend during the study period, at a rate of 0.84 g C m(-2) yr(-1). At the province level, the NPP increase rates increased in the order of Ningxia (7.7%), Shaanxi (6.5%), Gansu (4.5%), Qinghai (3.8%), and Xinjiang (1.7%). NPP was negatively correlated with CWSI (p<0.05) in 73% of areas, indicating the key role of water stress in constraining NPP over this arid region. The effect of water stress on NPP changes with elevation. Water stress has the strongest negative impact on NPP in areas with elevations around 2000 m. In elevations above 5000 m, NPP is not limited by water stress, mostly positively correlated with CWSI. Our findings further clarify the importance of water stress in dryland ecosystems, while highlighting that elevation gradients can significantly affect the correlation between NPP and water stress.

TI  - A study on spring rejuvenation and springshed characterization in Mussoorie, Garhwal Himalaya using an integrated geospatial-geophysical approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Himalayan region, drinking water has always been an issue. A total of six gravity springs and springsheds are selected at Mussoorie Hills, Garhwal (Lesser) Himalaya that prioritized the augmentation of water resources through spring rejuvenation. LISS-IV and Cartosat-I data are used to study topography, delineate springshed boundary, analyzing structural setting, surface water flow pattern. This geospatial analysis is validated further by the hydrogeological survey and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (Wenner configuration; especially carried out in Kandighat (<45 degrees slope angle)). They inferred that discharge is structurally controlled by Mussoorie Syncline (along its limbs) and impervious Krol Limestone. The high lineament density, gentle slope and positive NDVI determined the springsheds potential for groundwater resources augmentation and development. The Guru Nanak Fifth Centenary School, Mussoorie, became the protagonist for solving the drinking water issue, using an integrated geospatial (LISS IV and Cartosat I data) and geophysical survey (Vertical Electrical Sounding and Electrical Resistivity Tomography). The ERT survey shows a low resistivity zone (similar to 10-100 Omega m); subsequently, the VES results are plotted in a logarithmic graph, and the curve obtained (matched in the IP12 software by inverse slope method) shows sharp peaks that correspond with ERT results very well. Therefore, these low resistivity value confirms the presence of water saturation zones. In December 2017, final drilling took place, thereby discovering groundwater yield at a surplus rate of 180 L/m surfed up to 130 m below the ground level. This expedition became the first successful scientific study in the Mussoorie hills on drinking water extraction from aquifers by integrating Geospatial and Geophysical methods. Therefore, it is clear proof of the efficiency and effectiveness of the technology and can be adopted elsewhere in the steep mountainous terrains of the Himalayan region.

TI  - The dark art of interpretation in geomorphology
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of interpretation, and the ways in which knowledge builds upon interpretations, has profound implications in scientific and managerial terms. Despite the significance of these issues, geomorphologists typically give scant regard to such deliberations. Geomorphology is not a linear, cause-and-effect science. Inherent complexities and uncertainties prompt perceptions of the process of interpretation in geomorphology as a frustrating form of witchcraft or wizardry - a dark art. Alternatively, acknowledging such challenges recognises the fun to be had in puzzle-solving encounters that apply abductive reasoning to make sense of physical landscapes, seeking to generate knowledge with a reliable evidence base. Carefully crafted approaches to interpretation relate generalised understandings derived from analysis of remotely sensed data with field observations/measurements and local knowledge to support appropriately contextualised place-based applications. In this paper we develop a cognitive approach (Describe-Explain-Predict) to interpret landscapes. Explanation builds upon meaningful description, thereby supporting reliable predictions, in a multiple lines of evidence approach. Interpretation transforms data into knowledge to provide evidence that supports a particular argument. Examples from fluvial geomorphology demonstrate the data-interpretation-knowledge sequence used to analyse river character, behaviour and evolution. Although Big Data and machine learning applications present enormous potential to transform geomorphology into a data-rich, increasingly predictive science, we outline inherent dangers in allowing prescriptive and synthetic tools to do the thinking, as interpreting local differences is an important element of geomorphic enquiry.

TI  - The Diel Cycle of NH<sub>3</sub> Observed From the FY-4A Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS)
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Limiting excess atmospheric ammonia (NH3) is one of the great challenges for humanity in the 21st century but can only be achieved with adequate monitoring means in place. Here, we report the first NH3 measurements from the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) onboard the Chinese FY-4A satellite. The instrument scans almost all of Asia 10 times per day. We show that GIIRS ' unprecedented temporal sampling can be exploited to measure diurnal and nocturnal variations of NH3 and demonstrate this on two case studies over Punjab and the North China Plain. Day-night variations are found to be almost absent in winter, but can reach a factor 2-3 in the warmer months. These case studies are very promising given the future landscape of geostationary sounders, but also show that improved knowledge on lower tropospheric air temperatures and the vertical profile of NH3 is key to better exploit their measurements.

M3  - Article
AB  - In a recent article, L. Philip Barnes critiques the Commission on Religious Education (CoRE) Final Report by scrutinising its text and by responding to my interpretation of that text. His particular, but not exclusive, focus is CoRE's proposal that the idea of worldview should be central to RE. His conclusion is that: 'The collective force of these criticisms counsels against implementing the proposals of CoRE. Religious education needs to look elsewhere than to a worldview curriculum to overcome its current travails'. This article responds by arguing that Barnes fails to justify his conclusion because his critique does not meet the standards of a fair and responsible treatment of his chosen focal texts. In particular, it misrepresents and misinterprets the CoRE Report and overlooks the alternative interpretation that I and others offered.

TI  - Increasing the spatial resolution of cloud property retrievals from Meteosat SEVIRI by use of its high-resolution visible channel: implementation and examples
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The modification of an existing cloud property retrieval scheme for the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) instrument on board the geostationary Meteosat satellites is described to utilize its highresolution visible (HRV) channel for increasing the spatial resolution of its physical outputs. This results in products with a nadir spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km(2) compared to the standard 3 x 3 km(2) resolution offered by the narrowband channels. This improvement thus greatly reduces the resolution gap between current geostationary and polar-orbiting meteorological satellite imagers. In the first processing step, cloudiness is determined from the HRV observations by a threshold-based cloud masking algorithm. Subsequently, a linear model that links the 0.6 mu m, 0.8 mu m, and HRV reflectances provides a physical constraint to incorporate the spatial high-frequency component of the HRV observations into the retrieval of cloud optical depth. The implementation of the method is described, including the ancillary datasets used. It is demonstrated that the omission of high-frequency variations in the cloud-absorbing 1.6 mu m channel results in comparatively large uncertainties in the retrieved cloud effective radius, likely due to the mismatch in channel resolutions. A newly developed downscaling scheme for the 1.6 mu m reflectance is therefore applied to mitigate the effects of this scale mismatch. Benefits of the increased spatial resolution of the resulting SEVIRI products are demonstrated for three example applications: (i) for a convective cloud field, it is shown that significantly better agreement between the distributions of cloud optical depth retrieved from SEVIRI and from collocated MODIS observations is achieved. (ii) The temporal evolution of cloud properties for a growing convective storm at standard and HRV spatial resolutions are compared, illustrating an improved contrast in growth signatures resulting from the use of the HRV channel. (iii) An example of surface solar irradiance, determined from the retrieved cloud properties, is shown, for which the HRV channel helps to better capture the large spatiotemporal variability induced by convective clouds. These results suggest that incorporating the HRV channel into the retrieval has potential for improving Meteosat-based cloud products for several application domains.

TI  - Semantic segmentation of PolSAR image data using advanced deep learning model
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban area mapping is an important application of remote sensing which aims at both estimation and change in land cover under the urban area. A major challenge being faced while analyzing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) based remote sensing data is that there is a lot of similarity between highly vegetated urban areas and oriented urban targets with that of actual vegetation. This similarity between some urban areas and vegetation leads to misclassification of the urban area into forest cover. The present work is a precursor study for the dual-frequency L and S-band NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission and aims at minimizing the misclassification of such highly vegetated and oriented urban targets into vegetation class with the help of deep learning. In this study, three machine learning algorithms Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been implemented along with a deep learning model DeepLabv3+ for semantic segmentation of Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data. It is a general perception that a large dataset is required for the successful implementation of any deep learning model but in the field of SAR based remote sensing, a major issue is the unavailability of a large benchmark labeled dataset for the implementation of deep learning algorithms from scratch. In current work, it has been shown that a pre-trained deep learning model DeepLabv3+ outperforms the machine learning algorithms for land use and land cover (LULC) classification task even with a small dataset using transfer learning. The highest pixel accuracy of 87.78% and overall pixel accuracy of 85.65% have been achieved with DeepLabv3+ and Random Forest performs best among the machine learning algorithms with overall pixel accuracy of 77.91% while SVM and KNN trail with an overall accuracy of 77.01% and 76.47% respectively. The highest precision of 0.9228 is recorded for the urban class for semantic segmentation task with DeepLabv3+ while machine learning algorithms SVM and RF gave comparable results with a precision of 0.8977 and 0.8958 respectively.

TI  - Dried bottom of Urmia Lake as a new source of dust in the northwestern Iran: Understanding the impacts on local and regional air quality
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urmia Lake, the largest inland lake in Iran has lost most of its water surface area in the last 2 decades. The desertification caused by the drying of this unique lake may lead to dust storms from the lakebed and affect the air quality of the region. In this study, MODIS derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data observed between 2000 and 2019, Ultra Violet Aerosol Index (UVAI) data from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), meteorological data from MERRA-2 and ground-level PM10 data measured in the northwestern Iran and eastern Turkey were used to investigate the effects of the drying of Urmia Lake on local and regional aerosol pollution. The results revealed significant increase in aerosol pollution over the last 10 years. An inverse relationship was observed between water level fluctuations of Urmia Lake and aerosol pollution in the northwestern Iran. In total, 177 days (27 days in the period of 2000-2009 and 150 days in the period of 2010-2019) with mean daily AOD values equal to or greater than 1 were observed over the box covering Urmia Lake Basin (ULB). During 2000-2009, when the mean AOD was 0.25, the mean water surface area of the lake was observed to be 4000 km(2). When the lake dried up faster during 2010-2019 (the mean water surface area was observed 2100 km(2)), the mean AOD increased to 0.42.The eastern part of the lake was more polluted than western part due to the extent of salinization and desertification in this part and the prevailing wind direction from west to east. The results indicated similar trends with PM10 concentration in the northwestern Iran and eastern Turkey but the classification of PM10 values based on wind direction and wind speed rejected the influence of the lakebed on aerosol pollution in the eastern Turkey except in special meteorological conditions. These conditions occur when a low-pressure system over central Iraq and a high-pressure system located in a more northerly part of the region, mainly over the Caucasian, form a dust channel. In addition to dust storms from Iraq, Syria, Arabian Desert and local emission sources, the lakebed contributes as a new source of aerosol pollution mainly in the northwestern Iran and close regions.

TI  - Utilizing LiDAR data to map tree canopy for urban ecosystem extent and condition accounts in Oslo
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - LiDAR-based segmentation of urban tree canopies and their physical properties (canopy height, canopy diameter, 3D surface and volume) is a replicable, complementary and useful information source for urban ecosystem condition accounts, and an important basis for ecosystem service modeling and valuation. However, using available LiDAR data collected for municipal purposes other than vegetation mapping (such as for example engineering) entails a level of accuracy which may limit the usefulness of the data for change detection in ecosystem accounts. To account for changes in the urban tree canopy of Oslo (capital city of Norway) between 2011 and 2017, a segmentation model was developed based on available airborne LiDAR data scanned for general purposes. The results from the entire built-up area of Oslo indicate a general increase in the number of tall trees ( 10 m) and a moderate decrease in tall trees ( 10 m). The total tree canopy area within the Small House plan area decreased by 1.04%, with a corresponding 2.13% decrease in the tree canopy volume. With respect to the segmentation accuracy, the changes in aggregate tree canopy cover are too small to determine canopy change with confidence. This study demonstrates the potential for identifying ecosystem condition indicators as well as the limitations of using general purpose LiDAR data to improve the precision of urban ecosystem accounting. For future ecosystem service accounting in urban environments, we recommend that municipalities implement data acquisition programs that combine concurrent field data sampling and LiDAR campaigns designed for urban tree canopy detection, as part of general urban structural inventorying. We recommend using LiDAR and satellite remote sensing data depending on canopy densities. We also recommend that future tree canopy segmentation is done within a cloud-computing environment to ensure sufficient geoprocessing capacity.

TI  - Grass modelling in data-limited areas by incorporating MODIS data products
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Process-based grass models (PBGMs) are widely used for predicting grass growth under potential climate change and different management practices. However, accurate predictions using PBGMs heavily rely on field observations for data assimilation. In data-limited areas, performing robust and reliable estimates of grass growth remains a challenge. In this paper, we incorporated satellite-based MODIS data products, including leaf area index, gross primary production and evapotranspiration, as an additional supplement to field observations. Popular data assimilation methods, including Bayesian calibration and the updating method ensemble Kalman filter, were applied to assimilate satellite derived information into the BASic GRAssland model (BASGRA). A range of different combinations of data assimilating methods and data availability were tested across four grassland sites in Norway, Finland and Canada to assess the corresponding accuracy and make recommendations regarding suitable approaches to incorporate MODIS data. The results demonstrated that optimizing the model parameters that are specific for grass species and cultivar should be targeted prior to updating model state variables. The MODIS derived data products were capable of constraining model's simulations on phenological development and biomass accumulation by parameter optimization with its performance exceeding model outputs driven by default parameters. By integrating even a small number of field measurements into the parameter calibration, the model's predictive accuracy was further improved - especially at sites with obvious biases in the input MODIS data. Overall, this comparative study has provided flexible solutions with the potential to strengthen the capacity of PBGMs for grass growth estimation in practical applications.

TI  - Assessing the inter-annual variability of vegetation phenological events observed from satellite vegetation index time series in dryland sites
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tracking dryland vegetation phenology under a changing climate is of great concern because dryland ecosystems have broad spatial coverage and are important drivers of global carbon cycles. However, dryland ecosystems often consist of two or more different vegetation types with divergent phenological patterns and are characterized by relatively low vegetation greenup signal compared to noise present in satellite imagery. Thus, accurately characterizing dryland phenology - including the start, peak, and end of season (SOS, POS, and EOS, respectively) - across large temporal and spatial scales with satellite vegetation indices (VIs) has proven challenging. Working across six dryland flux tower sites in the United States from 2003 to 2014, we asked: 1) How well do satellite VIs explain GPP? 2) How accurately can satellite VIs characterize the number and timing of phenological transition dates? and 3) Why does this accuracy vary across VIs? To address these questions, we used daily GPP data from the FLUXNET2015 dataset. We computed four daily VIs from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensor including two greenness indices (i.e., NDVI and EVI), and two waterrelated indices (i.e., Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and NDVI-LSWI difference). We derived phenological transition dates from spline smoothed VI and GPP time series. We found that all major phenological patterns apparent in GPP time series were present in VI data across sites and VIs. Among the four VIs, EVI explained the most variance in daily GPP (R2 = 0.65). Between 88 and 90% of phenological events found in GPP time series - especially recurring, large magnitude events but also some sporadic, small ephemeral events - were detected from MODIS VI data. The rate of omission, when an event was detected from GPP but not from VI data, was similar across VIs (10-12% of all GPP events). Commissions, when an event was detected from VI but not from GPP data, varied more widely from 18% for NDVI to 30% for LSWI. Transition date accuracy as measured by mean absolute difference (MAD) between GPP- and VI-derived SOS and POS ranged from 13 to 15 days across VIs but was lower for EOS (17-26 days). EOS from LSWI most accurately characterized GPP-derived EOS. This may be because LSWI is sensitive to leaf water content, which declines in certain dryland vegetation even when leaves remain green. Our results highlight the potential for satellite VI-derived metrics to accurately track spatiotemporal variation in the phenological event occurrence and timing in dryland ecosystems.

TI  - Diversity of lymphatic flow in patients with lung cancer revealed by computed tomography lymphography
T2  - INTERACTIVE CARDIOVASCULAR AND THORACIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to verify the optimal extent of lymph node dissection or sampling during lung cancer surgery based on the sentinel node (SN) map created by computed tomography (CT) lymphography.METHODS: From April 2010 to January 2015, patients with clinical stage I non-small-cell lung cancer, who were candidates for lobectomy or segmentectomy with standard hilar and mediastinal lymph node dissection, and in whom bronchus reached the tumour, were enrolled. An ultrathin bronchoscope was inserted to the target bronchus under the guidance of virtual bronchoscopic navigation images. CT images of the chest were obtained 30 s after 2.5 ml of iopamidol was injected. SNs were identified when the maximum CT attenuation value of the lymph nodes on postcontrast CT images increased by 30 Hounsfield units or more compared with the precontrast images. Patients underwent lobectomy with standard lymph node dissection.RESULTS: SNs were identified in 36 (87.8%) of the 41 patients. The average number of SNs was 1.6 (range, 1-4). There was 1 false negative case; therefore, the accuracy of SN identification was 97.2% (35/36). In 5 (13.9%) of 36 patients, SNs were outside the lobe-specific lymph node station range (#11i from right S-1, #7 from right S-1, #4R from right S-8, #12u from right S-8, #7 and #121 from left S1+2).CONCLUSIONS: CT lymphography demonstrated the diversity of lymphatic spreading patterns and there were cases in which lymph flows are found outside the lymph node dissection range.

TI  - Modeling study of the impact of SO<sub>2</sub> volcanic passive emissions on the tropospheric sulfur budget
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Well constrained volcanic emissions inventories in chemistry transport models are necessary to study the impacts induced by these sources on the tropospheric sulfur composition and on sulfur species concentrations and depositions at the surface. In this paper, the changes induced by the update of the volcanic sulfur emissions inventory are studied using the global chemistry transport model MOCAGE (MOdele de Chimie Atmospherique a Grande Echelle). Unlike the previous inventory (Andres and Kasgnoc, 1998), the updated one (Carn et al., 2016, 2017) uses more accurate information and includes contributions from both passive degassing and eruptive emissions. Eruptions are provided as daily total amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emitted by volcanoes in the Carn et al. (2016, 2017) inventories, and degassing emissions are provided as annual averages with the related mean annual uncertainties of those emissions by volcano. Information on plume altitudes is also available and has been used in the model. We chose to analyze the year 2013, for which only a negligible amount of eruptive volcanic SO2 emissions is reported, allowing us to focus the study on the impact of passive degassing emissions on the tropospheric sulfur budget. An evaluation against the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) SO2 total column and MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations shows the improvements of the model results with the updated inventory. Because the global volcanic SO2 flux changes from 13 Tgyr(-1) in Andres and Kasgnoc (1998) to 23.6 Tgyr(-1) in Carn et al. (2016, 2017), significant differences appear in the global sulfur budget, mainly in the free troposphere and in the tropics. Even though volcanic SO2 emissions represent 15% of the total annual sulfur emissions, the volcanic contribution to the tropospheric sulfate aerosol burden is 25 %, which is due to the higher altitude of emissions from volcanoes. Moreover, a sensitivity study on passive degassing emissions, using the annual uncertainties of emissions per volcano, also confirmed the nonlinear link between tropospheric sulfur species content with respect to volcanic SO2 emissions. This study highlights the need for accurate estimates of volcanic sources in chemistry transport models in order to properly simulate tropospheric sulfur species.

TI  - Four-Dimensional Wind Fields From Geostationary Hyperspectral Infrared Sounder Radiance Measurements With High Temporal Resolution
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Four-dimensional (4D) wind fields were derived from radiance measurements of the Geosynchronous Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) onboard the FengYun-4A satellite with 15-min temporal resolution during Typhoon Maria (2018). Results are evaluated with independent ERA5 reanalysis, Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) analysis and dropsonde wind profiles, and show a statistical root mean squared error less than 2 m/s for U and V components in troposphere against ERA5 and GDAS. The temporal variation of the wind fields from GIIRS at 15-min intervals is consistent with that of the hourly ERA5. The added value of wind profiles over the numerical weather predictions (NWP) background field is also revealed. Further experiments confirm that higher temporal resolution from geostationary infrared (IR) sounder measurements could provide better dynamic information. 4D dynamic information can be extracted from high temporal resolution geostationary hyperspectral IR radiances in a consistent and continuous manner that can be used together with the thermodynamic information for various quantitative applications such as NWP data assimilation, near real-time weather monitoring, situational awareness and nowcasting.

TI  - Massive sterile neutrinos in the early Universe: From thermal decoupling to cosmological constraints
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW D
M3  - Article
AB  - We consider relatively heavy neutrinos nu(H), mostly contributing to a sterile state nu(s), with mass in the range 10 MeV less than or similar to m(s) less than or similar to m(pi) similar to 135 MeV, which are thermally produced in the early Universe in collisional processes involving active neutrinos and freezing out after the QCD phase transition. If these neutrinos decay after the active neutrino decoupling, they generate extra neutrino radiation but also contribute to entropy production. Thus, they alter the value of the effective number of neutrino species N-eff as, for instance, measured by the cosmic microwave background (CMB), as well as affect primordial nucleosynthesis (BBN), notably 4He production. We provide a detailed account of the solution of the relevant Boltzmann equations. We also identify the parameter space allowed by current Planck satellite data and forecast the parameter space probed by future stage-4 ground-based CMB observations, expected to match or surpass BBN sensitivity.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial-temporal land-use changes can greatly influence ecosystem services and landscape patterns, which themselves are important factors of ecological security. Spatial-temporal land-use changes can greatly influence ecosystem services and landscape patterns, which themselves are important factors of ecological security. This study analyzed the spatial-temporal changes of land-use/cover in the Lavasanat watershed (Tehran, Iran) between 2000 and 2020 using Landsat satellite images and evaluated the ecological security of the region in terms of landscape metrics and ecosystem services. The spatial-temporal analysis of land-use changes in the 20-year period between 2000 and 2020 showed the substantial growth of the region's residential areas because of population growth and rising demand for housing and the consequent urban expansion. This analysis also showed a decreasing trend in the total area of agricultural lands in the region. The results suggest that uncontrolled real estate development has greatly affected the ecological structure of the Lavasanat region by breaking the continuity of agricultural lands and replacing the large patches of these lands, which are of great ecological value, with smaller patches, which have far lower ecological value. Also, the results of the InVEST scenario-generator model and the water yield model showed an increase in the water yield of the Lavasanat watershed because of the expansion of built (residential) land-uses, which has led to increased runoff. These changes will have significant environmental consequences such as increased soil erosion, reduced regional groundwater recharge, and easier contaminant displacement, which will undermine the ecological security of the region.

TI  - Quantifying diurnal and seasonal variation of surface urban heat island intensity and its associated determinants across different climatic zones over Indian cities
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface urban heat island (SUHI) is a major anthropogenic alteration of Earth's surface and can influence the local thermal environment by altering the surface energy flux balances. Researchers have paid much attention to SUHI studies in the last decades; still, its geospatial variability over a larger area is poorly understood. Detailed research is required to understand the mechanism and dynamics of SUHI along with its different driving variables. Hence in this study, we quantified the diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variation of SUHI intensity (SUHII) over 150 major Indian cities situated over different climatic zones using MODIS data from 2003 to 2018. The results reveal urban cool islands occurrence over the hot desert, hot steppe, and tropical monsoon climatic zone during daytime in both summer (-0.25 to -0.17 degrees C) and winter (-0.33 to 0.17 degrees C) season. In contrast, nighttime SUHII shows clear evidence of positive urban heat island irrespective of climatic region and seasonal variation of 0.48-1 degrees C in summer and 0.46-1.32 degrees C in winter is seen. The Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator tests are used to detect the trend of the SUHII during the study period, which suggests a higher percentage of cities showing an increasing trend of SUHII for urban heat islands than the cities of the urban cool island. Pearson's correlation and stepwise multiple linear regression model determine the possible SUHII controlling variable over different climatic zones. During the daytime, the SUHII's distribution is controlled by vegetation, evapotranspiration, and thermal inertia in the summer/winter season. Whereas, it is linked tightly to built-up intensity, white sky albedo, and thermal inertia in both seasons during nighttime. Overall, we found that the stepwise multiple linear regression model can explain the SUHII variance more in the daytime (>0.8) than in nighttime (>0.7, except for tropical cities) and more in understanding the SUHII behaviors for cool cities as compared to hot cities. Moreover, this study also quantifies the significant control of thermal inertia and soil moisture in understating urban heat and cool island behavior over different climatic zones.

TI  - Impact of land-use and land-cover change on soil erosion using the RUSLE model and the geographic information system: a case of Temeji watershed, Western Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of land-use land-cover (LULC) change on soil resources is getting global attention. Soil erosion is one of the critical environmental problems worldwide with high severity in developing countries. This study integrates the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation model with a geographic information system to estimate the impacts of LULC conversion on the mean annual soil loss in the Temeji watershed. In this study, LULC change of Temeji watershed was assessed from 2000 to 2020 by using 2000 Landsat ETM+ and 2020 Landsat OLI/TIRS images and classified using supervised maximum likelihood classification algorithms. Results indicate that the majority of the LULC in the study area is vulnerable to soil erosion. High soil loss is observed when grassland and forest land were converted into cultivated land with a mean soil loss of 88.8 and 86.9 t/ha/year in 2020. Results revealed that about 6,608.5 ha (42.8%) and 8,391.8 ha (54.4%) were categorized under severe classes in 2000 and 2020, respectively. Accordingly, the soil loss severity class is directly correlated with the over-exploitation of forest resources and grasslands for agricultural purposes. These results can be useful for advocacy to enhance local people and stakeholder's participation toward soil and water conservation practices.

TI  - Mapping Forest Height and Aboveground Biomass by Integrating ICESat-2, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data Using Random Forest Algorithm in Northwest Himalayan Foothills of India
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to map forest canopy height by integrating ICESat-2 and Sentinel-1 data and investigate the effect of integrating forest canopy height information with Sentinel-2 data-derived spectral variables on the prediction of spatial distribution of forest aboveground biomass (AGB). Random forest (RF) algorithm was used to develop forest canopy height and AGB models. It was observed that ICESat-2 and Sentinel-1 based model was able to predict forest canopy height with R-2 = 0.84 and %RMSE = 4.48%. Two forest AGB models were developed, with only spectral variables and by incorporating forest height information with spectral variables. The results reflected that incorporation of forest canopy height in the forest AGB model improved the accuracy of the AGB predictions (R-2 = 0.83, %RMSE = 4.64%). The study presents a comprehensive methodology for mapping forest canopy height and AGB.

TI  - Feasibility of Sentinel Lymph Node Sampling in Early-Stage Carcinoma Endometrium: Single-Institution Experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Accurate surgical staging is an essential component in the management of carcinoma endometrium to assess the stage of disease and to tailor adjuvant treatment. Sentinel node technique was introduced as an alternative for extensive lymphadenectomy in early stages to avoid complications associated with lymphadenectomy. Aims and Objectives To assess the detection rate and diagnostic accuracy of SLN mapping in patients with early-stage carcinoma endometrium Materials and Methods Prospective validation study involving 30 patients diagnosed to have early-stage carcinoma endometrium. Sentinel nodes were detected by combined methods of radio colloid dye and isosulphan blue dye injection Results Sentinel lymph node was detected in 19 patients (63.4%). 11 patients had no sentinel nodes. Total number of sentinel nodes isolated was 68 with a mean of 2.26 per patient (range 0-4). Ten (33.33%) patients had single sentinel node location, while 9 (30%) had more than 1 sentinel lymph nodes. Twelve patients had bilateral sentinel nodes, and the most frequent location of sentinel node was obturator, 19 (63.3%) especially on right hemi-pelvis. One patient had a hot para-aortic node, while none had blue para-aortic sentinel node. Average number of lymph nodes obtained by lymphadenectomy was 13 per patient (range 7-22). All patients with sentinel node had negative frozen report as well as in histopathology. Two patients in whom no sentinel nodes were detected by either techniques had metastatic nodes in histopathology report. Conclusion Detection rate was maximum with radiocolloid dye, and it is better to utilize the technique for less graded tumours and endometrioid variants.

TI  - <i>Living Earth</i>: Implementing national standardised land cover classification systems for Earth Observation in support of sustainable development
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) has been recognised as a key data source for supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Advances in data availability and analytical capabilities have provided a wide range of users access to global coverage analysis-ready data (ARD). However, ARD does not provide the information required by national agencies tasked with coordinating the implementation of SDGs. Reliable, standardised, scalable mapping of land cover and its change over time and space facilitates informed decision making, providing cohesive methods for target setting and reporting of SDGs. The aim of this study was to implement a global framework for classifying land cover. The Food and Agriculture Organisation's Land Cover Classification System (FAO LCCS) provides a global land cover taxonomy suitable to comprehensively support SDG target setting and reporting. We present a fully implemented FAO LCCS optimised for EO data; Living Earth, an open-source software package that can be readily applied using existing national EO infrastructure and satellite data. We resolve several semantic challenges of LCCS for consistent EO implementation, including modifications to environmental descriptors, inter-dependency within the modular-hierarchical framework, and increased flexibility associated with limited data availability. To ensure easy adoption of Living Earth for SDG reporting, we identified key environmental descriptors to provide resource allocation recommendations for generating routinely retrieved input parameters. Living Earth provides an optimal platform for global adoption of EO4SDGs ensuring a transparent methodology that allows monitoring to be standardised for all countries.

TI  - Phytoplankton bloom detection during the COVID-19 lockdown with remote sensing data: Using Copernicus Sentinel-3 for north-western Arabian/Persian Gulf case study
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - To examine whether a country-wide COVID-19 lockdown affected phytoplankton development, variability of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the north-western Arabian/Persian Gulf (Kuwait Bay) was investigated using remote sensing instruments Sentinel OLCI between 2018 and 2020 and compared to available in situ collected data. Satellite-retrieved chlorophyll concentrations considerably increased in inshore waters of Kuwait Bay, 1-2 months following the initiation of the 24/7 curfew. The extremely high concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients, especially ammonia, and coincided phytoplankton bloom were revealed in June-July 2020 by opportunity field sampling, supporting the satellite-derived bloom detection. Remote sensing operational monitoring with high spatial resolution sensors provides an exceptional opportunity for emergency analysis and decision making in conditions of natural or anthropogenic crises, which forces the development of regional remote sensing algorithms for the shallow marine environment of the Gulf.

TI  - Effects of drought on groundwater-fed lake areas in the Nebraska Sand Hills
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The Nebraska Sand Hills (NSH) lies in the western part of Nebraska, United States. We chose the north-eastern, central, and western parts of NSH with distinct climate, topography, and hydrology.Study focus: The study assesses the response of hundreds of shallow groundwater-fed lakes to drought. Total lake area (TLA), determined by classifying Landsat satellite images from 1984 to 2018, was juxtaposed with published Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and detrended cumulative PDSI (DeCumPDSI) at monthly and annual timescales. The PDSI and DeCumPDSI were time lagged to incorporate the preceding climatic effect (groundwater time lag) and evaluated against TLA using Bayesian regression analysis.New hydrologic insight for the region: TLA in the NSH respond to the seasonal as well as long-term climatic effects moderated by topography, surface, and subsurface hydrology. A higher determination coefficient R2 and lower mean square error of TLA at annual PDSI and DeCumPDSI illustrate the effect of long-term climatic fluctuations and groundwater influence: the evaporative losses from lakes are modulated by the lake-groundwater exchange, but the groundwater recharge has a longer response time to the drought. The study provides a simple method of assessment of the climate impact that results from the satellite data, gridded climate observation, and statistics for sensitive landscape of the NSH.

TI  - Study on the propagation velocity of internal solitary waves in the Andaman Sea using Terra/Aqua-MODIS remote sensing images
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Andaman Sea has been a classic study region for internal solitary waves (ISWs) for several decades, and extraordinarily large ISWs are characteristic of the Andaman Sea in the Indian Ocean. This paper presents results on the estimation of the propagation velocity of ISWs in the Andaman Sea that were tracked using 195 image pairs acquired by MODIS National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Terra/Aqua satellites between January 2014 and December 2018. A total of 562 ISWs were identified during the period, and the results of the propagation velocity distribution of ISWs in the Andaman Sea are presented. The estimated propagation velocity of ISWs agrees well with the theoretical results derived from the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation using monthly climatology stratification data and local bathymetry. The ISW propagation velocity decreases as they propagate from deep to shallow water; the maximum propagation velocity of 3.27 m/s was estimated on the western side of the Nicobar Islands and minimum speed of 0.54 m/s occurred in the shallow water region of the southeastern Andaman Sea. The results show that the ISW propagation characteristics differ in the northern, central, and southern regions of the Andaman Sea. In the northern Andaman Sea, the velocity of ISWs propagating westward was greater than that of ISWs propagating eastward at the same water depth. In the central Andaman Sea, the propagation velocity of the ISWs differed over a small area at a depth of 2 500 m, and the velocity of ISWs in the deep mixing layer in winter was higher than that in the shallow mixing layer in spring. Monthly variations in ISW propagation velocity were analyzed in the southern Andaman Sea, and the velocity of ISWs differed greatly in shallow water and was not significantly different in deep water. Water depth and monthly stratification play vital roles in controlling the phase speed of ISWs in the Andaman Sea. This study will provide a basis for the propagation and prediction of ISWs in the Andaman Sea.

TI  - Differences and similarities between emergency department syndromic surveillance and hospital discharge data for nonfatal drug overdose
T2  - ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Emergency department syndromic surveillance and hospital discharge data have been used to detect and monitor nonfatal drug overdose, yet few studies have assessed the differences and similarities between these two data sources.Methods: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Drug Overdose Surveillance and Epidemiology system data from 14 states were used to compare these two sources at estimating monthly overdose burden and trends from January 2018 through December 2019 for nonfatal all drug, opioid-, heroin-, and stimulant-involved overdoses.Results: Compared to discharge data, syndromic data captured 13.3% more overall emergency depart-ment visits, 67.8% more all drug overdose visits, 15.6% more opioid-involved overdose visits, and 78.8% more stimulant-involved overdose visits. Discharge data captured 18.9% more heroin-involved overdoses. Significant trends were identified for all drug (Average Monthly Percentage Change [AMPC] = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.4,1.8) and stimulant-involved overdoses (AMPC = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.2,3.7) in syndromic data; opioid-involved overdoses increased in both discharge and syndromic data (AMPC(Discharge) = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.2,1.7; AMPC(Syndromic)= 1.9, CI= 1.1,2.8).Conclusions: Results demonstrate that discharge data may be better for reporting counts, yet syndromic data are preferable to detect changes quickly and to alert practitioners and public health officials to local overdose clusters. These data sources do serve complementary purposes when examining overdose trends. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - BSF: Block Subspace Filter for Removing Narrowband and Wideband Radio Interference Artifacts in Single-Look Complex SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radio signals emitted by various sources, such as ground radars and broadcast/communication devices, can unintentionally cause radio frequency interference (RFI) to spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR), degrading SAR image qualities to various degrees. Most existing methods tackle this problem by applying specially designed preprocessing steps to RFI-polluted level-0 SAR data before SAR focusing. However, such preprocessing is not widely used in spaceborne SAR, as there exist radiometric artifacts due to various RFI sources in the level-1 single-look complex (SLC) image products in many spaceborne SAR data, e.g., Sentinel-1 open data archives. To address this problem, in this article, we first propose a generic subspace model for characterizing a variety of RFI types, which reveals a low-dimensional structure of RFI subspace. Based on the proposed model, we next design a block subspace filter (BSF) for removing RFI artifacts in SLC SAR images directly. Experiments with ERS-2, ENVISAT/ASAR, Sentinel-1, and Gaofen-3 data are presented, and quantitative assessments based on numerical simulations are provided, which demonstrates the promising performance and application potentials of the proposed method. BSF is simple yet efficient and does not require performing preprocessing on level-0 raw data, which is helpful for users to obtain clean SAR images. MATLAB/Octave code implementation of BSF is available at https://github.com/huizhangyang/BSF.

TI  - The spatiotemporal shore morphological changes at east Bhola Island in Meghna Estuary of Bangladesh's central coast
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on the spatiotemporal shore erosion-accretion progression of east Bhola Island, located in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) basin at the mouth of Meghna Estuary on the central coast of Bangladesh. The erosion-accretion in this dynamic coastal region has caused significant morphological changes and frequent shoreline displacement over the last 40 years. This research analyzed 13 LANDSAT satellite images spanning from 1989 to 2018 to evaluate the shoreline change rates for the east face of Bhola Island over the four selected periods, i.e., 1989-2000, 2000-2005, 2005-2010, and 2010-2018. In general, the upstream portion of the east Bhola Island experienced a higher shore erosion rate up to -139 m/year at the northeast face, close to the confluence of the GBM Rivers. At this portion, the Island's geometric shape caused the stability of the shore vulnerable against the ebb tide-dominated high monsoon GBM River flows. In the interim, the southeast portion of the Island near the Bay of Bengal faced a slower rate of shore erosion up to -40 m/year because the upper part of the Island provided shelter to the downstream portion that diverts and minimizes the downward GBM River outfall flow intensities towards the sea. Construction of barrages on the major upstream rivers resulted in the widening of the Bhola's adjoining rivers through lean dry periods and increased wet season flows may be liable for a severe shoreline erosion of -171 m/year in 1989-2000. Further, higher annual rainfall and prolonged floods in 1998 and 2004 increased the shoreline erosion rate to -249 m/year from 2000 to 2005. Nevertheless, after considerable erosion from 1989 to 2005, recently implemented and ongoing shore protection works along the east face of the Island declined the erosion rate drastically to -41 m/year, while some sections achieved shore stability in the latest period of 2005-2018.

TI  - Air pollution scenario over Pakistan: Characterization and ranking of extremely polluted cities using long-term concentrations of aerosols and trace gases
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Pakistan ranks third in the world in terms of mortality attributable to air pollution, with aerosol mass concentrations (PM2.5) consistently well above WHO (World Health Organization) air quality guidelines (AQG). However, regulation is dependent on a sparse network of air quality monitoring stations and insufficient ground data. This study utilizes long-term observations of aerosols and trace gases to characterize and rank the air pollution scenarios and pollution characteristics of 80 selected cities in Pakistan. Datasets used include (1) the Aqua and Terra (AquaTerra) MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectmradiometer) Level 2 Collection 6.1 merged Dark Target and Deep Blue (DTB) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval products; (2) the CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) reanalysis PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 data; (3) the MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2) reanalysis PM2.5 data, (4) the OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) tropospheric vertical column density (TVCD) of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and VCD of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL), (5) the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) Nighttime Lights data, (6) MODIS Collection 6 Version 2 global monthly fire location data (MCD14ML), (7) population density, (8) MODIS Level 3 Collection 6 land cover types, (9) AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) Version 3 Level 2.0 data, and (10) ground-based PM2.5 concentrations from air quality monitoring stations. Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) analyses were performed by integrating with ground-based PM2.5 concentrations and the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) air parcel back trajectories to identify potential pollution source areas which are responsible for extreme air pollution in Pakistan. Results show that the ranking of the top polluted cities depends on the type of pollutant considered and the metric used.For example, Jhang, Multan, and Vehari were characterized as the top three polluted cities in Pakistan when considering AquaTerra DTB AOD products; for PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 Lahore, Gujranwala, and Okara were the top three; for tropospheric NO2 VCD Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Islamabad and for PBL SO2 VCD Lahore, Mirpur, and Gujranwala. The results demonstrate that Pakistan's entire population has been exposed to high PM2.5 concentrations for many years, with a mean annual value of 54.7 mu g/m(3), over all Pakistan from 2003 to 2020.This value exceeds Pakistan's National Environmental Quality Standards (Pak-NEQS, i.e., <15 mu g/m(3) annual mean) for ambient air defined by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) as well as the WHO Interim Target-1 (i.e., mean annual PM2.5 < 35 mu g/m(3)).The spatial analyses of the concentrations of aerosols and trace gases in terms of population density, nighttime lights, land cover types, and fire location data, and the PSCF analysis indicate that Pakistan's air quality is strongly affected by anthropogenic sources inside of Pakistan, with contributions from surrounding countries.Statistically significant positive (increasing) trends in PM1, PM2.5, PM10, tropospheric NO2 VCD, and SO2 VCD were observed in similar to 89%, similar to 67%, similar to 48%, 91%, and similar to 88% of the Pakistani cities (80 cities), respectively.This comprehensive analysis of aerosol and trace gas levels, their characteristics in spatio-temporal domains, and their trends over Pakistan, is the first of its kind. Results will be helpful to the Ministry of Climate Change (Government of Pakistan), Pak-EPA, SUPARCO (Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission), policymakers, and the local research community to mitigate air pollution and its effects on human health.

TI  - Radiomic models for lymph node metastasis prediction in cervical cancer: can we think beyond sentinel lymph node?
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Liu and colleagues performed a retrospective study to validate a computed tomography (CT) scan-based radiomic model to detect lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer. The proposed model incorporating the arterial and venous phase CT-scan features represented a non-invasive method exhibiting high sensitivity in the prediction of lymph node metastasis. It is well established that lymph node metastasis is one of the most significant prognostic factors in cervical cancer. For this reason, management of cervical cancer is strictly related to lymph node status, with international guidelines recommending definitive chemo-radiation in case of metastatic lymph node. More and more evidence supports the use of sentinel lymph node in early-stage cervical cancer but its frozen section analysis may result in false negative results; in locally-advanced stages staging para-aortic lymphadenectomy is proposed by many Authors to tailor chemoradiotherapy treatment, with potential intra-and post-operative related complications. The use of a validated radiomic model able to predict lymph node metastases in radiologically normal lymph nodes may represent an essential tool to possibly spare lympadenectomy related morbidity.

TI  - Development and evaluation of a new method to combine clinical impression survey data with existing laboratory data for veterinary syndromic surveillance with the Canada West Swine Health Intelligence Network (CWSHIN)
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Canada West Swine Health Intelligence Network (CWSHIN) is a surveillance system imbedded in an intelligence network. It has been conducting syndromic surveillance in the four western provinces of Canada since 2012. The quarterly activities include repeated clinical impression surveys, compilation of laboratory data, discussion of trends with an expert group (practitioners, laboratory diagnosticians) and swine health reports for producers and swine practitioners. However, due to the lack of standardized population identifiers across data sources usual methods of combining data could not be applied and the collated data were not being fully utilized and analysed. Therefore in 2019, CWSHIN underwent a substantial review resulting in the "Next Generation CWSHIN". The objectives of this study were to develop and evaluate a new data merging method to combine CWSHIN's clinical impression survey and laboratory data; and to provide examples of analyses and modeling based on these data. The data for analysis were restricted to repeated clinical impression surveys (2019-2020) from veterinary practitioners and laboratory diagnostic data (2016-2020). Merging surveillance data from existing sources can be challenging. Therefore, as an alternative to merge data using a hierarchy of population identifiers, we developed a Disease Map to link surveillance data from all our data-sources. The resulting Data Repository allowed monitoring of temporal trends of syndromes, clinical diseases, and laboratory identified organisms, but it cannot provide estimates of disease occurrence. Two main reasons were the lack of denominators and using existing data on routine diagnostic tests. Therefore, discussion in the expert group (veterinary practitioners, laboratory diagnosticians, swine health experts) was critical to the system's success. Based on repeated clinical impression surveys a stochastic scenario tree model for freedom from Foot and Mouth Disease (CWSHIN Blister model) was also developed. In conclusion, the method to link existing data systems from multiple divergent sources by means of a Disease Map improved CWSHIN's veterinary syndromic surveillance. Together the Data Repository and Disease map provided flexibility to monitor temporal trends, define populations and diseases, and allow analysis. However, it is critical that the surveillance is coupled with a good intelligence network that can help interpret the results and disseminate knowledge to veterinarians and producers.

TI  - Biomarker-based assessment of sublethal toxicity of organic UV filters (ensulizole and octocrylene) in a sentinel marine bivalve <i>Mytilus edulis</i>
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The global occurrence of organic UV filters in the marine environment is of increasing ecotoxicological concern. Here we assessed the toxicity of UV filters ensulizole and octocrylene in the blue mussels Mytilus Muffs exposed to 10 or 100 mu g l(-1) of octocrylene and ensulizole for two weeks. An integrated battery of biochemical and molecular biomarkers related to xenobiotics metabolism and cellular toxicity (induding oxidative stress, DNA damage, apoptosis, autophagy and inflammation) was used to assess the toxicity of these UV filters in the mussels. Octocrylene (but not ensulizole) accumulated in the mussel tissues during the waterborne exposures. Both studied UV filters induced sublethal toxic effects in M. edulis at the investigated concentrations. These effects involved induction of oxidative stress, genotoxicity (indicated by upregulation of DNA damage sensing and repair markers), upregulation of apoptosis and inflammation, and dysregulation of the xenobiotic biotransformation system. Octocrylene induced cellular stress in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas ensulizole appeared to be more toxic at the lower (10 mu g l(-1)) studied concentration than at 100 mu g l(-1). The different concentration-dependence of sublethal effects and distinct toxicological profiles of ensulizole and octocrylene show that the environmental toxicity is not directly related to lipophilicity and bioaccumulation potential of these UV filters and demonstrate the importance of using bioassays for toxicity assessment of emerging pollutants in coastal marine ecosystems.

TI  - Evaluation of the performance of remotely sensed rainfall datasets for flood simulation in the transboundary Mono River catchment, Togo and Benin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: This study focused on the Mono River Basin in west Africa.Study focus: The lack of extensive and functional measurement networks for flood monitoring, introduces satellite-based rainfall datasets as an alternative which needs however to be evaluated beforehand. This study investigated the performance of four satellite and gauge-based rainfall products - Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN), Tropical Applications of Meteorology using Satellite data and ground-based observations (TAMSAT), the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre full daily data (GPCC) - with grid-to-point and hydrologic modelling approaches at different time scales over the Mono basin.New Hydrological Insights for the Region: With the grid-to-point assessment, results show poor performances at daily and annual scales while the seasonal cycles were well reproduced with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) equal or higher than 0.94, and correlation coefficient above 0.9. All assessed products exhibited high probability of detection (POD) and low false alarm ratio (FAR) at dekadal scale. Based on NSE values of hydrologic modelling, best results were achieved by PERSIANN, followed by GPCC and TAMSAT, but CHIRPS performed worst with negative values. By filling the gaps of gauge data with the satellite-based products, we noticed that filling the missing does not necessarily improve the quality of the data and that may not be needed in the case of the Mono basin if interpolation methods like kriging are applied.

TI  - Remote sensing-based dynamic monitoring and environmental change of wetlands in southern Mongolian Plateau in 2000.2018
T2  - CHINA GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The environmental change in the wetlands in the southern Mongolian Plateau has important impacts on the environment of North China and even the entire Northeast Asia, from which the global climate change can be understood on a large scale, especially the climate change in the Mongolian Plateau. This study extracted the information on the wetlands from three stages of remote sensing images (also referred to as RS images) of the study area, including Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images of 2000, TM images of 2010, and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images of 2018. As indicated by the extraction results, the area of wetlands decreased from 796.90 km(2) of 2000 to 666.24 km(2) of 2018 at a rate of 7.26 km(2)/a. The reduced area is 130.66 km(2), which is about 16.4% reduction. And the patch number of wetlands decreased from 731 of 2000 to 316 of 2018 in the study area, approximately 56.8% reduction (415 patches), and the decrease in the area of the wetlands mainly occurred in the northwest endorheic region. In terms of wetland types, the change of the wetlands was dominated by the decrease of lacustrine wetlands, of which the area and patch number decreased by 106.2 km(2) and 242, respectively. Furthermore, the area of the lacustrine wetlands decreased at the highest rate of 8.70 km(2)/a in 2010.2018. From the perspective of spatial distribution, the wetlands in the western part shrunk more notably than those in the eastern part as a whole in the study area. According to local meteorological data, the precipitation gently decreased and the temperature increased (about 1.7 degrees C) from 1975-2018. Overall, the decrease in the area of the wetlands and the temperature rises in the study area were mainly driven by the Mongolian monsoon climate, reduction in precipitation, and human activities.

TI  - Certified community forests positively impact human wellbeing and conservation effectiveness and improve the performance of nearby national protected areas
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Community forests (CFs) aim to improve human wellbeing and conservation effectiveness, though their performance remains contested. A recent innovation in protected area (PA) governance is to combine CFs with forest certification. We assess (1) the impact of certified CFs on wellbeing and conservation effectiveness; (2) gender inequality and elite capture; (3) interaction effects with neighboring national PAs. We used a novel approach that integrates field data consisting of locally identified indicators representative of multidimensional wellbeing, with remotely sensed data on conservation effectiveness and statistical matching to improve causal inference. We found that CFs positively impacted wellbeing, conservation effectiveness, and reduced gender inequality, though they did not reduce elite capture. We also detected positive interaction effects between certified CFs and neighboring national PAs. Our findings suggest that locating contrasting local and national PA governance approaches next to each other may help to maximize wellbeing and conservation benefits within complex multiuse landscapes.

TI  - A complete magnetic sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure in oral cancer patients: A pilot study
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To assess the feasibility and merits of a complete magnetic approach for a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedure in oral cancer patients. Materials and methods: This study included ten oral cancer patients (stage cT1-T2N0M0) scheduled for elective neck dissection (END). Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) were administered peritumorally prior to surgery. A preoperative MRI was acquired to identify lymph nodes (LNs) with iron uptake. A magnetic detector was used to identify magnetic hotspots prior, during, and after the SLNB procedure. The resected sentinel LNs (SLNs) were evaluated using step-serial sectioning, and the neck dissection specimen was assessed by routine histopathological examination. A postoperative MRI was acquired to observe any residual iron. Results: Of ten primary tumors, eight were located in the tongue, one floor-of-mouth (FOM), and one tongue-FOM transition. SPIO injections were experienced as painful by nine patients, two of whom developed a tongue swelling. In eight patients, magnetic SLNs were successfully detected and excised during the magnetic SLNB procedure. During the END procedure, additional magnetic SLNs were identified in three patients. Histopathology confirmed iron deposits in sinuses of excised SLNs. Three SLNs were harboring metastases, of which one was identified only during the END procedure. The END specimens revealed no further metastases. Conclusion: A complete magnetic SLNB procedure was successfully performed in eight of ten patients (80% success rate), therefore the procedure seems feasible. Recommendations for further investigation are made including: use of anesthetics, magnetic tracer volume, planning preoperative MRI, comparison to conventional technique and follow-up.

TI  - Cross-scale phenological monitoring in forest ecosystems: a content-analysis-based review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Phenology has been useful to better understand the climate-vegetation relationship, and it is considered an indicator of climate change impact. Phenological data have been generated through multiple remote sensing techniques and ground-based observations through professional or citizen science. The combination of both techniques is known as cross-scale phenological monitoring. However, no comparative analysis has been carried out to assess the advantages and disadvantages of each of these techniques to characterize the phenological cycle of forest ecosystem species. This work is a content-analysis-based review of scientific literature published between 2000 and 2018 related to cross-scale monitoring methods, to estimate the phenological variation in different forest ecosystems worldwide. For this study, 97 publications related to cross-scale phenological monitoring were selected. We found that 71% of the articles aimed to corroborate the data generated through satellite imagery using surface data from either phenocams, flux towers, or from citizen science networks. More publications were published by authors in the USA (30%), Canada (8%), and China (7%). The most commonly used vegetation index was the normalized difference vegetation index (65%). Some deficiencies in the evaluation of the phenological phases of autumn when compared with surface observations were found. Flux towers and phenocams were included as alternatives for ground-based monitoring. Cross-scale phenological monitoring has the potential to characterize the phenological response of vegetation accurately due to data combinations at two different observation scales. This work contributes to specifying the methodologies used in gathering phenological parameters of the world's forest ecosystems.

TI  - Climate relict vulnerable to extinction from multiple climate-driven threats
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Over the gradually warming Holocene, many species' range limits shifted poleward. However, some populations persisted in climate refugia, such as mountain tops. These climate relict populations are critical components of regional biodiversity, but their isolation renders them vulnerable to other threats, including changes in environmental conditions indirectly related to a warming global climate. We aimed to quantify the role of these indirect climate effects on Florida saltmarsh vole (Microtus pennsylvannicus dukecampbelli; hereafter: "vole"), a poorly understood, endangered climate relict. Location The Gulf of Mexico between Sopchoppy and Pine Island, Florida, USA. Methods We surveyed for voles broadly across their potential range using camera traps and modelled the relationships between vole occurrence and two climate-driven threats: hurricane storm surge and shifting vegetation communities. We quantified these threats using both field-collected and remotely sensed data at fine (3-m) and coarse (150-m) spatial scales. Results Though seemingly suitable habitat exists outside their previously known range, voles appeared restricted to the outer marshes between the Suwannee and Withlacoochee Rivers. Within this range, the sites we surveyed had shorter grass heights, greater Distichils spp. cover, greater potential habitat within 150 m, and were less vulnerable to inundation when compared to sites outside of their range. Main conclusions The complex and varied ways in which climate change alters the physical environment can expose small-ranging species to multiple threats. Even climate relicts, which have endured historical changes in the global climate, may fail to cope with the rapid pace of anthropogenic climate change.

TI  - Satellite-based estimation of the impacts of summertime wildfires on PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in the United States
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent and widespread wildfires in the northwestern United States and Canada have become the "new normal" during the Northern Hemisphere summer months, which significantly degrades particulate matter air quality in the United States. Using the mid-visible Multi Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) satellitederived aerosol optical depth (AOD) with meteorological information from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and other ancillary data, we quantify the impact of these fires on fine particulate matter concentration (PM2.5) air quality in the United States. We use a geographically weighted regression (GWR) method to estimate surface PM2.5 in the United States between low (2011) and high (2018) fire activity years. Our results indicate an overall leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) R-2 value of 0.797 with root mean square error (RMSE) between 3 and 5 mu gm(-3). Our results indicate that smoke aerosols caused significant pollution changes over half of the United States. We estimate that nearly 29 states have increased PM2.5 during the fire-active year and that 15 of these states have PM2.5 concentrations more than 2 times that of the inactive year. Furthermore, these fires increased the daily mean surface PM2.5 concentrations in Washington and Oregon by 38 to 259 mu gm(-3), posing significant health risks especially to vulnerable populations. Our results also show that the GWR model can be successfully applied to PM2.5 estimations from wildfires, thereby providing useful information for various applications such as public health assessment.

TI  - Flood disaster monitoring based on Sentinel-1 data: A case study of Sihu Basin and Huaibei Plain, China
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Summer floods occur frequently in many regions of China, affecting economic development and social stability. Remote sensing is a new technique in disaster monitoring. In this study, the Sihu Basin in Hubei Province of China and the Huaibei Plain in Anhui Province of China were selected as the study areas. Thresholds of backscattering coefficients in the decision tree method were calculated with the histogram analysis method, and flood disaster monitoring in the two study areas was conducted with the threshold method using Sentinel-1 satellite images. Through satellite-based flood disaster monitoring, the flooded maps and the areas of expanded water bodies and flooded crops were derived. The satellite-based monitoring maps were derived by comparing the expanded area of images during a flood disaster with that before the disaster. The difference in spatiotemporal distribution of flood disasters in these two regions was analyzed. The results showed that flood disasters in the Sihu Basin occurred frequently in June and July, and flood disasters in the Huaibei Plain mostly occurred in August, with a high interannual variability. Flood disasters in the Sihu Basin were usually widespread, and the affected area was between Changhu and Honghu lakes. The Huaibei Plain was affected by scattered disasters. The annual mean percentages of flooded crop area were 14.91% and 3.74% in the Sihu Basin and Huaibei Plain, respectively. The accuracies of the extracted flooded area in the Sihu Basin in 2016 and 2017 were 96.20% and 95.19%, respectively. (C) 2021 Hohai University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Global offshore wind turbine dataset
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Offshore wind farms are widely adopted by coastal countries to obtain clean and green energy; their environmental impact has gained an increasing amount of attention. Although offshore wind farm datasets are commercially available via energy industries, records of the exact spatial distribution of individual wind turbines and their construction trajectories are rather incomplete, especially at the global level. Here, we construct a global remote sensing-based offshore wind turbine (OWT) database derived from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time-series images from 2015 to 2019. We developed a percentile-based yearly SAR image collection reduction and autoadaptive threshold algorithm in the Google Earth Engine platform to identify the spatiotemporal distribution of global OWTs. By 2019, 6,924 wind turbines were constructed in 14 coastal nations. An algorithm performance analysis and validation were performed, and the extraction accuracies exceeded 99% using an independent validation dataset. This dataset could further our understanding of the environmental impact of OWTs and support effective marine spatial planning for sustainable development.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinling-Daba Mountains region (Qinba) is an important geographical transitional zone across the north and south of China. To comprehensively understand the ecological transition in the Qinba over past two decades, this study assessed and predicted the spatiotemporal variations of vegetation comparatively, using 250-m time series MODIS NDVI and EVI products. From 2000 to 2019, remarkable increases were observed both in annual and seasonal NDVI and EVI (P < 0.05), and the increasing rate of NDVI was higher than that of EVI for all temporal scales, except summer. Compared to NDVI, larger areas of no significant change were obtained in annual, autumn, and winter EVI, primarily distributed in the high-altitude regions of western Qinba. All assessed vegetation types increased significantly during past two decades except alpine vegetation and marsh, however, the seasons in which the significant increase in NDVI and EVI occurred varied for different vegetation types. Hurst exponent analysis suggested that inconsistent characteristics of vegetation dynamic trends were stronger in the future across Qinba. The area proportion of unfavorable trends, identified mainly covered with cultivated vegetation and scrub, was much larger than that of favorable trends, especially detected by EVI. Areas likely to experience vegetation variation of unfavorable and undetermined trends deserve high focus.

TI  - Hard-Bottom Megabenthic Communities of a Chilean Fjord System: Sentinels for Climate Change?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Chilean Patagonia hosts one of the extensive fjord systems in the world, spanning more than 1,600 km between 41 and 55 degrees S, and with a complex geomorphology and hydrography that supports rich and unique assemblages of marine fauna. The biodiversity of benthic organisms is possibly further enhanced by the geographic position of the region that extends far south into subantarctic waters. However, we currently lack an exhaustive picture of the zonation and ecological functioning of the benthic communities within Chilean fjords. The present study provides a detailed examination of the hard substrata megabenthic communities inhabiting the Puyuhuapi and Jacaf fjord system, in the Aysen Region of Chile. Fifty-nine stations scattered along these fjords were explored through SCUBA diving surveys, at depths between 5 and 30 m, and 16 stations were characterized in terms of benthic cover and diversity using replicated underwater photography. Ten hard bottom megabenthic communities were identified within the fjords, with some communities newly described for this region. Community composition varied both along-fjord, and with depth, and was apparently driven by variation in environmental properties. Our characterization of these fjord communities improves overall knowledge of the functioning of the fjords, and provides a useful baseline against which future anthropogenic pressures can be assessed. Future shifts in bathymetric and geographical distributions might indicate detrimental effects of climate changes, and we therefore propose that characteristic communities could be adopted as "sentinels" for overall environmental status of these unique fjord ecosystems. In this regard, detailed mapping of the distribution of megabenthic communities can provide a fundamental tool that assists in best management practices for these ecosystems.

TI  - On the use of Sentinel-2 satellites and lidar surveys for the change detection of shallow bathymetry: The case study of North Carolina inlets
T2  - COASTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping bathymetric change is a core task for a wide range of navigation, research, monitoring, and design applications. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) can support this activity, particularly when using data from a platform, like the Sentinel-2A/B twin mission of the Copernicus programme, which provides routine and repetitive image acquisition at 10 m spatial resolution. As a result, SDB can expand on the temporal and spatial scope of more conventional mapping methods, such as lidar (or multi-beam). In this study, we use SDB, in comparison with high-resolution airborne lidar bathymetry (ALB), to quantify bathymetric changes at two inlets in North Carolina following the impacts of the devastating Hurricane Florence in September 2018. A recently developed multi-temporal SDB model that overcomes problems associated with turbidity and noise effects (whitecaps, ships, cloud shadows, etc.) is used with Sentinel-2 imagery. We identify bathymetric changes in shallow areas with navigation channels in two of the most dynamic inlets in the Outer Banks, Oregon and Hatteras. Multiple lidar surveys are used to validate the SDB method and for an assessment of accuracy and vertical uncertainty. The multi-temporal SDB products and ALB both show similar results in the erosion/accretion patterns. Comparing the change determined from the two methods, gives a median absolute error of similar to 0.5 m of SDB compared with ALB, with bias of +/- 0.2 m for depths <= 7 m; errors that are equivalent to those associated with the SDB estimated absolute depths. The composited SDB yields greater spatial coverage than lidar because it can retrieve data in areas where the lidar mission may have been constrained by turbidity or surf, and also because of the 300-km swath width. The Sentinel-2 constellation provides five-day revisit at the equator (more frequent at higher latitudes), allowing rapid construction of a bathymetric map as well as developing an archive for retrospective analysis. By implementing the multi-temporal turbidity correction, SDB based on Sentinel-2 may substantially enhance existing survey methods for change detection and support operational and recursive coastal monitoring on local to regional scales.

TI  - Feasibility and reliability of sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with positive axillary nodes at initial diagnosis: An up-to-date meta-analysis of 3,578 patients
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is increasingly adopted in the therapy of breast cancer (BC) patients with positive axillary nodes (cN+), but the reliability and feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) following NACT are still controversial. The objective of the present study is to conduct an updated meta-analysis on this issue. Methods: A literature search was performed using PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science to identify papers published from January 1, 2000 to October 22, 2020 to research SLNB after NACT in BC patients. Studies that met the quality standard were enrolled for this meta-analysis. Results: A total of 3578 participants from 27 trials were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of the identification rate (IR) for SLNB was 91 %, and the false negative rate (FNR) was 15 %. The pooled negative prediction value (NPV), accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity were 82 %, 89 %, 97 %, and 85 %, respectively. In subgroup analysis, the application of dual mapping could clearly decrease the FNR. The FNR was significantly high in the luminal types, and it declined as more sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were removed. Conclusion: SLNB following NACT is now technically feasible for BC with cN+. However, it must be emphasized that the FNR is unacceptable high. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Objective Assessment of Postoperative Morbidity After Breast Cancer Treatments with Wearable Activity Monitors: The "BRACELET" Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Current validated tools to measure upper limb dysfunction after breast cancer treatment, such as questionnaires, are prone to recall bias and do not enable comparisons between patients. This study aimed to test the feasibility of wearable activity monitors (WAMs) for achieving a continuous, objective assessment of functional recovery by measuring peri-operative physical activity (PA). Methods A prospective, single-center, non-randomized, observational study was conducted. Patients undergoing breast and axillary surgery were invited to wear WAMs on both wrists in the peri-operative period and then complete upper limb function (DASH) and quality-of-life (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaires. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the construct validity and concurrent validity of WAMs. Results The analysis included 39 patients with a mean age of 55 +/- 13.2 years. Regain of function on the surgically treated side was observed to be an increase of arm activity as a percentage of preoperative levels, with the greatest increase observed between the postoperative days 1 and 2. The PA was significantly greater on the side not treated by surgery than on the surgically treated side after week 1 (mean PA, 75.8% vs. 62.3%; p < 0.0005) and week 2 (mean PA, 91.6% vs. 77.4%; p < 0.005). Subgroup analyses showed differences in recovery trends between different surgical procedures. Concurrent validity was demonstrated by a significant negative moderate correlation between the PA and DASH questionnaires (R = -0.506; p < 0.05). Conclusion This study demonstrated the feasibility and validity of WAMs to objectively measure postoperative recovery of upper limb function after breast surgery, providing a starting point for personalized rehabilitation through early detection of upper limb physical morbidity.

TI  - Satellite-based flood mapping in the boreal region for improving situational awareness
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Space-borne remote sensing techniques enable near real-time mapping of floods cost-efficiently. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical sensors are the most suitable for flood detection. However, SAR has become more popular, due to the independence of sunlight and weather conditions, and the increasing data availability. Typical spring floods occurred in northern Finland during 2018. Various remote sensing sources were utilised for monitoring and damage estimation of the flooding. Floods were mapped with the SAR-based Finnish Flood Centre's Flood Detection Algorithm (FC-FloDA), a standard threshold-based approach applied to Sentinel-1, and a visual interpretation of Sentinel-2 images. In addition, flood maps from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) and aerial photographs from the city of Tornio were ordered. The flood products and interpretations were compared, and a deeper accuracy assessment was conducted on the FC-FloDA maps. FC-FloDA was, in general, the most successful in detecting floods within the test areas. The EMS product and the Sentinel-1 interpretation worked well in open areas, but did not detect floods in forests. The superiority of Flood Centre's product is mainly based on the adaptation of the algorithm to northern boreal environments and the selection of an optimal polarisation for detecting floods also under tree canopies.

TI  - Body size and digestive system shape resource selection by ungulates: A cross-taxa test of the forage maturation hypothesis
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The forage maturation hypothesis (FMH) states that energy intake for ungulates is maximised when forage biomass is at intermediate levels. Nevertheless, metabolic allometry and different digestive systems suggest that resource selection should vary across ungulate species. By combining GPS relocations with remotely sensed data on forage characteristics and surface water, we quantified the effect of body size and digestive system in determining movements of 30 populations of hindgut fermenters (equids) and ruminants across biomes. Selection for intermediate forage biomass was negatively related to body size, regardless of digestive system. Selection for proximity to surface water was stronger for equids relative to ruminants, regardless of body size. To be more generalisable, we suggest that the FMH explicitly incorporate contingencies in body size and digestive system, with small-bodied ruminants selecting more strongly for potential energy intake, and hindgut fermenters selecting more strongly for surface water.

TI  - Impact of Cloud Reduction on MODIS Thermal Infrared Sea Surface Temperature Retrieval
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the significant influence of clouds on thermal infrared (TIR) data sea surface temperature (SST) retrieval, this study focuses on the reduction of cloud influence on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) longwave SST retrieval. First, the quality level (QL) 3 MODIS SSTs are classified into cloudy or clear-sky pixels based on MODIS cloud mask products. The cloudy SST pixels, flagged as confident cloudy or probably cloudy in the cloud masks, are further classified into three groups according to their associated daytime cloud-top and optical properties. Taking the SSTs measured by 11 buoys over one year as the reference data, those three groups of cloudy SSTs are significantly underestimated, with biases of -33.45 degrees C, -6.35 degrees C, and -4.72 degrees C. The QL 3 clear-sky SSTs are identified as probably and confident clear in the cloud masks and are not influenced by clouds, with a bias of nearly 0 degrees C. Then, three support vector regression (SVR) models are individually proposed for the three groups of cloudy SSTs. Taking the cloud-top and optical parameters as inputs of the proposed SVR models, we can obtain SSTs with a bias of 0 degrees C and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 1.6 degrees C for the three groups of cloudy SSTs. The method proposed in this study shows the potential for TIR SST estimation under some cloudy conditions using satellite remote sensing cloud products. Considering the RMSE of 0.4 degrees C in operational sea surface temperature and sea ice analysis, further study is needed before actual applying the method proposed in this study.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent years recorded an increasing number of short duration - high-intensity rainfall events in the Indian subcontinent consequent with urban and riverine flash floods. Rapid assessments of flooded areas are key for effective mitigation strategies and disaster risk plans, as well as to prepare operative policies for future events. Herein, we present an integrated methodology for rapidly mapping the flood extent, and depths based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and a digital elevation model (DEM). Incessant rain during August 2019 brought heavy riverine flooding in southern India, killed at least 280 people, and displaced about one million inhabitants from low-lying areas. We used SAR images by Sentinel-1 before, and during the flooding, and the MERIT DEM which enabled us to map the flood extent and flood depth of the inundation zones. Because the coverage of Sentinel-1 scene was limited to the Kabini river section during the flood period, flood extent and depth maps for the adjacent basin was generated by mapping the susceptibility for flooding using the training set obtained from the flood time Sentinel-1 images, and a set of predictive variables derived from DEM using random forest model. Qualitative analysis and cross-comparison with a numerical flood model proved the proposed approach is highly reliable with an accuracy value of 90% and 86% respectively for training and validation data, thus allowing a precise, simple, and fast flood mapping. The methodology presented here could be applied to other flooded areas having incomplete inventory in the context of flood risk assessment.

TI  - 30 m global impervious surface area dynamics and urban expansion pattern observed by Landsat satellites: From 1972 to 2019
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Using more than three million Landsat satellite images, this research developed the first global impervious surface area (GISA) dataset from 1972 to 2019. Based on 120,777 independent and random reference sites from 270 cities all over the world, the omission error, commission error, and F-score of GISA are 5.16%, 0.82%, and 0.954, respectively. Compared to the existing global datasets, the merits of GISA include: (1) It provided the global ISA maps before the year of 1985, and showed the longest time span (1972-2019) and the highest accuracy (in terms of a large number of randomly selected and third-party validation sample sets); (2) it presented a new global ISA mapping method including a semi-automatic global sample collection, a locally adaptive classification strategy, and a spatio-temporal post-processing procedure; and (3) it extracted ISA from the whole global land area (not from an urban mask) and hence reduced the underestimation. Moreover, on the basis of GISA, the long time series global urban expansion pattern (GUEP) has been calculated for the first time, and the pattern of continents and representative countries were analyzed. The two new datasets (GISA and GUEP) produced in this study can contribute to further understanding on the human's utilization and reformation to nature during the past half century, and can be freely download from http://irsip.whu.edu.cn/resources/dataweb.php.

TI  - Primary melanoma of the anorectal region: clinical and histopathological review of 17 cases. A retrospective cohort study
T2  - COLORECTAL DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - Aim The aim of our study was to scrutinize diagnostic and treatment factors that may contribute to the low survival rate from anorectal melanoma while adding 17 more cases to the global research database. Method We carried out a retrospective analysis of 17 cases of anorectal melanoma treated at a single institution from 2000 to 2020. Data on patient age, sex, complaints, treatment and survival as well as tumour size, resection margins, histological and immunohistochemical features were assessed. Results The median age of patients was 72 +/- 12.49 (45-92) years. Most of the patients were women (n = 11, 64.71%). Three (17.65%) patients underwent no radical treatment. Of eight patients treated initially with radical surgery (either total mesorectal excision or abdominoperineal resection), six (75%) were found to have positive lymph nodes. Mean survival was 20 +/- 23.46 (1-84) months. The average diameter of the resected tumours was 5.43 +/- 3.02 cm (1.3-10 cm). Most tumours had epithelioid or spindle cell morphology and were positive for one or more melanocytic markers (S100, HMB-45 or MITF). More than half of the tumours contained no or very little melanin pigment. None of the tumours had significant lymphocytic infiltration. Three tumours showed positivity for keratins (PANCK or CAM5.2) and one tumour showed positivity for C-KIT stain. Conclusion An aggressive surgical approach may have an effect on survival in most early stages while more advanced disease benefits from a more conservative approach. Attention to sentinel lymph nodes and further systemic research into therapy is required. For now, treatment and diagnostic modalities seem to be inconsistent, requiring further investigation to elucidate common points.

TI  - Data-Driven Cloud Clustering via a Rotationally Invariant Autoencoder
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced satellite-borne remote sensing instruments produce high-resolution multispectral data for much of the globe at a daily cadence. These datasets open up the possibility of improved understanding of cloud dynamics and feedback, which remain the biggest source of uncertainty in global climate model projections. As a step toward answering these questions, we describe an automated rotation-invariant cloud clustering (RICC) method that leverages deep learning autoencoder technology to organize cloud imagery within large datasets in an unsupervised fashion, free from assumptions about predefined classes. We describe both the design and implementation of this method and its evaluation, which uses a sequence of testing protocols to determine whether the resulting clusters: 1) are physically reasonable (i.e., embody scientifically relevant distinctions); 2) capture information on spatial distributions, such as textures; 3) are cohesive and separable in latent space; and 4) are rotationally invariant (i.e., insensitive to the orientation of an image). Results obtained when these evaluation protocols are applied to RICC outputs suggest that the resultant novel cloud clusters capture meaningful aspects of cloud physics, are appropriately spatially coherent, and are invariant to orientations of input images. Our results support the possibility of using an unsupervised data-driven approach for automated clustering and pattern discovery in cloud imagery.

TI  - Uncovering the Composition and Diversity of Pelagic Copepods in the Oligotrophic Blue Water of the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The subtropical gyres occupy approximately 40% of the surface of the Earth and are widely recognized as oligotrophic zones. Among them, the South Pacific subtropical gyre (SPSG) shows the lowest chlorophyll-a levels (0.02-0.04 mu gL(-1)), the deepest nutricline (>200 m) and euphotic zone (similar to 160 m), and the lowest rates of nitrogen fixation. The zooplankton community is poorly known in the SPSG. We report a study focused on the composition and distribution of pelagic copepods within the gyre so as to uncover the diversity and habitat conditions of this special community. Therefore, during the austral spring of 2015, an oceanographic cruise was conducted across the eastern side of the SPSG. Physical and chemical variables were measured in the upper 1000 m, while zooplankton samples were collected by means of vertically stratified hauls using a multiple net sampler for five layers (0-800 m). Satellite data were also used to assess near-surface phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) and physical-dynamics conditions during the cruise, and 121 species of copepods were identified, which belonged to five taxonomic orders, 24 families, and 50 genera. Calanoida and Cyclopoida were the most frequent orders, containing 57% and 38% of species, respectively, whereas Harpacticoida and Mormonilloida contained 2% of species each, and Siphonostomatoida contained 1% of species. The vertical distribution of copepods revealed an ecological zonation linked to a strongly stratified water column, such that three different vertical habitats were defined: shallow (0-200 m), intermediate (200400 m), and deep (400-800 m). Both the abundance and diversity of copepods were greater in the shallow habitat and were strongly associated with water temperature, whereas copepods in the subsurface layers subsisted with relatively low oxygen waters (2-3 mL O-2 L-1) and presumably originated at the Chilean upwelling zone, being transported offshore by mesoscale eddies. Furthermore, the analysis of species composition revealed a marked dominance of small-sized copepods, which may play a key role in nutrient recycling under an oligotrophic condition, as inferred from their mostly omnivorous feeding behavior. Our findings also suggested a potentially high endemism within the gyre, although basin-scale circulation and mesoscale eddies, traveling from the coastal upwelling zone and transporting plankton, can also influence the epipelagic fauna.

TI  - Early infestations by arthropod pests induce unique changes in plant compositional traits and leaf reflectance
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND With steadily growing interest in the use of remote-sensing technologies to detect and diagnose pest infestations in crops, it is important to investigate and characterize possible associations between crop leaf reflectance and unique pest-induced changes in plant compositional traits. Accordingly, we compiled plant compositional traits from chrysanthemum and gerbera plants in four treatments: non-infested, or infested with mites, thrips or whiteflies, and we acquired hyperspectral leaf reflectance data from the same plants over time (0-14 days). RESULTS Plant compositional traits changed significantly in response to arthropod infestations, and individual chrysanthemum and gerbera plants were classified with 78% and 80% accuracy, respectively. Based on leaf reflectance, individual plants from the four treatments were classified with moderate accuracy levels of 76% (gerbera) and 73% (chrysanthemum) but with a clear distinction between non-infested and infested plants. Accurate and consistent diagnosis of biotic stressors was not achieved. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this is the first study in which infestations by multiple economically important arthropod pests are directly compared and associated with leaf reflectance responses and changes in plant compositional traits. It is important to highlight that imposed stress levels were low, period of infestation was short, and hyperspectral remote-sensing data were acquired at four time points with analyses based on large data sets (3826 leaf reflectance profiles for chrysanthemum and 4041 for gerbera). This study provides novel insight into crop responses to different biotic stressors and into possible associations between plant compositional traits and hyperspectral leaf reflectance data acquired from crop leaves.

T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The short-term deformation of Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL), southwestern India, built on the massive floodplain of the Periyar River, is the topic of inquiry in this study. An unprecedented flood of August 2018 instigated a refined understanding of the ground deformation, if any, of the CIAL property. Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR), using Sentinel-1A images, was used for documenting the ground deformation, which generated 5563 Persistent Scatterer Interferometric (PSI) points. Though the velocity of PSI points swayed positively (maximum velocity of 23.61 mm/y) and negatively (minimum velocity of - 21.83 mm/y), the majority values were negative. Interpolation of velocity values showed the predominance of the negative field for all the components of CIAL infrastructure. Ground deformation was modelled using Settle3, based on standard penetration test (SPT) values of five boreholes in the study area. Comparison between the PSInSAR and Settle3 modelling of deformation shows correlation amongst the mean values of both the approaches. PSInSAR monitoring and Settle3 modelling results relate to the varying thickness and properties of soils both in situ and the landfilled material. Findings also highlight the need for geological and geotechnical site characterization before the construction, and remote monitoring of critical long-term assets, especially strategic ones such as airport.

TI  - Cytologic diagnosis of metastatic melanoma by FNA: A practical review
T2  - CANCER CYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Malignant melanoma (MM) is a highly aggressive neoplasm with a growing worldwide incidence. It is not uncommon that the disease is already metastatic at the time of the first diagnosis. Regional lymph nodes and skin are the first and most common metastatic sites, followed by distant visceral sites (lungs, liver, and central nervous system) and bone. In this clinical setting, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) often represents the first diagnostic approach. FNA is a useful tool to obtain a rapid and accurate diagnosis, in conjunction with ancillary techniques and molecular analysis, as recommended by recent guidelines. The aim of this review was to describe the cytomorphology, immunocytochemical tools, and molecular tools used for the diagnosis of MM metastases on FNA.

TI  - How far spatial resolution affects the ensemble machine learning based flood susceptibility prediction in data sparse region
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the effect of digital elevation model (DEM) and its spatial resolution on flood simulation modeling has been well studied, the effect of coarse and finer resolution image and DEM data on machine learning ensemble flood susceptibility prediction has not been investigated, particularly in data sparse conditions. The present work was, therefore, to investigate the performance of the resolution effects, such as coarse (Landsat and SRTM) and high (Sentinel-2 and ALOS PALSAR) resolution data on the flood susceptible models. Another motive of this study was to construct very high precision and robust flood susceptible models using standalone and ensemble machine learning algorithms. In the present study, fifteen flood conditioning parameters were generated from both coarse and high resolution datasets. Then, the ANN-multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), bagging (B)-MLP, B-gaussian processes (B-GP) and B-SMOreg algorithms were used to integrate the flood conditioning parameters for generating the flood susceptible models. Furthermore, the influence of flood conditioning parameters on the modelling of flood susceptibility was investigated by proposing an ROC based sensitivity analysis. The validation of flood susceptibility models is also another challenge. In the present study, we proposed an index of flood vulnerability model to validate flood susceptibility models along with conventional statistical techniques, such as the ROC curve. Results showed that the coarse resolution based flood susceptibility MLP model has appeared as the best model (area under curve: 0.94) and it has predicted 11.65 % of the area as very high flood susceptible zones (FSz), followed by RF, B-MLP, B-GP, and B-SMOreg. Similarly, the high resolution based flood susceptibility model using MLP has predicted 19.34 % of areas as very high flood susceptible zones, followed by RF (14.32 %),B-MLP (14.88 %), B-GP, and B-SMOreg. On the other hand, ROC based sensitivity analysis showed that elevation influences flood susceptibility largely for coarse and high resolution based models, followed by drainage densityand flow accumulation. In addition, the accuracy assessment using the IFV model revealed that the MLP model outperformed all other models in the case of a high resolution imageThe coarser resolution image's performance level is acceptable but quite low. So, the study recommended the use of high resolution images for developing a machine learning algorithm based flood susceptibility model. As the study has clearly identified the areas of higher flood susceptibility and the dominant influencing factors for flooding, this could be used as a good database for flood management.

TI  - Mesenteric Lymph Node Transplantation in Mice to Study Immune Responses of the Gastrointestinal Tract
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) are sentinel sites of enteral immunosurveillance and immune homeostasis. Immune cells from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) are constantly recruited to the mLNs in steady-state and under inflammatory conditions resulting in the induction of tolerance and immune cells activation, respectively. Surgical dissection and transplantation of lymph nodes (LN) is a technique that has supported seminal work to study LN function and is useful to investigate resident stromal and endothelial cell biology and their cellular interactions in experimental disease models. Here, we provide a detailed protocol of syngeneic mLN transplantation and report assays to analyze effective mLN engraftment in congenic recipients. Transplanted mLNs allow to study T cell activation and proliferation in preclinical mouse models. Donor mLNs proved viable and functional after surgical transplantation and regenerated blood and lymphatic vessels. Immune cells from the host completely colonized the transplanted mLNs within 7-8 weeks after the surgical intervention. After allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), adoptively transferred allogeneic CD4(+) T cells from FVB/N (H-2(q)) mice homed to the transplanted mLNs in C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) recipients during the initiation phase of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). These CD4(+) T cells retained full proliferative capacity and upregulated effector and gut homing molecules comparable to those in mLNs from unmanipulated wild-type recipients. Wild type mLNs transplanted into MHCII deficient syngeneic hosts sufficed to activate alloreactive T cells upon allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, even in the absence of MHCII+ CD11c(+) myeloid cells. These data support that orthotopically transplanted mLNs maintain physiological functions after transplantation. The technique of LN transplantation can be applied to study migratory and resident cell compartment interactions in mLNs as well as immune reactions from and to the gut under inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions.

TI  - Identifying mismatches of ecosystem services supply and demand under semi-arid conditions: The case of the Oasis City Urumqi, China
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the balance between supply and demand of ecosystem services (ESs) is helpful for sustainable urban management. However, the interactions among multiple ESs supplies and demands remain under-researched, and ESs supply and demand spatial heterogeneity and correlation characteristics at the city level are rarely studied, especially in arid areas. To fill this gap, we established a comprehensive assessment framework of ESs supply and demand through integrating multi-source remote sensing data, social economy, and policy objectives, for the oasis city of Urumqi, China. The ESs supply-demand mismatches were revealed at the city level, and the spatial relationship between the ESs supply and demand was analyzed using spatial statistics. The results demonstrated that: (1) The total quantity of supply and demand of food provision, carbon sequestration, PM10 removal, and recreation services in Urumqi revealed that the demand was greater than the supply, the deficits being 16.10 x 10(7) kcal/ha, 6.88 x 10(4) t/ha, 155.86 kg/ha, and 697.26, respectively. (2) The supply and demand assessment of ESs revealed spatial differences from the city center to the suburbs, which further indicated that there are neighborhood similarities between the supply and demand of ESs. (3) The matching types of ESs supply and demand present obvious spatial heterogeneity, which can be divided into four types: High-high, high-low, low-high, and low-low. Owing to rapid urban development in the inner city, the city center is dominated by low-high, whereas the urban-rural ecotone is characterized by high-low, owing to the higher elevation and water resource advantages in the suburbs. Based on the analysis of the supply, demand, and matching of ESs, economic development and sustainable management policies are proposed for different ecological spaces.

TI  - Introducing SentiMag in a rural setting: A 5-year experience
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Sentimag device is a probe that contains a sensitive magnetometer which detects either an implantable magnetic marker (MagSeed) or an infectable superparamagnetic ironoxide nanoparticle tracer (MagTrace). MagSeed is used to localise impalpable breast lesions; MagTrace is used to identify sentinel lymph nodes. In Australasia, Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, using radioactive colloid injection, is a mainstay of prognostication in breast surgery in patients with a clinically negative axilla. In addition, radioactive seeds or hookwires have been used to detect impalpable breast lesions. Gisborne Hospital has been using the SentiMag device since June 2016 to both identify sentinel lymph nodes (Magtrace) and impalpable tumours (Magseed). This study gives perspective over more than 5 years on how this new technology can benefit patients and clinicians in the rural setting. Methods Patient data had been collected by the operative surgeon prospectively and corroborated with the coding department. Consecutive cases performed by a single surgeon were included in this study. Inclusion criteria were: (1) any patient who needed localisation of an impalpable breast lesion; (2) any patient who needed a sentinel lymph node biopsy; (3) cases were collected from January 2013 with the large majority of cases were collected between January 2015 and Jan 2020. Comparisons were made between patients with different localisation methods. Basic demographics were collected at the time of the surgery and outcomes then recorded. Staging, lymph node status, lymph node detection rates and complications were collected. Mode of tumour and sentinel node location was recorded. Financial data was collected from administrative staff via receipts and invoices of purchases to the hospital. Results Of the 125 patients included in this study: 23 underwent magnetic seed insertion; 15 underwent a hookwire insertion; 45 cases used MagTrace injection; 71 cases used radioactive colloid injection. There was a significantly higher detection rate of two or more sentinel nodes in the SentiMag group. (91% vs. 71.8%, p = 0.01). Neither complication rates, nor cancer detection rates were significantly different. Eighty-four (67.2%) cases did not require tumour location. Conclusion SentiMag is safe to use in a rural setting. Using the SentiMag system can simplify care for patients and surgeons and was shown to be cost effective in our hospital.

T2  - RICERCHE DI MATEMATICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Leverages of magnetic cross-field, thermal radiation, second order chemical reaction on the unsteady three dimensional flow of electrically conducting Cu-Al2O3/water hybrid nanofluid flow past a bidirectionally stretchable melting surface are investigated in the present scrutiny. A comparative inspection of Cu-Al2O3/water hybrid nanofluid and Al2O3/water nanofluid is achieved. The compatible models for the thermo-physical properties are chosen. The highly coupled nonlinear boundary layer partial differential equations and the associated initial-boundary restrictions are converted into a dimensionless structure employing the appropriate non dimensional variables. These dimension free equations are then fixed by preferring the explicit finite difference scheme. Since the current numerical procedure is conditionally stable, the convergence and stability criteria are established to justify the certainty of the outcomes. The superiority of the sundry parameters on the concentration, temperature and velocity profile in the boundary layer region are evaluated numerically and displayed through the diagrams. The responses of engineering coefficients (Nusselt number Nu, skin friction coefficients C fX, C fY and the Sherwood number Sh) in consequence of distinct parameters are exhibited through the tables. It is detected that the heat transfer and the mass transfer rate of Cu-Al2O3/water hybrid flow seem to be higher than that of Al2O3/water nanofluid flow. Due to the high thermal properties, hybrid nanofluids are chosen in many fields such as space, ships and defence, biomedical, nuclear system cooling and automotive.

TI  - Impacts of climate change and afforestation on vegetation dynamic in the Mu Us Desert, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important part of the terrestrial ecosystem, vegetation is commonly used as an indicator to evaluate climate change and ecological restoration efforts. In China's farming-pastoral areas, the Mu Us Desert is a typical area utilizing desertification control methods where vegetation cover has significantly changed in recent years. It is important to assess how climate change and afforestation affect vegetation activity dynamic in this region. This study aims to investigate the relationship between vegetation and climate change by using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and to find the cause of vegetation change by performing multiple linear regression analysis in the Mu Us Desert (including 11 counties) during the period from 2000 to 2019. The results showed that NDVI of the growing season (May to October) across the whole region increased by 0.0058 per year during the 20-year study period. Correlation analysis between the NDVI and climatic factors indicated that precipitation, temperature and relative humidity had a significant positive correlation, and mean wind speed and sunshine hours had a significant negative correlation across the study area (except for mean wind speed in Shenmu and Yuyang). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the relative contribution by climatic factors and afforestation to NDVI change was 41.9% and 58.1% across the study area, respectively. Findings from our study may help to provide scientific support for decision making concerning ecological restoration management and policy efficiency estimation in other similar desert areas.

TI  - Fusing Landsat and SAR Data for Mapping Tropical Deforestation through Machine Learning Classification and the PVts-β Non-Seasonal Detection Approach
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on mapping tropical deforestation using time series and machine learning algorithms. Before detecting changes in the time series, we reduced seasonality using Photosynthetic Vegetation (PV) index fractions obtained from Landsat images. Single and multi-temporal filters were used to reduce speckle noise from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images (i.e., ALOS PALSAR and Sentinel-1B) before fusing them with optical images through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We detected only one change in the two PV series using a non-seasonal detection approach, as well as in the fused images through five machine learning algorithms that were calibrated with Cross-Validation (CV) and Monte Carlo Cross-Validation (MCCV). In total, four categories were obtained: forest, cropland, bare soil, and water. We then compared the change map obtained with time series and that obtained with the classification algorithms with the best calibration performance, revealing an overall accuracy of 92.91% and 91.82%, respectively. For statistical comparisons, we used deforestation reference data. Finally, we conclude with some discussions and reflections on the advantages and disadvantages of the detections made with time series and machine learning algorithms, as well as the contribution of SAR images to the classifications, among other aspects.

TI  - Evaluation of a standardised protocol to measure the disease burden of respiratory syncytial virus infection in young children in primary care
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background A better understanding of the burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in primary care is needed for policymakers to make informed decisions regarding new preventive measures and treatments. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a protocol for the standardised measurement of the disease burden of RSV infection in primary care in children aged < 5 years. Methods The standardised protocol was evaluated in Italy and the Netherlands during the 2019/20 winter. Children aged < 5 years who consulted their primary care physician, met the WHO acute respiratory infections (ARI) case definition, and had a laboratory confirmed positive test for RSV (RT-PCR) were included. RSV symptoms were collected at the time of swabbing. Health care use, duration of symptoms and socio-economic impact was measured 14 days after swabbing. Health related Quality of life (HRQoL) was measured using the parent-proxy report of the PedsQL (TM) 4.0 generic core scales (2-4 years) and PedsQL (TM) 4.0 infant scales (0-2 years) 30 days after swabbing. The standardised protocol was evaluated in terms of the feasibility of patient recruitment, data collection procedures and whether parents understood the questions. Results Children were recruited via a network of paediatricians in Italy and a sentinel influenza surveillance network of general practitioners in the Netherlands. In Italy and the Netherlands, 293 and 152 children were swabbed respectively, 119 and 32 tested RSV positive; for 119 and 12 children the Day-14 questionnaire was completed and for 116 and 11 the Day-30 questionnaire. In Italy, 33% of the children had persistent symptoms after 14 days and in the Netherlands this figure was 67%. Parents had no problems completing questions concerning health care use, duration of symptoms and socio-economic impact, however, they had some difficulties scoring the HRQoL of their young children. Conclusion RSV symptoms are common after 14 days, and therefore, measuring disease burden outcomes like health care use, duration of symptoms, and socio-economic impact is also recommended at Day-30. The standardised protocol is suitable to measure the clinical and socio-economic disease burden of RSV in young children in primary care.

TI  - Landscape attributes explain salmonid ecological neighbourhoods across a complex river network
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Defining population neighbourhood boundaries provides a critical spatial framework for understanding ecological processes and informing species-specific conservation and restoration planning. The population neighbourhood boundary demarcates the total quantity of available habitat across life stages where specific ecological processes (e.g., breeding, foraging, migration) occur for all individuals within a population. For mobile species within dendritic freshwater networks, the population neighbourhood boundary can be defined by the upper limit of occurrence (ULO) of an individual within a population. We sought to define contemporary neighbourhood boundaries across a complex river network in southwestern Washington State, U.S.A. by: (1) identifying ULOs for three anadromous fish (Oncorhynchus spp.); and (2) quantifying the relationship of the ULO with landscape attributes and local features for these species of profound social and ecological importance. Extensive field surveys covering 669 river km across 2 years documented the ULOs for coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) as well as any local features, such as natural barriers, that influenced the ULOs. Generalised linear mixed models quantified the relationships between the ULOs and landscape attributes derived from remote sensing data. We identified the ULO for 115 coho salmon terminal streams, 97 steelhead streams, and 57 chum salmon streams. Natural barriers determined the ULO in just 5%-16% of the terminal streams, depending on species. Landscape attributes associated with the ULOs varied among species; however, drainage area, elevation, and geology were important landscape predictors for all species. Models for each species had good to excellent predictive performance (percent correct classification: 78%-89%; AUC: 0.87-0.96). We demonstrated that large-scale landscape attributes can accurately and consistently detect species-specific differences in population neighbourhoods across broad and diverse habitats. In comparison, local scale features (e.g., natural barriers) played a minor role in determining the neighbourhood boundaries in our study catchment. The modelled relationships between landscape attributes and the population neighbourhood provide a framework to guide conservation planning and predict benefits of habitat reconnections.

TI  - Upscaling in Situ Site-Based Albedo Using Machine Learning Models: Main Controlling Factors on Results
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Validation of satellite albedo products is an essential step because their quantitative application lie in their ability to record the real state of the earth surface. Upscaling in situ measurements to the corresponding pixel scale is necessary due to the spatial scale mismatch between in situ and satellite measurements. Machine learning-based models have been increasingly used for upscaling because they can yield more reliable results than traditional methods. Nevertheless, the main controlling factors on upscaled results have rarely been discussed. This article explores the control factors that bring uncertainties to the upscaled results based on machine learning models. Three machine learning models, including random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Cubist models, were selected to upscale single site in situ-based albedo to the coarse pixel scale. The upscaled results were carefully assessed through comparison with pixel scale albedo reference. The results indicate that the accuracy of upscaled results depends on the machine learning models, the inclusion of key variables related to albedo, the dataset selection of these variables, the amount of training data, and the sensitivity of machine learning models to these factors. Despite the dependence on control factors, the machine learning-based upscaling methods generally have excellent applicability across different spatial scales and over other untrained areas. Therefore, they open the door to generating a time series of globally, spatially continuous distributed reference datasets with sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to adequately fulfill the requirement of a comprehensive validation.

TI  - Remote sensing retrieval of winter wheat leaf area index and canopy chlorophyll density at different growth stages
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll density (CCD) are key indicators of crop growth status. In this study, we compared several vegetation indices and their red-edge modified counterparts to evaluate the optimal red-edge bands and the best vegetation index at different growth stages. The indices were calculated with Sentinel-2 MSI data and hyperspectral data. Their performances were validated against ground measurements using R-2, RMSE, and bias. The results suggest that indices computed with hyperspectral data exhibited higher R-2 than multispectral data at the late jointing stage, head emergence stage, and filling stage. Furthermore, red-edge modified indices outperformed the traditional indices for both data genres. Inversion models indicated that the indices with short red-edge wavelengths showed better estimation at the early jointing and milk development stage, while indices with long red-edge wavelength estimate the sought variables better at the middle three stages. The results were consistent with the red-edge inflection point shift at different growth stages. The best indices for Sentinel-2 LAI retrieval, Sentinel-2 CCD retrieval, hyperspectral LAI retrieval, and hyperspectral CCD retrieval at five growth stages were determined in the research. These results are beneficial to crop trait monitoring by providing references for crop biophysical and biochemical parameters retrieval.

TI  - Mechanisms and biomarkers of airway epithelial cell damage in asthma: A review
T2  - CLINICAL RESPIRATORY JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Bronchial asthma is a heterogeneous disease with complex pathological mechanisms representing different phenotypes, including severe asthma. The airway epithelium is a major site of complex pathological changes in severe asthma due, in part, to activation of inflammatory and immune mechanisms in response to noxious agents. Current imaging procedures are unable to accurately measure epithelial and airway remodeling. Damage of airway epithelial cells occurs is linked to specific phenotypes and endotypes which provides an opportunity for the identification of biomarkers reflecting epithelial, and airway, remodeling. Identification of patients with more severe epithelial disruption using biomarkers may also provide personalised therapeutic opportunities and/or markers of successful therapeutic intervention. Here, we review the evidence for ongoing epithelial cell dysregulation in the pathogenesis of asthma, the sentinel role of the airway epithelium and how understanding these molecular mechanisms provides the basis for the identification of candidate biomarkers for asthma prediction, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring.

TI  - Safety and Benefit Of Sentinel Lymph Nodes Biopsy Compared to Regional Lymph Node Dissection in Primary Vulvar Cancer Patients Without Distant Metastasis and Adjacent Organ Invasion: A Retrospective Population Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The safety and benefit of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) compared with regional lymph node dissection (RLND) and no lymph nodes removed (NA) in patients with vulvar squamous cell cancer (VSCC) was not well studied. Methods A retrospective analysis on VSCC patients without distant metastasis and adjacent organ invasion from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database between 2004 and 2016 was carried out. Within subgroups stratified by negative (LN-) or positive (LN+) regional lymph node findings, inverse probability weighting (IPW) adjusted multivariate Fine-Gray compete risk (CR) model and accelerated failure time (AFT) model was used to investigate the factors associated with and cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). Results Of the 3,161 VSCC patients treated with surgery, 287 (9.1%) underwent SLNB, 1,716 (54.3%) underwent RLND, and 1,158 (36.6%) had no regional lymph nodes removed. As illustrated by IPW adjusted multivariate regressions, SLNB was significantly associated with prolonged CSS (LN-, adjusted sub-proportional hazard ratio [sHR] = 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19-0.93; P=0.032; LN+, adjusted sHR = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.16-0.54, P<0.001) and OS (LN-, adjusted time ratio [TR] = 1.38; 95% CI, 0.82-2.32; P=0.226; LN+, adjusted TR = 2.68; 95% CI, 1.73-4.14; P<0.001), although the effect of SLNB on OS was not significant within the LN- cohort. Moreover, SLNB led to improved CSS (adjusted sHR = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.23-0.70; P = 0.001) and OS (adjusted TR=1.15, 95% CI 0.76-1.73, P=0.279) compared with NA. Age was a significant prognostic factor of CSS and OS, whereas tumor size, surgery type, and invasion depth were not. Conclusions SLNB leads to significantly prolonged CSS and OS in VSCC surgery patients without distant metastasis and adjacent organ invasion than RLND, except for the similar OS in the LN- cohort. SLNB could be carried out preferentially for VSCC surgery patients without distant metastasis and adjacent organ invasion, irrespective of tumor size, surgery type, invasion depth, and regional lymph nodes metastasis. Further prospective clinical trials are warranted to confirm the findings of this study.

TI  - Dataset of the mountain green cover index (SDG15.4.2) over the economic corridors of the Belt and Road Initiative for 2010-2019
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountains are undergoing widespread changes caused by human activities and climate change. Given the importance of mountains, the protection and sustainable development of mountain ecosystems have been listed as the goals of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. As one of the indicators, the Mountain Green Cover Index (MGCI) datasets can provide consistent and comparable status of green vegetation in mountainous areas, which can support the mapping of heterogeneous mountain ecosystem health and monitoring changes over time. The production of explicitly high-spatial-resolution MGCI datasets is therefore urgently needed to support the protection measures at subnational and multitemporal scales. In this paper, the MGCI datasets with 500-meter spatial resolutions, covering the economic corridors of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), were developed for 2010 to 2019 based on all available Landsat-8 data and the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. The validation of green vegetation cover with the ground-truth samples indicated that the datasets can achieve an overall accuracy of 94.06%, with well-detailed spatial and temporal variations. The archived datasets include the MGCI of each BRI economic corridor, matched to a geospatial layer denoting the economic corridor boundaries. The essential information of the datasets and their limitations, along with the production flow, were described in this paper. The published geospatial datasets are available at http://www.doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.1005.

TI  - An Assessment of In-situ Water Quality Parameters and its variation with Landsat 8 Level 1 Surface Reflectance datasets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The water quality represents the water's physical, chemical and biological properties and depends on the environment, and anthropogenic influences. Recently, river water in Dehradun has subjected to immense pressure due to contamination from indecorous land use and urbanisation. In this study area, water quality assessment is carried out with the help of in situ observations and satellite surface reflectance from October 2018 to March 2019. Physicochemical and microbial qualities, namely, ambient temperature (AT), electrical conductivity (EC), water temperature (WT), potential hydrogen (pH), free carbon di oxide (CO2), biological oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity (S), total Hardness (TH), calcium hardness (CH), magnesium hardness (MgH), sodium ion (Na), Potassium ion (K), nitrate (NO2), phosphate (PO4), and coliform concentrations (CC) were evaluated in the laboratory, plotted spatially in GIS environment and validated with the Indian Standards (IS). Furthermore, the Pearson correlation matrix was an established between the mean surface reflectance band values of Landsat-8 in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the water quality parameters are collected at each station location. The entire river water has been found an unsuitable for drinking but suitable for irrigation purposes. In future, such studies would be supportive for more effective management strategies to overcome the problems of water pollution.

TI  - Sensitivity of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to land surface temperature, soil moisture and precipitation over district Gautam Buddh Nagar, UP, India
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the trends in MODIS/TERRA derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its correlation with Land Surface Temperature (LST), Soil Moisture (SM), and precipitation over Gautam Buddh Nagar (India), during the period 2005-2018. The region have a sub-humid and quite moderate climate, scattered into cultivable land, forest and fast growing urbanization zone, making it suitable for monitoring vegetation trends and its accompanying factors. The NDVI-derived vegetation growth patterns over the study region of District Gautam Buddh Nagar, illustrate vigorous seasonal cycles, and interannual variations. The correlation between NDVI, and LST (- 0.45) was observed to be higher than the correlation of NDVI with SM (r = 0.43), and precipitation (r = 0.341), suggesting NDVI as more sensitive to LST as compare to SM, and precipitation, while SM shows the worthy positive correlation (r = 0.63) with the precipitation. On a seasonal basis, NDVI shows high values during winter (0.45 +/- 0.02) followed by monsoon (0.44 +/- 0.04), post-monsoon (0.41 +/- 0.02), and pre-monsoon (0.37 +/- 0.04). This study also aims to determine the phase wise status of NDVI and associated parameters.

TI  - Controversial Areas in Axillary Staging: Are We Following the Guidelines?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been the standard of care for clinically node-negative women with invasive breast cancer (IBC); however, there is less agreement on whether to perform SLNB when the risk of metastasis is low or when it does not affect survival or locoregional control. Methods An Institutional Review Board-approved survey was sent to members of the American Society of Breast Surgeons asking in which scenarios surgeons would recommend SLNB. Descriptive statistics and multivariable analysis were performed using SPSS software. Results There was a 23% response rate; 68% identified as breast surgical oncologists, 6% as surgical oncologists, 24% as general surgeons, and 2% as other. The majority practiced in a community setting (71%) versus an academic setting (29%). In a healthy female with clinical T1N0 hormone receptor-positive (HR+) IBC, 83% favored SLNB if the patient was 75 years of age, versus 35% if the patient was 85 years of age. Academic surgeons were less likely to perform axillary staging in a healthy 75-year-old (odds ratio [OR] 0.51 [0.32-0.80], p = 0.004) or a healthy 85-year-old (OR 0.48 [0.31-0.74], p = 0.001). For DCIS, 32% endorsed SLNB in women undergoing lumpectomy, with breast surgical oncologists and academic surgeons being less likely to endorse this procedure (OR 0.54 [0.36-0.82], p = 0.028; and OR 0.53 [0.34-0.83], p = 0.005, respectively). Conclusions Despite studies showing that omitting SLNB in older patients with HR+ IBC does not impact regional control or survival, most surgeons are still opting for axillary staging. In addition, one in three are performing SLNB for lumpectomies for DCIS. Breast surgical oncologists and academic surgeons were more likely to be practicing based on recent data and guidelines. Practice patterns are changing but there is still room for improvement.

TI  - A simple yet robust framework to estimate accurate daily mean land surface temperature from thermal observations of tandem polar orbiters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed and accurate daily mean land surface temperature (T-dm) is valuable for various applications such as air temperature estimation and climate change monitoring. However, most traditional methods employed by the remote sensing community estimate T-dm by averaging the - usually few - observed cloud-free land surface temperatures (LSTs). Such estimates can have large sampling bias, especially for tandem polar orbiters, due to their sparse sampling of diurnal LST dynamics and the unavailability of under-cloud LSTs. To estimate accurate T-dm based on thermal observations from tandem polar orbiters, here we propose a simple yet robust framework that combines the annual temperature cycle (ATC) and the diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) models (termed the ADTC-based framework). The ATC model is used to reconstruct daily instantaneous undercloud LSTs, based on which the DTC model is employed to establish diurnally continuous LST dynamics for estimating T-dm. The proposed framework is validated with geostationary LST observations and in-situ thermal measurements under both cloud-free and overcast conditions. The validations show that, under cloud-free conditions, the ADTC-based framework is able to reduce the positive sampling bias obtained with simple averaging (> 2.0 K) and yields a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.5 K. Under overcast conditions, the ADTC-based framework yields MAEs of 1.0 K and 0.5 K at the daily and monthly scales, respectively. Furthermore, a contribution analysis indicates that the ATC model reduces the MAE from around 4.2 K to 2.0 K while the DTC model reduces the MAE from around 2.0 K to 1.0 K. Based on our validation results and tests performed with MODIS data, the presented simple yet robust ADTC-based framework is able to accurately estimate large-scale spatiotemporally continuous T-dm from thermal observations of tandem polar orbiters. Therefore, the ADTC-based framework is a potentially valuable tool for many related applications.

TI  - Study of plant configuration pattern in guided vegetation restoration: A case study of semiarid underground mining areas in Western China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The large-scale and high intensity mining of coal resources has further worsened the already fragile plant ecosystem in Western China. On the basis of strictly following the developmental law of regional natural ecosystems, guiding the restoration of damaged vegetation is one of the important measures for ecological restoration in mining areas. However, there are still some problems to achieve the guided restoration of damaged vegetation in semiarid mining areas: how to configure different plant species, and what is the control threshold of vegetation coverage under different site conditions among others. In this paper, based on DEM, slope, aspect and soil type data, 12 different site conditions were obtained by using overlay analysis function of ArcGIS software. The trend of interannual variation of vegetation coverage was analyzed using Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data, and the spatial distribution of areas of degraded vegetation under 12 site conditions was identified. Based on the Fully Constrained Least Square (FCLS) unmixing algorithm, typical native plants were classified using Aerial Hyperspectral data. Finally, through the comparative analysis of plant composition and abundance under 12 site conditions, the control thresholds of vegetation coverage ranged from 36.60% to 45.30% in the early stage of vegetation restoration. The thresholds of steep slope are lower than that in gentle and flat slope, which is mainly related to the fact that steep slope is more prone to soil erosion and is not conducive to the conservation of soil water and nutrients. According to the calculation results of different plant allocation proportion under 12 site conditions, the proportion of herbs and shrubs is higher than that of trees. When selecting species for vegetation configuration, native herbs and shrubs with strong adaptability, fast growth and strong drought resistance should be preferred. It is suggested that trees should be planted properly after the site conditions of vegetation growth are effectively restored or the vegetation community structure tends to be stable. In the process of vegetation restoration in semiarid mining area, not only the appropriate threshold of vegetation coverage should be considered, but also the proportion of trees, shrubs, and herbs has an important impact on the effect of vegetation restoration. The results of this paper will provide guidance for the orderly restoration of damaged vegetation in semiarid mining areas.

TI  - Absence of prognostic value of lymphovascular space invasion in patients with endometrial cancer and negative sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To evaluate if the prognostic value of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) is different in endometrial cancer patients with negative lymph nodes following sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping or lymph node dissection (LND) as staging procedure. Material and methods. A retrospective study of 510 patients diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma in our institution between 2007 and 2014. We excluded patients that were diagnosed with positive nodes (Stage IIIc). We compared patients' characteristics and survival outcomes as function of their LVSI status (positive LVSI vs negative LVSI subgroups) in each cohort separately. Results. 413 patients met the inclusion criteria, out of whom 239 underwent SLN and 174 patients underwent LND only. In the SLN group, life table analysis showed 5-year OS and PFS of 80% and 72% in patients with LVSI compared to 96%, and 93% without LVSI. Same trend was observed among patients with LND with 5-year OS and PFS of 74% and 64% in patients with LVSI compared to 97%, and 90% without LVSI. On multivariable analysis, adjusted for age, FIGO stage, grade and maximal tumor size, the favorable survival of negative LVSI remained only in the LND cohort (SLN cohort: HR 1.2, CI [0.3-4.0], P = 0.8 and HR 1.7, CI [0.7-4.3], p = 0.2 for OS and PFS, respectively; LND cohort: HR 3.1, CI [1.4-6.5], p < 0.001 and HR 2.5, CI [1.2-4.9], p = 0.01 for OS and PFS, respectively). Conclusions. The prognostic value of LVSI disappears when patients undergo staging with SLN and are found to have negative nodes in contrast to those who have undergone LND. Future studies should confirm our observation on patients with negative sentinel nodes, and plan on tailoring adjuvant treatment to this specific subgroup. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Yield forecasting with machine learning and small data: What gains for grains?
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasting crop yields is important for food security, in particular to predict where crop production is likely to drop. Climate records and remotely-sensed data have become instrumental sources of data for crop yield forecasting systems. Similarly, machine learning methods are increasingly used to process big Earth observation data. However, access to data necessary to train such algorithms is often limited in food-insecure countries. Here, we evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms and small data to forecast yield on a monthly basis between the start and the end of the growing season. To do so, we developed a robust and automated machine-learning pipeline which selects the best features and model for prediction. Taking Algeria as case study, we predicted national yields for barley, soft wheat and durum wheat with an accuracy of 0.16-0.2 t/ha (13-14% of mean yield) within the season. The best machine-learning models always outperformed simple benchmark models. This was confirmed in low-yielding years, which is particularly relevant for early warning. Nonetheless, the differences in accuracy between machine learning and benchmark models were not always of practical significance. Besides, the benchmark models outperformed up to 60% of the machine learning models that were tested, which stresses the importance of proper model calibration and selection. For crop yield forecasting, like for many application domains, machine learning has delivered significant improvement in predictive power. Nonetheless, superiority over simple benchmarks is fully achieved after extensive calibration, especially when dealing with small data.

TI  - Class and landscape level habitat fragmentation analysis in the Bale mountains national park, southeastern Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The changes of natural habitat structure and function due to human interference is hastening worldwide, and it is compulsory to preserve biological resources in a protected system. This study aims to measure the landscape ecological structure and the extent of habitat fragmentation in the Bale mountains national park. The land use/ land cover change was determined by interpreting the 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2017 Landsat images with ArcGIS 10.3, and the selected landscape structural metrics was analyzed using FRAGSTATS 4.2.1. All land cover classes showed a declining trend, except the farmland, and grassland depicted the highest area reduction. From 1985 to 2017 grassland, Erica, forestland, and afro-alpine were decreased by 9.36 %, 0.26 %, 0.06 %, and 0.01 %, respectively. Whereas, farmland was increased by 43.67 %. The study area was characterized as progressively fragmented since it was signified by the escalated value of patch number (40.22 %), area-weighted mean shape index (18.84 %), and edge density (22.27 %) and a declined value of mean patch size (28.68 %) and core area (10.60 %) over the study period. Considering this result, there was a high loss in area available for core dependent species, particularly for Mountain nyala in the grasslands and woodlands, Ethiopian wolf in afro-alpine regions, and Bale monkey in the bamboo forest. Both forestland and grassland need a conservation priority since these habitats were the most fragmented and habitat lost area.

TI  - Physiological models for in vivo imaging and targeting the lymphatic system: Nanoparticles and extracellular vesicles
T2  - ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Imaging of the lymphatic vasculature has gained great attention in various fields, not only because lymphatic vessels act as a key draining system in the body, but also for their implication in autoimmune diseases, organ transplant, inflammation and cancer. Thus, neolymphangiogenesis, or the generation of new lymphatics, is typically an early event in the development of multiple tumor types, particularly in aggressive ones such as malignant melanoma. Still, the understanding of how lymphatic endothelial cells get activated at distal (pre)metastatic niches and their impact on therapy is still unclear. Addressing these questions is of particular interest in the case of immune modulators, because endothelial cells may favor or halt inflammatory processes depending on the cellular context. Therefore, there is great interest in visualizing the lymphatic vasculature in vivo. Here, we review imaging tools and mouse models used to analyze the lymphatic vasculature during tumor progression. We also discuss therapeutic approaches based on nanomedicines to target the lymphatic system and the potential use of extracellular vesicles to track and target sentinel lymph nodes. Finally, we summarize main pre-clinical models developed to visualize the lymphatic vasculature in vivo, discussing their applications with a particular focus in metastatic melanoma.

Recent studies have aimed to establish whether combination therapy can augment the response seen with PARP inhibitors or antiangiogenic agents alone. This review provides an overview of PARP inhibitors and antiangiogenics as monotherapy in women with advanced ovarian cancer, explores potential mechanisms of action of PARP inhibitor and antiangiogenic combination treatments, reviews efficacy and safety data from trials evaluating this combination, and outlines ongoing and future trials evaluating this combination, discussing these in the context of the current and future treatment landscape for women with advanced ovarian cancer. Sentinel studies evaluating PARP inhibitor (n = 8), antiangiogenic (n = 4), and combination (n = 7) therapy were identified in women with newly diagnosed (n = 7) and recurrent (n = 12) ovarian cancer. PARP inhibitors included olaparib (n = 9), niraparib (n = 4), rucaparib (n = 1), and veliparib (n = 1). Antiangiogenic agents included bevacizumab (n = 7) and cediranib (n = 4). PARP inhibitors combined with antiangiogenics demonstrated efficacy based on objective response rates and progression-free survival (PFS) in the relapsed disease setting. Maintenance therapy with the PARP inhibitor, olaparib, plus antiangiogenic therapy offered a significant PFS benefit versus the antiangiogenic alone in women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer who tested positive for homologous recombination deficiency. Combination therapy was tolerated, with no new safety signals reported compared with monotherapy trials. PARP inhibitors and antiangiogenics have changed the landscape of ovarian cancer treatment. The PARP inhibitor plus antiangiogenic combination is a novel treatment option that appears promising in the first-line advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer settings, although the role of this combination in recurrent disease requires further elucidation. Defining which patients are candidates for monotherapy or combination therapy is critical, taking into consideration safety profiles of therapies alone or in combination, and how these treatments should be sequenced in clinical practice.

TI  - An innovative oncoplastic technique for immediate small to medium volume breast reconstruction in lower inner quadrant cancer: The Zhuo-technique
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Insufficient glandular tissue in the lower quadrant of the breast is the main source of difficulty in repairing defects after oncoplastic surgery. Especially in small to medium sized breasts, this issue is more common. Here, we describe a novel oncoplastic approach that could help to solve this problem.Materials and methods: Retrospective analysis of breast cancer patients with tumors in the lower inner quadrants, who underwent Zhuo's technique between January 2017 and August 2019. Aesthetic outcomes were evaluated in terms of the Paris Breast Center's 5-point scale. The work was reported according to the STROCSS criteria.Results: Nine patients (mean age 54 years) with small to medium volume breast received Zhuo's oncoplastic technique after tumor excision. The mean size tumor was 18.0 mm. The median follow-up time was 27.0 months. Sentinel lymph node biopsy results for all patients were negative. None of the patients had local recurrences or metastases and postoperative complications were not observed. Seven patients (77.8%) achieved aesthetic scores of 5 and two patients (22.2%) achieved 4 points.Conclusions: Zhuo's oncoplastic technique could provide a favorable and flexible surgical approach for small to medium volume breast with tumors of the lower inner quadrant with a low risk of recurrence and good aesthetic results.

TI  - Estimating leaf area index of the Yellowwood tree (<i>Podocarpus spp.)</i> in an indigenous Southern African Forest, using Sentinel 2 Multispectral Instrument data and the Random Forest regression ensemble
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Yellowwood or Podocarpus (spp.) holds the esteemed biodiversity status, as key forest species in the mist-belt Afromontane forests of southern Africa. The podocarps are listed as endangered species owing to extensive logging. The forest species support large communities of plants and birds, attributing to the maintenance of biodiversity. Therefore, there is a need to understand the condition of such keystone species if effective and comprehensive biodiversity conservation measures are to be drawn for these dwindling forests. Leaf area index is a crucial eco-physiological parameter applied in the evaluation of the growth and productivity of forest trees, hence it is a suitable proxy for understanding the condition of Yellowwood trees. This study, therefore, sought to estimate the leaf area index of the Yellowwood spp. using Sentinel 2 Multispectral instrument (S2 MSI) data in concert with the Random Forest regression ensemble. Specifically, individual wavebands and vegetation indices were used in developing leaf area index prediction models based on two approaches. The multistage approach, categorised the predictors according to the generalised order of progression, from standard spectral bands to vegetation indices. The second approach involved using a pooled set of predictors, with the backward elimination of poorly performing wavebands and vegetation indices. Results showed that the backward elimination method produced a better model (R-2 = 0.59; RMSE = 0.48) when compared to the multistage approach (R-2 = 0.50; RMSE = 0.48). The most influential predictor variables in both models were Band 5 and NDVI Red Edge 2. Results of this study underscore the prospects of Sentinel 2 MSI data in characterising the productivity of critical forest species such as the Yellowwoods of the Afromontane forest in southern Africa. The findings of this study are a fundamental step towards understanding forest health and productivity, required in deriving comprehensive monitoring and management strategies in biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Modelling and accessing land degradation vulnerability using remote sensing techniques and the analytical hierarchy process approach
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation and desertification have recently become a critical problem in Ethiopia. Accordingly, identification of land degradation vulnerable zonation and mapping was conducted in Wabe Shebele River Basin, Ethiopia. Precipitation derived from Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GMP), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST), topography (slope), and pedological properties (i.e., soil depth, soil pH, soil texture, and soil drainage) were used in the current study. NDVI has been considered as the most significant parameter followed by the slope, precipitation and temperature. Geospatial techniques and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach were used to model the land degradation vulnerable index. Validation of the results with google earth image shows the applicability of the model in the study. The result is classified into very highly vulnerable (17.06%), highly vulnerable (15.01%), moderately vulnerable (32.72%), slightly vulnerable (16.40%), and very slightly vulnerable (18.81%) to land degradation. Due to the small rate of precipitation which is vulnerable to evaporation by high temperature in the region, the downstream section of the basis is categorized as highly vulnerable to Land Degradation (LD) and vice versa in the upstream section of the basin. Moreover, the validation using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis shows an area under the ROC curve value of 80.92% which approves the prediction accuracy of the AHP method in assessing and modelling LD vulnerability zone in the study area. The study provides a substantial understanding of the effect of land degradation on sustainable land use management and development in the basin.

TI  - Comparison of different methods of determining land surface reflectance for AOD retrieval
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining land surface reflectance (LSR) is important for satellite retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD). Many studies have focused on the development of AOD retrieval through using different land surface reflectance determination algorithms. However, there is still lack of a comprehensive comparison among those algorithms. In this study, AOD retrieval algorithms with different land surface reflectance assumptions were compared and analyzed using Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data. The results demonstrate that the AOD retrieved by the algorithm considering the land surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects (Method 3) has a higher accuracy than that based on the dark target (Method 1) and second lowest reflectance (Method 2) methods. The overall correlation coefficient between the AOD retrievals considering land surface BRDF and AERONET AOD measurements is 0.93 and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is 0.13. In addition, there are 68.91 % of AOD matchups falling within the expected error (+/- 0.05 +/- 0.2 x AOD (AERONET)). Method 3 shows a more robust performance than the other two methods for different seasons, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values and scattering angles. It also shows the advantages of AOD retrieval in urban regions with relatively high LSR. The AOD retrievals based on Method 2 show the best agreement with MODIS 1 km AOD product, while Method 1 AODs are much closer to the MODIS 10 km AODs. The differences of annual average values of AHI AOD retrievals using different algorithms can be high to 0.13 at 11:00 (Beijing Time) over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, which could cause a 23.6Wm(-2) discrepancy when calculating the direct aerosol radiative effect (DARE) at the bottom of the atmosphere.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with endometrial cancer and an indocyanine green or iodinated contrast reaction-A proposed management algorithm
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To describe the incidence of adverse reactions to indocyanine green (ICG) administered during sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for endometrial cancer, and to propose an ICG management algorithm for these patients. Methods. All patients who underwent surgery for endometrial cancer with SLN biopsy using ICG from 1/2017 to 8/2020 were identified using a single-institution prospective database. Surgical adverse events (SAEs) related to the procedure were identified. A review of the literature was performed. Results. In all, 1414 patients met inclusion criteria and were evaluated. Sixty-seven (4.7%) patients had a history of either an iodine or contrast allergy. No patients had a history of documented ICG allergy. Among patients with an iodine or contrast allergy, 65 (97%) received a corticosteroid with or without diphenhydramine prior to ICG administration. One hundred five patients (7.4%) experienced 116 SAEs. Among these patients, 3 experienced potentially allergic SAEs possibly related to ICG administration. After thorough chart review, however, the likelihood these SAEs were due to ICG appeared low. No patients experienced an anaphylactic response after ICG admission. Conclusion. There were no anaphylactic reactions to ICG intracervical administration during 1414 consecutive SLN biopsies, including in patients with a documented iodine or contrast allergy. Intracervical injection of ICG is safe, and premedication using corticosteroids with or without diphenhydramine prior to SLN biopsy is a reasonable strategy in patients with iodinated contrast allergy. @ 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The impact of primary care supported shielding on the risk of mortality in people vulnerable to COVID-19: English sentinel network matched cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To mitigate risk of mortality from coronavirus 2019 infection (COVID-19), the UK government recommended `shielding' of vulnerable people through self-isolation for 12 weeks.Methods: A retrospective cohort study using a nationally representative English primary care database comparing people aged >=40 years who were recorded as being advised to shield using a fixed ratio of 1:1, matching to people with the same diagnoses not advised to shield (n = 77,360 per group). Time-todeath was compared using Cox regression, reporting the hazard ratio (HR) of mortality between groups. A sensitivity analysis compared exact matched cohorts (n = 24,752 shielded, n = 61,566 exact matches).Results: We found a time-varying HR of mortality between groups. In the first 21 days, the mortality risk in people shielding was half those not (HR = 0.50, 95%CI:0.41-0.59. p < 0.0001). Over the remaining nine weeks, mortality risk was 54% higher in the shielded group (HR=1.54, 95%CI:1.41-1.70, p < 0.0001). Beyond the shielding period, mortality risk was over two-and-a-half times higher in the shielded group (HR=2.61, 95%CI:2.38-2.87, p < 0.0001).Conclusions: Shielding halved the risk of mortality for 21 days. Mortality risk became higher across the remainder of the shielding period, rising to two-and-a-half times greater post-shielding. Shielding may be beneficial in the next wave of COVID-19.

TI  - Monitoring glacier surges in the Kongur Tagh area of the Tibetan Plateau using Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate identification of glacier surges aids in promoting a better understanding of the mechanisms of rapid glacier movement and predicting possible surge-related hazards. Surges of 10 glaciers in the Kongur Tagh area of the Tibetan Plateau were examined based on 128 scenes of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery with 12-day and 24-day time intervals from 2015 to 2019. To identify the surges, a set of quantifiable multi-feature criteria was used, including higher glacier velocity, surge front position movement and continuous higher velocity at contiguous time intervals based on surge-type glacier characteristics. The results showed that the Karayaylak Glacier surge reported in May 2015 was more likely initiated in summer 2014, and an unreported pulse event occurred in 2019. Another new and complete surge in the Jangmanjiar Glacier from 2016 to 2018 was further identified. Another two pulse events in the Jangmanjiar Glacier and the Kokodak Glacier in 2015 were discovered. The elevation changes from ASTER images and glacier terminus evolution based on Landsat 8 images also provided positive evidence for the occurrence of two surges. In the Kongur Tagh area, the surge type glaciers might have larger areas (above 40 km(2)), longer lengths (above 13 km), lower slopes (below 10 degrees) and higher mean quiescent velocities (above 0.1 +/- 0.05 m d(-1)) than non-surging glaciers. The temperature and precipitation data of ECMWF Re-Analysis 5 (ERA5) showed that the surges in the Kongur Tagh area were mainly induced by thermal and hydrological trigger mechanisms together.

TI  - A dynamic acceleration method for remote sensing image processing based on CUDA
T2  - WIRELESS NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - The incredible increase in the volume of remote sensing data has made the concept of Remote Sensing as Big Data reality with recent technological developments. Remote sensing image processing is characterized with features of massive data processing and intensive computation, which makes the processes difficult. To optimize the remote sensing image processing for GPU, compute unified device architecture (CUDA) is widely used to implement remote sensing algorithms. However, the usage of GPU in remote sensing image processing has been constrained by the complexity of its implementation and configuration. Therefore, how to take full advantage of the parallel organization of GPU architecture is awfully challenging. In this paper, a dynamic adaptive acceleration (DAA) method is proposed to determine calculation parameters of GPU adaptively and preprocess the input remote sensing images on host dynamically. By this method, we determine calculation parameters according to the hardware parameters of GPU firstly. And then, the input remote sensing images are reconstructed based on the calculation parameters. Finally, the preprocessed image blocks are arranged to stream tasks and executed on GPU respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed DAA method in accelerating remote sensing algorithm with point operations was verified by experiments in this paper, and the experimental results indicated that the DAA method can obtain better performance than traditional methods.

TI  - Practical Differences Between Photogrammetric Bathymetry and Physics-Based Bathymetry
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical satellite remote sensing (RS) is a time- and cost-effective approach for shallow-water bathymetry over large areas. The photogrammetric and physics-based methods, which do not require in situ depth calibration data, are two implementations of RS-based bathymetry. This article compares these two bathymetric methods by using the same WorldView-2 imagery product of a study area in the Xisha Islands of the South China Sea. The focus is to investigate the difference between the resulting depths. The resulted accuracy of the photogrammetric method was slightly higher than that of the physics-based method based on the backward image, but both of them were significantly higher than that of the physics-based method based on the forward image. In the calm clear waters, the resulted depth of the photogrammetric method was closer to the ground truth than that of the physics-based method based on the backward image. In the shoal and adjacent waters where the water was turbid or larger waves were present, the photogrammetric method produced a highly noisy digital depth model (DDM), whereas the physics-based method derived a low-noise DDM from the backward image. In conclusion, the photogrammetric method outperforms the physics-based method in calm clear waters, but the physics-based method performs better than the photogrammetric method in shoal and adjacent waters that has turbid water or waves larger than the image spatial resolution. The photogrammetric DDM is noisier than the physics-based DDM. The accuracy of the physics-based method is also influenced by the non-optimal sun-target-sensor geometry of the images used.

TI  - Assessment of mapping of annual average rainfall in a tropical country like Bangladesh: remotely sensed output vs. kriging estimate
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge about spatial variation of annual rainfall is important for many applications ranging from agriculture planning to flood risk management in a tropical low-lying country like Bangladesh. The remotely sensed data has emerged as a suitable addition to the data source which is often suggested for use at ungauged conditions. This study investigates whether the remotely sensed outputs on its own or its incorporation as a covariate can outperform the mapping estimate of annual average rainfall. The work primarily considers a multivariate kriging approach, kriging with external drift (KED), which can take covariates to good effect for the spatial interpolation. Other than remotely sensed annual average rainfall (RAAR), the study includes easily accessible: geographical coordinates (LON, LAT) and elevation as potential covariates. The suitability of the KED model is assessed against the widely used classical univariate, ordinary kriging (OK), and the inverse distance weighting (IDW) methods. The annual average rainfall calculated at 34 stations based on observed daily rainfall data from 1970 to 2016 was used for the assessment. Based on cross-validation techniques, the KED with LON is identified as the best interpolation method. The IDW performed poorly and came last among all the interpolation methods. The performance of remotely sensed outputs on its own is not as good as the interpolation estimate; in fact, it is outperformed by the IDW quite convincingly. The integration of RAAR as a covariate with the KED performed superior to IDW but could not outperform the chosen KED (LON) model. Overall, remotely sensed data could be served better with the integration of an appropriate kriging approach rather than to be used as model outputs.

TI  - Evaluation of land use and land cover Spatio-temporal change during rapid Urban sprawl from Lahore, Pakistan
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates land use/cover changes and urban expansion in Lahore, Pakistan from 2000 to 2020 using satellite images and socio-economic data. Spatial and temporal dynamics of land use/cover changes were quantified using five Landsat images, a supervised classification algorithm post-classification change detection and the intensity analysis technique in GIS. Landsat images 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020 were classified into four dominant land use categories in the study area: built up area, agricultural land, barren land and water bodies. The intensity analysis of time interval revealed that the annual change rate during 2000-2005, and 2010-2015 was 28.76% and 16.45% respectively, while during the 2005-2010 and 2015-2020 was 11.49% and 6.04%. The transition level of intensity analysis indicated that the built-up area is expanded at agricultural land and gained area 886 km2 and 861 km2 in the period from 2000 to 2005, and 2010-2015, respectively. The built up area significantly growth from 22.99% to 47.17% of total study area 2000 and 2020 respectively. The driving force behind this change was economic development and population growth and climate change. The rapid population growth and rapid urbanization resulted in a wide range of environmental impacts, including degraded habitat quality.

TI  - Evolution of southern Mexican Pacific coastline: Responses to meteo-oceanographic and physiographic conditions
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The coast of Oaxaca, along the southern Mexican Pacific coastline, is home to diverse ecosystems, which undergoes significant erosion and accretion due to natural and anthropogenic influences. This study aims in analysing the historical shoreline variations and predicting the future changes for better coastal management plans. In order to study the long-term variations in shoreline, Landsat time-series satellite imageries between 1973 and 2020 were evaluated. Overall, the results indicate that the coast is highly dominated by accretion (74%) process, with the most significant changes occurring at the estuarine areas and beaches. Linear Regression Rate (LRR) and Weighted Linear Regression (WLR) methods showed mean variations at rates of 1.2 +/- 2.5 and 0.4 +/- 2.5 m/yr for the long-term period. The analysis of seven short-term periods (for every 5 years between 1986-2020) identified the maximum mean erosion of -20.6 m during 2005-2010 and accretion of 18.7 m during 2000-2005. However, the forecasted rate of change for the period 2030 and 2040 using End Point Rate (EPR) statistics revealed that the northern region would continue to move seaward at a rate of +0.26 m/yr and the coastline of southern region would move landward at a possible rate of -0.45 m/yr. The natural factors such as rainfall, river discharge, hurricane, and wave dynamics are the main drivers of shoreline changes along the estuarine and wetland areas. Contrarily, the anthropogenic factors such as breakwaters and urbanization are responsible for coastline dynamics along the beaches and ports. Henceforth, the estuarine region, lagoon openings, and tourist beaches require utmost attention as the sediment flow in these regions are not monitored constantly. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Recombinant Capabilities, R&D Collaboration, and Innovation Performance of Emerging Market Firms in High-Technology Industry
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The capability that facilitates the transition of emerging market firms (EMFs) from technology followers to innovation leaders is an important but underexamined topic, particularly for firms aiming to compete distinctively in high-technology fields. Drawing on the recombinant perspective, in this article, we investigate how an EMFs' recombinant capability relates to its innovation and how R&D collaboration moderates this relationship. Using panel data on 184 publicly listed firms in the Chinese telecommunication-equipment industry from 2009 to 2014, we find that both recombinant reuse and recombinant creation positively relate to firm innovation performance. Moreover, the positive association between recombinant reuse and innovation is strengthened by the high degree of R&D collaboration. These findings provide novel insights into how firms may overcome their latecomer disadvantages and leverage the accumulated knowledge stock to foster innovation in an emerging economy.

TI  - Early-Life Exposure to Green Space and Mid-Childhood Cognition in the Project Viva Cohort, Massachusetts
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The association between early-life greenness and child cognition is not well understood. Using prospective data from Project Viva (n = 857) from 1999-2010, we examined associations of early-life greenness exposure with mid-childhood cognition. We estimated residential greenness at birth, early childhood (median age 3.1 years), and mid-childhood (7.8 years) using 30-m resolution Landsat satellite imagery (normalized difference vegetation index). In early childhood and mid-childhood, we administered standardized assessments of verbal and nonverbal intelligence, visual-motor abilities, and visual memory. We used natural splines to examine associations of early life-course greenness with mid-childhood cognition, adjusting for age, sex, race, income, neighborhood socioeconomic status, maternal intelligence, and parental education. At lower levels of greenness (greenness <0.6), greenness exposure at early childhood was associated with a 0.48% increase in nonverbal intelligence and 2.64% increase in visual memory in mid-childhood. The association between early-childhood greenness and mid-childhood visual memory was observed after further adjusting for early childhood cognition and across different methodologies, while the association with nonverbal intelligence was not. No other associations between early life-course greenness and mid-childhood cognition were found. Early childhood greenness was nonlinearly associated with higher mid-childhood visual memory. Our findings highlight the importance of nonlinear associations between greenness and cognition.

TI  - Assessing the quantitative relationships between the impervious surface area and surface heat island effect during urban expansion
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important component of underlying urban surfaces, the distribution pattern and density of the impervious surface area (ISA) play an important role in the generation of surface urban heat island (SUHI) effects. However, the quantitative and localized exploration of the ISA's influence on SUHIs in the process of urban expansion from the perspective of temporal and spatial changes is still not clear. Based on multisource remote sensing data, the SUHI effect of urban expansion is revealed by using geospatial analysis methods such as profile, difference and regression analysis. The results show the following: (1) urban expansion plays a significant role in aggravating SUHIs. Overall, the ISA and land surface temperature (LST) have obvious consistency in terms of spatial distribution patterns. However, local spatial differentiation is significant. The areas with the highest LST were not concentrated in the downtown area with the highest ISA but were scattered in the cultivated land and exposed surface areas under development in the northern part of the city. (2) In general, the ISA can explain the spatial distribution of LST well, there is an obvious positive correlation between them, and the quadratic polynomial function is the best fitting model between them. (3) The density and spatial allocation of ecological elements, such as green space and water bodies, play an important role in alleviating SUHIs. This study found that the urban center with the highest ISA coverage rate has no significant SUHI due to the reasonable allocation of green space and water bodies. The research results can provide a scientific basis for future urban planning and ecological environment construction.

TI  - Aquatic biota responses to temperature in a high Andean geothermal stream
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of global warming on mountain ecosystems is predicted to be high, and particularly in the tropical region. Geothermal streams have provided comprehensive evidence about how aquatic biodiversity changes across natural thermal gradients, but current knowledge is restricted to arctic and temperate zones. Thermal tolerances are different in tropical biological communities, resulting in high thermal sensitivity and low capacity to endure change in their thermal environments. This feature can change the response of aquatic organisms to warming, yet there is little empirical evidence to support this assumption. In this study, we address this issue by evaluating how water temperature affects biodiversity, and the structure of primary and secondary producers of a high-elevation geothermal stream system (4,500 m above sea level) in the Bolivian Andes. We analysed multi-taxa responses to increased water temperature using benthic macroinvertebrate families, benthic algae and cyanobacteria, fishes, and macrophytes as study organisms. Different models were run to assess the response of aquatic biota to temperature. In addition, threshold indicator taxa analysis was used to identify changes in macroinvertebrate taxa distributions along the thermal gradient. We found that macroinvertebrate richness decreased at 24-25 degrees C due to the different taxon-specific responses to temperature. Threshold indicator taxa analysis identified 17 temperature thresholds for each family of macroinvertebrates. Changes in macroinvertebrate community composition were significantly associated with changes in water temperature. Similarly, changes in macrophytes were associated with temperature differences, and high macrophyte richness was found at 19-20 degrees C. Chlorophyll-a concentration of green algae and diatoms was higher at intermediate temperatures 20-22 degrees C, macroinvertebrates density peaked at 27 degrees C, and fish body size reduced linearly with temperature. Temperature increase in the geothermal stream resulted in a reduction of aquatic diversity and primary and secondary producers by simplifying the community structure to a few warm-adapted taxa and reduced body size. These patterns differed from those obtained in temperate/arctic geothermal streams, but are similar to other studies at high-elevation. In a context of increasing warming, the ecological structure of high-elevation streams might lose cold-adapted taxa, and change to smaller populations. Additional studies based on ecosystem functioning of geothermal streams could lead to a better understanding on how warming affects high-elevation streams.

TI  - Performance of daily satellite-based rainfall in groundwater basin of Merapi Aquifer System, Yogyakarta
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of the performance of daily satellite-based rainfall (CMORPH, CHIRPS, GPM IMERG, and TRMM) was done to obtain applicable satellite rainfall estimates in the groundwater basin of the Merapi Aquifer System (MAS). Performance of satellite data was assessed by applying descriptive statistics, categorical statistics, and bias decomposition on the basis of daily rainfall intensity classification. This classification is possible to measure the performance of daily satellite-based rainfall in much detail. CM (CMORPH) has larger underestimation compared to other satellite-based rainfall assessments. This satellite-based rainfall also mostly has the largest RMSE, while CHR (CHIRPS) has the lowest. CM has a good performance to detect no rain, while IMR (GPM IMERG) has the worst performance. IMR and CHR have a good performance to detect light and moderate rain. Both of them have larger H frequencies and lower MB values compared to other satellite products. CHR mostly has a good performance compared to TR (TRMM), especially on wet periods. CM, IMR, and TR mostly have a good performance on dry periods, while CHR on wet periods. CM mostly has the largest MB and lowest AHB values. CM and CHR have better accuracy to estimate rain amount compared to IMR and TR. All in all, all 4 satellite-based rainfall assessments have large discrepancy compared with rain gauge data along mountain range where orographic rainfall usually occurs in wet periods. Hence, it is recommended to evaluate satellite-based rainfall with time series of streamflow simulation in hydrological modeling framework by merging rain gauge data with more than one satellite-based rainfall than to merge both IMR and TR together.

TI  - Exploring differences in perceptions of child feeding practices between parents and health care professionals: a qualitative study
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundEvidence on child feeding practice is often based on the perspectives and experiences of parents and less that of health practitioners. In this study, we explored child feeding practice in Aboriginal communities in northern Australia from both the parents and health practitioners' perspectives with the aim of informing nutrition improvement programs.MethodsQualitative research methods were employed. Using semi-structured interviews, parents (n=30) of children aged 2-5years, and 29 service providers who were involved in the delivery of child health and nutrition programs in the same communities, were asked about child feeding attitudes and practices. Responses were analyzed through inductive and deductive analysis, recognizing that worldviews influence child feeding practices.ResultsSharing food was a central practice within families. Parents highly valued development of child independence in food behavior but were conflicted with the easy access to unhealthy food in their communities. This easy access to unhealthy food and inadequate food storage and kitchen facilities for some families were major challenges to achieving optimal diets for children identified by Aboriginal families and service providers. The responsive style of parenting described by parents was often misunderstood by service providers as sub-optimal parenting when viewed through a dominant western lens.ConclusionsApproaches to support healthy feeding practices and optimal child nutrition require health-enabling food environments. Along with a community-based Aboriginal health workforce, it is paramount that the non-Aboriginal workforce be supported to be reflective of the impact of worldview on their practice, to ensure a culturally safe environment for families where parenting styles are understood and appropriately supported.

TI  - Modeling susceptibility to forest fires in the Central Corridor of the Atlantic Forest using the frequency ratio method
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is one of the main disturbances of tropical forests. Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest fires is of fundamental importance for the conservation of tropical forests. We used a frequency ratio model to identify those areas most susceptible to forest fires in the Central Corridor of the Atlantic Forest, from 2001 to 2019. We used data from the burned area of MODIS MCD64A1 to create the dependent variable grouped as climatic, topographic and human and landscape variables. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess the model's performance. Land use and relief orientation were the most and least important variables in the model, respectively. The model showed good AUC values, ranging from 0.72 to 0.96, with an average of 0.81 for the study period. The average distribution of susceptibility classes was low (19.62 %), medium (24.45 %) and high (20.55 %). The northwestern region of the CAFC was the one that presented the greatest susceptibility to the occurrence of forest fires. The frequency ratio proved to be a good model for mapping areas susceptible to forest fires in an area of the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Estimating evapotranspiration based on the satellite-retrieved near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIR<sub>v</sub>) over croplands
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on cropland evapotranspiration (ET) can facilitate effective agricultural management. However, the application of existing physical models over broad regions may be impeded due to the need for difficult to acquire information about environmental factors that constrain ET. The recently developed near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), which can reasonably characterize ecosystem photosynthesis without the need for additional environmental information, is potentially useful for estimating cropland ET and reducing the difficulty in ET modeling. As such, we proposed two simply formulated semi-empirical models that utilize NIRv as a major factor constraining cropland ET. The first model, termed Penman-Monteith+ (PM+), computed canopy transpiration using the PM equation along with canopy conductance values estimated from NIRv-derived gross primary productivity (NIRv-GPP) and calculated soil evaporation using an empirical approach. Another model, termed underlying water-use efficiency+ (uWUE+), used the uWUE approach along with the NIRv-GPP to predict ET. We calibrated and validated PM+ and uWUE+ over 32 cropland flux sites and then compared them with six complex models. The better model between PM+ and uWUE+ was applied to estimate regional ET over North China Plain (NCP), where typical C-3 and C-4 crops were planted during 2010-2018, along with remote sensing and meteorological data. Results indicated that the two new models can reasonably estimate cropland ET. The PM+ model reproduced an eight-day value of ET (denoted as eight-day ET) with R-2 = 0.741 and RMSE = 5.638 mm/8d, slightly better than the uWUE+ model (R-2 = 0. 674 and RMSE = 6.275 mm/8d) for a cross-site validation over 17 flux sites of the validation dataset. Site-level validation revealed consistently better performance of PM+ compared to uWUE+ over most flux sites. For the comparisons with six existing models, PM+ can perform better than all these models and uWUE+ is better than five of them. Subsequently, the PM+ (uWUE+) model reasonably reproduced eight-day ET over four sites under a dry climate (Arid Index <= 0.5) with site-level R-2 = 0.691 (0.617) and RMSE = 6.663 (7.906) mm/8d on average, which is better than the six existing models. In addition, the regional mean annual ET varied from 590 mm per year (mm/yr) to 680 mm/yr over NCP with a significant increasing trend of 9.05 mm/yr (p < 0.01), and the ET values in maize growing season were higher than that in wheat growing season. Our results demonstrated that the simply formulated PM+ and uWUE+ models can provide simple and robust approaches to estimate regional and global cropland ET.

TI  - Sunlight-absorbing aerosol amplifies the seasonal cycle in low-cloud fraction over the southeast Atlantic
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Y The mean altitude of the smoke loading over the southeast Atlantic moves from the boundary layer in July to the free troposphere by October. This study details the month-by-month changes in cloud properties and the large-scale environment as a function of the biomass burning aerosol loading at Ascension Island (8 degrees S, 14.5 degrees W) from July to October, based on island measurements, satellite retrievals, and reanalysis. In July and August, the smoke loading predominantly varies within the boundary layer. During both months, the low-cloud fraction is less and is increasingly cumuliform when more smoke is present, with the exception of a late morning boundary layer deepening that encourages a short-lived cloud development. The meteorology varies little, suggesting aerosol-cloud interactions explain the cloudiness changes. September marks a transition month during which midlatitude disturbances can intrude into the Atlantic subtropics, constraining the free tropospheric aerosol closer to the African coast. Stronger boundary layer winds on cleaner days help deepen, dry, and cool much of the marine boundary layer compared to that on days with high smoke loadings, with stratocumulus reducing everywhere but at the northern deck edge. The September free troposphere is better mixed on smoky days compared to October. Longwave cooling rates, generated by a sharp water vapor gradient at the aerosol layer top, encourage a small-scale vertical mixing that could help maintain the well-mixed smoky September free troposphere. The October meteorology primarily varies as a function of the strength of the free tropospheric winds advecting aerosol offshore. The free tropospheric aerosol loading is less than in September, and the moisture variability is greater. Low-level clouds in-crease and are more stratiform in October when the smoke loadings are higher. The increased free tropospheric moisture can help sustain the clouds through a reduction in evaporative drying during cloud-top entrainment. Enhanced subsidence above the coastal upwelling region, increasing cloud droplet number concentrations, may further prolong cloud lifetime through microphysical interactions. Reduced subsidence underneath stronger free tropospheric winds at Ascension Island supports slightly higher cloud tops during smokier conditions. Overall, the monthly changes in the large-scale aerosol and moisture vertical structure act to amplify the seasonal cycle in low-cloud amount and morphology. This is climatically important, as cloudiness changes dominate changes in the top-of-atmosphere radiation budget.

TI  - Applied Research on InSAR and GPS Data Fusion in Deformation Monitoring
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the enrichment of land subsidence monitoring means, data fusion of multisource land subsidence data has gradually become a research hotspot. The Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a potential Earth observation approach, and it has been verified to have a variety of applications in measuring ground movement, urban subsidence, and landslides but similar to Global Positioning System (GPS). The InSAR observation accuracy and measurements are affected by the tropospheric delay error as well as by the Earth's ionospheric and tropospheric layers. In order to rectify the InSAR result, there is a need to interpolate the GPS-derived tropospheric delay. Keeping in view of the above, this research study has presented an improved Inverse Distance Weighting (IIDW) interpolation method based on Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation by using Sentinel-1 radar satellite image provided by European Space Agency (ESA) and the measured data from the Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) provided by the Survey and Mapping Office of the Lands Department of Hong Kong. Furthermore, the corrected differential tropospheric delay correction is used to correct the InSAR image. The experimental results show that the correction of tropospheric delay by IIDW interpolation not only improves the accuracy of Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) but also provides a new idea for the solution of InSAR and GPS data fusion.

TI  - Modeling the impact of spatiotemporal vegetation dynamics on groundwater recharge
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change affects the growth of vegetation and its physiological states such as leaf area index (LAI), which in turn can affect groundwater recharge because of changes in evapotranspiration (ET). Presently, most recharge modeling studies over-simplify transient vegetation conditions and the potential corresponding impact on recharge by using climatological values of vegetation parameters such as LAI. Our study uses the Community Land Model (CLMv4.5) to investigate the sensitivity of recharge to interannual varying vegetation in Minnesota (USA) across different climate, hydrogeology, and ecoregions at a 25 km spatial resolution and for the period of 2000-2015. The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) was used to calibrate soil and runoff parameters to statewide water table depth observations. Results of the study indicate that although year-to-year varying vegetation does not affect long-term climatological recharge estimates, it can drive disproportionately large variability in annual and seasonal recharge. Comparing simulations with dynamic and climatological vegetation inputs, the average magnitude difference (root mean square difference, RMSD) for recharge was 21.1% in response to only a 4% difference in LAI inputs. Regression analysis revealed that the combination of local hydrogeology and vegetation-type affects the magnitude of recharge response to LAI and ET changes. We also found cross-ecoregion dominance of temperature rather than precipitation controlling LAI anomalies and resulting recharge variability, with springtime temperature being the primary factor because of its impact on leaf-out conditions. Drier western Minnesota showed higher relative LAI differences as well as higher spring time and relative annual recharge compared to the wetter eastern part of the state, indicating higher vulnerability of the water-limited region to changing vegetation and climatic conditions. Our study shows that models can underestimate or overestimate annual and seasonal recharge if vegetation dynamics are neglected, demonstrating the need to incorporate transient vegetation conditions when assessing the impact of future climate change on recharge.

AB  - Urban population growth in south-Eastern Nigeria and associated proliferation of built-up areas predispose groundwater to contaminants of anthropogenic origin. This study compared the groundwater quality across an urban gradient, in Onitsha, a notable urbanized region and beehive of commercial activity in southeastern Nigeria. Groundwater samples (n = 120) from sixty boreholes tapping into aquifers spanning major settlement clusters at upper Iweka, Mgbuka and Nkpor, were sampled over 5-months from August to December 2019. Faecal coliforms, water-soluble metals, and nutrients (nitrates and phosphates) were estimated in groundwater samples. Noncarcinogenic risks of heavy metals in ground water samples was estimated for Average daily dose (ADD) and Total Hazard Quotient (THQ) using both deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Concentrations of mercury and heavy metals (Fe, Pb, and Cd) estimated in water samples revealed a general exceedance of World Health Organization (2009) standards for drinking water. However, significantly higher Hg, Pb and faecal coliform levels (0.122 +/- 0.03 mg/L, 0.115 +/- 0.014 mg/L, 2.3 x 106 +/- 300 MPN respectively) in groundwater of the more built-up areas of upper Iweka highlight increased chances of metals and pathogens impacts on water quality with increased urbanization. High incidence of nutrients (nitrates: 258.40 +/- 62.1 and phosphorus: 33.05 +/- 4.06 mg/L) in groundwater of less urbanized areas suggests impacts of fertilizer applications from greater agricultural activity. Probabilistic estimates for heavy metals in ground water from Onitsha via ingestion route, showed that Upper Iweka had the highest HQ (3.262) followed by Mgbuka (2.1233) and Nkpor (2.0187). On the other hand, estimates showed that Mgbuka had the highest HQ (0.0241) followed by Nkpor (0.016) and Upper Iweka (0.014) for dermal exposure routes. Strategic mitigation measures including urban planning and infrastructural upgrade are recommended to protect the water resources, prevent further groundwater contamination and reduce population health risks emanating from poor drinking water sources.

TI  - Hyperspectral and Multispectral Classification for Coastal Wetland Using Depthwise Feature Interaction Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of coastal wetlands is of great importance to the protection of marine and terrestrial ecosystems. However, due to the complex environment, severe vegetation mixture, and difficulty of access, it is impossible to accurately classify coastal wetlands and identify their species with traditional classifiers. Despite the integration of multisource remote sensing data for performance enhancement, there are still challenges with acquiring and exploiting the complementary merits from multisource data. In this article, the depthwise feature interaction network (DFINet) is proposed for wetland classification. A depthwise cross attention module is designed to extract self-correlation and cross correlation from multisource feature pairs. In this way, meaningful complementary information is emphasized for classification. DFINet is optimized by coordinating consistency loss, discrimination loss, and classification loss. Accordingly, DFINet reaches the standard solution-space under the regularity of loss functions, while the spatial consistency and feature discrimination are preserved. Comprehensive experimental results on two hyperspectral and multispectral wetland datasets demonstrate that the proposed DFINet outperforms other competitive methods in terms of overall accuracy.

TI  - A comparative approach of data-driven split-window algorithms and MODIS products for land surface temperature retrieval
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this paper is to compare eighteen data-driven split-window (SW) algorithms to derive land surface temperature (LST) and identify the most efficient techniques. We also aim to compare the results of the SW algorithms against the MODIS LST products (MOD11_L2/MYD11_L2). To archive these goals, the radiometric correction was accomplished to the MODIS satellite image, and then, the LST was derived using the SW algorithms for the year 2019. This LST was validated using RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and MAD based on the observed data in local meteorological stations. Validation analysis reveals that the Sobrino 1993 algorithm with a RMSE value of 1.79 and Qin algorithm with a RMSE value of 5.28 have respectively high and low accuracy to calculate LST in the study area. Furthermore, we compared the MODIS LST products against the local meteorological station data and achieved respectively the RMSE values of 13.3, 13.96, 18.83, 10.84, 13.91, 13.51, and 5.2 in Ahar, Tabriz, Jolfa, Sarab, Maraghe, Ligvan, and Kalibar stations. These findings demonstrated that the SW algorithms have better performance in comparison with MODIS LST products to estimate LST. Results of this research are of great importance for applying and comparing different data-driven approaches and identifying the most efficient techniques. The obtained results support future research by means of exploring the capability of each method and deriving validate results through efficient techniques.

TI  - Collaboration between Behavior Analysts and Occupational Therapists in Autism Service Provision: Bridging the Gap
T2  - BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS IN PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Interdisciplinary collaboration is challenging, but necessary, to meet the needs of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Among the dyadic interactions in interdisciplinary teams, the relationships between occupational therapy practitioners and board certified behavior analysts are uniquely challenging. The disciplines define evidence-based practice differently and approach intervention from different angles. Furthermore, there are fundamental differences in worldview between the disciplines. Both disciplines offer necessary treatment, and successful collaboration between these disciplines is essential for maximizing outcomes. Hence, finding ways to help bridge the gap between these professions, in particular, is essential. Common barriers to developing collaborative alliances include misperceptions of the other discipline, differences in terminology, and unprofessional behavior. This article reviews the history and foundational concepts of both disciplines, and the common approaches associated with each. In addition, models of collaboration are discussed, with suggestions for enhancing interdisciplinary communication and treatment. Successful collaborative treatment is predicated on an understanding of the value and expertise offered by different disciplines, and requires mutual respect and professional dialogue.

TI  - Predicting within-field soybean yield variability by coupling Sentinel-2 leaf area index with a crop growth model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate within-field yield estimation is an essential step to conduct yield gap analysis and steer crop management towards more efficient use of resources. This study aims to develop and validate a process-based soybean model and to predict within-field yield variability by coupling leaf area index (LAI) retrieval from Sentinel-2 into the crop model. First, a soybean model is presented, which was successfully validated with field observations of total aboveground biomass, LAI and yield from seven contrasting field campaigns with strongly varying conditions. Within-field yield predictions were achieved by combining the model and the observations of LAI through an assimilation strategy. Four model parameters were chosen to optimize against the LAI curve: soil depth, field capacity, initial LAI and nitrogen translocated from leaves to seed. Six fields were used to evaluate the methodology (21175 pixels). The accuracy assessment was conducted on a pixel-by-pixel basis using high density of information from the yield monitor. The overall accuracy quantified by the relative root mean square error (rRMSE) ranged from 28 to 51% (overall rRMSE 35.8%) across the studied fields. The Lee statistics index ranged from 0.61 to 0.71, confirming a high level of similarity between observed and simulated yield maps. Therefore, the methodology was capable of representing the observed spatial patterns of yield. Furthermore, the high consistency of the optimized WHC reflects the value of the assimilation data strategy to spatialize this relevant characteristic. Some challenges were identified for further study to reduce the sources of uncertainty and improve accuracy: i) the inability of the model to reallocate biomass by simulating plant response to source limitation, ii) the generalization of empirical algorithms to retrieve LAI, and iii) the exploration of an updating method as an assimilation strategy to overcome discrepancy between simulated and retrieved LAI.

TI  - Eutrophication monitoring of lakes in Wuhan based on Sentinel-2 data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication is the leading cause of freshwater impairment. Of China's major cities, Wuhan has the largest coverage of the lake area, while lake eutrophication is increasing. Thus, the objective of this study was to monitor and assess lake eutrophication in Wuhan. For this purpose, the lake eutrophication was quantified using the Trophic Level Index (TLI). The TLI was modeled by building a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model with a set of indices derived from Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) imagery and a parameter of lake environmental characteristics. Applied MSI indices are the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) and the spectral band ratio of b5/b4 and b3/b4. In addition, the applied lake environmental parameter is the chlorophyll-a dependent month. Based on 54 MSI images from April 2018 to March 2020, the lake eutrophication was successfully determined. The main findings are as follows: 1) The higher percentage of eutrophic area was registered in the autumn (from September to November) and the highest was registered on September 12(th), 2019; 2) Compared to the same period in 2018, the eutrophic area in the autumn of 2019 was significantly higher. In the autumn of 2018, from 74.94% to 86.38% of the lakes were eutrophic, while from 83.54% to 93.24% of the lakes were eutrophic in the autumn of 2019; 3) The TLI values were between 30 and 70 for the majority of lakes in Wuhan, suggesting that most lakes were mesotrophic, light eutrophic, or medium eutrophic, with few oligotrophic and heavy eutrophic lakes. Most oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes were located in northern Wuhan, while eutrophic lakes were located in central and southern Wuhan. Our result indicates that the developed algorithm from this study could be applied for rapid and effective monitoring of eutrophication in lakes.

TI  - Evaluation of six satellite- and model-based surface soil temperature datasets using global ground-based observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The comprehensive evaluation of model-and satellite-based surface soil temperature (ST) products is a prerequisite for applications of these datasets in hydrology, ecology, and climate change, as well as in passive microwave soil moisture retrieval algorithms. Distinguished from existing regional validations, this study used ground soil temperature observations of approximately 800 stations from 5 sparse and 15 dense networks worldwide to fully assess six model-and satellite-based surface ST products from April 2015 to December 2017. The products consist of five model-based ST from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), the Goddard Earth Observing System Model version 5 Forward Processing (GEOS-5 FP), the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Noah, the ERA-Interim and the newly released ERA5 produced by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and one satellite-based ST retrieved from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) by using the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM). The accuracy of these products was comprehensively assessed per availability of ground networks, soil temperature interval, soil moisture interval, land cover, climate zone, and elevation. The results show that the GEOS-5 exhibits the smallest averaged unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD) of 1.84 K among all the surface ST products. All model-based products show a high skill in capturing the temporal trend of ground observations with an averaged correlation coefficient larger than 0.97. The ERA5 surface ST obtains visible improvements compared to its predecessor ERA-Interim by showing smaller ubRMSD and absolute bias values. All model-based surface ST products generally show lower values than ground ST, while their bias tends to be warmer as soil temperature and soil moisture increase except for the highest temperature and moisture conditions. Moreover, unstable performance of most model-based products in shrubland and grassland, tropical, arid and cold climate, and high elevation regions is also demonstrated by larger ubRMSD values. The averaged ubRMSD of the satellite-based LPRM ST is 3.04 K, and more attentions should be paid to the impacts of elevations and underlying surfaces on improving this product. These new findings will be valuable for future refinement of ST datasets, algorithms used to estimate soil moisture from satellite data, and applications in various disciplines.

TI  - Compliance with sentinel lymph node biopsy guidelines for invasive melanomas treated with Mohs micrographic surgery
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has not been studied for invasive melanomas treated with Mohs micrographic surgery using frozen-section MART-1 immunohistochemical stains (MMS-IHC). The primary objective of this study was to assess the accuracy and compliance with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for SLNB in a cohort of patients who had invasive melanoma treated with MMS-IHC. Methods This retrospective cohort study included all patients who had primary, invasive, cutaneous melanomas treated with MMS-IHC at a single academic center between March 2006 and April 2018. The primary outcomes were the rates of documenting discussion and performing SLNB in patients who were eligible based on NCCN guidelines. Secondary outcomes were the rate of identifying the sentinel lymph node and the percentage of positive lymph nodes. Results In total, 667 primary, invasive, cutaneous melanomas (American Joint Committee on Cancer T1a-T4b) were treated with MMS-IHC. The median patient age was 69 years (range, 25-101 years). Ninety-two percent of tumors were located on specialty sites (head and/or neck, hands and/or feet, pretibial leg). Discussion of SLNB was documented for 162 of 176 (92%) SLNB-eligible patients, including 127 of 127 (100%) who had melanomas with a Breslow depth >1 mm. SLNB was performed in 109 of 176 (62%) SLNB-eligible patients, including 102 of 158 melanomas (65%) that met NCCN criteria to discuss and offer SLNB and 7 of 18 melanomas (39%) that met criteria to discuss and consider SLNB. The sentinel lymph node was successfully identified in 98 of 109 patients (90%) and was positive in 6 of those 98 patients (6%). Conclusions Combining SLNB and MMS-IHC allows full pathologic staging and confirmation of clear microscopic margins before reconstruction of specialty site invasive melanomas. SLNB can be performed accurately and in compliance with consensus guidelines in patients with melanoma using MMS-IHC.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Analysis of Spruce Crown Transparency Levels and Their Environmental Drivers After Summer Drought in the Northern Eifel (Germany)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts in recent years weaken the forest stands in Central Europe, where especially the spruce suffers from an increase in defoliation and mortality. Forest surveys monitor this trend based on sample trees at the local scale, whereas earth observation is able to provide area-wide information. With freely available cloud computing infrastructures such as Google Earth Engine, access to satellite data and high-performance computing resources has become straightforward. In this study, a simple approach for supporting the spruce monitoring by Sentinel-2 satellite data is developed. Based on forest statistics and the spruce NDVI cumulative distribution function of a reference year, a training data set is obtained to classify the satellite data of a target year. This provides insights into the changes in tree crown transparency levels. For the Northern Eifel region, Germany, the evaluation shows an increase in damaged trees from 2018 to 2020, which is in line with the forest inventory of North Rhine-Westphalia. An analysis of tree damages according to precipitation, land surface temperature, elevation, aspect, and slope provides insights into vulnerable spruce habitats of the region and enables to identify locations where the forest management may focus on a transformation from spruce monocultures to mixed forests with higher biodiversity and resilience to further changes in the climate system.

TI  - Spatio-temporal modelling for the evaluation of an altered Indian saline Ramsar site and its drivers for ecosystem management and restoration
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Saline lakes occupy 44% and 23% of the volume and area of all lakes that are tending to suffer from extended dryness, reduced hydro period, or complete desiccation by 2025. The current study is conducted on Sambhar Salt Lake, the largest inland saline Ramsar, site of India, contributing to 9.86% of total salt production. The lake is under threat due to illegal salt pan encroachment, losing brine worth 300 million USD. The objective was to identify the key drivers that affect the lake at a landscape level. Geospatial modelling was conducted for 96 years (1963-2059) at a decadal scale, integrating ground data (birds-soil-water). Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classification was conducted using CORONA aerial imagery of 1963, along with Landsat imageries, using supervised classification for 1972, 1981, 1992, 2009, and 2019, and future prediction for 2029, 2039, 2049, and 2059. Further, images were classified into 8 classes that include the Aravali hills, barren land, saline soil, salt crust, salt pans, wetland, settlement, and vegetation. Past trends show a reduction of wetland from 30.7 to 3.4% at a constant rate (4.23%) to saline soil, which subsequently seemed to increase by 9.3%, increasing thereby the barren land by 4.2%; salt pans by 6.6%, and settlement by 1.2% till 2019. Future predictions show loss of 40% wetland and 120% of saline soil and net increase in 30% vegetation, 40% settlement, 10% salt pan, 5% barren land, and a net loss of 20%, each by Aravali hills and salt crust. Additionally, the ground result shows its alteration and reduction of migratory birds from 3 million to 3000. In the light of UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030), restoration strategies are suggested; if delayed, more restoration capital may be required than its revenue generation.

TI  - <i>Varroa destructor</i> detection in non-endemic areas
T2  - APIDOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Australia is one of the few countries where Apis mellifera are not infested by the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. In Australia a program called the 'Sugar Shake Team' has been implemented to detect an incursion of V. destructor, should it occur. The aim of this paper was to provide an estimate of the probability that V. destructor would be detected by the Sugar Shake Team program if an incursion had actually occurred (surveillance system sensitivity) using a scenario tree modelling approach. A secondary aim was to provide commentary on how surveillance for V. destructor incursions into Australia might be made more effective. Our analyses show that if one apiary in the study area was infested with V. destructor, there was only a 0.47% probability that infestation would be detected by the current program. We conclude that in its current form the Sugar Shake Team program does not provide protection to multi-billion-dollar beekeeping, pollination and agricultural industries in Australia. Surveillance for V. destructor can be made more effective by increasing the coverage and frequency of testing, deployment of additional sentinel hives and the use of sticky boards.

Vegetation phenology is a sensitive indicator that reveals the underlying processes as well as responses to climate change, while currently there remain knowledge gaps in exploring and monitoring the longterm bog vegetation phenology due to insufficient remote sensing application experiences. In this study, we investigated three remotely sensed vegetation phenological parameters, the start of growing season (SOS), the end of growing season (EOS), and the length of growing season (LOS) in two bogs located in norther China by using double-logistic reconstructed MOD13Q1-EVI from 2001 to 2018, which were evaluated by the flux phenology. Also combing with meteorological data to detect interactions between vegetation phenology and climate change. The results showed that remotely sensed EOS had 8-day time lags with flux phenological date, while that outperformed SOS. Bog vegetation generally with a life pattern of SOS at the 108th day of year (doy) and EOS at the 328th doy, though the life cycle of individual vegetation groups varies among different vegetation communities. There was no significant delayed (or extended) trend in each phenological features in bogs. Precipitation and minimum temperature (monthly and annual) were the driving forces for bog vegetation growth (R2 0.9, P < 0.01), and other features presented weaker correlations. Overall, this study determined the remote sensing phenology and climate drivers in two Chinese bogs, we suggested that vegetation phenology alternation should be concerned when carry on ecological processes and carbon dynamics researches in peatlands.

TI  - The aromatase inhibitor letrozole restores FADS2 function in ER+MCF7 human breast cancer cells
T2  - PROSTAGLANDINS LEUKOTRIENES AND ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Plasticity in fatty acid metabolism is increasingly recognized as a major feature influencing cancer progression and efficacy of treatments. Estrogen receptor positive MCF7 human breast cancer cells have long been known to have no FADS2-mediated Delta 6-desaturase activity. Our objective was to examine the effect of estrogen and the "antiestrogen" aromatase inhibitor letrozole, on Delta 5- and Delta 6-desaturase synthesized fatty acids in vitro. Methods: Eicosa-11,14-dienoic acid (20:2n-6), a known substrate for both FADS1 and FADS2, was used as a sentinel of relative FADS2 and FADS1 activity. MCF7 cells and four additional estrogen responsive wild type cell lines (HepG2, SK-N-SH, Y79 and Caco2) were studied. FAME were quantified by GC-FID and structures identified by GC-CACI-MS/MS. Results: In all five cell lines, estrogen caused a dose dependent decrease in sciadonic acid (5,11,14-20:3, ScA) via apparent inhibition of FADS1 activity, and had no effect on FADS2 catalyzed synthesis of dihomo-gamma linolenic acid (8,11,14-20:3; DGLA). In MCF7 cells, letrozole caused a dose dependent increase in FADS2catalyzed DGLA synthesis, which plateaued in SK-N-SH cells. Conclusion: Letrozole restores Delta 6-desaturase mediated synthesis of the anti-inflammatory PGE1-precursor DGLA in vitro and is the first endocrine-active agent to have opposing effects on FADS1 and FADS2 catalyzed activities.

T2  - CULTURAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the long-standing interest among science educators in using history of science in science teaching, little has been discussed around whether and how non-Western histories of science could be incorporated into science education. This study considers some opportunities and challenges of addressing East Asian history of science (EAHOS) in the science teacher education context, drawing on postcolonial science studies and global history of science. Eight undergraduate preservice science teachers (PSTs) participated in sessions on EAHOS. Our aim was to investigate the PSTs' perceptions relating to the nature of EAHOS and its relevance to science teaching. Using interviews and reflective essays, we explore the tension coming from their dual positions as science teachers and East Asian people as they entered into the unfamiliar territory of EAHOS. When they were considering themselves specifically as science teachers, they tended to focus on the aspects of EAHOS as knowledge and concluded that it has little to do with achieving the aims of science teaching because is not part of modern science. On the contrary, when they were talking about their roles as teachers in general, they were able to come up with several educational benefits that EAHOS can offer to students, particularly in its relation to worldview and history. Additionally, several mixed feelings were expressed about the way EAHOS is often portrayed as "our" history about "our" science. Overall, the experience of exploring and discussing EAHOS provided the PSTs with an opportunity to critically reflect on science education and their responsibility as teachers in the context of broader society and culture.

TI  - Evaporation in Brazilian dryland reservoirs: Spatial variability and impact of riparian vegetation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaporation is a major factor controlling the hydrological dynamics of surface water reservoirs in dry environments, therefore quantification with minimal uncertainties is desired. The aim of this paper is to assess the spatial variability and impact of riparian vegetation on reservoir evaporation by remote sensing. Eight reservoirs located in subhumid and semi-arid climates in the Brazilian Drylands were studied. Scenes from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellites (1985 and 2018) supplied the data for four evaporation models. For reference evaporation, the Class A Pan and Piche Evaporimeter closest to the reservoirs were considered. The occurrence/density of riparian vegetation was associated with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its influence on evaporation was assessed. The Surface Energy Balance System for Water (AquaSEBS) model presented the best average performance (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient 0.40 +/- 0.19). Evaporation was observed to be higher at the reservoirs' margins and near the dams, due to the contact of exposed soil and rock/concrete, respectively, which transfer heat to the water. Marginal areas near the riparian forest presented low evaporation rates with decreases between 18% and 31% in relation to the average. This interdependence was evidenced by the high negative correlation (R2 0.87-0.96) between NDVI and evaporation; vegetation reduces radiation because of the shading of the reservoir margin and changes local aerodynamics, reducing evaporation. Depending on the spatial variability of evaporation, it was found that the volumes transferred to the atmosphere may have variations of up to 30%. On average, the evaporated volume in all the studied reservoirs is 450,000 m3/day, a quantity enough to supply more than two million people. Overall, the results of this study contribute not only to a better understanding of the spa-tial variability of evaporation in surface reservoirs, but also of the interdependence between riparian vegetation and evaporation rates.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of cerebral embolic protection systems during transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a review of current clinical findings
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF CARDIOVASCULAR THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Cerebrovascular events are one of the most serious consequences after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). More than half of the cerebrovascular events following TAVR are due to procedure-related emboli. Embolic protection devices (EPDs) have the potential to decrease cerebrovascular events during TAVR procedure. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not conclusively determined if EPDs are effective, likely because of small number of patients enrolled. However, meta-analyses and propensity-matched analyses from large registries have shown efficacy and suggest the importance of EPDs in prevention of stroke during TAVR and perhaps other structural heart procedures.Areas covered: This review will focus on clinical and histopathologic studies examining the efficacy, safety, and histopathologic device capture findings in the presence and absence of EPDs during TAVR procedures.Expert opinion: Clinical studies have not conclusively determined the efficacy of EPDs. Current ongoing large-scale RCT (PROTECTED TAVR [NCT04149535]) has the potential to prove their efficacy. Histopathological evaluation of debris captured by EPDs contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms of TAVR procedure-related embolic events and suggests the importance of preventing cerebral embolization of debris released during this and other structural heart procedures.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study estimates the consequences of a scenario earthquake to a city or region using the formulated mathematical model based on multi-criteria decision-making methods like Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) and Weighted Product Method (WPM). A customized tool was developed using MATLAB to calculate, map and display the damage scenarios corresponding to various earthquake parameters and graphical user interface (GUI) was designed. The tool can be used to generate different damage scenarios by changing the earthquake parameters. The most unfavorable site-conditions, areas and the most vulnerable building, can be identified from the outputs. It allows for actions before an earthquake occurs, for example, the retrofitting of buildings and long-term urban planning. The formulated mathematical model was validated by comparing the damage scenario generated using the developed tool for 2001 Bhuj earthquake parameters and actual damage map prepared using the available pre- and post-earthquake satellite data (Landsat-7). The results showed the tool's potential to generate earthquake scenarios that help develop post-event response and recovery strategies.

TI  - Estimation of Suspended Sediment Concentration from Remote Sensing and In Situ Measurement over Lake Tana, Ethiopia
T2  - ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Discharge from basins joining a lake is the main factor determining the lake volume and sediment inflow to the lake. Suspended sediment is an important parameter for describing the water quality of aquatic ecosystems. Lake Tana is an important and the largest lake in Ethiopia for the local ecological system. However, environmental change and anthropogenic activities in the area threaten its water quality. The conventional methods of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) observation are unable to determine and compare spatial and temporal SSC patterns for the lake over a period of years. Remote sensing methods have made it possible to map SSC. The objective of this study is to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of suspended sediment of Lake Tana using in situ measurement and remote sensing applications and specifically to develop a relationship between in situ and remote sensing observation to retrieve suspended sediment concentration and map the spatal distribution of SSC. This study used MODIS-Terra and in situ data to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of SSC in the rainy season. Four sampling campaigns (20 samples per campaign) were carried out on Lake Tana, and the first three sampled campaigns on May 11-13, 2018, June 08-10, 2018, and July 15-17, 2018, were used for calibration of regression models. MODIS-Terra reflectance in NIR was found best related to in situ water quality data and varies linearly with SSC (r(2) = 0.81) and turbidity (r(2) = 0.85). Secchi disc depth (SDD) found the best fit for a power relation with NIR band reflectance (r(2) = 0.74). The MODIS-Terra reflectance in red was found to be poorly related to in situ measurements. The relation in NIR reflectance was validated using the LOOCV (leave-one-out-cross-validation) technique and the fourth sampled data set collected on August 12-14, 2018. Developed models are validated with RMSE of 42.96 mg/l, 14.6 NTU, and 0.17 m, ARE of 23.3%, 27.6%, and 12.4%, and RRMSE of 25.1%, 44.5%, and 29.6% for SSC, turbidity, and SDD, respectively, using LOOCV. The equation was also validated using August 2018 collected data sets with RMSE of 87.6 mg/l, 11.7 NTU, 0.08 m, ARE of 20.8%, 25.9%, and 28.8%, and RRMSE of 17.8%, 20.5%, and 27.9% for SSC, turbidity, and SDD, respectively. Applying the developed regression model, a 10-year time series of SSC from 2008-2017 for May-August was estimated and the trend was tested using the Mann-Kendall trend test. It was found that an increasing trend was observed from the period 2008 to 2017. The result shows that satellite data like the MODIS-Terra imagery could be used to monitor and obtain past records of SSC with the developed equation. The increasing SSC can be reduced by implementing selected management practices in the surrounding watersheds of the lake to reduce nutrient and sediment inflow.

TI  - Using land-use machine learning models to estimate daily NO2 concentration variations in Taiwan
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - It is likely that exposure surrogates from monitoring stations with various limitations are not sufficient for epidemiological studies covering large areas. Moreover, the spatiotemporal resolution of air pollution modelling approaches must be improved in order to achieve more accurate estimates. If not, the exposure assessments will not be applicable in future health risk assessments. To deal with this challenge, this study featured Land-Use Regression (LUR) models that use machine learning to assess the spatial-temporal variability of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Daily average NO2 data was collected from 70 fixed air quality monitoring stations, belonging to the Taiwanese EPA, on the main island of Taiwan. Around 0.41 million observations from 2000 to 2016 were used for the analysis. Several datasets were employed to determine spatial predictor variables, including the EPA environmental resources dataset, the meteorological dataset, the land-use inventory, the landmark dataset, the digital road network map, the digital terrain model, MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index database, and the power plant distribution dataset. Regarding analyses, conventional LUR and Hybrid Kriging-LUR were performed first to identify important predictor variables. A Deep Neural Network, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms were then used to fit the prediction model based on the variables selected by the LUR models. Lastly, data splitting, 10-fold cross validation, external data verification, and seasonal-based and county-based validation methods were applied to verify the robustness of the developed models. The results demonstrated that the proposed conventional LUR and Hybrid Kriging-LUR models captured 65% and 78%, respectively, of NO2 variation. When the XGBoost algorithm was further incorporated in LUR and hybrid-LUR, the explanatory power increased to 84% and 91%, respectively. The Hybrid Kriging-LUR with XGBoost algorithm outperformed all other integrated methods. This study demonstrates the value of combining Hybrid Kriging-LUR model and an XGBoost algorithm to estimate the spatial-temporal variability of NO2 exposure. For practical application, the associations of specific land-use/land cover types selected in the final model can be applied in land-use management and in planning emission reduction strategies.

TI  - A nationwide birth year-by-year analysis of effectiveness of HPV vaccine in Japan
T2  - CANCER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Japan, the age-adjusted incidence of cervical cancer has been increasing constantly and rapidly among younger women. We set out to accurately confirm the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine in Japan. Data were collected for women born in the fiscal year (FY) 1990 to 1997, who became eligible for their 20-y-old cervical cancer screening between the FY 2010 to 2017. The adjusted incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)1+ in women born in FY 1990 to 1993, that is those who reached the national vaccination target age prior to the introduction of publicly subsidized HPV vaccinations, referred here after as "the pre-introduction generation", was 1.42% (242/17 040). The incidence in the "vaccination generation" (women born in FY 1994 to 1997, that is those who were heavily vaccinated as a group when they were of the nationally targeted age of 13-16) was 1.66% (135/8020). There was no significant difference between these incidence rates. However, our FY birth year-by-year analysis revealed that the incidence of CIN1+ was obviously lower than that predicted based on just the trend for CIN1+ seen in the pre-introduction generation. Our analysis revealed that the incidence of CIN3+ was obviously lower in the vaccination generation than in the pre-introduction generation (P = .0008). The incidence of CIN was already tending to increase in both the pre-introduction and vaccination generations. The changes in CIN incidence by individual birth FY must be examined to accurately determine the actual effects of the HPV vaccine for reducing mild cervical lesions.

TI  - Formation, mechanism and significance of alluvial-dammed lakes in Golmud River catchment, north-eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated a series of dammed lakes and downstream-adjacent alluvial fans in the upstream to middle reaches of the Golmud River in the eastern Kunlun Mountain, on the north-eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). An optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronology shows the sediments of five dammed lakes developed from c. 45-40, 30-25, 18-14, and 12-8 ka, corresponding to MIS 3b, late MIS 3a, Last Deglaciation, and early Holocene, respectively. The remote sensing data show these dammed lakes have a total area of 109.4 km(2), with the lake volume of more than 4.0 km(3). Symmetric alluvial fans from north-south tributary valleys produced OSL ages of c. 61-52, 42-31, 26-20, and 16-10 ka, corresponding to glaciation periods: the MIS 3c and MIS 3a, MIS 2, and the Last Deglaciation. This suggests that glacial activity is responsible for the alluvial fan development, where dammed rivers occurred first, but lake formation did not take place synchronously until later periods of strong hydrologic activity, resulting from northward intrusions of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) or glacier melt. Thus, the blocking pattern is that river valleys were dammed during periods of glacial activity and lakes formed during wet periods. The lake formation and subsequent drainage may have resulted in: (i) impeded headwater incision and strengthening of downstream dissection; (ii) enriched the halite and potash in the distal Qarhan Salt Lake through hydrologic and hydrochemical processes of abundant water input, the salt lake expansion, salt redissolution from playa and final resedimentation during later dry periods. The alluvial-dammed lake pattern in the mountain-basin systems of eastern Kunlun Mountain offers a model for assessing the linkages between monsoon dynamics, geomorphic processes and distal salt lake evolutions in other arid regions.

TI  - Determination of inactive water quality variables by MODIS data: A case study in the Kizilirmak Delta-Balik Lake, Turkey
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to apply Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to monitor water quality parameters of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) in Balik Lake since TP and TN are important factors for eutrophication as well as it is essential to monitor TP and TN concentrations accurately for the management of water environments. Water chemical variables, including TN and TP, are soluble and optically inactive. For such a purpose, remote sensing (RS) enables an alternative way to monitor the optical activity of water with some limitations. In this study, TN and TP concentrations of Balik Lake are examined by RS data. The artificial neural networking (ANN) model was used to reveal the relation between the reflectance bands of MODIS along with the water quality parameters of TP and TN concentrations in aquatic environments by utilizing ground truth water samples collected concurrently with the MODIS overpass. The dataset used in the study consists of MODIS Aqua bands from 1 to 7 and ground truth observations of TP and TN from the study area of Balik Lake during 2017-2019. The development and testing of a feedforward back-propagation multilayer perceptron artificial neural network were performed by using the Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm to predict TP and TN. The accuracy of the ANN model was determined to be relatively higher in the testing stage of TP prediction with R = 0.59 for Model-1 (3-10-1) and R = 0.56 for Model-2 (7-10-1) while it is lower in the testing stage of TN prediction with R = 0.36 for Model-1 and Model-2. The findings of this study indicated that the reflectance bands of MODIS have a moderate potential to monitor the solubility variables of the water quality for the management of the lake. However, the ANN model introduced in this study is expected to ensure an improvement in the prediction accuracy of inactive water quality variables based on the RS data.

TI  - Accuracy assessment of remotely sensed data to analyze lake water balance in semi-arid region
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake water level fluctuation is a function of hydro-meteorological components, namely input, and output to the system. The combination of these components from in-situ and remote sensing sources has been used in this study to define multiple scenarios, which are the major explanatory pathways to assess lake water levels. The goal is to analyze each scenario through the application of the water balance equation to simulate lake water levels. The largest lake in Iran, Lake Urmia, has been selected in this study as it needs a great deal of attention in terms of water management issues. We ran a monthly water balance simulation of nineteen scenarios for Lake Urmia from 2003 to 2007 by applying different combinations of data, including observed and remotely sensed water level, flow, evaporation, and rainfall. We used readily available water level data from Hydrosat, Hydroweb, and DAHITI platforms; evapotranspiration from MODIS and rainfall from TRMM. The analysis suggests that the consideration of field data in the algorithm as the initial water level can reproduce the fluctuation of Lake Urmia water level in the best way. The scenario that combines in-situ meteorological components is the closest match to the observed water level of Lake Urmia. Almost all scenarios showed good dynamics with the field water level, but we found that nine out of nineteen scenarios did not vary significantly in terms of dynamics. The results also reveal that, even without any field data, the proposed scenario, which consists entirely of remote sensing components, is capable of estimating water level fluctuation in a lake. The analysis also explains the necessity of using proper data sources to act on water regulations and managerial decisions to understand the temporal phenomenon not only for Lake Urmia but also for other lakes in semi-arid regions.

TI  - Quantifying delta channel network changes with Landsat time-series data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Delta channel networks (DCNs) are highly complex and dynamic systems that are governed by natural and anthropogenic perturbations. Challenges remain in quickly quantifying the length, width, migration, and pattern changes of deltaic channels accurately and with a high frequency. Here, we develop a quantitative framework, which introduces a water occurrence algorithm based on Landsat time-series data and spatial morphological delineation methods, in order to measure DCN structures and associated changes. In examining the Pearl River Delta (PRD) and Irrawaddy River Delta (IRD) as case studies, we analyze their conditions and trends between 1986 and 2018 at ten-year intervals. Both study areas have undergone various human interventions, including dam construction, sand mining, and land use change driven by urbanization. Our results show the following: (1) the use of a 0.5 water occurrence extraction based on Landsat time-series data, morphological delineation, and spatial change analysis methods can quantify the morphodynamics of DCNs effectively with a root-mean-square error of 15.1 m; (2) there was no evident channel migration in either PRD or IRD with average channel widths of 387.6 and 300.9 m, respectively. Most channels in the PRD underwent remarkable shrinkage, with average rates of 0.4-6.4 m/year, while there were only slight changes in the IRD, which is consistent with observed trends in sediment load variation. The results of this research have the potential to contribute to sustainable river management in terms of flood prevention, riparian tideland reclamation, and water and sediment regulation. Moreover, the proposed framework can be used to develop a new global delta channel network dataset and can be generalized to remotely sensed water discharge and river depth estimation.

TI  - Feasibility and validation of the targeted axillary dissection technique in the axillary staging of breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy: Definitive results
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: to study the feasibility and value of "Targeted Axillary Dissection" (TAD) in cN1 breast cancer (BC) patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), in order to avoid unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Materials and methods: Design: Prospective observational study. Inclusion criteria: Patients with histologically confirmed cN1 staging BC and treated with NACT between January 2016 and August 2019 who accomplished clinical response. Method: Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) positive axillary nodes were marked with a metallic clip prior to neoadjuvant treatment. All patients were summited to TAD and ALND. Analysis of data: We performed [1]: a feasibility analysis of clinical, radiological and pathological variables, as well as difficulties and complications of the TAD [2]; a diagnostic test study of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), clipped lymph node biopsy (BCLIP) and their combination (TAD), using ALND as the Gold Standard. Results: 60 patients were included. 43 patients (71.7%) had a complete clinical lymph node response to NACT. Neither limitations nor complications in clip placement were found. Intraoperative location of the clipped node was problematic in 7 cases (11.7%). The pathological complete response rate (pCR) was 30.5% (18 patients) and ypN0 staging rate was 38.3% (23 patients). Sensitivity values of each technique were: SLNB: 80.9% (95%CI: 61.8-100); BCLIP: 80.8% (95%CI: 63.7-97.8); TAD: 92.6% (95%CI: 80.9-100) with negative predictive values of: SLNB: 84.6% (95%CI: 68.8-100); BCLIP: 81.0% (95%CI: 63.7-97.8); TAD: 91.3% (95%CI: 77.6-100). Conclusion: TAD is feasible and valid to rule out axillary metastatic involvement in cN1 breast cancer patients who respond to NACT.

TI  - Early drought warning based on chlorophyll fluorescence and normalized difference vegetation index in Xilingol League of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the most serious natural disasters affecting global food security and human life. Traditional drought monitoring is based on the impact of water deficit on crop morphology. Due to the time lag of traditional drought monitoring based on vegetation index and land surface temperature, crop yield has been adversely affected when drought detection is delayed. Early drought warning is an effective way to prevent disasters and reduce damage. An early warning model, using the percentage of anomaly vegetation and fluorescence (PAVF) was proposed to determine drought risk level and development trends. The principle of PAVF is to analyze the change in the percentage of anomaly vegetation (PAV) using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensor, and percentage anomaly fluorescence (PAF), from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment. A standard score of seasonal cumulative NDVI and Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence based on the data from 2007 to 2017 was used as a proxy for the evaluation index. Because PAV and PAF have different sensitivities to monitoring vegetation physiological changes, these parameters can reflect the occurrence and development trend of drought from different perspectives. Drought risk analysis in Xilingol League of China in 2018 demonstrated that the drought warning model could depict the evolution process of agricultural drought and can efficiently predict the occurrence of drought in the next half month. The proposed PAVF provides an available and innovative way to address the complexity of agricultural drought warnings. (C) 2021 Society of Photo Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Potential of Pleiades and Radarsat-2 Data for Mapping Plastic-Mulched Farmland Using Object-Based Image Analysis
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing area of Plastic-Mulched Farmland (PMF) is aggravating the conflict between agricultural development and environmental protection. The spatial distribution of PMF requires an effective and economic technique. However, most works are currently carried out on pixel-level algorithms, which leads inevitably to mixed spectral errors. In this connection, PMF has been mapped with Pleiades and Radarsat-2 data combining object-based image analysis (OBIA) and Random Forest (RF). At first, through visual interpretation, the outcomes of various segmenting scenarios were used to select the optimum segmentation parameters. The spectral characteristics, textural and geometric features were then extracted and tailored to the best PMF mapping function subset. Finally, we map the PMF using the optimized object-level feature subset based on RF. The results show that the ability of Pleiades data to map PMF in Northern China is higher than that of Radarsat-2. The overall mapping accuracy achieved is 90.27%. In general, the precision and reliability of the mapping are the product of extensive structural data and object-level features that can reduce the reliance on spectral data.

TI  - Spaceborne infrared imagery for early detection of Weddell Polynya opening
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing when sea ice will open is crucial, notably for scientific deployments. This was particularly obvious when the Weddell Polynya, a large opening in the winter Southern Ocean sea ice, unexpectedly re-appeared in 2016. As no precursor had been detected, observations were limited to chance autonomous sensors, and the exact cause of the opening could not be determined accurately. We investigate here whether the signature of the vertical ocean motions or that of the leads, which ultimately re-open the polynya, are detectable in spaceborne infrared temperature before the polynya opens. From the full historical sea ice concentration record, we find 30 polynyas starting from 1980. Then, using the full time series of the spaceborne infrared Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, we determine that these events can be detected in the 2 weeks before the polynya opens as a reduction in the variance of the data. For the three commonly used infrared brightness temperature bands, the 15 d sum and 15 d standard deviation of their area median and maximum are systematically lower than the climatology when a polynya will open. Moreover, by comparing the infrared brightness temperature to atmospheric reanalysis, hydrographic mooring data, and autonomous profilers, we find that temporal oscillations in one band and the decrease in the difference between bands may be used as proxies for upwelling of warm water and presence of leads, respectively, albeit with caution. Therefore, although infrared data are strongly limited by their horizontal resolution and sensitivity to clouds, they could be used for studying ocean or atmosphere preconditioning of polynyas in the historical record.

TI  - Optimal county-level crop yield prediction using MODIS-based variables and weather data: A comparative study on machine learning models
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop yield prediction for more precise forecasting of price volatility in crop markets, better agricultural planning and enhanced national food security is one of the important utilities of crop monitoring systems. Due to the spatiotemporal nonlinear characteristic of crop yields, recent studies have actively used various machine learning approaches to predict crop yields. However, there are few studies that have compared these approaches, and even in those cases, the comparison was restricted to one or two crops or a specific region. In this study, we evaluated seven popular machine learning approaches, for the same input variables, over three crops: paddy rice in South Korea and corn and soybean in Illinois and Iowa, USA. Based on the data from April to September, six time-series scenarios of different range of months for each crop were tested for prediction accuracy with 14-year (2003-2016). The time-series data include vegetation indices from Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), weather data, crop yield statistics, and a land cover map of county-level spatial resolution and 16-day-aggregated temporal resolution. In the results, regardless of crop type, support vector machine (SVM) presented the most accurate result with the lowest average root mean square error (RRMSE), in comparison with a decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), stacked-sparse autoencoder (SSAE), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). Also, we derived best cases for each crop yield prediction out of six time-series scenarios, which were May - September data for rice and corn and June - August data for soybean for the test sites. Considering all of the findings together, SVM is an appropriate method for crop yield prediction based on MODIS-based vegetation indices and weather data of county-level spatial resolution and approximately one-half-month temporal resolution.

TI  - W-Net: A Deep Network for Simultaneous Identification of Gulf Stream and Rings From Concurrent Satellite Images of Sea Surface Temperature and Height
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate digitization of synoptic ocean features is crucial for climate studies and the operational forecasting of ocean and coupled ocean-atmosphere systems. Today, for some North Atlantic operational regional models, skilled human experts visualize and extract the gulf stream and rings (warm and cold eddies) through an extensive and knowledge-based manual process. To automate this task, we develop a dynamics-inspired deep learning system that extracts the Gulf Stream and rings from concurrent satellite images of sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface height (SSH). We pose the above problem as a multilabel semantic image segmentation problem. A novel deep convolutional neural network architecture named W-Net, with two parallel encoder-decoder branches, is developed to perform the segmentation. The W-Net's one branch is the SST branch (accepts SST image as input) and another is the SSH branch (accepts SSH as input), and the final output is a segmentation of gulf stream, warm rings, and cold rings. A dataset consisting of SST, SSH, and manual feature annotation (ground truth) from 2014 to 2018 is used for training. For gulf stream, we obtain 82.7% raw test accuracy and a low error of 4.39% in the detected path length. For the Rings, we obtain more than 71% raw eddy detection accuracy. A detailed ablation study and an examination of both SST and SSH parts of the network are presented to understand how the deep neural network learns to segment the gulf stream's meandering path and Rings accurately.

TI  - Estimation and Compensation of Ionospheric Phase Delay for Multi-Aperture InSAR: An Azimuth Split-Spectrum Interferometry Approach
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple aperture interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MAI) can measure ground displacements along SAR track. However, MAI measurements may suffer from severe ionospheric error, especially for long-wavelength SAR sensors. This study presents a new approach, azimuth split-spectrum interferometry (AziSSI), to correct ionospheric errors in MAI measurements. The proposed method can straightforwardly resolve ionospheric phase delay by exploiting two subband MAI interferograms with different centroid frequencies. We utilized two groups of ALOS-1 PALSAR images, which cover the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake containing strong coseismic ground deformation and a stable coast region in Chile, respectively, to test the proposed method. Experimental results show that the AziSSI method can successfully recover the coseismic displacements induced by the Wenchuan earthquake and circumvent the azimuth stripes for the Chile case's MAI measurements. The maximum ionosphere-induced azimuth shifts are about 2.2 m for the Wenchuan case and 2.5 m for the Chile case. We validated the correction performance of the AziSSI method with the Wenchuan case by comparing the compensated azimuth displacements with the simulated deformation from a forward fault slip model and coseismic global positioning system (GPS) measurements. The validations show that the deformation patterns after the ionospheric correction are consistent with the simulations of the sinistral slip of the causative fault. The root-mean-square error between the GPS and MAI measurements is reduced from 0.77 to 0.28 m before and after the ionospheric correction, indicating that AziSSI can significantly compensate ionospheric errors for MAI.

TI  - Combining Imaging Flow Cytometry and Molecular Biological Methods to Reveal Presence of Potentially Toxic Algae at the Ural River in Kazakhstan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal blooms occur in freshwater bodies throughout the world, often leading to fish kills. Cases of these kills along the Ural River were reported in 2018-2019, involving significant amount of sturgeon in fish farming areas. In this study, the analysis of algal samples from the delta of the Ural River up to 100 km inland was carried out from August to December 2019 using imaging flow cytometry (IFC), molecular biological, and microscopic techniques. We identified the filamentous cyanobacteria Cuspidothrix issatschenkoi, Dolichospermum cf. flos-aquae, Dolichospermum cf. macrosporum, Pseudanabaena limnetica, and Planktothrix spp. as the dominant potentially toxic phytoplankton species, and we also found minor quantities of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. For the first time, molecular phylogenetic investigations of field clones of cyanobacteria from Ural River were carried out to establish the taxa of the dominant species and to identify the presence of genes encoding toxins. The complementary analysis with nanopore-based next-generation sequencing overlapped with the results of IFC and was instrumental in revealing minor cyanobacteria taxa. Real-time PCR analysis and sequencing indicated the presence of Microcystis and ADA-clade spp. as well as genes associated with the production of microcystin (mcyE) and the algal neurotoxin saxitoxin (sxtA) originating from cyanobacteria. These findings suggest that toxin-producing cyanobacteria could become a threat in the Ural River near Atyrau, which can significantly affect aquaculture in the region.

TI  - The trend of vegetation greening and its drivers in the Agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China, 2000-2020
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Revegetation practices have continued for nearly 20 years in the agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China (AENC), but it still remains unknown how human-induced efforts have contributed to vegetation restoration. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation coverage in the AENC during 2000-2020 in terms of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using MODIS NDVI datasets, projected the future trend of vegetation variations, and was first to quantify the relative contributions of climatic and anthropogenic impacts on the vegetation variations in the AENC by residual analysis. The results showed that the vegetation in the AENC was greening in recent 20 years due to pronounced increases in NDVI at a rate of 0.00623 year-1, but the trend of vegetation greening was unsustainable as a whole, especially in the central AENC, where large areas of vegetation will degrade in the future. Specifically, anthropogenic and climatic impacts jointly determined vegetation greening in almost 89% of the AENC. Human activities, especially large-scale afforestation, was the most important driver that contributed to vegetation greening in the AENC as a result of the relative role of approximately 66% of NDVI variations (34% from climate change). Despite the significant expansion in forest coverage, excessive afforestation had complex and unpredictable impacts on vegetation growth, and hence the eco-restoraiton is better to make vegetation recover in its natural form. This study revealed a more significant NDVI uptrend in the AENC than previously understood, highlighted the decisive role of human activities in vegetation greening over the last 20 years, and was expected to offer a better understanding and information for local ecological restoration.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) and Land surface temperature (LST) dynamics are critical indicators of trends in human activities. LULC change explains human-environment interactions and is vital for sustainable development & natural resources management. Rapid urbanization causes permanent changes in land cover as well as altering the LST. City corporations established in Gazipur (2013) and Rangpur (2012) accelerated economic growth and urbanization. We aimed to investigate whether key administrative change is the primary factor accelerating drastic urbanization rather than historical development trends. We examined the areal extent of urban class and LST change from 2006 to 2020 throughout Gazipur and Rangpur Sadar Upazila using Landsat 5 & 8 imagery. Supervised classification (Maximum Likelihood Classification) and Plank equation were used to identify urban build-up and estimate LST. The rate of urbanization was 59.64% and 51.80% during the second epoch (2013-2020) compared to 12.40% and 5.50% in the first epoch (2006-2013). The LST increased throughout the whole region during the second epoch with a maximum of 31.1 degrees C and 26.6 degrees C in Gazipur and Rangpur Sadar Upazila, respectively, which is significantly higher than the first epoch. The overall accuracy for all images used in this study stand between 93.94% and 96.97%.

T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the distribution and type of land use and land cover (LULC) is essential for watershed management. The Tigris-Euphrates basin is a transboundary region in the Middle East shared between six countries, but a recent fine-scale LULC map of the area is lacking. Using Landsat-8 time series, a 30-m resolution LULC map was produced for the Tigris-Euphrates basin. In total, 1184 Landsat scenes were processed within the Google Earth Engine (GEE). For the collection of ground truth data, differential manifestations of green cover were considered by dividing the study area into five climatic regions and the training samples were taken from each sub-region. To account for the temporal variation of LULC types, six two-month interval composite layers, including the spectral and thermal bands of Landsat-8, texture and spectral indices, as well as topographic factors were created for the target year 2019. Image segmentation and classification were performed using the simple non-iterative clustering (SNIC) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, respectively. A computationally effective parallel processing approach was developed, which created a number of tiles and sub-tiles and a bulk command was converted into smaller parallel commands. The generated LULC map showed a satisfactory overall accuracy of 91.7%, with the highest User's accuracy in water and wetland, and the lowest in rainfed crop and rangeland and the highest Producer's accuracy in water and barren areas, and the lowest in garden and rangeland. This study highlights the necessity of using multi-temporal data for LULC mapping, in particular, multi-temporal NDVI, for the separation of different green cover types in arid and semi-arid environment.

TI  - Lipidomic Profiling of Algae with Microarray MALDI-MS toward Ecotoxicological Monitoring of Herbicide Exposure
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Misuse of agrochemicals has a long-lasting negative impact on aquatic systems. Mismanagement of herbicides in agri-food sectors is often linked to a simultaneous decline in the health of downstream waterways. However, monitoring the herbicide levels in these areas is a laborious task, and modern analytical approaches, such as solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, are low-throughput and require significant sample preparation. We report here the use of microchip technology in combination with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) for the assessment of the ecotoxicological effect of agrochemicals on aquatic species at the single-cell level. This approach quantifies the fluctuations in lipid content in sentinel organisms and targets the microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii), as the model system. Specifically, we investigated the cytotoxicity of three herbicides (atrazine, clomazone, and norflurazon) on C. reinhardtii by analyzing the lipid component variation upon assorted herbicide exposure. Lipidomic profiling reveals a significantly altered lipid content at >EC50 in atrazine-exposed cells. The response for norflurazon showed similar trends but diminished in magnitude, while the result for clomazone was near muted. At lower herbicide concentrations, digalactosyldiacylglycerols showed a rapid decrease in abundance, while several other lipids displayed a moderate increase. The microchip-based MALDI technique demonstrates the ability to achieve lipidomic profiling of aquatic species exposed to different stressors, proving effective for high-throughput screening and single-cell analysis in ecotoxicity studies.

TI  - State of air pollutants and related health risk over Haryana India as viewed from satellite platform in COVID-19 lockdown scenario
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - COVID-19 driven lockdown has affected air quality worldwide. Changes in air pollutants concentration, Air Quality Index (AQI), and associated Excess Health Risk (ER%) were assessed using satellite data of before (2019), and during (2020) COVID-19 periods in the industrially, agriculturally developed and highly populated area of Haryana in the northern region of Indo-Gangetic Plains. Parameters such as Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Particulate matters (PM), Sulphur Di-Oxide (SO2), Nitrogen Di-Oxide (NO2), Carbon Mono-oxide (CO), and Methane (CH4) were derived using satellite data and validated using ground-based observations (n = 23). The coefficient of correlation (r) 0.91, 0.90, 0.95, 0.73, 0.81 and 0.80 were established with AOD, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and CO, respectively. Significant reduction (p < 0.005) in the concentration of air pollutants, viz. 38% in AOD, 55% in PM2.5, 61% in PM10, 31% in SO2, 10% in NO2, 5% in CO and 1% in CH4 were observed during lockdown. Significant (p < 0.00) improvement in air quality was observed due to a 44% reduction in pollution level, which led to the reduction in ER% by 71%, which is quite significant. AQI and ER% from satellite and ground showed a high r(2) i.e. 0.88 and 0.99 respectively, suggesting the potential application of satellite data for periodic AQI and ER% assessment.

TI  - Construction of the Mean Sea Surface Model Combined HY-2A With DTU18 MSS in the Antarctic Ocean
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A new Mean Sea Surface (MSS) model called Shandong University of Science and Technology Antarctic Mean Sea Surface model (SDUST_ANT MSS) in the Antarctic Ocean is presented and validated in this paper. The SDUST_ANT MSS updates the DTU18 MSS with 6 years of Exact Repeat Mission (ERM) and Geodetic Mission (GM) data from HY-2A. Collinear adjustment was applied to all the ERM data to obtain the along-track mean sea surface height. Oceanic variability has been removed from the GM data. Crossover adjustment was applied to both the ERM and GM data. We constructed the HY-2A_MSS using HY-2A altimetry data based on optimal interpolation method. Several types of errors (such as white noise, residual effect of oceanic variability, and long wavelength bias) have been taken into account for the determination of MSS using optimal interpolation method. The SDUST_ANT MSS was constructed by mapping HY-2A_MSS onto the DTU18 MSS. The SDUST_ANT MSS was compared with DTU18 MSS and CNES_CLS15 MSS. At wavelengths below 150 km, differences between models are consistent with seafloor topographic gradient. At wavelengths above 150 km, differences are affected by the mesoscale activities and the altimetry errors in coastal areas. The errors of the three models, as indicated by their power spectral densities (PSDs), are of similar orders of magnitude. The absolute error is slightly smaller in SDUST_ANT than in CNES_CLS15 or DTU18.

TI  - Mapping annual land disturbance and reclamation in rare-earth mining disturbance region using temporal trajectory segmentation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rare-earth mining has caused extensive damage to soil, vegetation, and water, significantly threatening ecosystems. Monitoring environmental disturbance caused by rare-earth mining is necessary to protect the ecological environment. A spatiotemporal remote sensing monitoring method for mining to reclamation processes in a rare-earth mining area using multisource time-series satellite images is described. In this study, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is used to evaluate the mining impact. Regression analysis is conducted to relate the HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 5/8 data to reduce the NDVI error related to sensor differences between different datasets. The analysis method of NDVI trajectory data of ground objects is proposed, and areas of environmental disturbance caused by rare-earth mining are identified. Pixel-based trajectories were used to reconstruct the temporal evolution of vegetation, and a temporal trajectory segmentation method is established based on the vegetation changes in different disturbance stages. The temporal trajectory of the rare-earth disturbance points is segmented to extract features in each stage to obtain the disturbance year, recovery year, and recovery cycle and evaluate the vegetation recovery after rare-earth mining disturbance. We applied the method to a stack of 20 multitemporal images from 2000 to 2019 to analyze vegetation disturbance due to rare-earth mining and vegetation recovery in the upper reaches of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, China. The results show the following. (1) Mining industry in the study area experienced rapid expansion before 2008, but growth slowed since the policies implemented by the government since 2009 to restrict rare-earth mining. (2) The continuous influence to the land caused by rare-earth mining can last for decades; however, the reclamation activities shorten the recovery cycle of mining land from 5 to 3 years.

TI  - Deep learning approach to predict sentinel lymph node status directly from routine histology of primary melanoma tumours
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Sentinel lymph node status is a central prognostic factor for melanomas. However, the surgical excision involves some risks for affected patients. In this study, we therefore aimed to develop a digital biomarker that can predict lymph node metastasis non invasively from digitised H&E slides of primary melanoma tumours. Methods: A total of 415 H&E slides from primary melanoma tumours with known sentinel node (SN) status from three German university hospitals and one private pathological practice were digitised (150 SN positive/265 SN negative). Two hundred ninety-one slides were used to train artificial neural networks (ANNs). The remaining 124 slides were used to test the ability of the ANNs to predict sentinel status. ANNs were trained and/or tested on data sets that were matched or not matched between SN-positive and SN-negative cases for patient age, ulceration, and tumour thickness, factors that are known to correlate with lymph node status. Results: The best accuracy was achieved by an ANN that was trained and tested on unmatched cases (61.8% +/- 0.2%) area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). In contrast, ANNs that were trained and/or tested on matched cases achieved (55.0% +/- 3.5%) AUROC or less. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the image classifier can predict lymph node status to some, albeit so far not clinically relevant, extent. It may do so by mostly detecting equivalents of factors on histological slides that are already known to correlate with lymph node status. Our results provide a basis for future research with larger data cohorts. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Metric inertia for eddy densities of nonlocal matter-space
T2  - JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monistic thermomechanics of eddy mater-space with metric stresses of Maxwellian type and inelastic metric waves can be developed for purely kinetic densities of the nonlocal mass-energy integral. Pseudo-Riemannian 4-geometry uses locally warped time to preserve the Euclidean sublight transport of nonlocally correlated densities with instantaneous metric connections and coherent conservation of local 4-currents everywhere. The kinematic viscosity of geometrised energy-momentum densities and their geodesic self-pushes by correlated metric stresses quantitatively clarify the adaptive all-unity of continuous kinetic energy, including material ether or variable rest-energy. The metric self-organisation of matter-space+time implies a nonlocal feedback of correlated eddy densities and their tensor response to the vector density of external forces. Such tensor inertial responses of correlated metric stresses reveal the nonlocal nature of turbulence and predict adaptive auto-modes or thermal waves of Euclidean material space due to the modified geodesic equation with viscose autowaves and the inverse Cavendish constant. The proposed nonlocal alternative to Euler/Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics can distinguish between Cartesian and Newtonian worldviews in conceptual laboratory probes of new macroscopic mechanics for metric self-organisations of thermokinetic energies of viscose material space without negative gravitational energies.

TI  - Trends and Outcomes Associated With Axillary Management of Males With Clinical N0 Breast Cancer-An NCDB Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) is standard of care for women with clini-cally N0 breast cancer. However, there are no randomized controlled studies in men deter-mining optimal surgical axillary management. Methods: Using the National Cancer Database, males diagnosed from 2006-2016 with clinical T1-4 N0 tumors treated with primary surgery were identified and categorized by axillary management. Clinicopathologic variables were compared between two timeframes, 2006-2011 and 2012-2016. Survival analysis was performed. Results: We identified 2,646 males meeting criteria. Use of SLNB increased (65.9%-72.8%, P < 0.01). For those who underwent ALND, administration of radiation (31.1% versus 48.8%, P < 0.01) and endocrine therapy (70.2% versus 80.7%, P < 0.01) increased. There was no differ-ence in survival between timeframes ( P = 0.42). For those who underwent SLNB, tumor grade ( P = 0.02) and pathologic T stage ( P < 0.01) were higher and more patients underwent mas-tectomy (74.9% versus 79.4%, P = 0.02). Administration of chemotherapy decreased (35.1% versus 27.2%, P < 0.01) and endocrine therapy increased (72.1% versus 81.3%, P < 0.01). Sur-vival of those who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) diagnosed 2012-2016 was worse than those diagnosed 2006-2011 ( P = 0.01). Conclusions: Use of SLNB alone has increased while ALND has declined in males with clin-ically N0 breast cancer. However, patients who underwent SLNB alone in the later time pe- riod had worse clinical characteristics and experienced differences in adjuvant therapy. This suggests increased acceptance of the use of SLNB for axillary management. Further analysis is warranted to evaluate methods of axillary staging and the impact on outcomes in males with breast cancer. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Citizen monitoring promotes informed and inclusive forest governance in Liberia
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Global forest loss depends on decisions made in the rural, often poor communities living beside the Earth's remaining forests. Gov-ernance problems in these forest-edge communities contribute to rapid deforestation and household vulnerability. In coordina-tion with experimental studies in 5 other countries, we evaluate a program that recruits, trains, and deploys citizens to monitor communal forestland in 60 communities in rural Liberia. The year-long intervention is designed to promote more informed and inclusive resource governance, so that that citizens' preferences (and not just leaders' interests) are reflected in forest manage-ment. In our control communities, households are uninformed and disengaged; leaders' authority is unchecked. The program both engages and mobilizes community members: households are better informed and participate more in the design and enforce-ment of rules around forest use. They also report receiving more material benefits from outside investors' activities in their com-munity forests. The chiefs who lead these communities attest to strengthened accountability. Using both on-the-ground environ-mental assessments and remotely sensed data, we find no effects on forest use or deforestation. Households do not favor more con-servation, and, thus, more inclusive management does not reduce forest use. Conservation likely requires compensating community members for foregoing forest use; citizen monitoring, we argue, could ensure that such schemes enjoy popular support and do not just benefit local elites.

M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - This article outlines a complex, vibrant, interweaving of language as a decolonising practice through creative outcomes. I will summarise how the Quandamooka tradition of weaving served as a theoretical framework for the reclamation of Jandai language. Shaped by a paradigm of language reclamation, it describes a Quandamooka worldview which is based on the connection Quandamooka people have with our Ancestors and our Country. The article identifies the integration of local ways of thinking and doing as a framework for the Quandamooka Storyweave, which was created to be more culturally relevant for the Elder participants, allowing them to share their stories and knowledge in more meaningful and culturally affirming ways. Lastly, the role of how the Quandamooka Storyweave, based on the symbolism of the fibre practices of our Ancestors, the Quandamooka Grannies and Grandfathers, is applied to support the reclamation of Jandai language through visual stories is discussed.

TI  - Axillary lymph node status in BIRADS 4-5 female patients: can shear wave and strain ultrasound elastography help?
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY AND NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The status of axillary nodes is a determining factor of management and prognosis for patients having a recent diagnosis of breast cancer. Axillary nodes are usually evaluated by ultrasonography (US) and biopsy, if indicated. Ultrasound-guided sampling and intraoperative or sentinel nodal sampling are available options, however, are invasive and hold risks of potential complications, calling for reliable, non-invasive axillary imaging. In the current prospective study, we assessed the performance of shear wave (SWE) and strain (SE) ultrasound elastography regarding preoperative axillary assessment. Sixty axillary nodes from 60 patients (age 28-65 years, mean 49.88 +/- 7.61 SD) were included, all scoring BIRADS 4-5 on sonomammography.Results: For US, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were 100%, 66.67%, 84.78%, 100%, and 88.33%, respectively. Cortical thickness and vascularity were the most sensitive. For qualitative SWE, indices were 76.92%, 80.95%, 88.24%, 65.38% and 7833%, respectively. Calculated cutoff for Emax was 59.3 and for Eratio was 4.56, giving statistical indices of 76.9%, 90.5%, 93.75%, 67.86%, and 81.67% for Emax and 76.9%, 100%, 100%, 70% and 85% respectively for Eratio. Both Emax and Eratio were greater for malignant (Emax 81.77 +/- 1.904, Eratio 8.95 +/- 5.69) than for benign nodes (Emax 37.59 +/- 33.37, Eratio 2.5 +/- 137) (P values < 0.001). For qualitative SE, sensitivity and specificity were 9231% and 57.14%, while PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 80% each (P values < 0.001). The calculated cut-off value for SR was 3.85, giving indices of 87.2%, 76.2%, 76.19%, 87.18% and 83.33% respectively.Conclusion: Adding elastography evaluation to conventional US positively impacts the specificity and accuracy of the preoperative axillary nodal status assessment in patients having newly diagnosed breast cancer.

TI  - Uncertainty of atmospheric correction algorithms for chlorophyll α concentration retrieval in lakes from Sentinel-2 data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the largest uncertainties in remote sensing data comes from atmospheric influence. This research aims to explain the uncertainties emanating from atmospheric correction (AC) product selection and how they influence chlorophyll alpha concentration retrieval in lakes in eastern Lithuania. We tested seven products from six AC processors (Acolite, Acolite Rayleigh, iCOR, Sen2Cor, C2RCC, C2X, and POLYMER) and 10 chlorophyll alpha retrieval algorithms with different architectures. The uncertainty of AC products transferred to chlorophyll alpha concentrations, and large differences in the chlorophyll alpha concentrations retrieved using different AC products were observed. The match-up analysis showed that chlorophyll alpha algorithms based on band difference performed best in terms of a high coefficient of determination and the lowest median bias when used with image-based, Sen2Cor, and TOA data. The results of this study highlight the uncertainties of AC products as well as how the selection of the chlorophyll alpha retrieval algorithm can mitigate the influence of AC selection.

TI  - The effectiveness of syndromic surveillance for the early detection of waterborne outbreaks: a systematic review
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundWaterborne outbreaks are still a risk in high-income countries, and their early detection is crucial to limit their societal consequences. Although syndromic surveillance is widely used for the purpose of detecting outbreaks days earlier than traditional surveillance systems, evidence of the effectiveness of such systems is lacking. Thus, our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the effectiveness of syndromic surveillance to detect waterborne outbreaks.MethodWe searched the Cochrane Library, Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science for relevant published articles using a combination of the keywords 'drinking water', 'surveillance', and 'waterborne disease' for the period of 1990 to 2018. The references lists of the identified articles for full-text record assessment were screened, and searches in Google Scholar using the same key words were conducted. We assessed the risk of bias in the included articles using the ROBINS-I tool and PRECEPT for the cumulative body of evidence.ResultsFrom the 1959 articles identified, we reviewed 52 articles, of which 18 met the eligibility criteria. Twelve were descriptive/analytical studies, whereas six were simulation studies. There is no clear evidence for syndromic surveillance in terms of the ability to detect waterborne outbreaks (low sensitivity and high specificity). However, one simulation study implied that multiple sources of signals combined with spatial information may increase the timeliness in detecting a waterborne outbreak and reduce false alarms.ConclusionThis review demonstrates that there is no conclusive evidence on the effectiveness of syndromic surveillance for the detection of waterborne outbreaks, thus suggesting the need to focus on primary prevention measures to reduce the risk of waterborne outbreaks. Future studies should investigate methods for combining health and environmental data with an assessment of needed financial and human resources for implementing such surveillance systems. In addition, a more critical thematic narrative synthesis on the most promising sources of data, and an assessment of the basis for arguments that joint analysis of different data or dimensions of data (e.g. spatial and temporal) might perform better, should be carried out.Trial registrationPROSPERO: International prospective register of systematic reviews. 2019.

About one in three patients with breast cancer present with lymph node (LN) metastasis and LN status is one of the most important prognostic predictors in patients with BC. In addition to their prognostic value, LNs initiate adaptive immunity against BC. Yet, BC cells often avoid immune-mediated destruction in LNs. This review provides an overview of the ways by which BC cells modulate LN stromal and hematopoietic cells to promote metastasis and immune evasion.

TI  - Seasonal deformation monitoring of the northern Yellow River Delta based on InSAR technology
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to overexploitation of natural resources in the northern Yellow River Delta and the resulting land subsidence, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology is utilized to analyze the deformation trend. Based on Advanced Land Observation Satellite PHASE Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar and Sentinel-1 data, this paper obtains the annual subsidence rate in two time periods (2007-2010 and 2017-2020) and verifies the correctness by comparing the ascending and descending orbit results. Subsequently, the 11 deformation interference pairs of the three-month interval are extracted to analyze the time series displacement of deformation areas. The results show that there are three large-scale subsidence areas with maximum annual subsidence of 250 mm, all of which are located in the oil or brine exploitation areas, and each deformation area displays a larger linear rate from January to May and then displays different nonlinear deformation from June to December.

TI  - Detecting heat-inducing urban built-up surface material with multi remote sensing datasets using reflectance and emission spectroscopy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the spatial and spectral characteristics of dominant heat-inducing urban built-up surface materials (UBSM) in Kalaburagi, Karnataka State (India) using multi remote sensing datasets and field/lab instruments. A total of 16 UBSM were collected at different locations of the study area and spectra were generated using ASD Field spec 3 Spectro radiometer operated at VNIR and SWIR regions (0.35 mu m to 2.5 mu m). The collected spectra were then resampled with the spectral range of 0.3-2.5 mu m and used for classifying dimensionally reduced AVIRIS-NG (Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation) dataset through Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier for understanding spatial and spectral characteristics of heat inducing UBSM in the study area. The classification shows that concrete, basalt stones and asbestos are the dominant UBSM in the study area and its spectral reflectance are comparatively low in the VNIR and SWIR regions. The land surface temperature (LST) of the study area was retrieved from the Landsat-8 TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor), and compared with the ECOSTRESS (ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station) LST data product and Fluke Infrared thermometer measurements operated at LWIR (8-14 mu m). All these LST estimation and comparison processes were synchronized at the most possible manner (+/- 7 days). Additionally, emissivity of collected UBSM were determined using FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Radiometer) emissivity in the laboratory. The amalgamation of results shows that barren land (mostly basaltic), basalt stones and concrete surfaces cover dominantly the high LST region of the study area. The FTIR measurements reveal that, among 16 dominant UBSM, basalt stones had recorded high spectral radiance (0.0309 Wm(-1)mu m(-1)sr(-1)) and emissivity (0.98) followed by concrete (emissivity = 0.94). Whereas marble had the lowest spectral radiance (0.0246 Wm(-1)mu m(-1)sr(-1)) and emissivity (0.49). The results agree with the SWIR reflection spectra (where basalt stones, concrete and barren rocks shows lower reflectance) and principle of Wien's displacement law (where radiance spectra display series of peaks that corresponding to the temperature measurements). Besides proposing a newer methodology for understanding spatial and spectral distribution of dominant heat inducing urban builtup surface materials, the results offer baseline data for studying microclimatic variations in the study area.

TI  - Feasibility of lateral sentinel lymph node biopsy in medullary thyroid cancer: A surrogate tool for determining prophylactic lateral neck dissection-A pilot study
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Article
AB  - Backgrounds This study aimed to evaluate usefulness of lateral sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in determining lateral neck dissection (LND) of patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Methods Sixteen patients with MTC were enrolled in the study from January 2013 to June 2019. Intratumoral injection of technetium (Tc)-99m phytate followed by lymphoscintigraphy was performed preoperatively. Lateral sentinel lymph nodes were detected by a collimated gamma probe and underwent frozen analysis. Ipsilateral LND was performed in all patients to assess lateral LN status. Results The identification rate of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) detected by radioisotope was 87.5% (14 of 16 patients). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of frozen analyses were 66.7%, 100%, 100%, and 91.6%, respectively. Based on final histopathology, however, the diagnostic values of lateral SLNB were all 100%. Conclusions This study showed that lateral SLNB can be a promising surgical tool for decisions on LND in patients with MTC.

TI  - Improved daily SMAP satellite soil moisture prediction over China using deep learning model with transfer learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The skillful soil moisture (SM) for the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L4 product can provide substantial value for many practical applications including ecosystem management and precision agriculture. Deep learning (DL) models provide powerful methods for hydrologic variables' prediction such as SM. However, the sample size of daily SM in the SMAP product is quite small, which may lead to overfitting and further impact the accuracy of DL models. From this, we first tested whether excellent predictive performance can be achieved with limited SMAP samples by the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) models, which are frequent used for hydrologic prediction. Then we pre-trained the DL models in the source domain (ERAS-land) and fine-tuned them in the target domain (SMAP). The results show that the transfer ConvLSTM model had the highest R-2 ranging from 0.909 to 0.916 and the lowest RMSE ranging from 0.0239 to 0.0247 for the lead time of 3, 5 and 7 days, and the regression lines between the predicted and the observed SM were closer to the ideal line (y = x) than all the other DL models. All the performances of transfer DL models were better than those of their corresponding DL models without transfer learning and some regions witnessed an increased explained variation over 20%. The predictive ability of different factors (i.e., lagged SM, soil temperature, season, and precipitation) has been widely discussed in this paper. According the results, we advocate for applying cross-source transfer learning with DL models for SM prediction in newly built datasets.

TI  - How to automate timely large-scale mangrove mapping with remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests have witnessed significant changes resulted from both anthropogenic and natural disturbances in the last four decades. Although a few attempts have been reported, effective methods that can repeatedly generate large-scale mangrove maps on a timely basis are still lacking due to the difficulty in gathering sufficient training samples in large geographical areas. In this study, we have addressed three objectives in the following manner: (1) we aim to develop a method to automatically collect ample mangrove training samples; Corre-spondingly, we developed an automatic training sample collection method which extracted unchanged mangrove samples from a historical mangrove map; In addition, we employed a region growing method to include more diversified training samples; (2) we strive to foster compatible classifiers that can leverage the collected one-class training samples; To this end, we came up with two representative one-class classifiers: the Support Vector Data Description (SVDD), and the Positive and Unlabeled Learning algorithm (PUL); (3) we endeavor to compare the effectiveness of various combinations of training samples, classifiers, and input images; As a result, we developed 32 classification models by varying four different variables: training samples (unchanged vs. expanded), input data (Landsat 8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2), classifiers (SVDD vs. PUL), and study sites (Florida, the United States and Guangxi, China). We found that our developed automatic training sample collection methods performed well (user's accuracy >97%). Inter-annual NDVI combined with geometric restrictions warranted the effective extraction of unchanged training samples while the region growing method further reduced the omission due to its addition of recently emerged mangroves. In addition, PUL performed better than SVDD. This is attributed to the fact that PUL draws upon not only mangrove samples, but also unlabeled ones unaccounted for in SVDD. Lastly, the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 is recommended among all the compared models. In sum-mary, we developed an effective method to automatically extract mangrove training samples, based on which a one-class classification method for large-scale mangrove mapping is made possible. We envision our methods will contribute to a wide spectrum of timely large-scale mangrove mapping tasks.

TI  - Spatial and temporal deep learning methods for deriving land-use following deforestation: A pan-tropical case study using Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing land-use following deforestation is vital for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. In this paper, for the first time, we assess the potential of spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal deep learning methods for large-scale classification of land-use following tropical deforestation using dense satellite time series over six years on the pan-tropical scale (incl. Latin America, Africa, and Asia). Based on an extensive reference database of six forest to land-use conversion types, we find that the spatio-temporal models achieved a substantially higher F1-score accuracies than models that account only for spatial or temporal patterns. Although all models performed better when the scope of the problem was limited to a single continent, the spatial models were more competitive than the temporal ones in this setting. These results suggest that the spatial patterns of land-use within a continent share more commonalities than the temporal patterns and the spatial patterns across continents. This work explores the feasibility of extending and complementing previous efforts for characterizing follow-up land-use after deforestation at a small-scale via human visual interpretation of high resolution RGB imagery. It supports the usage of fast and automated large-scale land-use classification and showcases the value of deep learning methods combined with spatio-temporal satellite data to effectively address the complex tasks of identifying land-use following deforestation in a scalable and cost effective manner.

TI  - A screening approach for the correction of distortion in UAV data for coral community mapping
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) may provide us super resolution data, however, they are often captured with artefacts and distortion. To investigate impact of distortion on the coral reef information, UAV surveys were deployed using multispectral sensor over two reefs in Bidong Island (Malaysia). Band-specific analysis of distortion revealed five different types of distorted images from the acquisition. This study optimized screening distorted images by comparing the seven distortion correction approaches and validated coral classification maps based on machine learning algorithms [support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN)]. Results indicate that the screening the green band (b2) alone or the blue band (b1) combined with b2 of UAV data and SVM capable of generating the best coral classification maps, with an overall accuracy of 7-17% improved compared to that of orthomosaic without distortion correction. The proposed distortion correction method can be applied to similar coral environments.

TI  - Comparison of blue and green water fluxes for different land use classes in a semi-arid cultivated catchment using remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study area: Kikuletwa catchment, Upper Pangani River Basin, Tanzania.Study focus: This study compared yearly blue and green water fluxes using four different methods: Senay's method (SN) (Senay et al., 2016), van Eekelen method (EK) (van Eekelen et al., 2015), the Budyko method (Simons et al., 2020) and the Soil Water Balance (SWB) model (FAO and IHE Delft, 2019). The yearly blue and green water fluxes of different Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classes were estimated using an ensemble of seven global remote sensing-based evapotranspiration products (Ensemble ET) and the CHIRPS rainfall dataset. The Ensemble ET was created from seven global RS-based surface energy balance models (GLEAM, CMRS-ET, SSEBop, ALEXI, SEBS, ETMonitor and MOD16).New hydrological insights: Our study found that the EK method was able to map blue and green water fluxes with realistic results for irrigated and non-irrigation cultivated areas. Budyko and SWB gave too high blue water fluxes for the non-irrigated agricultural areas, whereas the Budyko and SWB models were not able to show a clear difference in blue-water fluxes in irrigated versus non-irrigated areas. On the other hand, the SN method estimated no blue water fluxes in more than half of the identified irrigated areas.Three of the four methods estimate the highest blue water fluxes (318-582 mm/y) in forested areas, while the SWB model estimates the highest blue water fluxes in irrigated banana and coffee (278 mm/y). Overall, we conclude that the EK method yielded the most realistic spatial pattern of blue-water fluxes when compared to the irrigated land use map, whereas SWB could be considered after further calibration if higher temporal data resolution (e.g. monthly) is required.

TI  - Towards user-driven earth observation-based slum mapping
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation (EO) capabilities to produce up-to-date geographical information on slums over large areas supporting urban planning and evidence-based policymaking are largely acknowledged. Most EO studies typically use a data-driven approach without an understanding of end-user requirements. This study addresses this gap by aligning EO methods with societal needs and concerns using a user-driven approach in Accra, Ghana. By carrying out in-situ observations and slum experts interviews, we produced a user-driven slum map that meets potential users' expectations. To do so, we used a random forest classifier, SPOT 6 imagery, and ancillary geospatial data such as OpenStreetMap information. The overall classification accuracy for the user-driven approach reached 84%. The results show that the addition of local context-knowledge, end-user requirements, and geo-ethics, help to better contextualise and conceptualise slums. Our research demonstrates an approach of slum mapping that is reflective and open to societal needs and concerns.

T2  - ANTHROPOLOGY OF CONSCIOUSNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores Henri Bergson's understanding of time in relation to the experience of the sensory deprivation tank. In this exploration, the tank is presented as a time machine: a machine that separates time from space and takes the floater into an experience of what Bergson describes as pure time. At the same time, the tank acts as a kind of phenomenological epoche that, through the disabling of the floater's sensory-motor schema, literally suspends the human being outside of the world and forces them to reconsider their previous judgements and understandings of consciousness and time. The tank is tied in with contemporary scientific and philosophical discourses on consciousness, such as those of David Chalmers and what he has described as the hard problem of consciousness. As Chalmers discusses, the hard problem requires a radically new type of thinking beyond contemporary science and its inherent materialistic and mechanistic worldview. The tank is presented as a machine that could play a part in this radical rethinking of consciousness-a literal black box working through the black box problems of consciousness.

TI  - Quantifying the demographic vulnerabilities of dry woodlands to climate and competition using rangewide monitoring data
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is expected to alter the distribution and abundance of tree species, impacting ecosystem structure and function. Yet, anticipating where this will occur is often hampered by a lack of understanding of how demographic rates, most notably recruitment, vary in response to climate and competition across a species range. Using large-scale monitoring data on two dry woodland tree species (Pinus edulis and Juniperus osteosperma), we develop an approach to infer recruitment, survival, and growth of both species across their range. In doing so, we account for ecological and statistical dependencies inherent in large-scale monitoring data. We find that drying and warming conditions generally lead to declines in recruitment and survival, but the strength of responses varied between species. These climate conditions point to geographic regions of high vulnerability for particular species, such as Pinus edulis in northern Arizona, where both survival and recruitment are low. Our approach provides a path forward for leveraging emerging large-scale monitoring and remotely sensed data to anticipate the impacts of global change on species distributions.

TI  - Quantifying physical parameterization uncertainties associated with land-atmosphere interactions in the WRF model over Amazon
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model can be used to diagnose regional land-atmosphere (L-A) coupling strength in the absence of sufficient observations but subjected to uncertainties associated with model physical parameterizations. In this study, we propose a framework to quantify and reduce model physical parameterization uncertainties associated with surface fluxes and L-A coupling. An ensemble of WRF simulations with different physical schemes is used to simulate surface fluxes and land-atmosphere coupling strength over the Amazon region. The physical parameterizations investigated include cloud microphysics (MP), land surface processes (LSM), planetary boundary layer (PBL), surface layer (SL), and cumulus (CU). We perform 120 ensemble simulations using the WRF model and different combinations of six MPs, three LSMs, six PBLs and SLs and three CUs. The measurements from the GoAMAZON field campaign and satellite data are used to evaluate model performance. A Multi-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) approach is applied to quantify the relative importance of different physics processes on L-A coupling. The Tukey's test is used to sort schemes that have no significant differences into one group. The suite of physics that result in the best simulations of the corresponding variables are selected based on the Taylor skill score. Results show that the relative importance of processes and their interaction vary with the variables of interest. For example, CU was the most important process in modulating soil moisture, 2 m-humidity, latent heat, and net radiation. LSM showed dominant effects on 2 mtemperature and also has the largest impact on sensible heat and the lifting condensation level. The best physical parameterization ensembles show much narrower ranges of the variables of interest than the priori ensemble. Results of this study show the roles of different physical processes in modulating L-A interactions, quantify model uncertainties from physical processes, and provide insights for improving the model physics parameterizations.

TI  - Investigating the Capability of Thermal-Moisture Indices Extracted from MODIS Data in Classification and Trend in Wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are considered as dynamic ecosystems that have been changed by various factors and to protect the environment, it is necessary to identify these changes, but since terrain investigation of wetlands requires a lot of time and money, remote sensing technology can be used in this regard. The purpose of this research is to investigate the capability of TVDI, MTVDI, VTCI and TVX along with MODIS satellite products including NDVI, EVI and LST in wetland classification. Due to the multiplicity of images used, coding in MATLAB software was used. In some of the mentioned indicators, triangular and trapezoidal method was used, which uses the parameters of vegetation and surface temperature to detect surface moisture. For this purpose, six Iranian wetlands during the period 2000-2016 were studied. The images were classified using SVM method. This classification was done in March and August in all years. The study results showed that using the mentioned indicators will make it possible to classify all studied wetlands with kappa coefficient above 0.9 and overall accuracy above 0.94. On the one hand, investigation of area changes in wetlands has shown that no decreasing or increasing trend was found in the study period.

TI  - Water deep mapping from HJ-1B satellite data by a deep network model in the sea area of Pearl River Estuary, China
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) water depth inversion is an important technology and the method of water depth measurement. Taking the waters around the islands out-side the Pearl River Estuary as an example, five optical RS depth inversion algorithms were introduced. Then, five water depth inversion models were trained through the HJ-1B satellite RS image and the measured water depth data. The results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the deep learning model was the smallest (2.350 m), and that the distribution of predicted water depth points was closest to the actual value. Deep learning has been widely used in RS image classification and recognition and shows its advantages. Therefore, the deep learning model was applied to extract the depth of the shallow water. Meanwhile, the obtained inversion effect map is closest to the actual contour map. The water depth inversion per-formance of back propagation neural network model is better than that of the radial basis function (RBF) neural network model. Besides, the inversion accuracy of the RBF neural network may be affected due to the small amount of data and the improper number of hidden neurons. The results show broad application prospects of machine learning algorithms in RS water depth inversion. Also, this study provided data support for model optimization, training, and parameter setting.

TI  - Fire Prediction Based on CatBoost Algorithm
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, increasingly severe wildfires have posed a significant threat to the safe and stable operation of transmission lines. Wildfire risk assessment and early warning have become an important research topic in power grid risk assessment. This study proposes a fire prediction model on the basis of the CatBoost algorithm to effectively predict the fire point. Five wildfire risk factors, including vegetation factors, meteorological factors, human factors, terrain factors, and land surface temperature, were combined using the feature selection method on the basis of the gradient boosting decision tree model and principal component analysis to achieve dimensionality reduction of redundant data and create a fire prediction model. The MODIS fire point product is used as the model evaluation data. The verification result uses the AUC value as the evaluation factor. The accuracy of the model is 0.82, and the AUC value is 0.83. The obtained fire point evaluation results are in good agreement with the actual fire points. Results show that this model can effectively predict the risk of wildfires.

TI  - Pansharpening based on convolutional autoencoder and multi-scale guided filter
T2  - EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a pansharpening method based on a convolutional autoencoder. The convolutional autoencoder is a sort of convolutional neural network (CNN) and objective to scale down the input dimension and typify image features with high exactness. First, the autoencoder network is trained to reduce the difference between the degraded panchromatic image patches and reconstruction output original panchromatic image patches. The intensity component, which is developed by adaptive intensity-hue-saturation (AIHS), is then delivered into the trained convolutional autoencoder network to generate an enhanced intensity component of the multi-spectral image. The pansharpening is accomplished by improving the panchromatic image from the enhanced intensity component using a multi-scale guided filter; then, the semantic detail is injected into the upsampled multi-spectral image. Real and degraded datasets are utilized for the experiments, which exhibit that the proposed technique has the ability to preserve the high spatial details and high spectral characteristics simultaneously. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrated that the proposed study performs state-of-the-art results in terms of subjective and objective assessments on remote sensing data.

TI  - The 2019 Raikoke volcanic eruption - Part 1: Dispersion model simulations and satellite retrievals of volcanic sulfur dioxide
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic eruptions can cause significant disruption to society, and numerical models are crucial for forecasting the dispersion of erupted material. Here we assess the skill and limitations of the Met Office's Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion Modelling Environment (NAME) in simulating the dispersion of the sulfur dioxide (SO2) cloud from the 21-22 June 2019 eruption of the Raikoke volcano (48.3 degrees N, 153.2 degrees E). The eruption emitted around 1.5 +/- 0.2 Tg of SO2, which represents the largest volcanic emission of SO2 into the stratosphere since the 2011 Nabro eruption. We simulate the temporal evolution of the volcanic SO2 cloud across the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and compare our model simulations to high-resolution SO2 measurements from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) satellite SO2 products.We show that NAME accurately simulates the observed location and horizontal extent of the SO2 cloud during the first 2-3 weeks after the eruption but is unable, in its standard configuration, to capture the extent and precise location of the highest magnitude vertical column density (VCD) regions within the observed volcanic cloud. Using the structure-amplitude-location (SAL) score and the fractional skill score (FSS) as metrics for model skill, NAME shows skill in simulating the horizontal extent of the cloud for 12-17 d after the eruption where VCDs of SO2 (in Dobson units, DU) are above 1 DU. For SO2 VCDs above 20 DU, which are predominantly observed as small-scale features within the SO2 cloud, the model shows skill on the order of 2-4 d only. The lower skill for these high-SO2-VCD regions is partly explained by the model-simulated SO2 cloud in NAME being too diffuse compared to TROPOMI retrievals. Reducing the standard horizontal diffusion parameters used in NAME by a factor of 4 results in a slightly increased model skill during the first 5 d of the simulation, but on longer timescales the simulated SO2 cloud remains too diffuse when compared to TROPOMI measurements.The skill of NAME to simulate high SO2 VCDs and the temporal evolution of the NH-mean SO2 mass burden is dominated by the fraction of SO2 mass emitted into the lower stratosphere, which is uncertain for the 2019 Raikoke eruption. When emitting 0.9-1.1 Tg of SO2 into the lower stratosphere (11-18 km) and 0.4-0.7 Tg into the upper troposphere (8-11 km), the NAME simulations show a similar peak in SO2 mass burden to that derived from TROPOMI (1.4-1.6 Tg of SO2) with an average SO2 e-folding time of 14-15 d in the NH.Our work illustrates how the synergy between highresolution satellite retrievals and dispersion models can identify potential limitations of dispersion models like NAME, which will ultimately help to improve dispersion modelling efforts of volcanic SO2 clouds.

TI  - Combining gradual and abrupt analysis to detect variation of vegetation greenness on the loess areas of China
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The annual peak growth and trend shift of vegetation are critical in characterizing the carbon sequestration capacity of ecosystems. As the well-known area with the fastest vegetation growth in the world, the Loess Plateau (LP) lands find an enhanced greening trend in the annual and growing-season. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation peak growth and breakpoints characteristics on time series still needs to be explored. Here, we performed tendency analysis to characterize recent variations in annual peak vegetation growth through a satellite-derived vegetation index (NDVImax, Maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and then applied breakpoint analysis to capture abrupt points on the time series. The results demonstrated that the vegetation peak trend had been significantly increasing, with a growth rate at 0.68 x 10(-2)center dot a(-1) during 2001-2018, and most pixels (70.81%) have a positive linear greening trend over the entire LP. In addition, about 83% of the breakpoint type on the monthly NDVI time series is a monotonic increase at the pixel level, and most pixels (57%) have detected breakpoints after 2010. Our results also showed that the growth rate accelerates in the northwest and decelerates in the southeast after the breakpoint. This study indicates that combining abrupt analysis with gradual analysis can describe vegetation dynamics more effectively and comprehensively. The findings highlighted the importance of breakpoint analysis for monitor timing and shift using time series satellite data at a regional scale, which may help stakeholders to make reasonable and effective ecosystem management policies.

TI  - Decreased Survival of Invasive Ductal Breast Cancer Patients With Two Macrometastatic Lymph Nodes Among Few Resected Ones: Should Current Sentinel-Lymph-Node Guidelines Be Revised?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Sentinel-lymph-node (SLN) biopsy (SLB) is an efficient and safe axillary surgical approach with decreased morbidity than total axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in initial patients (T1-T2). Current guidelines strongly suggest avoiding completion of ALND in patients with one or two positive SLNs that will be submitted to whole-breast radiation therapy, but must be done when three SLNs are affected.Methods We performed a SEER-based study with breast invasive ductal carcinoma patients treated between 2010 and 2015. Optimal cutoffs of positive LNs predictive of survival were obtained with ROC curves and survival as a continuous variable. Bias was reduced through propensity score matching. Cox regression was employed to estimate prognosis. Nomograms were constructed to analyze the predictive value of clinicopathological factors for axillary burden.Results Of 43,239 initial patients that had one to three analyzed LNs, only 425 had two positive LNs and matched analysis demonstrated no survival difference versus pN2 patients [HR: 0.960 (0.635-1.452), p = 0.846]. The positive-to-analyzed LN proportion demonstrated a strong prognostic factor for a low rate (1 positive to & LE;1.5 analyzed) [HR = 1.567 (1.156-2.126), p = 0.004], and analysis derived from the results demonstrated that a "negative LN margin " improves survival. Nomograms shows that tumor size is the main factor of axillary burden.Conclusion Macrometastasis of two LNs is a poor prognostic factor, similar to pN2, in SLNB (-like) patients; more extensive studies including preconized therapies must be done in order to corroborate or refute the resistance of this prognostic difference in patients with two macrometastatic lymph nodes within few resected.

TI  - Greenland ice velocity maps from the PROMICE project
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the Programme for Monitoring of the Greenland Ice Sheet (PROMICE) Ice Velocity product (https://doi.org/10.22008/promice/data/sentinel1icevelocity/greenlandicesheet, Solgaard and Kusk, 2021), which is a time series of Greenland Ice Sheet ice velocity mosaics spanning September 2016 through to the present. The product is based on Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data and has a 500m grid spacing. A new mosaic is available every 12 d and spans two consecutive Sentinel-1 cycles (24 d). The product is made available within similar to 10 d of the last acquisition and includes all possible 6 and 12 d pairs within the two Sentinel-1A cycles. We describe our operational processing chain from data selection, mosaicking, and error estimation to final outlier removal. The product is validated against in situ GPS measurements. We find that the standard deviation of the difference between satellite- and GPS-derived velocities (and bias) is 20 m yr(-1) (-3 m yr(-1)) and 27 m yr(-1) (-2 m yr(-1)) for the components in an eastern and northern direction, respectively. Over stable ground the values are 8 m yr(-1) (0.1 m yr(-1)) and 12 m yr(-1) (-0.6 m yr(-1)) in an eastern and northern direction, respectively. This is within the expected values; however, we expect that the GPS measurements carry a considerable part of this uncertainty. We investigate variations in coverage from both a temporal and spatial perspective. The best spatial coverage is achieved in winter due to the comprehensive data coverage by Sentinel-1 and high coherence, while summer mosaics have the lowest coverage due to widespread melt. The southeast Greenland Ice Sheet margin, along with other areas of high accumulation and melt, often has gaps in the ice velocity mosaics. The spatial comprehensiveness and temporal consistency make the product ideal both for monitoring and for studying ice-sheet-wide and glacier-specific ice discharge and dynamics of glaciers on seasonal scales.

TI  - Automatic cloud and cloud shadow detection in tropical areas for PlanetScope satellite images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PlanetScope satellite data with a 3-m resolution and near-daily global coverage have been increasingly used for land surface monitoring, ranging from land cover change detection to vegetative biophysics characterization and ecological assessments. Similar to other satellite data, effective screening of clouds and cloud shadows in PlanetScope images is a prerequisite for these applications, yet remains challenging as PlanetScope has 1) fewer spectral bands than other satellites hindering the use of traditional methods, and 2) inconsistent radiometric calibration across satellite sensors making the cloud/shadow detection using fixed thresholds unrealistic. To address these challenges, we developed a SpatioTemporal Integration approach for Automatic Cloud and Shadow Screening ('STI-ACSS'), including two steps: (1) generating initial masks of clouds/shadows by integrating both spatial (i.e. cloud/shadow indices of an individual PlanetScope image) and temporal (i.e. reflectance outliers in PlanetScope image time series) information with an adaptive threshold approach; (2) a two-step fine-tuning on these initial masks to derive final masks by integrating morphological processing with an object-based cloud and cloud shadow matching. We tested STI-ACSS at six tropical sites representative of different land cover types (e.g. forest, urban, cropland, savannah, and shrubland). For each site, we evaluated the performance of STI-ACSS with reference to the manual masks of clouds/shadows, and compared it with four state-of-the-art methods, namely Function of mask (Fmask), Automatic Time-Series Analysis (ATSA), Iterative Haze Optimized Transformation (IHOT) and the default PlanetScope quality control layer. Our results show that, across all sites, STI-ACSS 1) has the highest average overall accuracy (98.03%), 2) generates an average producer accuracy of 95.53% for clouds and 89.48% for cloud shadows, and 3) is robust across sites and seasons. These results suggest the effectiveness of using STI-ACSS for cloud/shadow detection for PlanetScope satellites in the tropics, with potential to be extended to other satellite sensors with limited spectral bands.

TI  - Quantifying the contribution of climate change and human activities to biophysical parameters in an arid region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the variation of biophysical parameters and their driving mechanisms is essential for monitoring land surface environmental changes and for understanding the land-atmosphere interaction in the arid region. Due to the complexity of human activities, most researches are limited to climate change, whereas the response analysis of human activities to changes in biophysical parameters are still lacking or not comprehensively considered. Therefore, large biases and uncertainties still exist in the estimates of regional responses to global change. Firstly, we specifically quantified the main human activities related to land use/land cover change (LULCC) in the northern Tianshan Mountains (NTM), and identified the spatiotemporal changes of primary biophysical parameters, including Albedo, leaf area index (LAI), land surface temperature (LST), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Then, we tested the performance of the five models used, including multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). RF outperformed others and was used to quantify and disaggregate the contribution of climate change and human activities to land surface parameters in the NTM. We found a strong spatial heterogeneity in the spatial variation of all biophysical parameters. Except for LST, the annual maximum Albedo, LAI, and NDVI showed a significant increasing trend in the NTM from 2000 to 2019 (p < 0.05). Generally, climate change contributed more to the biophysical parameters than human activities. However, the contribution of human activities to NDVI was 0.51, which was greater than that of climate change during 2000-2015. This study provides new insight on the impact of climate change and human activities on biophysical parameters and a scientific basis for model parameterization in the arid region.

TI  - An entirely new approach based on remote sensing data to calculate the nitrogen nutrition index of winter wheat
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) is a reliable indicator for diagnosing crop nitrogen (N) status. However, there is currently no specific vegetation index for the NNI inversion across multiple growth periods. To overcome the limitations of the traditional direct NNI inversion method (NNIT1) of the vegetation index and traditional indirect NNI inversion method (NNIT2) by inverting intermediate variables including the aboveground dry biomass (AGB) and plant N concentration (PNC), this study proposed a new NNI remote sensing index (NNIRS). A remote-sensing-based critical N dilution curve (Nc_RS) was set up directly from two vegetation indices and then used to calculate NNIRS. Field data including AGB, PNC, and canopy hyperspectral data were collected over four growing seasons (2012-2013 (Exp.1), 2013-2014 (Exp. 2), 2014-2015 (Exp. 3), 2015-2016 (Exp. 4)) in Beijing, China. All experimental datasets were cross-validated to each of the NNI models (NNIT1, NNIT2 and NNIRS). The results showed that: (1) the NNIRS models were represented by the standardized leaf area index determining index (sLAIDI) and the red-edge chlorophyll index (CIred edge) in the form of NNIRS=CIred edge/(a & times;sLAIDIb), where "a" equals 2.06, 2.10, 2.08 and 2.02 and "b" equals 0.66, 0.73, 0.67 and 0.62 when the modeling set data came from Exp.1/2/4, Exp.1/2/3, Exp.1/3/4, and Exp.2/3/4, respectively; (2) the NNIRS models achieved better performance than the other two NNI revised methods, and the ranges of R2 and RMSE were 0.50-0.82 and 0.12-0.14, respectively; (3) when the remaining data were used for verification, the NNIRS models also showed good stability, with RMSE values of 0.09, 0.18, 0.13 and 0.10, respectively. Therefore, it is concluded that the NNIRS method is promising for the remote assessment of crop N status.<comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment

TI  - Air pollution in an urban world: A global view on density, cities and emissions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we take a global view at air pollution looking at cities and countries worldwide. We pay special attention at the spatial distribution of population and its relationship with the evolution of emissions. To do so, we build i) a unique and large dataset for more than 1200 (big) cities around the world, combining data on emissions of CO2 and PM2.5 with satellite data on built-up areas, population and light intensity at night at the grid-cell level for the last two decades, and ii) a large dataset for more than 190 countries with data from 1960 to 2010. At the city level, we find that denser cities show lower emissions per capita. We also find evidence for the importance of the spatial structure of the city, with polycentricity being associated with lower emissions in the largest urban areas, while monocentricity being more beneficial for smaller cities. In sum, our results suggest that the size and structure of urban areas matters when studying the density-emissions relationship. This is reinforced by results using our country-level data where we find that higher density in urban areas is associated with lower emissions per capita. All our main findings are robust to several controls and different specifications and estimation techniques, as well as different identification strategies.

TI  - Urbanization effect of mega sporting events using sentinel-2 satellite images: The case of the pyeongchang olympics
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study attempts to understand the impact of mega sporting events on local economies by identifying and comparing the urbanization and economic effects of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games. However, for an accurate evaluation of the effects of hosting the Winter Olympics, it is necessary to consider not only the ripple effect on the local economy but also the increased potential for urban growth from the expansion of social overhead capital. This study calculates the urbanization index and land cover ratio using Sentinel-2 satellite images to examine the urbanization from infrastructure construction for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. It additionally analyzes the changes in land price and tax revenue during this period to understand the economic effects of the Olympics, and verifies the correlation between urbanization and economic indicators.

TI  - Axillary Reverse Mapping in Patients Undergoing Axillary Lymph Node Dissection: A Single Institution Experience From India
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionAxillary lymph node dissection (ALND) remains the gold standard for clinically node-positive and sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) positive breast cancer patients, but it is associated with the debilitating morbidity of lymphedema. Recently, a new technique of axillary reverse mapping (ARM) has been described which helps in differentiating arm lymphatics from breast lymphatics.AimTo evaluate the applicability of the ARM technique with blue dye and the incidence of metastases in ARM nodes in the Indian population.MethodA total of 120 patients underwent ARM during ALND. Blue lymphatic channels and lymph nodes were noted. All axillary nodes along with ARM nodes were dissected and sent separately for pathological evaluation for metastases.ResultsARM nodes or lymphatics were identified in 65 (54.17%) out of 120 patients. The mean ARM lymph node yield was 1.4. The patients in whom ARM lymph nodes or lymphatics were not identified had significantly higher T stage and N stage (p<0.00001) than in whom it was identified. There was no significant correlation between ARM identification with BMI, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu), and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) status. ARM nodes were found metastatic in three patients (7.5%). All these patients had clinically N2 disease and all had pathologically more than ten nodes involved in the axilla.ConclusionThe identification rate of ARM nodes and lymphatics with blue dye is lower in Indian patients who present with higher clinical T and N stage disease. Other clinicopathological parameters were not associated with the identification rate. The rate of metastasis in ARM nodes is high in patients with a high axillary tumor burden. Hence, preserving ARM nodes may not be oncologically safe in higher N stage disease.

TI  - Resolvin D1 reduces expression and secretion of cytokines and monocyte adhesion triggered by Angiotensin II, in rat cardiac fibroblasts
T2  - BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cardiac fibroblasts (CF) play an important role in the healing process and in pathological remodeling of cardiac tissue. As sentinel cells in the heart, they respond to inflammatory stimuli, expressing cytokines and cell adhesion proteins, which ultimately lead to increased recruitment of monocytes and enhancement of the inflammatory response. Angiotensin II (Ang II) triggers an inflammatory response, leading to cardiac tissue remodeling. On the other hand, RvD1 has been shown to contribute to the resolution of inflammation; however, its role in Ang IItreated CF has not been addressed until now. The present research aimed to study the effect of RvD1 on cytokine levels, cell adhesion proteins expression in a model of Ang II-triggered inflammatory response. CF from adult Sprague Dawley rats were used to study mRNA and protein levels of MCP-1, IL-6, TNF-a, IL-10, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1; and adhesion of spleen mononuclear cells to CF after Ang II stimulation. Our results show that Ang II increased IL-6, MCP-1 and TNF-a mRNA levels, but only increased IL-6 and MCP-1 protein levels. These effects were blocked by Losartan, but not by PD123369. Moreover, RvD1 was able to prevent all Ang II effects in CF. Additionally, RvD1 reduced the intracellular Ca2+ increase triggered by Ang II, indicating that RvD1 acts in an early manner to block Ang II signaling. Conclusion: our findings confirm the pro-resolutive effects of inflammation by RvD1, which at the cardiovascular level, could contribute to repair damaged cardiac tissue.

TI  - Pathologic Lymph Node Staging of Gastric Cancer: Current Challenges and Controversies
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: The TNM classification is the main tool for lymph node (LN) staging in gastric cancer (GC). However, alternative LN staging systems have been proposed, and the role of features other than the number of metastatic LNs is being investigated. Our aim is to discuss the main challenges of LN assessment in GC.Methods: Comprehensive review of the literature on alternative LN staging systems, examined LNs, sentinel LN (SLN) biopsy, LN micrometastases (LNMIs), extracapsular extension (ECE), and tumor deposits (TDs) in GC.Results: Many controversies exist regarding LN assessment in GC. The TNM classification shows excellent prognostic performance, but alternative prognostic methods such as the LN ratio or log odds of positive LNs have demonstrated to be better than the TNM system in terms of prognostic accuracy. The value of SLN biopsy and LNMIs in GC is still unclear, and several challenges concerning their clinical impact and pathologic analysis must be overcome before their introduction in clinical practice. Most authors have identified ECE and TDs as independent prognostic factors for survival in GC.Conclusions: Further studies should be performed to evaluate the impact of these features on the TNM classification and patient outcomes, as well as to standardize alternative LN staging systems.

TI  - Dilated-ResUnet: A novel deep learning architecture for building extraction from medium resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In today's world, satellite images are being utilized for the identification of built-up area, urban planning, disaster management, insurance & tax assessment in an area, and many other social-economic activities. The extraction of the accurate building footprints in densely populated urban areas from medium resolution satellite images is still a challenging task which requires the development of the new methods to solve such problem. In this paper, a novel Dilated-ResUnet deep learning architecture for building extraction from Sentinel-2 satellite images has been proposed. The proposed model has been tested on three novel building datasets that are prepared for three densely populated cities of India (viz. Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru) using Sentinel-2 satellite images and Planet OSM. First FCC (false colour composite) dataset prepared by merging NIR, Red, Green bands, second FCC dataset prepared by merging NIR, Red, Green and Blue bands and third is TCC (true colour composite) dataset by merging red, green and blue bands. The proposed architecture is applied to both the FCC datasets and TCC dataset separately; it has been identified that the proposed model has obtained better building extraction results using FCC (NIR, Red, Green) dataset. The input satellite image enhancement and extensive experimentations to identify the optimal deep learning hyper-parameters using FCC spatial dataset have also been carried out to further improve the performance of the proposed model. The results of the experimentations reveal that the proposed model has out-performed the state of the art models available in literature by achieving the F1-score of 0.4718 and Mean IoU of 0.582 for building extraction from Sentinel-2 satellite images. The outcome of the research work can be utilized for urban planning and management, generate more ground truths for Sentinel-2 satellite images which further can be useful for other societal applications.

TI  - The impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on surface urban heat island changes and air-quality improvements across 21 major cities in the Middle East
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates changes in air quality conditions during the restricted COVID-19 lockdown period in 2020 across 21 metropolitan areas in the Middle East and how these relate to surface urban heat island (SUHI) characteristics. Based on satellite observations of atmospheric gases from Sentinel-5, results indicate significant reductions in the levels of atmospheric pollutants, particularly nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). Air quality improved significantly during the middle phases of the lockdown (April and May), especially in small metropolitan cities like Amman, Beirut, and Jeddah, while it was less significant in "mega" cities like Cairo, Tehran, and Istanbul. For example, the concentrations of NO2 in Amman, Beirut, and Jeddah decreased by-56.6%,-43.4%, and-32.3%, respectively, during April 2020, compared to April 2019. Rather, there was a small decrease in NO2 levels in megacities like Tehran (-0.9%) and Cairo (-3.1%). Notably, during the lockdown period, there was a decrease in the mean intensity of nighttime SUHI, while the mean intensity of daytime SUHI experienced either an increase or a slight decrease across these locations. Together with the Gulf metropolitans (e.g. Kuwait, Dubai, and Muscat), the megacities (e.g. Tehran, Ankara, and Istanbul) exhibited anomalous increases in the intensity of daytime SUHI, which may exceed 2 degrees C. Statistical relationships were established to explore the association between changes in the mean intensity and the hotspot area in each metropolitan location during the lockdown. The findings indicate that the mean intensity of SUHI and the spatial extension of hotspot areas within each metropolitan had a statistically significant negative relationship, with Pearson's r values generally exceeding -0.55, especially for daytime SUHI. This negative dependency was evident for both daytime and nighttime SUHI during all months of the lockdown. Our findings demonstrate that the decrease in primary pollutant levels during the lockdown contributed to the decrease in the intensity of nighttime SUHIs in the Middle East, especially in April and May. Changes in the characteristics of SUHIs during the lockdown period should be interpreted in the context of long-term climate change, rather than just the consequence of restrictive measures. This is simply because short-term air quality improvements were insufficient to generate meaningful changes in the region's urban climate.

TI  - Delineating the Influence of Erosion and Accretion to Identify the Vulnerable Zone of Embankment Breaching in Gosaba Island, South 24 Parganas, West Bengal, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess the vulnerable zone of embankment breaching in Gosaba Island using geospatial and quantitative techniques. In this study, multi-temporal Landsat data from 1972 to 2017 were used for delineating shoreline change rate, net shoreline movement (NSM), erosion and accretion area and net areal change for each Gram Panchayats (GP) of the island. The shoreline change rate was calculated using end point rate (EPR) for each GP, and the uncertainty of the shoreline change rate was adjusted by measuring the positional error (+/- 3.58 m yr(-1)). Near about, 704.39 ha of lands in Gosaba Island was highly erosion-prone and almost 303.33 ha of lands was completely washed out in the last 45 years. Gosaba (63.35 ha), Kumirmari (58.09 ha), Bally I (66.82 ha), Bally II (16.29 ha), Lahiripur (51.80 ha) and Satjelia GP (52.98 ha) were facing intensive land loss during 1972-2017. For validation of the result, a rigorous field survey during 2017-2018 was conducted and different forms of riverbank erosion were identified and presented in this study. Besides, GP-wise coastal vulnerability was delineated using three parameters, such as EPR, NSM and area under erosion. The statistical analysis revealed that the southern and eastern parts were highly vulnerable to coastal erosion as compared to the northern part of the island. The temporal tidal fluctuations of Sundarbans' rivers also influence the intensity of coastal erosion. Therefore, the construction and management of embankment in this part of the island is highly challenging and needs a proper strategic framework for the longevity of the embankment. The present research work also suggests some planning measures for the protection of embankments. This research study may help to understand the degree of spatial vulnerability of Gosaba Island to erosion hazards and also encourage coastal planners for strategic planning of coastal zone management and its implementation for better resilience of the island against environmental extremes.

TI  - Water and energy demand forecasting in large-scale water distribution networks for irrigation using open data and machine learning algorithms
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In a world where the availability of water is decreasing, its use must be thoroughly optimized. Irrigated agricultural systems, as the main user of the planet's fresh water, must improve its management and save as much of this scarce resource as possible. However, the heterogeneity of these complex systems that are frequently organized in water user associations makes the daily management of this resource difficult. The new information and communication technologies as well as artificial intelligence techniques help to understand the heterogeneity of these complex systems, making it possible to better manage them. However, the implementation of a tool with these characteristics requires a large and heterogeneous amount of data from different sources. Thus, in this work, a new tool for managers based on water demand forecasting at the field scale for the week ahead has been developed. This tool, WatergyForecaster, combines artificial intelligence techniques, satellite remote sensing (Sentinel 2) and open source climate data to automatically build a water forecasting model at the farm scale for a week in advance. WatergyForecaster, developed in Python, was applied to a real water user association (WUA), obtaining a set of optimum models with an accuracy that ranged from 17% to 19% and representativeness higher than 80%.

TI  - Detection and Prediction of Sundarban Reserve Forest using the CA-Markov Chain Model and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper highlights the classification, change detection and future prediction of Sundarban reserve forest using multi-spectral satellite data over last 43 years (1975-2018). The remote sensing data are classified using back-propagation neural network algorithm which are healthy vegetation, unhealthy vegetation, wet land, and water bodies. The classification result demonstrates that the net forest areas were gradually declined by around 6.83% during 1975-2018, while it was not uniform over the whole period. Besides the other features also correspondingly changes. The change detection results revealed that some of the forest areas were converted into wet land and part of the wet land also flooded by water bodies due to rising sea level. To validate the forest cover classification on the images, the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were used. The resulting overall accuracy were 91.8%, 94.1%, 87.5%, 88.1% and 90.1% and Kappa coefficients were 0.8903, 0.9201, 0.8292, 0.8413 and 0.8680 for 1975, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2018 respectively. Future predictions were obtained through CA-Markov Chain model which is based on the probabilistic modeling methods. The CA-Markov model shows that constant changes in forest cover. Changes in the extent of forest cover of the study area were further projected until 2034, representing that the area of net forest will be continuously reduced to 12.89%. The outcomes of this study may be offer quantitative information, which signify the base for measurement of forest ecosystem and for taking actions to reduce their degradation.

TI  - Surgical Management of Axilla Following Neoadjuvant Endocrine Therapy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Randomized clinical trials support deescalation of axillary surgery in breast cancer patients with low-volume axillary disease treated with a surgery-first approach. However, few data exist to guide axillary surgery following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET). Therefore, we evaluated the extent and outcomes of axillary surgery in a contemporary cohort of NET patients, a treatment approach that has become particularly relevant during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients and Methods We identified invasive breast cancer patients treated with NET between October 2008 and November 2019. Patients presenting with stage IV disease or recurrent disease were excluded. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Results 194 invasive breast cancers in 186 patients (median age 66 years) were evaluated; 81 patients had breast-conserving surgery (BCS), while 113 underwent mastectomy. Eighty-four patients (43.3%) were biopsy-proven cN+ with 4/84 (4.8%) ypN0 following NET. Among cN+ patients, 14 (16.7%) had sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) only, 27 (32.1%) had SLNB + axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and 43 (51.2%) had ALND. Among 110 cN0 patients, 99 had axillary surgery with 28/99 (28.3%) ypN+: SLNB in 83 (75.5%), SLNB+ALND in 14 (12.7%), and ALND in 2 (1.8%). Among all ypN+ patients, 23/108 (21.3%) had SLNB alone: 18/43 (41.9%) of BCS and 5/65 (7.7%) mastectomy patients (p < 0.001). After median follow-up of 35 months, no regional recurrences were observed. Conclusions Among biopsy-proven cN+ NET patients, we observed deescalation of axillary surgery in selected patients, despite a low nodal pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, without nodal recurrences. These data suggest that patients with low-volume axillary disease treated with NET may be managed similarly to patients treated with a surgery-first approach.

TI  - Influence of management on vegetation restoration in coal waste dump after reclamation in semi-arid mining areas: examining ShengLi coalfield in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation management usually carried out for a period of time to maintain the vegetation restoration of coal waste dumps after reclamation. However, the natural restoration of vegetation is faced with great challenges in semi-arid mining areas without management, due to the fragile ecological environment. Therefore, it is necessary to determine a reasonable management plan so that vegetation restoration can reach a stable state although the abandonment of the management. The objective was to explore the difference of vegetation restoration under different management modes in a typical semi-arid mining area. Two reclaimed coal waste dumps under different management measures, the north waste dump (ND) and the south waste dump (SD), were examined in the ShengLi coalfield in Inner Mongolia, China. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset based on Landsat series imagery was obtained using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, and the landscape metrics were also calculated based on different vegetation coverage. The results proved that 3 years of management was not enough to stabilize vegetation restoration. A serious vegetation degradation occurred at the ND after the management stopped, with 40.1% of the pixels recorded a significant decrease (rho = 0.05). The vegetation coverage became fragmented, and there was a tendency of succession to lower coverage. On the contrary, the vegetation restoration of SD was better under continuous management, and no significant degradation trend was observed. Furthermore, the results indicated that rainfall is the main influencing factor on vegetation restoration in semi-arid mining areas. The coal waste dump was more susceptible to weather change in natural restoration. By contrast, continuous management measures will resist such climate disturbances, even in dry years. This research will provide support for the formulation of the reclamation management plan of coal waste dumps in semi-arid mining areas.

TI  - An Efficient Machine Learning Approach for Atmospheric Correction
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The earth observation using remote sensing images is an inquisitive way to explore and evaluate the geo-resources of any specific area on the globe. In this regard, Indian Resourcesat-2A (R2A) remote sensing satellite plays an important role in monitoring the critical resources of our planet using its unique three tier imaging mechanism. Optical sensors on-board R2A have good spatial temporal resolution for diverse space borne applications. Most of these applications requires Surface Reflectance (SR) data product by removing the effects of intermittent atmospheric scattering and absorption. Radiative Transfer Models (RTM) are used to perform atmospheric correction which are computationally intensive, thus a look-up table (LUT) is utilized to interpolate intermediate values as a trade-off between accuracy and speed. However, the process of interpolation too becomes very compute intensive when a large enough LUT is used. The paper provides an approach to remove this trade-off by using multi-layered deep network to model interpolation as a regression problem. The proposed method generates highly accurate Deep SR product with a significant reduction in turn-around time. The experimental result shows that a speedup of 5x is achieved with the developed framework as compared to conventional interpolation-based approach for generation of R2A LISS-3 Deep SR scene data product. The Deep SR product is compared with pure 6SV generated product and R2 value found to be 0.97 (Green), 0.97 (Red), 0.98 (NIR) and 0.98 (SWIR), respectively. To check the efficacy of the framework, the LISS-3 Deep SR product is also compared with closest acquisition Landsat-8 SR product and ground truth values obtained through vicarious calibration. The maximum relative deviation error found to be 1.34%, 1.82%, 3.25% and 2.16% for Green, Red, NIR and SWIR channels, respectively.

TI  - Stochastic modelling of variable renewables in long-term energy models: Dataset, scenario generation & quality of results
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Variable electricity generation from wind and solar influences the design of a cost-efficient and reliable energy system. This paper presents a method that uses stochastic programming to represent variable renewable electricity generation in long-term energy system models, and demonstrates this on a Norwegian TIMES model. First, we derive hourly PV-and wind-generation data by modifying satellite-based data, based on a comparison with historical generation data. Second, the satellite-based dataset is transformed into a manageable set of scenarios that is used as an input to the stochastic energy-system model. This is done using six different scenario generation methods. Third, we solve the energy-system model with three of the scenario-generation methods and evaluate the quality of the corresponding model value by stability tests. We demonstrate that scenarios generated from the six methods have significantly different moment-based and Wasserstein distance error relative to the dataset. Further, the energy system model results show that the number of scenarios needed to achieve stability differs between the three used scenario generation methods. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Evaluations of MODIS and microwave based satellite evapotranspiration products under varied cloud conditions over East Asia forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is an important tool to retrieve terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET). Widely-used MOD16 ET product (MOD-ET) is a representative of Penman-Monteith method coupled with MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) optic observations. Although MOD-ET has been extensively evaluated over the world, its accuracy under various cloud conditions remains unevaluated. Combining MODIS-observed cloud cover (Frc) and in-situ measurements at sixteen forests sites in East Asia, we evaluated 8-day MOD-ET and its primary MODIS inputs (i.e. LAI, FPAR and albedo) from clear to cloudy sky. A new satellite microwave ET method based on microwave Emissivity Difference Vegetation Index (EDVI-ET) was also compared with MODET. Results showed that the accuracy of MOD-ET was highly variable under the changing Frc over the forests. The largest bias ( 10%, while slight increase of Frc (10%-30%) reduced the bias (10%-20%). Further increase of Frc ( 13%) under similar sky conditions. A higher Taylor score (0.84) for EDVI-ET was found under Frc of 4% than MOD-ET (0.66), while two ET had close scores ( 0.81) under other sky conditions. Further investigation found that MOD-ET over four tropical coastal forests contributed most to the bias, especially under least cloudy sky. A case study at a tropical forest showed that MODIS LAI/FPAR and surface albedo products were overestimated, which could directly cause the overestimation of canopy-scale conductance and the underestimation of net solar radiation in MOD-ET method, respectively. Analysis showed that the bias in MOD-ET was significantly related to the bias in MODIS LAI under various Frc, but it was weakly related to that in MODIS albedo, suggesting that LAI-based conductance might dominate the overestimation of MOD-ET. During a consecutive cloud cover period when fewer reliable MODIS pixels are available, slight increase of clouds partly reduced MODIS-observed signals of LAI/FPAR and increased those of albedo over the tropical forest, resulting in the lower bias in MOD-ET. More clouds reduced surface MODIS albedo and might increase the uncertainty in all-sky shortwave radiation from reanalysis data, which deteriorated MOD-ET accuracy under overcast sky. Our study highlighted the importance of cloud impacts on the satellite ET estimation.

TI  - Impacts of climate change on vegetation phenology and net primary productivity in arid Central Asia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is highly sensitive to climate changes in arid regions. The relationship between vegetation and climate changes can be effectively characterized by vegetation phenology. However, few studies have examined the vegetation phenology and productivity changes in arid Central Asia (ACA). The vegetation phenological information of ACA was extracted using MODIS NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data, and the dynamics of vegetation phenological changes under spatiotemporal variations were quantitatively assessed. Moreover, the impacts of climate change on vegetation phenology and net primary productivity were analyzed by combining meteorological data with that of MODIS NPP (Net Primary Productivity) during the same period. The results demonstrated that the start of the season (SOS) of vegetation in the study was concentrated from mid-February to mid-April, while the end of the season (EOS) was concentrated from early October to mid-December. The length of growing season (LOS) ranged from 6 to 10 months. The SOS of vegetation was gradually postponed at a rate of 0.16 dmiddotyear-1. The EOS advanced at a rate of 0.69 dmiddotyear-1. The LOS was gradually shortened at a rate of 0.89 dmiddotyear-1. For each per 1000 m increase in elevation, the SOS of vegetation was postponed by 12.40 d; the EOS advanced by 0.40 d, and the LOS was shortened by 11.70 d. For the impacts of climate changes on vegetation phenology and NPP, the SOS of vegetation phenology negatively correlated with temperature but positively correlated with precipitation and NPP. The EOS and LOS positively correlated with temperature but negatively with precipitation and NPP. Results indicated that the SOS was not moved ahead but was delayed, while the EOS advanced rather than being postponed under climate change. These results can offer new insights on the phenological response to climate change in arid regions and on non-systematic changes in phenology under global warming. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Multiple nonlinear regression model of cutting force for C/SiC composites by laser-assisted micromachining
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the response surface methodology (RSM), laser-assisted micromachining (LAMM) experiments of carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide matrix(C/SiC) composites have been carried out to obtain the data of three-direction cutting forces Fx, Fy, Fz, and result-force F in the cutting process. A stepwise regression method is used to screen out the factors that significantly affected the cutting force, and hence a multivariate nonlinear mathematical regression model has been established. Through the analysis of variance and regression analysis, the R2 of the regression model is the cutting force Fx: 0.975, the cutting force Fy: 0.970, the cutting force Fz: 0.972, the resultant force F: 0.987, and the probability p > F-values are all less than 0.001. The model analysis results show that the main effects and interactions of the three factors of laser power, cutting speed, and cutting depth significantly influence the cutting force. The main effect of the most considerable influence on the resultant F is cutting depth, followed by cutting speed and laser power, and the interactive effect is cutting speed and cutting depth. The experimental results show that the model prediction results are in good agreement with the experimental results.

TI  - Unsupervised GRNN flood mapping approach combined with uncertainty analysis using bi-temporal Sentinel-2 MSI imageries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods occur frequently worldwide. The timely, accurate mapping of the flooded areas is an important task. Therefore, an unsupervised approach is proposed for automated flooded area mapping from bi-temporal Sentinel-2 multispectral images in this paper. First, spatial-spectral features of the images before and after the flood are extracted to construct the change magnitude image (CMI). Then, the certain flood pixels and non-flood pixels are obtained by performing uncertainty analysis on the CMI, which are considered reliable classification samples. Next, Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) is used as the core classifier to generate the initial flood map. Finally, an easy-to-implement two-stage post-processing is proposed to reduce the mapping error of the initial flood map, and generate the final flood map. Different from other methods based on machine learning, GRNN is used as the classifier, but the proposed approach is automated and unsupervised because it uses samples automatically generated in uncertainty analysis for model training. Results of comparative experiments in the three sub-regions of the Poyang Lake Basin demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. Moreover, its superiority in dealing with uncertain pixels is further proven by comparing the classification accuracy of different methods on uncertain pixels.

TI  - Water clarity response to climate warming and wetting of the Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Plateau: A remote sensing approach
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity (generally quantified as the Secchi disk depth: SDD) is a key variable for assessing environmental changes in lakes. Using remote sensing we calculated and elucidated the SDD dynamics in lakes in the Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Lake Zone (IMXL) from 1986 to 2018 in response to variations in temperature, rainfall, lake area, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and Palmer's drought severity index (PDSI). The results showed that the lakes with high SDD values are primarily located in the Xinjiang region at longitudes of 75 degrees- 93 degrees E. In contrast, the lakes in Inner Mongolia at longitudes of 93 degrees-118 degrees E generally have low SDD values. In total, 205 lakes show significant increasing SDD trends (P < 0.05), with a mean rate of 0.15 m per decade. In con -trast, 75 lakes, most of which are located in Inner Mongolia, exhibited significant decreasing trends with a mean rate of 0.08 m per decade (P < 0.05). Pooled together, an overall increase is found with a mean rate of 0.14 m per decade. Multiple linear regression reveals that among the five variables selected to explain the variations in SDD, lake area accounts for the highest proportion of variance (25%), while temperature and rainfall account for 12% and 10%, respectively. In addition, rainfall accounts for 52% of the variation in humidity, 8% of the variation in lake area and 7% of the variation in NDVI. Temperature accounts for 27% of the variation in NDVI, 39% of the variation in lake area and 22% of the variation in PDSI. Warming and wetting conditions in IMXL thus promote the growth of vegetation and cause melting of glaciers and expansion of lake area, which eventually leads to improved water quality in the lakes in terms of higher SDD. In contrast, lakes facing more severe drought conditions, became more turbid. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of surface albedo over the Tibetan Plateau simulated by CMIP5 models using in-situ measurements and MODIS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo plays a key role in the energy and water cycles, and reasonable parameterizations of surface albedo will be greatly helpful to improve the simulation of radiation partition in climate models. In-situ measurements of albedo from five sites over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and MODIS albedo product are used to evaluate monthly, annual, and seasonal variations of the surface albedo simulated by 24 Global Climate Models (GCMs) archived by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Potential factors contributing to the bias of simulated albedo were investigated. The results show that the monthly albedo of 24 GCMs varied across models, and the difference among the models was smaller in the June-July-August period than the December-January-February period. The ensemble mean albedo of the 24 GCMs was more consistent with the in-situ measurements than the individual model. The albedo calculated from the BNU-ESM, GFDL-CM3, INM-CM4, MIROC4h, MIROC-ESM, and MIROC-ESM-CHEM models coincided with the observations from June to September, increasing rapidly to above 0.4 from November. However, the annual cycle of surface albedo was insignificant when simulated by some models, such as CanESM2, CSIRO-Mk3.6.0, CMCC-CMS, IPSL-CM5A-MR, and MPI-ESM-MR. Additionally, the surface albedo was overestimated by CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean-with a smaller amplitude of daily albedo-compared with the values estimated from in-situ observations and MCD43A3. In all 24 models, snow albedo parameterization schemes were found to variably fit the attenuation of snow albedo over time. The cold temperature, relatively more precipitation, fresh snow density, and albedo in these models led to large biases in snow depth and ablation. The surface albedo tends to increase without the influence of blowing snow and withered grass on the model's albedo.

TI  - Evaluating ecological outcomes from environmental stewardship initiatives: A comparative analysis of approaches
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the extent to which stewardship initiatives achieve objectives of enhanced ecological outcomes is important for enhancing effectiveness and efficiency of environmental management initiatives. Alternative approaches - community science, stakeholder perceptions, and remote sensing - are emerging in lieu of the conventional approach of collecting field data that present different benefits and drawbacks and to date have not been directly compared. This research compared the use of four approaches to evaluating ecological outcomes of a grassland restoration project on a 2 ha Niagara Parks Commission property in Ontario, Canada. We collected three levels of quantitative data, from general site assessments to species-specific data using standardized questionnaires and multi-spectral imagery from a remotely piloted aircraft system. We found that community scientists and stakeholders provided comparable general site assessments to the field data, but that as the assessments became more detailed, differences emerged. Further, remotely sensed data were assessed and provided a more positive site assessment than any other method. Experiences and knowledge of nature did not influence assessments by community scientists or stakeholders. Our findings show that for overall site assessments, community scientists and stakeholders may be able to provide a reasonably accurate assessment. If monitoring and evaluation needs (either research-based or practical) extend beyond a broad assessment, use of a field expert or multiple methods of data collection may be warranted.

TI  - Assessing Biases and Climate Implications of the Diurnal Precipitation Cycle in Climate Models
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The diurnal cycle is a common benchmark for evaluating the performance of weather and climate models on short timescales. For decades, capturing the timing of peak precipitation during the day has remained a challenge for climate models. In this study, the phase and amplitude of the diurnal precipitation cycle in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) models are compared to satellite data. While some improvements align CMIP6 models closer to satellite observations, significant biases in the timing of peak precipitation remain, especially over land. Notably, precipitation over land in CMIP6 models still occurs similar to 5.4 h too early; the diurnal cycle amplitude is similar to 0.81 mm day(-1) too small over the oceans. Further, the diurnal phase of oceanic precipitation correlates weakly with the equilibrium climate sensitivity in CMIP6 models: models with a later precipitation peak over oceans tend to exhibit a higher climate sensitivity. However, it is unclear whether this relationship is robust.

TI  - Prioritization of Sub-Basins of Gomti River for Soil and Water Conservation Through Morphometric and LULC Analysis Using Remote Sensing and GIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Prioritization of river basin in semi-arid to sub-humid tropical region is important in the context of natural resources conservation and management. In this paper, the Gomti River basin was prioritized for soil-water resource conservation based on analysis of morphometric parameters and land use-land cover with RS and GIS techniques. Gomti River is a monsoon and groundwater-fed river; it is a tributary of Ganga River. The basin has been divided into seventeen sub-basins. ASTER (30 m) Digital Elevation Model data and LANDSAT-8 (30 m) satellite imagery were used to analyze the morphometric parameters and to generate land-use-land-cover data for the basin through supervised image classification technique. The linear, areal, and relief aspects of each sub-basins were determined. Morphometric analysis revealed that the basin is a fifth-order drainage system with a dendritic to sub-dendritic drainage pattern. Drainage patterns indicate that sub-surface materials are homogeneous and lack structural control over topography. The circulatory ratio value indicates the basin is an elongated shape. Low values of morphometric parameters indicate good permeability, infiltration, and coarse drainage texture, low relief, and elongated shape indicated good groundwater potential in the basin. The final prioritization result shows that the sub-basin 12 is at the highest priority with the greatest shortage of groundwater potential, so immediate water conservation measures are needed. Contrary, sub-basin 3 is at low priority that indicates the highest groundwater potential. This study suggests the primary priority to improve the water resource management in semi-arid regions at the basin level.

TI  - Towards redressing inaccurate, offensive and inappropriate common bird names
T2  - IBIS
M3  - Article
AB  - English common names are widely used in ornithological research, birding, media and by the general public and, unlike other taxa, often receive considerably greater use than scientific names. Across the world, many of these names were coined from 18th and 19th century European perspectives and are symbolic of a time when this was the only worldview considered in science. Here, we highlight formal efforts by ornithological societies around the world to change common names of birds to better reflect the diverse perspectives of scientists in the 21st century. We focus on particular case studies from regions with a history of colonialism, including South Africa and North America, as well as the successful implementation of Indigenous bird names in New Zealand. In addition to detailing independent and repeated efforts by different ornithological communities to address culturally inappropriate English common names, we discuss dissention and debate in North America regarding these changes. The continued use of problematic common names must change if we wish to create a more diverse and inclusive discipline.

TI  - Accuracy and error cause analysis, and recommendations for usage of Himawari-8 aerosol products over Asia and Oceania
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himawari-8 aerosol algorithm was updated to version 3 (V30). However, no study has evaluated its performance. The purpose of this study is to verify and to compare version 2.1 (V21) and V30 aerosol products, to explain which factor dominates the aerosol optical depth (AOD) error, and to provide recommendations for aerosol product usage. The AOD accuracy of V30 was better than that of V21, with a higher correlation coefficient (R) and a higher expected error (EE_DT). The V30 AOD metrics (including R, EE_DT, and the root mean square error) exceeded those of V21 on more than 69% of the AERONET sites and its bias from MODIS AOD was smaller than that of V21 AOD. However, the V30 AOD does not meet the metric of EE_DT > 0.66. The analysis results suggest that aerosol type parameters (primarily the Angstrom exponent (AE)) may be the dominant factor determining the AOD error. This reveals the direction of H8 algorithm improvement. More than 59% of the H8 AE value meets the expected error but they do not capture the variety (R < 0.3). The FMF and SSA retrieved by H8 performed poorly. The V30 AOD performs best in Japan and South Korea (83.3% of AERONET sites meet the EE_DT > 0.66 requirement) and has better data accuracy in the morning. Therefore, we recommend V30 AOD morning data to users in Japan and South Korea regions. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A comprehensive transferability evaluation of U-Net and ResU-Net for landslide detection from Sentinel-2 data (case study areas from Taiwan, China, and Japan)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquakes and heavy rainfalls are the two leading causes of landslides around the world. Since they often occur across large areas, landslide detection requires rapid and reliable automatic detection approaches. Currently, deep learning (DL) approaches, especially different convolutional neural network and fully convolutional network (FCN) algorithms, are reliably achieving cutting-edge accuracies in automatic landslide detection. However, these successful applications of various DL approaches have thus far been based on very high resolution satellite images (e.g., GeoEye and WorldView), making it easier to achieve such high detection performances. In this study, we use freely available Sentinel-2 data and ALOS digital elevation model to investigate the application of two well-known FCN algorithms, namely the U-Net and residual U-Net (or so-called ResU-Net), for landslide detection. To our knowledge, this is the first application of FCN for landslide detection only from freely available data. We adapt the algorithms to the specific aim of landslide detection, then train and test with data from three different case study areas located in Western Taitung County (Taiwan), Shuzheng Valley (China), and Eastern Iburi (Japan). We characterize three different window size sample patches to train the algorithms. Our results also contain a comprehensive transferability assessment achieved through different training and testing scenarios in the three case studies. The highest f1-score value of 73.32% was obtained by ResU-Net, trained with a dataset from Japan, and tested on China's holdout testing area using the sample patch size of 64x64 pixels.

TI  - Molecular Imaging, How Close to Clinical Precision Medicine in Lung, Brain, Prostate and Breast Cancers
T2  - MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Precision medicine is playing a pivotal role in strategies of cancer therapy. Unlike conventional one-size-fits-all chemotherapy or radiotherapy modalities, precision medicine could customize an individual treatment plan for cancer patients to acquire superior efficacy, while minimizing side effects. Precision medicine in cancer therapy relies on precise and timely tumor biological information. Traditional tissue biopsies, however, are often inadequate in meeting this requirement due to cancer heterogeneity, poor tolerance, and invasiveness. Molecular imaging could detect tumor biology characterization in a noninvasive and visual manner, and provide information about therapeutic targets, treatment response, and pharmacodynamic evaluation. This summates to significant value in guiding cancer precision medicine in aspects of patient screening, treatment monitoring, and estimating prognoses. Although growing clinical evidences support the further application of molecular imaging in precision medicine of cancer, some challenges remain. In this review, we briefly summarize and discuss representative clinical trials of molecular imaging in improving precision medicine of cancer patients, aiming to provide useful references for facilitating further clinical translation of molecular imaging to precision medicine of cancers.

TI  - Toward monitoring forest ecosystem integrity within the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Signatory countries to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) are formulating goals and indicators through 2050 under the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). Among the goals is increasing the integrity of ecosystems. The CBD is now seeking input toward a quantifiable definition of integrity and methods to track it globally. Here, we offer a schema for using Earth observations (EO) to monitor and evaluate global forest ecosystem integrity (EI). Our approach builds on three topics: the concept of EI, the use of satellite-based EO, and the use of "essential biodiversity variables" to monitor and report on it. Within this schema, EI is a measure of the structure, function, and composition of an ecosystem relative to the range of variation determined by climatic-geophysical environment. We use evaluation criteria to recommend eight potential indicators of EI that can be monitored around the globe using Earth Observations to support the efforts of nations to monitor and report progress to implement the post-2020 GBF. If operationalized, this schema should help Parties to the CBD take action and report progress on achieving ecosystem commitments during this decade.

TI  - Very high resolution aboveground carbon mapping in subtropical thicket
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground carbon (AGC) maps will assist with the monitoring and verification of carbon stored through restoration of subtropical thicket. Field methods are required to capture AGC ground truth data at the plot scale, but they are highly impractical for large area mapping of carbon stocks. Against this background, a remote sensing method to estimate AGC from very high spatial resolution multi-spectral imagery was developed. AGC ground truth was acquired for 85 plots in a small study area in the Baviaanskloof, South Africa. Using the ground truth, univariate and multivariate snapshot models were developed to predict AGC from features in a 2017 WorldView-3 (0.34-m resolution 8-band) satellite image. Informative features were selected from a large set of spectral, textural, and vegetation index features using stepwise forward selection. Using this approach, the multivariate model produced a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.886 and root mean square error of 2.862 t Cha(-1). This study demonstrates the efficacy of regression approaches for estimating AGC from multi-spectral imagery and provides a foundation for the spatial and temporal extension of AGC remote sensing in the thicket biome.

TI  - Multi-channel Imager Algorithm (MIA): A novel cloud-top phase classification algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The current Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-16 and 17) cloud-top phase classification algorithm is based primarily on empirical thresholds at multiple wavelengths that have varying absorption capabilities for water and ice. The performance of current GOES-16 cloud-top phase product largely depends on the accuracy of the selection of reflectance ratios. This study aims at presenting a novel cloud-top phase classification algorithm (the Multi-channel Imager Algorithm, MIA) that provides a more judicious selection of relationships between channels using a supervised K-mean clustering method on multi-channel Red-Green-Blue images. The Kmean clustering method works analogously to how human eyes separate different colors in a microphysical color rendering set of satellite images, which differentiates water, ice and unclassified thin clouds. For water phase, cloud-top temperature information is used to further distinguish supercooled water. To evaluate the performance of the MIA, an extensive comparison with Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, and current GOES-16 cloud-top phase products is conducted, using CALIOP as the benchmark. Compared to the current GOES-16 cloud-top phase product, MIA demonstrates a substantial improvement in phase classification, where hit rate increases from 69% to 76% over the Continental United States and 58% to 66% over the full disk domain.

TI  - Long-term trend of heat waves and potential effects on phytoplankton blooms in Lake Qiandaohu, a key drinking water reservoir
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is increasing the frequency and duration of heat waves, which is defined as when air temperature exceeds a threshold for more than specific consecutive days. Ecosystem around the globe will be impaired by heat waves just like the exposures to dangerously high temperatures as a public health threat to human. However, the knowledge of the response of lake and reservoir ecosystem to heat waves is largely unknown although it has been argued that climate warming may increase the incidence of harmful algal blooms. We examined the long-term trend of heat waves and how the variability of phytoplankton biomass responds to lake heat waves on a deep reservoir (Lake Qiandaohu). Long-term (1980-2020) meteorological observation in the lake watershed showed a significant warming trend of 0.36 degrees C per decade for the yearly average of daily average air temperature and the yearly average of daily maximum air temperature of 18.32 degrees C was observed in 2016. Meanwhile, a significant increasing number of heat wave events lasting longer was observed, and Lake Qiandaohu suffered an unusually severe lake heat wave in summer 2016. Significant correlations were found between the yearly average of daily maximum air temperature and heat days, heat wave events, and heat wave days. Nuisance phytoplankton bloom was found in Lake Qiandaohu by high frequency observation and remote sensing monitoring in summer 2016. Remote sensing estimation from two Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images showed that the average chlorophyll a (Chla) was 7.45 +/- 4.89 mu g/L on July 18 before heat wave and 18.96 +/- 0.98 mu g/L on August 19 during the heat wave. Two heat wave events lasting from July 20 to August 2 and August 11 to 26 with average surface water temperature of 29.93 and 31.99 degrees C promoted two marked phytoplankton blooms with average Chla concentrations of 11.75 +/- 4.08 and 10.53 +/- 1.65 mu g/L in the central lake region, respectively, as evidenced by high-frequency buoy data. These findings suggest that heat waves are likely to yield an increased threat of harmful algal bloom in freshwater ecosystems. With lake heat waves projected to increase in frequency, duration, and spatial extent with global climate change, more studies are needed to improve our understanding of lake heat waves and their potential effects on the species, communities, frequency of phytoplankton bloom, and also help providing advanced schemes of water quality management.

TI  - District-level HIV estimates using the spectrum model in five states of India, 2017
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Decentralized response has been the hallmark of the National AIDS Control Programme in India. District-level HIV burden estimates quantifying the distribution of the epidemics are needed to enhance this decentralized response further to monitor the progress on prevention, testing, and treatment interventions. In this paper, we describe the methodology and results of district-level estimates using the Spectrum model piloted in 5 states of India under National AIDS Control Programme. Using state spectrum model for HIV estimations 2017, we disaggregated state results by the district in pilot states. Each district was considered a subepidemic and HIV epidemic configuration was carried out in its general population as well as in key population. We used HIV surveillance data from antenatal clinics and routine pregnant women testing to model the general population's epidemic curve. We used HIV prevalence data available from HIV sentinel surveillance and integrated biological and behavioral surveys to inform the epidemic curve for key population. Estimation and projection packgage classic platform was used for the curve fitting. District-wide estimates extracted from subpopulation summary in Spectrum results section were used to calculate relative burden for each district and applied to approved State HIV Estimations 2017 estimates. No district in Tamil Nadu had an adult HIV prevalence of higher than 0.5% except for one, and the epidemic seems to be declining. In Maharashtra, the epidemic has shown a decline, with all except 5 districts showing an adult prevalence of less than 0.50%. In Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, few districts showed rising HIV prevalence. However, none had an adult prevalence of higher than 0.50%. In Mizoram, 6 of 8 districts showed a rising HIV trend with an adult prevalence of 1% or more in 5 districts. Disaggregation of state-level estimates by districts provided insights on epidemic diversity within the analyzed states. It also provided baseline evidence to measure the progress toward the goal of end of AIDS by 2030.

TI  - Analysis of environmental factors affecting the large-scale long-term sequence of green tide outbreaks in the Yellow Sea
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Green tide outbreaks in the southern Yellow Sea have become an ecological disaster. To further understand the conditions of large-scale green tide outbreaks, this study examines the relationship between the expansion of green tides and environmental factors from 2007 to 2020. Using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, the semi-automatic extraction of green tide information using multi-source satellite data was achieved for the first time. The normalized difference vegetation index threshold was determined manually according to the water environment and visual interpretation, and the automatic extraction of green tide information was realized based on GEE programming. The influences of the initial phase coverage area and growth rate of green tide algae on green tide outbreaks during 2007-2020 were explored. In addition, the sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity, and precipitation (PRCP) during green tide outbreaks were systematically analyzed, and the influence of the combined effect of environmental factors on green tide outbreaks was also determined. The results showed that the initial scale of a green tide had no necessary influence on the outbreak scale; green tides were more likely to occur on a large scale if they were observed earlier in the initial phase, if the SST was lower, and if PRCP was timely and abundant. These findings are useful for further understanding the rules of green tide outbreaks, analyzing their outbreak conditions, and preventing and controlling green tide disasters.

TI  - A baseline evaluation of oceanographic and sea ice conditions in the Hudson Bay Complex during 2016-2018
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we examine sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice conditions in the Hudson Bay Complex as a baseline evaluation for the BaySys 2016-2018 field program time frame. Investigated in particular are spatiotemporal patterns in SST and sea ice state and dynamics, with rankings of the latter to highlight extreme conditions relative to the examined 1981-2010 climatology. Results from this study show that SSTs in northwestern Hudson Bay from May to July, 2016-2018, are high relative to the climatology for SST (1982-2010). SSTs are also warmer in 2016 and 2017 than in 2018 relative to their climatology. Similarly, unusually low sea ice cover existed from August to December of 2016 and July to September of 2017, while unusually high sea ice cover existed in January, February, and October of 2018. The ice-free season was approximately 20 days longer in 2016 than in 2018. Unusually high ice-drift speeds occurred in April of 2016 and 2017 and in May of 2018, coinciding with strong winds in 2016 and 2018 and following strong winds in March 2017. Strong meridional circulation was observed in spring of 2016 and winter of 2017, while weak meridional circulation existed in 2018. In a case study of an extreme event, a blizzard from 7 to 9 March 2017, evaluated using Lagrangian dispersion statistics, is shown to have suppressed sea ice deformation off the coast of Churchill. These results are relevant to describing and planning for possible future pathways and scenarios under continued climate change and river regulation.

TI  - Domestic abuse and intimate partner violence: the role of digital by design
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADULT PROTECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Domestic abuse or intimate partner violence is a term that describes a pattern of abusive behaviours, often experienced concurrently and linked to gender-based violence. This study aims to explore through the literature the potential to design effective digital services that work for victims, survivors and those who provide domestic abuse support services. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a systems or service design thinking methodology which was adopted during a Scottish Government-funded Technology Enabled Care (TEC) pathfinder project on domestic abuse. This methodology is the basis for the Scottish Approach to Service Design which is based on the Design Council Double Diamond. During the first phase, known as the discovery phase, desk-based research is conducted by the service design team to inform their approach to the later phases (the second half of the first diamond is define whilst design and deliver form the second diamond). Time is spent during discovery to unpack the complexity whilst the approach takes a pragmatic worldview. Findings Technology has yet to be shown to provide an effective solution to any aspect of the victim or survivors' experience or support services albeit these are often over-stretched and under-funded even without the Covid-19 pandemic. Digital abuse is increasing with perpetrators adapting new technologies. Digital developments should be grounded on ethical design principles. Research limitations/implications This study is the result of the desk-based research during a TEC project considering the potential role of technology in tackling domestic abuse. Limitations include only including evidence from the literature; interviews were conducted but are not reported here. Another limitation is the pragmatic rather than academic nature of the approach; it was to be a foundation for service re-design. So hopefully useful for new practitioners to immerse themselves in the topic area but with no claims to be reproducible as would be the case in a formal review. Practical implications All the evidence shows the authors need to keep trying different approaches, different forms of engagement and ways to empower survivors. Could technology support health-care practitioners to consistently use sensitive routine enquiry? Perhaps enable independent domestic violence advisors to attend more multidisciplinary team meetings in local community settings? Meanwhile, digital abuse is increasing with perpetrators adapting new technologies. Technology has not yet provided a digital solution which is practical and meets the needs of the broad intersectional population affected by domestic abuse nor those who provide support. If the future is to be based on digital developments it must be grounded on ethical design principles. Originality/value This desk-based review collates the current national and international policy and research literature whilst focusing on digital developments which support those affected by domestic abuse.

TI  - Regulation of healthcare and medical imaging in Australia: A narrative review of the evolution, function and impact on professional behaviours
T2  - RADIOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: This review explores the literature about the status and influence of statutory regulation in healthcare with a focus on medical imaging. It summarises the status of regulation in Australia for radiographers and sonographers, with brief reference to the global situation. The role of regulation is explored in terms of its evolution, function and effect on professional behaviours.Key findings: Reports of medical errors, sentinel events and professional misconduct in healthcare have raised concern about how health care professionals are regulated. Patient-centric healthcare delivery has changed how people interact with healthcare, contributing to the development of statutory regulation for many healthcare professions.In Australia, the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (The National Law) 2009, established the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme (NRAS) in order to practice. Not all health care professions are included in the scheme. In medical imaging, radiographers are included but sonographers are a notable exception.Regulation is designed to positively influence practitioners' professional behaviours. The available evidence however is limited, but suggests that under certain circumstances, it can negatively impact practitioners' professional behaviours.Conclusion: Statutory regulation has been implemented to address serious issues highlighted in reports of medical errors and professional misconduct, but it may have unintended consequences on the professional behaviours of practitioners. Limited research means the relationship between statutory regulation of healthcare practitioners and its impact upon professional behaviours remains unclear.Implications for practice: If statutory regulation of healthcare professionals is to achieve its aim of protecting the public, it is imperative that we understand the impact that it has on professional behaviours. This review highlights that it can negatively impact professional behaviours which may be detrimental to patient's safety. (C) 2020 The College of Radiographers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A New Spatiotemporal Model for Analyzing the Variations of Urban Heat Islands Using Remotely Sensed Multi Spectral Images: The Case of Mashhad City, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) refer to areas of the earth's surface with higher temperatures than neighboring regions. The spread of this phenomenon varies according to spatial and temporal dimensions, and these variations are affected mainly by changes in land cover and heat emissions from human activities. Due to the high variations in the unit of time, the spatial continuity, and expansion of this phenomenon, remote sensing is a suitable tool for studying it. The purpose of this study is to present a fixed model with general thresholds for studying UHIs. Therefore, the fixed model was adjusted based on the features that exhibit similar behaviors to respond to the temporal and spatial variations of the urban heat and cool islands. To achieve this objective, one of the cities of Iran with high UHIs intensity and vastity was assigned as the study area. Therefore, the UHIs of Iranian cities were investigated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) production by applying the Getis-ord algorithm on the land surface temperature (LST) map obtained by the split-window method. Then, the UHIs of Mashhad were studied by applying clustering on the LST map of Landsat images. In this study, the UHIs of different seasons of 2018 for Mashhad were interpreted based on the LST, and the results showed that the UHIs show different behavior in different seasons in terms of location and intensity. Therefore, it is necessary to extract features that exhibit similar behavior for UHIs. Features or the emergence of UHIs were analyzed by statistical methods, principal component analysis (PCA), and regression. The results of the principal component analysis showed that the four indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Build-Up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) are useful features for studying UHIs. On the other hand, these features were suitable for presenting a fixed model for examining the UHIs of different seasons. The results of the fixed multivariate regression model with different thresholds had an average overall accuracy (OA) of 82.15% for different seasons, and the results for the fixed model with fixed thresholds had an average overall accuracy of 83.54% for summer and winter and 59.1% for spring and autumn.

Landscape ecology is strongly influenced by remote sensing, and the value of fine resolution temporal information for characterising landscapes is under-explored. Objectives We highlighted the importance of temporal information extracted from remote sensing data gathered over a period of time for landscape research. A case study approach was used to show how time-series information can benefit the mapping of land cover and landscape elements in a heterogeneous landscape dominated by agricultural land use. Methods We constructed four composite images of the study area, each incorporating different levels of temporal information. The images either represent a single date or summarise temporal information into single values as the median of spectral bands or vegetation indices. Random forest and k-means clustering methods were used to classify the images. Results The overall accuracy of the landscape classifications ranged between 0.3 to 0.8, increasing substantially when including temporal information, for mapping both land cover and small landscape elements. Using temporal information and a RF-based classification it was generally possible to map crop and forest types. The size of landscape elements was overestimated, although the clustering model predicted elements close to their true size and complexity. Conclusions The approach highlights the importance of temporal resolution for landscape ecology research. The easy-to-implement methodology offers an opportunity for landscape ecologists to increase the accuracy of landscape mapping and identify ecologically important landscape elements that might otherwise be missed.

TI  - Analyzing Assessment Practices for Indigenous Students
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
M3  - Review
AB  - The purpose of this article is to review common assessment practices for Indigenous students. We start by presenting positionalities-our personal and professional background identities. Then we explain common terms associated with Indigeneity and Indigenous and Western worldviews. We describe the meaning of document analysis, the chosen qualitative research design, and we explicate the delimitations and limitations of the paper. The review of the literature revealed four main themes. First, assessment is subjugated by a Western worldview. Next, many linguistic assessment practices disadvantage Indigenous students, and language-specific and culture-laden standardized tests are often discriminatory. Last, there is a pervasive focus on cognitive assessment. We discuss how to improve assessment for Indigenous students. For example, school divisions and educators need quality professional development and knowledge about hands-on assessment, multiple intelligences, and Western versus Indigenous assessment inconsistencies. Within the past 20 years, assessment tactics for Indigenous students has remained, more or less, the same. We end with a short discussion addressing this point.

TI  - Changes in illicit drug use and markets with the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions: findings from the Ecstasy and Related Drugs Reporting System, 2016-20
T2  - ADDICTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims To describe (i) self-reported changes in drug use and (ii) trends in price, perceived availability, and perceived purity of illicit drugs, among people who regularly use ecstasy/ 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and other illicit stimulants in Australia following COVID-19 and associated restrictions. Design Annual interviews with cross-sectional sentinel samples conducted face-to-face in 2016-19 and via video conferencing or telephone in 2020. Data were collected via an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Setting Australian capital cities. Participants Australians aged 16 years or older who used ecstasy/MDMA and other illicit stimulants on a monthly or more frequent basis and resided in a capital city, recruited via social media and word-of-mouth (n similar to 800 each year). Measurements Key outcome measures were self-reported illicit drug market indicators (price, purity and availability) and, in 2020 only, perceived change in drug use (including alcohol and tobacco) since March 2020 and reasons for this change. Findings For most drugs, participants reported either no change or a reduction in their use since COVID-19 restrictions were introduced. Ecstasy/MDMA was the drug most frequently cited as reduced in use (n = 552, 70% of those reporting recent use), mainly due to reduced opportunities for socialization. While market indicators were largely stable across most drugs, the odds of perceiving MDMA capsules as 'high' in purity decreased compared with 2016-19 [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53-0.99], as did perceiving them as 'easy' to obtain (aOR = 0.42, CI = 0.26-0.67). The odds of perceiving cocaine and methamphetamine crystal as 'easy' to obtain also decreased (aOR = 0.67, CI = 0.46-0.96 and aOR = 0.12, CI = 0.04-0.41, respectively). Conclusions After COVID-19-related restrictions were introduced in Australia, use of ecstasy/MDMA, related stimulants and other licit and illicit drugs mainly appeared to remain stable or decrease, primarily due to impediments to socialization.

TI  - Optimum machine learning algorithm selection for forecasting vegetation indices: MODIS NDVI & EVI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation as a key environmental indicator both influences and is influenced by other factors. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) are quantitative measurements of vegetation that follow a monthly trend. Machine learning algorithms are now widely used to forecast several environmental indicators, including vegetation indices. In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectror-adiometer (MODIS) dataset MOD13A2.006 (2001-2018) was used to extract NDVI and EVI values. These quantitative values were used to forecast vegetation indices for 2019 and scored on their performance. Four supervised machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Linear & Polynomial Regression were tested. The models forecasted data with 5.73%-1.51% error in NDVI and 6.99%-4.33% error in EVI. However, sudden loss and sudden gain in NDVI or EVI midyear could not be forecasted with these four algorithms in some cases. There was an observed upwards linear trend in the data suggesting increasing vegetation cover.

TI  - Drawing ethical mentation in Islamic banks; addressing operational lines heterogeneity with special reference to Al-Ghazali's ethical philosophy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - This study aims to examine the decision-making behaviour of Islamic banking practitioners of the United Arab Emirates with special reference to the operational line heterogeneity by employing factors that are religious in nature such as intellect, satanic force and divine knowledge as encapsulated in al-Ghazali's ethical philosophy.Design/methodology/approach - A total of 337 samples were collected from the Islamic banking practitioners in the United Arab Emirates using a purposive sampling technique, and the empirical analysis was conducted with the measures of model fit and bootstrapping technique using Partial least square Structural equation modelling and multi-group analysis.Findings - The empirical findings reveal that the dedicated use of intellect in making decisions related to ethical issues where desires and emotions tend to overwhelm reason and human choices. While divine knowledge is found ineffective guidance of the intellect, the element of satanic force is found significantly impacting decision-making. As the lack of religious consciousness is evident among respondents, higher exposure to operational risk is expected. These findings were found identical across the Islamic banking practitioners in different lines of operations.Research limitations/implications - The span of the study is limited to a single country. Future studies are recommended to replicate the study to more markets where the share of Islamic finance is significant.Practical implications - Findings of the study highly suggest respective authorities of Islamic financial institutions to intensify the capacity-building programs on the foundation of faith which includes Islamic thought and worldview, to enhance the corporate ethical decision-making. Moreover, equal importance should be given to all the banking practitioners regardless of line of business operations.Originality/value - With undue emphasis is given to the juristic (fiqh) aspects of Shariah compliance in the Islamic banking and finance industry, less has been attempted to explore its ethical dimension (akhlaq) in the compliance parameters that leave a relatively large gap to address prevailing unethical practices in Islamic finance institutions. Findings from this study can be useful as a warning to the Islamic banking firms to enhance the sense of God-fearing and improve existing measures in the organisation in mitigating operational risks that may arise from people or system and consequently ensure the smooth governance of the Islamic banks.

TI  - Regolith LANDSAT-8/OLI and Hyperion/EO-1 images classification in midwest of Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The orbital LANDSAT-8/OLI sensor and SRTM altimetric images combined with Boolean algebra and complemented by fieldwork and XRD, chemical and spectroradiometric analysis, allowed to develop a mathematical model for mapping the tropical regolith in the Midwest of Brazil. It was used four mapping classes following the arithmetic band operations of 4/2 and (4+6)/5 to identify lateritic duricrusts, loosed iron concretions, nodules and pisoliths, (6/7)/(5/4) to parent rock, saprolite, mottled horizon and soil, and (5-4)/(5+4) to vegetation. Hyperspectral Hyperion/EO-1 image endorse the mathematical model identifying the pure pixels of kaolinite, goethite, and hematite in the lateritic duricrusts, loosed iron concretions, nodules and pisoliths occurrence pixels. Narrow and low reflectance spectroscopy concavity between 400 and 600 nm and a broad medium concavity between 800 and 1100 nm are the typical spectral features of the study lateritic duricrusts, highlighting the strong influence of the goethite and hematite contents. The development of these LANDSAT-8/OLI and Hyperion/EO-1 classification models and the identification of the specific reflectance spectroscopy features for the tropical lateritic terrains, provide a more precise regolithgeological architecture. It is very helpful for mineral exploration, for developed strategies for understanding the regolith landscape better and how surficial geochemical anomalies are formed, and for geomorphology interpretation in deeply weathered regions.

TI  - MODIS PRI performance to track Light Use Efficiency of a Mediterranean coniferous forest: Determinants, restrictions and the role of LUE range
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) and Light Use Efficiency (LUE) is well established at leaf and small canopy scales, but upscaling to ecosystem level is still a challenge. Only few studies have applied satellite-derived PRI to estimate LUE, mostly using MODIS, and although the results are promising, many external factors have been identified affecting PRI performance. The present study investigates determinants and restrictions of MODIS-derived PRI potential to follow the LUE variability of a Mediterranean coniferous forest.Daily and half-hour LUE values were calculated from eddy covariance measurements, dividing GPP by either Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) or the absorbed fraction of PAR (APAR). Also, various PRI datasets were created based on different sensor (Terra, Aqua, Both), reference band (1, 12, 13) and observation/illumination angles. Overall, PRI correlated better with LUE calculated using PAR instead of APAR and Aqua PRI yielded better results than Terra. Restricting acquisitions according to observation/illumination angles improves the PRI:LUE relationship (maximum R-2 = 0.512), with backscatter observations yielding the best correlations. Our findings suggest that MODIS-derived PRI is more sensitive to relatively large seasonal LUE changes, but is unable to closely follow severe drought events. Among the tested reference bands, the best results were derived using band 12 (546 - 556 nm), although the optimum reference band seems to depend on viewing conditions. The PRI:LUE relationship was further improved when half-hour LUE of the satellite overpass was used instead of daily LUE. However, it was found that the PRI:LUE relationships for the different datasets were strongly affected by the range of LUE values corresponding to each PRI group, with lower LUE variability resulting to weaker PRI:LUE correlations. LUE range effect should be accounted for in future studies, when different PRI datasets are compared and might explain the contradicting findings in the existing literature.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity modeling of water quality based on random forest regression and model interpretation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A systematic understanding of the spatial distribution of water quality is critical for successful watershed management; however, the limited number of physical monitoring stations has restricted the evaluation of spatial water quality distribution and the identification of features impacting the water quality. To fill this gap, we developed a modeling process that employed the random forest regression (RFR) to model the water quality distribution for the Taihu Lake basin in Zhejiang Province, China, and adopted the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the underlying driving forces. We first used RFR to model three water quality parameters: permanganate index (CODMn), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN), based on 16 watershed features. We then applied the built models to generate water quality distribution maps for the basin, with the CODMn ranging from 1.39 to 6.40 mg/L, TP from 0.02 to 0.23 mg/L, and TN from 1.43 to 4.27 mg/L. These maps showed generally consistent patterns among the CODMn, TN, and TP with minor differences in the spatial distribution. The SHAP analysis showed that the TN was mainly affected by agricultural non-point sources, while the CODMn and TP were affected by agricultural and domestic sources. Due to differences in sewage collection and treatment between urban and rural areas, the water quality in highly populated urban areas was better than that in rural areas, which led to an unexpected positive relationship between water quality and population density. Overall, with the RFR models and SHAP interpretation, we obtained a continuous distribution pattern of the water quality and identified its driving forces in the basin. These findings provided important information to assist water quality restoration projects.

TI  - Invasion, establishment, and spread of invasive mosquitoes from the <i>Culex coronator</i> complex in urban areas of Miami-Dade County, Florida
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Species from the Culex coronator complex are Neotropical species and potential vectors of Saint Louis and West Nile viruses. Culex coronator was first described in Trinidad and Tobago in the early twentieth century and since then it has invaded and has been reported established in most countries of the Americas. Species from the Culex coronator complex were first detected in the United States in the state of Louisiana in 2004 and were subsequently detected in Florida in 2005, reaching Miami-Dade County in 2008. We hypothesize that species from the Cx. coronator complex are adapting to urban environments in Miami-Dade County, Florida, and are becoming more present and abundant in these areas. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the patterns of the presence and abundance of species from the Cx. coronator complex in the urban areas of Miami-Dade County. Here we used weekly data comprised of 32 CDC traps from 2012 to 2020 and 150 BG-Sentinel traps from 2016 to 2020. A total of 34,146 female mosquitoes from the Cx. coronator complex were collected, 26,138 by CDC traps and 8008 by BG-Sentinel traps. While the number of CDC traps that were positive was relatively constant at 26-30 positive traps per year, the number of positive BG-Sentinel traps varied substantially from 50 to 87 positive traps per year. Furthermore, the heat map and logistic general linear model for repeated measures analyses showed a significant increase in both the distribution and abundance of mosquitoes from the Cx. coronator complex, indicating that these species are becoming more common in anthropized habitats being able to thrive in highly urbanized areas. The increase in the distribution and abundance of species from the Cx. coronator complex is a major public health concern. The ability of species from the Cx. coronator complex to benefit from urbanization highlights the need to better understand the mechanisms of how invasive vector mosquito species are adapting and exploiting urban habitats.

TI  - Institutions Treating Breast Cancer Patients of a Low Socioeconomic Status Achieve Multidisciplinary Quality Standards at Lower Rates
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The National Accreditation Program of Breast Centers (NAPBC) certifies institutions that provide quality breast care. Whereas low socioeconomic status (SES) has a negative impact on patient outcomes, it is unknown whether an institution's patient SES mix is associated with meeting NAPBC standards. Methods All institutions submitting at least 100 breast cancer patients to the National Cancer Database (2006-2017) were ranked based on the patients' insurance status, income, and education. The 10% treating the largest proportion of low-SES patients were termed low-SES institutions (LSES). Patient cohorts were created based on the 2018 NAPBC standards. Uni- and multivariate comparisons of patient, tumor, and treatment factors were made to calculate adjusted odds of meeting each standard between low- and non-low-SES institutions. Results The analysis included 1319 institutions. Both the LSES and non-LSES reached the benchmark rate of 50% lumpectomies (61.2 vs 62.9%; p < 0.001), but the unadjusted and adjusted rates of lumpectomy were lower in LSES. The rate for sentinel lymphadenectomy was lower for LSES (49.2 vs 53.7%; p < 0.001). Similarly, the unadjusted and adjusted rates of adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy were lower at LSES. Although the unadjusted rate of adjuvant radiation was higher at LSES, adjusted odds demonstrated that patients treated at LSES were less likely to undergo adjuvant radiation when appropriate. Conclusions Small but significant differences in achieving multidisciplinary standards for quality breast cancer care exist between LSES and non-LSES and may exacerbate disparities already faced by patients of low SES.

TI  - Rethinking the correction for absorbing aerosols in the OMI- and TROPOMI-like surface UV algorithms
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite estimates of surface UV irradiance have been available since 1978 from the TOMS UV spectrometer and have continued with significantly improved ground resolution using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI 2004-current) and Sentinel 5 Precursor (S5P 2017-current). The surface UV retrieval algorithm remains essentially the same: it first estimates the clear-sky UV irradiance based on measured ozone and then accounts for the attenuation by clouds and aerosols, applying two consecutive correction factors. When estimating the total aerosol effect in surface UV irradiance, there are two major classes of aerosols to be considered: (1) aerosols that only scatter UV radiation and (2) aerosols that both scatter and absorb UV radiation. The former effect is implicitly included in the measured effective Lambertian-equivalent scene reflectivity (LER), so the scattering aerosol influence is estimated through cloud correction factor. Aerosols that absorb UV radiation attenuate the surface UV radiation more strongly than non-absorbing aerosols of the same extinction optical depth. Moreover, since these aerosols also attenuate the outgoing satellite-measured radiance, the cloud correction factor that treats these aerosols as purely scattering underestimates their aerosol optical depth (AOD), causing underestimation of LER and overestimation of surface UV irradiance. Therefore, for correction of aerosol absorption, additional information is needed, such as a model-based monthly climatology of aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD). A correction for absorbing aerosols was proposed almost a decade ago and later implemented in the operational OMI and TROPOMI UV algorithms. In this study, however, we show that there is still room for improvement to better account for the solar zenith angle (SZA) dependence and nonlinearity in the absorbing aerosol attenuation, and as a result we propose an improved correction scheme. There are two main differences between the new proposed correction and the one that is currently operational in OMI and TROPOMI UV algorithms. First, the currently operational correction for absorbing aerosols is a function of AAOD only, while the new correction additionally takes the solar zenith angle dependence into account. Second, the second-order polynomial of the new correction takes the nonlinearity in the correction as a function of AAOD better into account, if compared to the currently operational one, and thus better describes the effect by absorbing aerosols over a larger range of AAOD. To illustrate the potential impact of the new correction in the global UV estimates, we applied the current and new proposed correction for global fields of AAOD from the aerosol climatology currently used in OMI UV algorithm, showing a typical differences of +/- 5 %. This new correction is easy to implement operationally using information of solar zenith angle and existing AAOD climatology.

TI  - Is ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of axillary lymph nodes a viable alternative to sentinel lymph node biopsy?
T2  - DIAGNOSTIC CYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Axillary lymph node (ALN) ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (US-FNAB), a minimally invasive procedure, may be used for the preoperative evaluation of ALN status of breast cancer patients. Despite the relative ease of use and low cost, paucity of comparative studies and variation in the reported sensitivity of FNAB preclude its clinical utility in evaluation of ALNs. This study aims to determine the accuracy of US-FNAB in detecting metastasis in ALN pre-operatively and to assess US-FNAB as a viable alternative to sentinel lymph node (SLN) excision. Methods The 228 consecutive ALN US-FNABs with subsequent histologic follow up performed from 2005 to 2020 in patients with breast carcinoma were retrospectively evaluated. FNAB results were correlated with histologic diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and risk of malignancy of FNAB were calculated. Results 157/228 (69%) FNABs were concordant with histology, 37/228 (16%) discordant. Positive FNAB findings correlated with primary tumor size, grade, number of metastatic lymph nodes and size of metastases. FNAB with negative diagnosis carried a 22% risk of malignancy, atypical 43%, suspicious 80%, and positive a 100% risk of malignancy (100% positive predictive value [PPV]). The sensitivity and specificity were 78% and 95% respectively; accuracy was 77%. SLN biopsy was avoided in all 82 (36%) cases with positive FNAB results. Conclusion Negative FNAB result does not exclude metastatic carcinoma. With 100% PPV, full ALN dissection and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be safely planned after a positive FNAB result, avoiding SLN biopsy, reducing management costs and shortening time interval to definitive therapy.

AB  - Introduction Breast cancer-related lymphedema occurs in up to 30% of women following axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and less commonly following sentinel lymph node biopsy. To quantify disability in these patients, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have proven useful; however, given the overlap of symptoms between ALND and lymphedema, examination of their accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in detecting lymphedema in breast cancer patients undergoing ALND is needed. Methods The Lymphedema Life Impact Scale (LLIS) and the Upper Limb Lymphedema 27 scale (ULL27) were administered to patients who had undergone ALND at least 2 years prior and either did or did not develop lymphedema. Survey responses and the degree of disability were compared to generate receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, and the sensitivity and specificity of PROMs to diagnose lymphedema were analyzed. Results Both PROMs were highly accurate, sensitive, and specific for detecting lymphedema. The LLIS had an accuracy of 97%, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 84.8% at a cutoff of >= 5.88 overall percent impairment score (higher scores indicate worse disability). The ULL27 had an accuracy of 93%, sensitivity of 88.6%, and specificity of 90.9% at a cutoff of <= 83.3 global score (lower scores indicate worse disability). Conclusions The LLIS and the ULL27 appear to be highly specific for lymphedema and capable of differentiating it from symptoms resulting from ALND alone. Our findings suggest that use of these questionnaires with a threshold may be effective for diagnosing lymphedema, potentially reducing the need for frequent clinic visits and time-consuming measurements.

TI  - Streamflow Prediction Upstream of a Dam Using SWAT and Assessment of the Impact of Land Use Spatial Resolution on Model Performance
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to examine the sensitivity of streamflow prediction of SWAT model to the spatial resolution of land use data. The land use quality impact was studied with a low-resolution global dataset (ESA-CCI with a 300-m resolution) and a refined dataset classified based on Sentinel-2 satellite images (20-m resolution). Two models were successfully built under ArcSWAT, and SWAT-CUP software, which were calibrated and validated after sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. The measured precipitation in the Bine El Ouidane dam watershed was used for model calibration and validation. Snowmelt parameters were first calibrated before analyzing the sensitivity of flow parameters and calibrating the most sensitive ones. The performance of the calibration and validation was very satisfactory for both models based on statistical coefficients and graphical evaluation in addition to parameter uncertainty of the 95 PPU band. The results revealed slightly higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, root mean square error and R-2 values for the SWAT-CCI model than those for the SWAT-Sentinel-2 model (in calibration, NSE was approximately 0.85 for the first model and 0.76 for the second model, whereas in validation, NSE was 0.70 and 0.61, respectively). This study demonstrated that the streamflow assessment accuracy obtained with the SWAT model was not enhanced when applying finer-spatial resolution land use data and that the accuracy was not directly related to the increase in the number of delineated hydrological response units (HRUs).

TI  - Gulf of Alaska ice-marginal lake area change over the Landsat record and potential physical controls
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes in contact with glacier margins can impact glacier evolution as well as the downstream biophysical systems, flood hazard, and water resources. Recent work suggests positive feedbacks between glacier wastage and ice-marginal lake evolution, although precise physical controls are not well understood. Here, we quantify ice-marginal lake area change in understudied northwestern North America from 1984-2018 and investigate climatic, topographic, and glaciological influences on lake area change. We delineate time series of sampled lake perimeters (n = 107 lakes) and find that regional lake area has increased 58% in aggregate, with individual proglacial lakes growing by 1.28 km(2) (125 %) and ice-dammed lakes shrinking by 0.04 km(2) (15 %) on average. A statistical investigation of climate reanalysis data suggests that changes in summer temperature and winter precipitation exert minimal direct influence on lake area change. Utilizing existing datasets of observed and modeled glacial characteristics, we find that large, wide glaciers with thick lake-adjacent ice are associated with the fastest rate of lake area change, particularly where they have been undergoing rapid mass loss in recent times. We observe a dichotomy in which large, low-elevation coastal proglacial lakes have changed most in absolute terms, while small, interior lakes at high elevation have changed most in relative terms. Generally, the fastest-changing lakes have not experienced the most dramatic temperature or precipitation change, nor are they associated with the highest rates of glacier mass loss. Our work suggests that, while climatic and glaciological factors must play some role in determining lake area change, the influence of a lake's specific geometry and topographic setting overrides these external controls.

TI  - Factors and Their Interaction Effects on the Distribution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the Yangtze River Delta Based on Grids
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial features of PM2.5 concentration in the Yangtze River Delta in 2016 were analyzed using remote sensing data. Selecting factors among meteorology, topography, vegetation, and emission list of air pollutants, factors and their interaction effects on the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentration were studied based on GAM, with an evaluation unit of 0.25 degrees x0.25 degrees for the grid. It showed that: (1) With a more significant difference between the north and south, PM2.5 concentration was generally higher in the north and west but lower in the south and east. In the southern part of the delta, the concentration was mostly lower than 35 mu g.m(-3), with noncompliance of the PM2.5 concentration scattered in urban areas like islands. Meanwhile, PM2.5 concentration is generally over 35 mu g.m(-3), and the pollution appeared like sheets. (2) Besides, PM2.5 concentration showed an apparent positive spatial autocorrelation with "High-High" PM2.5 agglomeration areas in the north of the delta and "Low-Low" PM2.5 agglomeration areas in the south. (3) Based on GAM, hypsography, temperature, and precipitation negatively affected PM2.5 concentration, whereas pollutant emissions positively affected it. The effect of wind was minor when its speed <2.5 m.s(-1), and more negatively significant when its speed >= 2.5 m.s(-1). Hypsography, temperature, and precipitation were higher in the southern part of the delta, but they were lower in the northern part, leading to a higher PM2.5 concentration in the northern parts and lower in the southern parts. A higher wind speed in the east and lower in the west also led to a concentration difference between them. (4) All factors had passed a significant pair interaction test, except for hypsography and PM2.5 emission, and they all showed a significant interaction effect on the distribution of PM2.5 in the Yangtze River Delta.

TI  - A comparative analysis of two unrelated outbreaks in Latvia and Australia of acquired idiopathic megaesophagus in dogs fed two brands of commercial dry dog foods: 398 cases (2014-2018)
T2  - JAVMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - CASE DESCRIPTIONIn Latvia in 2014, acquired idiopathic megaesophagus (AIME) was observed in increased numbers of dogs that consumed varieties of I brand of dog food. Within 2 years, 253 dogs were affected. In Australia in November 2017, 6 working dogs that consumed I diet of another brand of dog food developed AIME. In total, 145 Australian dogs were affected.CLINICAL FINDINGSAIME was diagnosed predominantly in large-breed male dogs (> 25 kg [55 lb]). Regurgitation, weight loss, and occasionally signs consistent with aspiration pneumonia (coughing, dyspnea, or fever) were noted. Most Latvian dogs had mild to severe peripheral polyneuropathies as evidenced by laryngeal paralysis, dysphonia, weakness, and histopathologic findings consistent with distal axonopathy. In Australian dogs, peripheral polyneuropathies were not identified, and histopathologic findings suggested that the innervation of the esophagus and pharynx was disrupted locally, although limited samples were available.TREATMENT AND OUTCOMEInvestigations in both countries included clinical, epidemiological, neuropathologic, and case-control studies. Strong associations between the dog foods and the presence of AIME were confirmed; however, toxicological analyses did not identify a root cause. In Latvia, the implicated dietary ingredients and formulations were unknown, whereas in Australia, extensive investigations were conducted into the food, its ingredients, the supply chain, and the manufacturing facilities, but a cause was not identified.

TI  - Experimental Demonstration of Nadir Echo Removal in SAR Using Waveform Diversity and Dual-Focus Postprocessing
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides high-resolution images for remote-sensing applications regardless of sunlight and weather conditions. The pulsed operation of SAR may lead to an occurrence of nadir echoes in SAR images that significantly affect the image quality in case the pulse repetition frequency (PRF), which is not properly constrained within the SAR system design. As an alternative, pulse-to-pulse variation of the transmitted waveform and dual-focus postprocessing can be exploited to remove the nadir echo and alleviate the PRF constraints (also in ScanSAR operation). This work provides a demonstration of the latter concept through an experimental acquisition of the TerraSAR-X satellite. The experiment is designed by selecting the scene and the acquisition parameters in order to have the nadir echo appearing in the SAR image. The waveform variation is achieved by alternating up- and down-chirps on transmit. The analysis of the results shows the effectiveness of dual-focus postprocessing for nadir echo suppression.

TI  - Research on remote sensing ecological environmental assessment method optimized by regional scale
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As the global ecosystem has been severely disturbed by an increasing number of human activities at different scales, remote sensing technology, as an effective quantitative measure of environmental quality, has been widely used. The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) is one of the most popular and comprehensive ecological quality assessment indices based on the remote sensing data. However, the RSEI model exhibits that the ecological environment under natural conditions is not limited by the spatial scales. In addition, the model has major shortcomings in index selection and eigenvector, which greatly limit the application of RSEI. In this paper, the RSEI model is improved and a remote sensing ecological index optimized by the regional scale (RO-RSEI) is proposed. The result of the study, conducted in Shuangyang District, Changchun City, Jilin Province, shows that the RO-RSEI model has regional ecological significance after the introduction of the scale theory of landscape ecology; the index is preferred to solve problems like the RSEI model applied mechanization and baseless index selection. Meanwhile, due to the optimization of the eigenvector contribution of the optimal index, it solves the problems like non-unique model calculation result caused by principal component analysis or even antipodal calculation result. Compared with the RSEI model, the monitoring result of RO-RSEI model can better reflect the regional ecological changes. The improved model offers the possibility of monitoring ecological environment quality with remote sensing big data and provides a scientific basis for future scholars' batch computing.

TI  - Evaluation of proximal sensing technologies for mapping bovine urine patches under grazing pastures
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Animal urine patches, particularly bovine, are the major source of gaseous and leaching losses of nitrogen (N) in livestock-grazed pastoral systems. One method of mitigating these losses is the application of N inhibitors to patches that slow down the N transformations, thus allowing more time for plant uptake. If inhibitors can be applied as spot-treatments, then the overall volume of chemical can be minimized without compromising inhibitor efficacy. To enable this, accurate and reliable methods of detecting patches within hours of deposition are required. In this study, we aimed to validate the output of the newly developed and modified instrument 'SpikeyR' for detecting and mapping urine patches via measurement of soil surface electrical conductivity with the aim of using these data for targeting in-situ spot treatment of detected patches. We compared measurements from Spikey-R against thermal imagery from a handheld camera taken during urine deposition, as well as imagery taken from a remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS or 'drone') 2 weeks after deposition. Wetted areas, as a result of urine application, across all sites were 0.2-0.3 m2 (1 L urine), 0.3-0.5 m2 (2 L), and 0.3-0.8 m2 (3 L). Spikey-R data generally compared well with the reference map produced from the thermal imagery, with slightly larger mean patch areas that still fell within the bounds of uncertainty. Repeat Spikey-R runs over the same patches showed no significant difference in detected areas up to 48 h after application. The drone was successful in detecting most urine patches 14 days post-application and identified a much larger pasture response (average > 150% larger again) than the initial wetted area with sizes ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 m2 (1 L), to 0.5 to 1.1 m2 (2 L), to 0.5 to 1.5 m2 (3 L). Spikey-R proved to be an effective tool in a research setting; advantages and disadvantages of each technology are discussed in detail.

TI  - Assessing the early impact of a hospital-based health technology assessment program, smart innovation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective We evaluated the early impact of a new hospital-based health technology assessment (HB-HTA) program, called Smart Innovation, at the University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC). Methods We compared the UWMC's utilization trends for two surgical procedures to control hospitals by evaluating the difference before and after adoption decisions: (i) a new filter for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures that treat aortic valve stenosis and (ii) microwave ablation (MWA) for treating hepatocellular carcinoma. We used descriptive statistics to assess the difference between the UWMC and controls for TAVR and MWA procedures and multivariate difference-in-differences (DID) analyses to test for statistical significance. Results The UWMC experienced a 10 percent reduction in TAVR procedures compared with controls following the implementation of the TAVR Sentinel filter. The DID regression model indicated a 1.5 reduction in the number of TAVR procedures per quarter at the UWMC between the pre- and post period, which was not statistically significant (p-value: .87). The UWMC experienced a 51 percent reduction in utilization when compared with controls for MWA procedures in the pre- and post periods. The DID model for MWA indicated an 18.8 decrease in utilization per quarter during the study period for the UWMC, which was statistically significant (p-value: .0007). For MWA procedures, the UWMC experienced a $647,658 dollar reduction in total costs in the post period compared with controls. Conclusions When the UWMC used HB-HTA methods for technology adoption, there was a reduction in utilization and total costs when compared with controls; however, when the UWMC adopted a new technology without using HB-HTA methods, there was no difference in utilization.

TI  - A novel partial ambiguity method for multi-GNSS real-time kinematic positioning
T2  - JOURNAL OF NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent progress in using real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning has motivated the exploration of its application due to its high accuracy and efficiency. However, poorly-observed satellite data will cause unfixed ambiguities and markedly biased solutions. A novel partial ambiguity resolution method, named the irrespective of integer ambiguity resolution (IIAR) model, is proposed and applied to improve the reliability of ambiguity resolution. The proposed method contains initial ambiguity resolution and irrespective of integer ambiguity processes. The initial ambiguity resolution process applies an iterative partial ambiguity resolution method to obtain an approximate solution. The irrespective of integer ambiguity process transforms the approximate solution to a high-precision solution. Experiments show that the approximate solution is unreliable when the initial ambiguity resolution process has small redundancy, and the proposed method can obtain better results for those cases. The IIAR method showed about a 40% improvement of multi-GNSS ambiguity success rate and about a 25% improvement of standard deviation. Therefore, these results show that the proposed IIAR method can improve the results of multi-GNSS RTK positioning significantly.

TI  - Estimating leaf area index using unmanned aerial vehicle data: shallow vs. deep machine learning algorithms
T2  - PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring leaf area index (LAI) is essential for evaluating crop growth and estimating yield, thereby facilitating high-throughput phenotyping of maize (Zea mays). LAI estimation models use multi-source data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), but using multimodal data to estimate maize LAI, and the effect of tassels and soil background, remain understudied. Our research aims to (1) determine how multimodal data contribute to LAI and propose a framework for estimating LAI based on remote-sensing data, (2) evaluate the robustness and adaptability of an LAI estimation model that uses multimodal data fusion and deep neural networks (DNNs) in single- and whole growth stages, and (3) explore how soil background and maize tasseling affect LAI estimation. To construct multimodal datasets, our UAV collected red-green-blue, multispectral, and thermal infrared images. We then developed partial least square regression (PLSR), support vector regression, and random forest regression models to estimate LAI. We also developed a deep learning model with three hidden layers. This multimodal data structure accurately estimated maize LAI. The DNN model provided the best estimate (coefficient of determination [R-2]=0.89, relative root mean square error [rRMSE]=12.92%) for a single growth period, and the PLSR model provided the best estimate (R-2=0.70, rRMSE=12.78%) for a whole growth period. Tassels reduced the accuracy of LAI estimation, but the soil background provided additional image feature information, improving accuracy. These results indicate that multimodal data fusion using low-cost UAVs and DNNs can accurately and reliably estimate LAI for crops, which is valuable for high-throughput phenotyping and high-spatial precision farmland management.

TI  - A comparative study of EOF and NMF analysis on downward trend of AOD over China from 2011 to 2019
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades China has experienced high-level PM2.5 pollution and then visible air quality improvement. To understand the air quality change from the perspective of aerosol optical depth (AOD), we adopted two statistical methods of Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to AOD retrieved by MODIS over China and surrounding areas. Results showed that EOF and NMF identified the important factors influencing AOD over China from different angles: natural dusts controlled the seasonal variation with contribution of 42.4%, and anthropogenic emissions have larger contribution to AOD magnitude. To better observe the interannual variation of different sources, we removed seasonal cycles from original data and conducted EOF analysis on AOD monthly anomalies. Results showed that aerosols from anthropogenic sources had the greatest contribution (27%) to AOD anomaly variation and took an obvious downward trend, and natural dust was the second largest contributor with contribution of 17%. In the areas surrounding China, the eastward aerosol transport due to prevailing westerlies in spring significantly influenced the AOD variation over West Pacific with the largest contribution of 21%, whereas the aerosol transport from BTH region in winter had relative greater impact on the AOD magnitude. After removing seasonal cycles, biomass burning in South Asia became the most important influencing factor on AOD anomalies with contribution of 10%, as its interannual variability was largely affected by El Nin similar to o. Aerosol transport from BTH was the second largest contributor with contribution of 8% and showed a decreasing trend. This study showed that the downward trend of AOD over China since 2011 was dominated by aerosols from anthropogenic sources, which in a way confirmed the effectiveness of air pollution control policies.

TI  - Satellite data for the offshore renewable energy sector: Synergies and innovation opportunities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Can satellite data be used to address challenges currently faced by the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) sector? What benefit can satellite observations bring to resource assessment and maintenance of ORE farms? Can satellite observations be used to assess the environmental impact of offshore renewables leading towards a more sustainable ORE sector? This review paper faces these questions presenting a holistic view of the current interactions between satellite and ORE sectors, and future needs to make this partnership grow. The aim of the work is to start the conversation between these sectors by establishing a common ground. We present offshore needs and satellite technology limitations, as well as potential opportunities and areas of growth. To better understand this, the reader is guided through the history, current developments, challenges and future of offshore wind, tidal and wave energy technologies. Then, an overview on satellite observations for ocean applications is given, covering types of instruments and how they are used to provide different metocean variables, satellite performance, and data processing and integration. Past, present and future satellite missions are also discussed. Finally, the paper focuses on innovation opportunities and the potential of synergies between the ORE and satellite sectors. Specifically, we pay attention to improvements that satellite observations could bring to standard measurement techniques: assessing uncertainty, wind, tidal and wave conditions forecast, as well as environmental monitoring from space.

TI  - Forecasting contrasting coastal and estuarine hydrodynamics with OPENCoastS
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Robust and accurate coastal forecasts require models to represent the relevant processes, prediction computational tools and reliable computational resources. OPENCoastS is a free, open-source WebGIS platform to develop on-demand hydrodynamic forecast systems that started as a simple 2D engine. OPENCoastS provides a visualization and download interface with in-situ and Sentinel satellite data comparison. 2D tidal, 2D wave & current interaction and 3D baroclinic flows are now included, forced by several atmospheric, oceanic and riverine forcings. Four applications demonstrate OPENCoastS' capacity. The prediction of the 2020 typhoon season in Taiwan illustrates the use of the service using only large-scale public data. An application to the Bay of Biscay shows the importance of waves on extreme water levels during storms. A nearshore deployment in Figueira da Foz harbor assesses the impact of bathymetry on coupled wave and current circulation. 3D baroclinic circulation forecasts in Tagus estuary are validated by independent data.

TI  - Effect of environmental covariable selection in the hydrological modeling using machine learning models to predict daily streamflow.
T2  - Journal of environmental management
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - There are different methods for predicting streamflow, and, recently machine learning has been widely used for this purpose. This technique uses a wide set of covariables in the prediction process that must undergo a selection to increase the precision and stability of the models. Thus, this work aimed to analyze the effect of covariable selection with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Forward Feature Selection (FFS) in the performance of machine learning models to predict daily streamflow. The study was carried out in the Piranga river basin, located in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The database consisted of an 18-year-old historical series (2000-2017) of streamflow data at the outlet of the basin and the covariables derived from the streamflow of affluent rivers, precipitation, land use and land cover, products from the MODIS sensors, and time. The highly correlated covariables were eliminated and the selection of covariables by the level of importance was carried out by the RFE and FFS methods for the Multivariate Adaptive Regression (EARTH), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and Random Forest (RF) models. The data were partitioned into two groups: 75% for training and 25% for validation. The models were run 50 times and had their performance evaluated by the Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), Determination coefficient (R2), and Root of Mean Square Error (RMSE). The three models tested showed satisfactory performance with both covariable selection methods, however, all of them proved to be inaccurate for predicting values associated with maximum streamflow events. The use of FFS, in most cases, improved the performance of the models and reduced the number of selected covariables. The use of machine learning to predict daily streamflow proved to be efficient and the use of FFS in the selection of covariables enhanced this efficiency.

TI  - The ethical implications of Goethe's approach to nature and Its potential role in teacher education
T2  - CULTURAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The myth of Psyche and Eros is startling in its relevance for the existential and ecological crises facing humanity today. Taking up the images therein, this article explores possible ways that science education can address the epistemological roots of environmental destruction, especially through the practice of Goethean observation. Calling on Levinas's concept of the face of the other, an ethics of responsibility is shown to be an inherent manifestation of an epistemological shift toward a conscious participation in and with nature that a Goethean approach engenders. If Psyche has become, to use Levinas's language, a stranger, a widow, and an orphan, via the modern scientific worldview, becoming aware of this worldview is an important part of science education and of teacher education programs. The article closes by identifying the preconditions that are necessary for a new ethical relationship with nature and considers contributions from the field of contemplative inquiry that can support this relationship in teacher education.

TI  - A Linkage Between Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Meteorological Drought over the Eastern Gangetic Plain of India
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The meteorological drought is a recurring phenomenon for Bihar, a densely populated Indian state situated on the Eastern Gangetic Plain (EGP). Drought largely affects a wide population of the state since most people residing here predominantly depend on agriculture for livelihood. The linkage between Aerosol and Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) or southwest monsoon rainfall is a complex process affecting the hydrological cycle, which in turn may cause meteorological drought over the study area. Therefore, the relation between the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI); a metric for categorising drought intensity, and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) are examined from 2000 to 2019. The high resolution (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) gridded rainfall data (2000-2019) of India Meteorological Department (IMD) and AOD data (2000-2019) at a resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees at 550 nm from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) products are analysed. To understand the role of the aerosol on rainfall and to further investigate the influence on underlying cloud properties as a probable cause of meteorological drought, MODIS-derived cloud parameters namely, Cloud Top Temperature (CTT), Cloud Top Pressure (CTP), and Cloud Fraction (CF) at the resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees for the period of 2000-2019 have been examined. A strong inverse relationship between CTT/CTP and SPI whereas as a directly positive relationship between CTT/CTP and AOD is found thus a strong correlation between SPI and AOD is also well verified by cloud parameters. A possible linkage between aerosols and drought conditions through indirect and semi direct effects of aerosol cloud interactions was also found to be quite important for Bihar & EGP.

TI  - Self-adaptive bandwidth eigenvector spatial filtering model for estimating PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in the Yangtze River Delta region of China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 concentrations are commonly estimated using geographically weighted regression (GWR) models, but these models may suffer from multi-collinearity and over-focus on local feature problems. To overcome these shortcomings, a self-adaptive bandwidth eigenvector spatial filtering (SA-ESF) model utilizing the golden section search (GO-ESF) and genetic algorithm (GA-ESF) was proposed. The SA-ESF model was applied to estimate ground PM2.5 concentrations in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China both seasonally and annually from December 2015 to November 2016 using remotely sensing data, factory locations, and road networks. The results of the original eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF), GO-ESF, GA-ESF, and GWR models show that the GA-ESF model offers better performance and exhibits a better average adjusted R-2 which is 26.6%, 15.3%, and 10.8% higher than for the ESF, GO-ESF, and GWR models, respectively. We next calculated stochastic site indicators that can describe characteristics of regional concentration from interpolated concentration maps derived from the GA-ESF and GWR models. The concentration maps and stochastic site indicators point to major differences in the PM2.5 concentrations in mountainous areas. There are notably high concentrations in those areas using the GWR model, in contrast with the GA-ESF results, indicating that there may be overfitting problems using the GWR model. Overall, the proposed SA-ESF model with the genetic algorithm technique can capture both global and local features and achieve promising results.

TI  - Role of Land Use Changes on Ammonia Emissions from Agricultural Ecosystems in the Yangtze River Delta Region from 2000 to 2018
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on Landsat satellite remote sensing images, this study interprets land use changes in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region from 2000 to 2018. Combined with changes in nitrogen fertilizer application, the changes in ammonia emissions from farmland ecosystem due changes in land use and nitrogen fertilizer application were further investigated. The results show that along with the rapid urbanization process, the area of cultivated land in the YRD region has gradually decreased from 276 269 km(2) (49% of total land area) in 2000 to 244 001 km(2) (44%) in 2018. The effects of changes in land use and nitrogen fertilizer application on ammonia emissions from farmland ecosystems mainly include emissions from soil background and nitrogen fertilizer application. From 2000 to 2018, ammonia emissions due to the application of nitrogen fertilizer decreased from 690 kt.a(-1) to 541 kt.a(-1) (relative decrease by 22%), while the ammonia emissions from the soil background reduced from 32 kt.a(-1) to 29 kt.a(-1) (decrease by 9%). During the past 20 years, urbanization in the YRD region has accelerated, and the area of cultivated land and the total amount of nitrogen fertilizer application have significantly reduced, thus resulting in reductions in ammonia emissions from the farmland ecosystem.

TI  - Reconstructing Missing Information of Remote Sensing Data Contaminated by Large and Thick Clouds Based on an Improved Multitemporal Dictionary Learning Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of clouds and cloud shadows has limited the applications of optical remote sensing data. Currently, most cloud removal methods are focused on reconstructing remote sensing data contaminated by small or thin clouds. This study proposes an improved method based on multitemporal dictionary learning to reconstruct missing information of remote sensing data contaminated by large and thick clouds. First, the contaminated target image is initialized using all available adjacent cloud-free reference images. Second, reconstructed images from each of the reference images are produced using dictionary learning and sparse representation methods. Then, weights are determined for the abovementioned reconstructed images based on their reconstruction errors over uncontaminated regions and are used to generate the preliminary reconstruction result. Finally, an error correction step for the contaminated regions is applied to the preliminary result, which is then combined with the original uncontaminated pixels to produce the final reconstruction result. The proposed method was evaluated on simulated clouds/cloud shadows based on remote sensing data with various sizes and land cover types. Visual and quantitative analyses of the reconstruction results show that the proposed method outperformed the generally used geostatistical neighborhood similar pixel interpolator (GNSPI) and nonnegative matrix factorization and error correction (S-NMF-EC) methods. Therefore, the results indicated that the proposed method was capable of accurately and effectively reconstructing data contaminated by large and thick clouds.

TI  - Towards interpreting multi-temporal deep learning models in crop mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal deep learning approaches have exhibited excellent classification performance in large-scale crop mapping. These approaches efficiently and automatically transform remote sensing time series into highdimensional feature representations to identify crop types. The lack of interpretation, however, is regarded as a major drawback of these high-performance approaches. Interpreting deep learning approaches in multitemporal crop mapping is critical for verifying their reliability. This study aims to quantify the impact of multi-temporal information in input time series on classification performance and develop a multi-perspective interpretation pipeline for deep learning models. The pipeline involves three interpretation approaches: evaluating input feature importance, analyzing hidden features, and monitoring temporal changes in model's soft output. An experiment is conducted to classify corn and soybean in the U.S corn belt in 2018. The study area consists of three sites each encompassing millions of pixel-level samples at 30 m resolution. The Landsat Analysis Ready Data are used as the input remote sensing time series and Cropland Data Layer is used as the ground reference. Attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (AtLSTM) and Transformer models are built as multitemporal deep learning models, and compared to Random Forest (RF). Complete time series input in the correct order achieves a higher overall accuracy of 97.8% than using single-window or out-of-order inputs, indicating multi-temporal information facilitates crop classification. An assessment of the input feature importance demonstrates that the AtLSTM, Transformer, and RF models all consider the period from weeks 11 to 20 (earlyJuly to late-August) as a key growth period and the shortwave infrared band as the critical band for corn and soybean discrimination. Hidden feature analysis suggests that the AtLSTM model accumulates the useful information over the growth period, while the Transformer model extracts the temporal dependencies that contribute important information to high-level feature learning. The learned features contain more effective and refined information than the raw input features and thus are better suited for crop classification. The soft output analysis in the in-season classification scenario demonstrates that increased length of input time series improves the model's confidence in the classification results. The further comparison of input feature importance in different sites and years demonstrates the applicability of the interpretation approach at larger spatiotemporal extents with heterogeneous landscapes and interannual variability. This study provides a multi-perspective evaluation to identify key features in multi-spectral and multi-temporal remote sensing data, and yields a practical approach to integrate agronomy knowledge in deep learning-based crop mapping.

TI  - Remote Estimation of Sea Surface Nitrate in the California Current System From Satellite Ocean Color Measurements
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface nitrate (SSN) is an important parameter to characterize physical and biogeochemical processes, particularly to quantify oceanic new primary production, yet its remote estimation from satellite has been difficult due to the complex relationships between environmental variables and SSN. In the central and southern sections of the California Current System (CSCCS), this challenge is attempted through modeling, validation, and extensive tests in different oceanic scenarios. Specifically, using extensive SSN datasets collected by many cruises spanning 40 years (1978-2018) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) estimated sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chl), a stacking random forest (SRF) model of SSN has been developed and validated with a spatial resolution of similar to 4 km. The model showed an overall performance of root mean square difference (RMSD) = 0.83 mu mol/kg, with coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.87, mean bias = -0.11 mu mol/kg, and mean ratio = 1.15 for SSN ranging between 0.05 and 19.90 mu mol/kg (N = 1034). Furthermore, tests of the model with its original parameterization for the upwelling period, oceanic period, and winter period all showed satisfactory performance with an overall RMSD of 1.95 mu mol/kg. The sensitivity of the SRF model to uncertainties of MODIS SST and Chl was examined, with induced uncertainties of <= 2.22 mu mol/kg. The extensive evaluation and sensitivity tests indicated the robustness of the SRF model in estimating SSN in the study area of the CSCCS, and it could serve as a robust approach for other regions once sufficient in situ SSN data are available for model calibration.

TI  - Oriented Gaussian Function-Based Box Boundary-Aware Vectors for Oriented Ship Detection in Multiresolution SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important remote sensing means, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has many superiorities to other sensors. How to effectively detect and locate ships in SAR images is also a popular field. In previous ship detection research, most algorithms focus on detecting the horizontal bounding box of ship targets, which ignore the rotation angle of each ships. Thus, too much background noise in the horizontal detection results makes them difficult to describe each ship accurately. Inspired by the powerful feature representation ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a novel anchor-free and keypoint-based deep learning method is proposed for oriented ship detection in multiresolution SAR images. Our detector first extracts multilevel features from the input SAR image with a backbone network and feature pyramid network. Next, considering multiscale ships in multiresolution SAR images, we detect different sizes of ships on different levels of feature maps with identical head network structures. In each head network, the classification subnetwork determines each pixel in feature maps as the central pixel of this ship or not, and the regression subnetwork regresses the oriented bounding box for each ship. In the training process, the proposed oriented nonnormalized Gaussian function is used to describe the center point of ship targets, while the nonuniform weighting of the different level loss functions is used to suppress the imbalanced sample distribution. Experimental results on two authoritative SAR-oriented ship detection datasets and two Gaofen-3 images demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods.

TI  - Variation of intra-daily instantaneous FAPAR estimated from the geostationary Himawari-8 AHI data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) quantifies the efficiency of light absorption by vegetation. The intra-daily variation in FAPAR is important for monitoring vegetation growth but current studies to estimate the intra-daily FAPAR from remote sensing are limited. This study proposes to estimate the intra-daily variations of the direct, diffuse, and total FAPARs on clear days from the geostationary Himawari-8 AHI data. A look-up table inversion method was developed based on simulations of a radiative transfer model that couples a soil reflectance (GSV, General Spectral Vectors), canopy (PROSAIL), and atmospheric models (6SV, Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum). Field measurements were conducted over paddy rice fields in Northeast China from June 22 to August 25, 2019, to obtain continuous FAPAR measurements using an AccuPAR ceptometer and digital hemispherical photography. The instantaneous FAPAR values were analyzed and evaluated with field measurements and MODIS and GEOV2 FAPAR products. The results show that the retrieved AHI FAPAR values are consistent with the field measurements (R-2 > 0.75). The AHI, MODIS, and GEOV2 FAPAR values display similar spatial and temporal patterns over the growing season (R-2 > 0.66). The intra-daily variations in the total and direct FAPAR values agree with the field measurements, and both show a "bowl-shaped" pattern with the smallest value found at noon. The diffuse FAPAR remains stable before 16:00 local solar time (LST). The instantaneous total and direct FAPAR values at 10:00 - 10:30 LST usually assumed to be daily values underestimate the daily values, while the values at 9:30 and 14:30 LST can better represent the daily FAPAR. As a future study, global intra-daily instantaneous and daily FAPAR products could be generated by combining all geostationary satellite data.

TI  - A knowledge-based, validated classifier for the identification of aliphatic and aromatic plastics by WorldView-3 satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the C-H chains of petroleum derivatives display unique absorption features in the short-wave infrared (SWIR), it is a challenge to identify plastics on terrestrial surfaces. The diverse reflectance spectra caused by chemically varying polymer types and their different kinds of brightness and transparencies, which are, moreover, influenced further by the respective surface backgrounds. This paper investigates the capability of WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite data, characterized by a high spatial resolution and equipped with eight distinct and relatively narrow SWIR bands suitable for global monitoring of different types of plastic materials. To meet the objective, hyperspectral measurements and simulations were conducted in the laboratory and by aircraft campaigns, based on the JPL-ECOSTRESS, USGS, and inhouse hyperspectral libraries, all of which are convolved to the spectral response functions of the WV-3 system. Experiments further supported the analyses wherein different plastic materials were placed on different backgrounds, and scaled percentages of plastics per pixel were modeled to determine the minimum detectable fractions. To determine the detectability of plastics with various chemical and physical properties and different fractions against diverse backgrounds, a knowledge-based classifier was developed, the routines of which are based on diagnostic spectral features in the SWIR range. The classifier shows outstanding results on various background scenarios for lab experimental imagery as well as for airborne data and it is further able to mask non-plastic materials. Three clusters of plastic materials can clearly be identified, based on spectra and imagery: The first cluster identifies aliphatic compounds, comprising polyethylene (PE), polyvinylchloride (PVC), ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVAC), polypropylene (PP), polyoxymethylene (POM), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and polyamide (PA). The second and third clusters are diagnostic for aromatic hydrocarbons, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC), and styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN), respectively separated from polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and polyurethane (PU). The robustness of the classifier is examined on the basis of simulated spectra derived from our HySimCaR model, which has been developed inhouse. The model simulates radiation transfer by using virtual 3D scenarios and ray tracing, hence, enables the analysis of the influence of various factors, such as material brightness, transparency, and fractional coverage as well as different background materials. We validated our results by laboratory and simulated datasets and by tests using airborne data recorded at four distinct sites with different surface characteristics. The results of the classifier were further compared to results produced by another signature-based method, the spectral angle mapper (SAM) and a commonly used technique, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Finally, we applied and successfully tested the classifier on WV-3 imagery of sites known for a high abundance of plastics in Almeria (Spain), Cairo (Egypt), and Accra, (Ghana, West Africa). Both airborne and WV-3 data were atmospherically corrected and transferred to "at-surface reflectances". The results prove the combination of WV-3 data and the newly designed classifier to be an efficient and reliable approach to globally monitor and identify three clusters of plastic materials at various fractions on different backgrounds.

TI  - Correlation between outcome and extent of residual disease in the sentinel node after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in clinically fine-needle proven node-positive breast cancer patients
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Whether the extent of residual disease in the sentinel lymph node (SLN) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) influences the prognosis in clinically node-positive breast cancer (BC) patients remains to be ascertained.Methods: One hundred and thirty-four consecutive cNthorn/BC-patients received NAC followed by SLN biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection. Cumulative incidence of overall (OS) and disease-free (DFS) survival, BC-related recurrences and death from BC were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method both in the whole patient population and according to the SLN status. The log rank test was used for comparisons between groups.Results: The SLN was identified in 123/134 (91.8%) patients and was positive in 98/123 (79.7%) patients. Sixty-five of them (66.3%) had other axillary nodes involved. SLN sensitivity and false-negative rate were 88.0% and 2.0%, Median follow-up was 10.2 years. Ten-year cumulative incidence of axillary, breast and distant recurrences, and death from BC were 6.5%, 11.9%, 33.4% and 31.3%, respectively. Ten-year OS and DFS were 67.3% and 55.9%. When stratified by SLN status, 10-year cumulative incidence of BC-related and loco-regional events, and death from BC were similar between disease-free SLN and micrometastatic SLN subgroups (28.9% vs 30.2%, p = 0.954; 21.6% vs 13.4%, p = 0.840; 12.9 vs 24.5%, p=0.494). Likewise, 10year OS and DFS were comparable (80.0% vs 75.5%, p=0.975 and 68.0% vs 69.8, p=0.836). Both OS and DFS were lower in patients presenting a macrometastatic SLN (60.2% and 47.5%).Conclusion: Outcome of patients with micrometastatic SLN was similar to that of patients with diseasefree SLN, which was more favorable as compared to that of patients with macrometastatic SLN.

TI  - Surgical complications occurring during minimally invasive sentinel lymph node detection in endometrial cancer patients. A systematic review of the literature and metanalysis
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecological cancer. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) technique has been adopted worldwide and showed lower morbidity and superimposable survival outcomes than the systematic lymphadenectomy (LND). Although these encouraging results, no meta-analyzes were performed on surgical complications during SLN research among patients undergoing laparoscopic (L) versus robotic surgery (R). The present review aims to report surgical complications during laparoscopic versus robotic SLN technique.Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) and the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines have been followed for the present meta- analysis.Results: Six studies, including 769 participants, were included. L-LND resulted in a significantly higher risk of operative complications relative to L-SLN (RR 2.10 [95% CI 1.37 to 3.21]). The risk of complications was comparable between R-SLN and L-SLN (RR 2.32 [95% CI 0.04-121.02]) and between R-LND and L-LND (RR 2.17 [95% CI 0.04-126.69]). According to the SUCRA analysis, L-SLN and R-SLN had the highest chances of being ranked first among proposed surgical procedures (SUCRA 48.9% and 28.4% respectively).Conclusions: Our study reported a lower surgical complications rate in patients undergoing L-SLN technique compared to L-LND. A lower rate of surgical complications was also reported for the R-SLN technique compared to the R-LND. Both laparoscopic and robotic SLN surgical techniques were found to be safe surgical procedures.

TI  - Seasonal changes in GPP/SIF ratios and their climatic determinants across the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been increasingly used for estimating gross primary production (GPP). However, the relationship between SIF and GPP has not been well defined, impeding the translation of satellite observed SIF to GPP. Previous studies have generally assumed a linear relationship between SIF and GPP at daily and longer time scales, but support for this assumption is lacking. Here, we used the GPP/SIF ratio to investigate seasonal variations in the relationship between SIF and GPP over the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Based on multiple SIF products and MODIS and FLUXCOM GPP data, we found strong seasonal hump-shaped patterns for the GPP/SIF ratio over northern latitudes, with higher values in the summer than in the spring or autumn. This hump-shaped GPP/SIF seasonal variation was confirmed by examining different SIF products and was evident for most vegetation types except evergreen broadleaf forests. The seasonal amplitude of the GPP/SIF ratio decreased from the boreal/arctic region to drylands and the tropics. For most of the NH, the lowest GPP/SIF values occurred in October or September, while the maximum GPP/SIF values were evident in June and July. The most pronounced seasonal amplitude of GPP/SIF occurred in intermediate temperature and precipitation ranges. GPP/SIF was positively related to temperature in the early and late parts of the growing season, but not during the peak growing months. These shifting relationships between temperature and GPP/SIF across different months appeared to play a key role in the seasonal dynamics of GPP/SIF. Several mechanisms may explain the patterns we observed, and future research encompassing a broad range of climate and vegetation settings is needed to improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal relationships between SIF and GPP. Nonetheless, the strong seasonal variation in GPP/SIF we identified highlights the importance of incorporating this behavior into SIF-based GPP estimations.

TI  - Detecting and mapping mature, medium, and young age date palms in the arid lands of Abu Dhabi, using hierarchical integrated approach (HIA)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of the current study was to map dispersed date palm (DP) plantations in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi/United Arab Emirates (UAE), at different age stages: young (<5 years), medium (5-10 years), and mature (>= 10 years), using multi-source/multi-sensor data in hierarchical integrated approach (HIA) developed and implemented for the purpose of this study. We initially succeeded in delineating and mapping "mature" DP plantations with acceptable accuracy using Landsat-8 OLI data. However, at this stage, our approach failed to depict "young" and "medium" DP with such level of accuracy, because of inadequate sensor resolution at such level of detail. Consequently, an object-based classification (OBC) approach was implemented using sub-meter WorldView-2 (WV-2) imagery, to depict and map medium and young aged palms in targeted DP plantations. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was integrated to convert from raster to vector formats, allowing for manual editing of certain young DP polygons hence, increasing the accuracy of their delineation. The outcomes of the implemented approach were the creation of detailed and accurate maps of DP at the three age stages, for the first time in the region. The produced maps were validated using existing ancillary data and field checks. The overall accuracies for young, medium, and mature DP plantations were 86.8%, 88% and 90.7%, respectively; while for mixed-ages DP the value reached up to 94.5%, with an Overall Kappa Statistic estimated at 0.888.

TI  - First Surgical National Consensus Conference of the Italian Breast Surgeons association (ANISC) on breast cancer management in neoadjuvant setting: Results and summary
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: On October 15th, 2020, the first Surgical National Consensus Conference on neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) was promoted by the Italian Association of Breast Surgeons (ANISC).Method: The Consensus Conference was entirely held online due to anti-Covid-19 restrictions and after an introductory four lectures held by national and international experts in the field, a total of nine questions were presented and a digital "real-time" voting system was obtained. A consensus was reached if 75% or more of all panelists agreed on a given question.Results: A total of 202 physicians, from 76 different Italian Breast Centers homogeneously distributed throughout the Italian country, participated to the Conference. Most participants were surgeons (75%). Consensus was reached for seven out of the nine considered topics, including management of margins and lymph nodes at surgery, and there was good correspondence between the 32 "Expert Panelists" and the "Participants" to the Conference. Consensus was not achieved regarding the indications to NACT for high-grade luminal-like breast tumors, and the need to perform an axillary lymph node dissection in case of micrometastases in the sentinel lymph node after NACT.Conclusions: NACT is a topic of major interest among surgeons, and there is need to develop shared guidelines. While a Consensus was obtained for most issues presented at this Conference, controversies still exist regarding indications to NACT in luminal B-like tumors and management of lymph node micrometastases. There is need for clinical studies and analysis of large databases to improve our knowledge on this subject.

TI  - Mapping potential wildlife habitats around Haro Abba Diko controlled hunting area, Western Ethiopia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing and geographic information system technologies provide useful data to analyze and map potential wildlife habitats based on physical parameters collected from the field. HADCHA was established with a total area of 20,000 ha, while many more comparable potential wildlife habitats were left outside the area. This study aims to identify and map potential wildlife habitats around HADCHA. Data were collected using Landsat 5 thematic mapper and Sentinel-2A satellite image, a digital elevation model with 30 m pixels downloaded from ASTER data, and existing GIS Shapefile layers. Thematic Mapper data were downloaded from USGS and processed with Erdas Imagine 2015 software. To evaluate potential wildlife habitat around HADCHA, habitat suitability parameters such as settlement, slope, water, and road buffer zones were used for habitat evaluation and mapping. Accordingly, 16,795 ha of potential wildlife habitats were identified and mapped on westwards of HADCHA. In the new PPWH, about 476.68 ha (2.84%) were moderately suitable, 14,119.17 ha (84.04%) suitable and 2,200.08 ha (13.10%) highly suitable but only 4.2 ha (0.02%) identified as unsuitable. Legal protection of the PPWH around HADCHA could increase the conservation of African buffalo, other mammals, and their habitats. While the mapped potential wildlife habitats had the potential to be parts of HADCHA, it was neglected and has not yet obtained conservation attention. The finding appeals for legal protection of the PPWH and expansion of HADCHA, which could maximize the conservation efforts taken to wild animals of the area. Neglecting this potential wildlife habitat for a long period of time exposed African buffalo and other largesized mammals to illegal hunting practices. Policymakers and conservationists shall revise and design the future action plan of HADCHA on how to expand the current-controlled hunting area and maximize revenue generation from African buffalo and other potential trophy species of the area.

TI  - Multiview Graph Convolutional Hashing for Multisource Remote Sensing Image Retrieval
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, hashing has been successfully applied for large-scale remote sensing image retrieval (LSRSIR) due to its advantage in terms of computation and storage. In LSRSIR, existing hashing methods mainly focus on single-source remotely sensed data. They cannot effectively fuse multisource remotely sensed data, which has a large potential for LSRSIR. To fulfill this gap, this letter proposes a novel deep hashing method, dubbed Multiview Graph Convolutional Hashing (MGCH) that can successfully fuse multisource remote sensing image. Since graph convolutional network (GCN) has been applied as an effective means that expresses and integrates relationships into features, MGCH applies a GCN to explore inherent structural similarity among multiview data, which will help to generate discriminative hash codes. An asymmetric scheme is developed that optimizes the proposed deep model in an end-to-end manner to improve training efficiency. We evaluate the proposed method by fusing two different kinds of RS images, i.e., multispectral (MUL) image and panchromatic (PAN) image. The experimental results on the dual-source RS image data set (DSRSID) show that the proposed MGCH outperforms state-of-the-art multiview hashing methods.

TI  - CocoNet: a hybrid machine learning framework for coconut farm identification and its cyclonic damage assessment on bitemporal SAR images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coconut tree is an important cash crop in coastal tropical regions. These trees undergo substantial damage during annual cyclones. Early and effective assessment of damage is important to farmers for appropriate monetary compensation. However, the identification of coconut trees presents multiple challenges: (i) the trees are with other vegetation and (ii) cloud cover during monsoons and cyclones precludes using simple imaging techniques. Although automated approaches based on classical machine learning techniques have been attempted for other crops on remote sensed images, these are not adequate for identifying coconut trees from different land cover. We present a hybrid approach termed CocoNet that combines (i) unsupervised K-means for pixel-based coarse classification of land cover and (ii) a patch- based convolutional neural network for fine classification of vegetation to identify coconut farms. The challenge presented by cloud cover is addressed using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Change detection is then performed on bitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR images taken before and after a cyclone to obtain the change map depicting the damage caused. Experimental results show that the proposed two-phase CocoNet model gives a classification accuracy of 92.5% and a change detection accuracy of 89.1%.

TI  - Optically Enhanced Super-Resolution of Sea Surface Temperature Using Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) can be measured from space using infrared sensors on Earth-observing satellites. However, the tradeoff between spatial resolution and swath size (and hence revisit time) means that SST products derived from remote sensing measurements commonly only have a moderate resolution (>1 km). In this article, we adapt the design of a super-resolution neural network architecture [specifically very deep super-resolution (VDSR)] to enhance the resolution of both top-of-atmosphere thermal images of sea regions and bottom-of-atmosphere SST images by a factor of 5. When tested on an unseen dataset, the trained neural network yields thermal images that have an RMSE 2-3x smaller than interpolation, with a 6-9 dB improvement in PSNR. A major contribution of the proposed neural network architecture is that it fuses optical and thermal images to propagate the high-resolution information present in the optical image to the restored thermal image. To illustrate the potential benefits of using super-resolution (SR) in the context of oceanography, we present super-resolved SST images of a gyre and an ocean front, revealing details and features otherwise poorly resolved by moderate resolution satellite images.

TI  - Tracking the dynamics of paddy rice cultivation practice through MODIS time series and PhenoRice algorithm
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring paddy rice cultivation is essential for ensuring food security and for land resource management in agrarian countries of South Asia. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal variation of rice cultivated area and phenological metrics in Nepal between 2003 and 2018 using the time series MODIS data and PhenoRice algorithm. Comparisons of PhenoRice outputs with ancillary data show that implementation of PhenoRice with the MODIS data can be used for long-term change analysis of rice cultivation. Results on spatial distribution illustrate: rice cultivation is concentrated in the low elevation belt in the south; the cultivation begins earlier in the western region compared to the eastern region and begins earlier in the hilly region compared to the plains. The inter-annual trend analysis found a statistically significant decrease of rice cultivated area at the rate of 19.13 thousand hectares per year during the recent decade; the loss of rice fields was more prominent in the eastern plains while rice farming expanded in the mid-hills in the western region. Our study provides insights regarding timely and cost-efficient monitoring of rice farming at a large scale in the mountainous region.

TI  - Land surface modeling over the Dry Chaco: the impact of model structures, and soil, vegetation and land cover parameters
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we tested the impact of a revised set of soil, vegetation and land cover parameters on the performance of three different state-of-the-art land surface models (LSMs) within the NASA Land Information System (LIS). The impact of this revision was tested over the South American Dry Chaco, an ecoregion characterized by deforestation and forest degradation since the 1980s. Most large-scale LSMs may lack the ability to correctly represent the ongoing deforestation processes in this region, because most LSMs use climatological vegetation indices and static land cover information. The default LIS parameters were revised with (i) improved soil parameters, (ii) satellite-based interannually varying vegetation indices (leaf area index and green vegetation fraction) instead of climatological vegetation indices, and (iii) yearly land cover information instead of static land cover. A relative comparison in terms of water budget components and "efficiency space" for various baseline and revised experiments showed that large regional and long-term differences in the simulated water budget partitioning relate to different LSM structures, whereas smaller local differences resulted from updated soil, vegetation and land cover parameters. Furthermore, the different LSM structures redistributed water differently in response to these parameter updates. A time-series comparison of the simulations to independent satellite-based estimates of evapotranspiration and brightness temperature (Tb) showed that no LSM setup significantly outperformed another for the entire region and that not all LSM simulations improved with updated parameter values. However, the revised soil parameters generally reduced the bias between simulated surface soil moisture and pixel-scale in situ observations and the bias between simulated Tb and regional Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) observations. Our results suggest that the different hydrological responses of various LSMs to vegetation changes may need further attention to gain benefits from vegetation data assimilation.

TI  - Current practice patterns of society of urologic oncology members in performing inguinal lymph node staging/therapy for penile cancer: A survey study
T2  - UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Inguinal lymph node (ILN) staging and therapeutic procedures are important for the diagnosis and management of suspected Inguinal lymph node metastasis in the setting of penile cancer. Morbidity associated with inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) and the lack of standardization in its perioperative management are both significant. In this study, we aimed to define current management approaches and potential opportunities for improving outcomes.Methods and materials: A questionnaire was developed with 16 questions regarding pre, peri, and postoperative management of patients undergoing ILND. The questionnaire was approved by the Society of Urologic Oncology (SUO) Questionnaire Committee, which facilitated its dissemination through an initial email and a follow-up reminder to 1,003 members. The study was conducted from July to August, 2020.Results: Of the 1,003 SUO members invited to participate, 93 responded (9.3% response rate); 49% performed 1 to 2 ILNDs annually, and 60% chose open ILND for high-risk primary cancer cN0. For suspicious lymph nodes > 2 cm, 69% preferred ILND, 86% preoperative systemic neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by surgery for bulky inguinal metastasis, and 84% used perioperative antibiotics (ABX), 53% of whom discontinued ABX 24 hours after surgery. Prophylactic anticoagulation was used by 78% of respondents, and 60% stopped it after ambulation. Specific ligation of lymphatics (versus none) was used by 82% of respondents, 55% obtained frozen sections, and 94% used inguinal drains. A saphenous sparing technique was used by 75% of respondents. An incisional wound vacuum device was used by 17% of respondents. Compression stockings and/or referral to a lymphedema specialist were used to manage postoperative lymphedema by 61% of respondents.Conclusions: Responses to a penile lymphadenectomy survey were relatively low and were primarily from the academic surgeon subset of the SUO. Significant consensus (>= 70%) was noted for neoadjuvant chemotherapy for bulky nodal metastasis prior to surgery, perioperative antibiotic use, ligation of lymphatics, drain placement, and saphenous sparing dissection techniques. Other evidenced-based strategies that could decrease morbidity were rarely used, including dynamic sentinel node biopsy, incisional wound vacuums, and lymphedema prevention. Prospective trials are needed to validate and resolve existing treatment paradigms and to optimize perioperative pathways to reduce complications in penile cancer management. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Laparoscopic repair of segmental obturator nerve injury defect using an artificial nerve conduit: A case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Obturator nerve injury is an uncommon complication frequently associated with pelvic gynecologic or urologic cancer surgery. It can lead to disability or adversely affect quality of life. Large segmental defects are particularly difficult to manage as the limited mobility of the nerve prevents tension-free direct end-to-end anastomosis. A 36-year-old woman with cervical cancer underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, laparoscopic radical hysterectomy, and bilateral adnexectomy. During the procedure, the sentinel lymph node (right obturator node) adherent to the obturator nerve was resected together with the nerve segment leaving a 3 cm defect. Immediate laparoscopic obturator nerve repair was performed using an artificial nerve conduit leading to successful recovery. We report this unique case due to rarity of large segmental obturator nerve defects and present laparoscopic nerve repair with artificial nerve conduits as a useful treatment alternative of these important injuries, without nerve donor site morbidity.

TI  - On the Circulation and Thermohaline Properties of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The circulation of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea is characterized by numerous recurrent or permanent anticyclonic structures, which modulate the pathway of the main currents and the exchange of the water masses in the basin. This work aims to describe the main circulation structures and thermohaline properties of the Eastern Mediterranean with particular focus on two anticyclones, the Pelops and the Cyprus gyres, using in-situ (drifters and Argo floats) and satellite (altimetry) data. The Pelops gyre is involved in the circulation and exchange of Levantine origin surface and intermediate waters and in their flow toward the Ionian and the Adriatic Sea. The Cyprus Gyre presents a marked interannual variability related to the presence/absence of waters of Atlantic origin in its interior. These anticyclones are characterized by double diffusive instability and winter mixing phenomena driven by salty surface waters of Levantine origin. Conditions for the salt finger regime occur steadily and dominantly within the Eastern Mediterranean anticyclones. The winter mixing is usually observed in December-January, characterized by instability conditions in the water column, a gradual deepening of the mixed layer depth and the consequent downward doming of the isohalines. The mixing generally involves the first 200 m of the water column (but occasionally can affect also the intermediate layer) forming a water mass with well-defined thermohaline characteristics. Conditions for salt fingers also occur during mixing events in the layer below the mixed layer.

TI  - Surgical Management of the Axilla of HER2+Breast Cancer in the Z1071 Era: A Propensity-Score-Matched Analysis of the NCDB
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction We aim to analyze survival outcomes for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) versus axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)+ infiltrative ductal carcinoma (IDC) that demonstrate complete clinical response (cCR) to neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) after initial presentation with clinical N1 (cN1) disease. Methods NCDB 2004-2017 was utilized for the analysis. Female patients with unilateral HER2+ IDC, stage cT1-T4 cN1, who demonstrated cCR to NAST with reported definitive axillary surgical management were included. Patients were propensity score matched, and overall survival (OS) was compared. Cox regression analysis was used to identify survival predictors. Results 6453 patients were selected, of whom 2461 (38.1%) had SLNB and 3992 (69.1%) had ALND as definitive axillary surgical management. The trend of SLNB utilization increased from 20% in 2012 to 50% in 2017. A total of 2454 patients were matched from each group with adequate adjustment for all variables. There was no difference in OS between SLNB versus ALND (84.03 +/- 0.36 versus 84.62 +/- 0.42 months; p = 0.522). Cox regression identified age, cT stage, primary tumor response to NAST, ypN+, and endocrine therapy as significant OS predictors. In subgroup analysis of patients with ypN+ who had SLNB as a definitive procedure, primary tumor response to NAST and continuation of adjuvant chemotherapy were associated with improved OS. Conclusion In cN1 HER2+ IDC patients who demonstrate cCR to NAST, SLNB is a reasonable definitive procedure for axillary management with comparable OS outcomes to ALND. However, higher-level data are required to determine the appropriate management in the case of ypN+.

TI  - Differential modelling and simulation of solar power potential: a helio-application of biharmonic model
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Modelling and simulation of solar power potential (SPP, Wm(-2)) is dominated by non-differential models, which are prone to truncation errors. However, this work focuses on presenting a more precise SPP model through a biharmonic differential model (BDM). The exact solution of the BDM ensures an accurate prediction of SPP in the study area (Uganda). This is possible by transforming the Mercatorian coordinates into Cartesian coordinates and establishing closed boundary conditions describing the SPP (Wm(-2)). Single- and multiple-order-exact solutions of the BDM are presented. The body validation of the simulated results is carried out using National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) quadrennial SPP satellite data (1984-2019). The study is conducted on Regional and Non-regional basis to identify areas with high SPP values. Validation of the simulated SPP results indicates that multiple-order-exact solution is more accurate than the single-order-exact solution based on the mean square error (RMSE) analysis. The SPP (dense area km(2), percentage area %) for the Non-regional, Northern Region, Eastern Region, Central Region and Western Region is as follows: 870 (170,817, 7.37), 831.4 (20,250, 23.71), 829.2 (10941.6, 27.71), 823.0 (2677.2, 4.36) and 798.0 (13,600, 0.73), respectively, were investigated. Therefore, it is clear that the BDM could be used to model SPP field data using the multiple-order-exact model solution. Thus, BDM produces a better result than non-differential models by eliminating truncation error in its solution. Therefore, for the purposes of estimating accurate information on the SPP, the BDM and its exact multiple-order solution should be applied.

TI  - Measuring nest incorporation of anthropogenic debris by seabirds: An opportunistic approach increases geographic scope and reduces costs
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Data on the prevalence of anthropogenic debris in seabird nests can be collected alongside other research or through community science initiatives to increase the temporal and spatial scale of data collection. To assess the usefulness of this approach, we collated data on nest incorporation of debris for 14 seabird species from 84 colonies across five countries in northwest Europe. Of 10,274 nests monitored 12% contained debris, however, there was large variation in the proportion of nests containing debris among species and colonies. For several species, the prevalence of debris in nests was significantly related to the mean Human Footprint Index (HFI), a proxy for human impact on the environment, within 100 km of the colony. Collecting opportunistic data on nest incorporation of debris by seabirds provides a cost-effective method of detecting changes in the prevalence of debris in the marine environment across a large geographic scale.

TI  - Scale gaps in landscape phenology: challenges and opportunities
T2  - TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Phenology, or the timing of life history events, can be heterogeneous across biological communities and landscapes and can vary across a wide variety of spatiotemporal scales. Here, we synthesize information from landscape phenology studies across different scales of measurement around a set of core concepts. We highlight why phenology is scale dependent and identify gaps in the spatiotemporal scales of phenological observations and inferences. We discuss the consequences of these gaps and describe opportunities to address the inherent sensitivities of phenological metrics to measurement scale. Although most studies we review and discuss are focused on plants, our work provides a broadly relevant overview of the role of observation scale in landscape phenology and a general approach for measuring and reporting scale dependence.

TI  - Lithological mapping of Waiotapu Geothermal Field (New Zealand) using hyperspectral and thermal remote sensing and ground exploration techniques
T2  - GEOTHERMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrothermal systems develop secondary mineral assemblages due to rock and fluid interactions. Such minerals can be identified on the surface and mapped using hyperspectral imaging and thermal remote sensing to complement geothermal exploration and monitoring. These methods are effective in detecting hydrothermal alteration and thermal anomalies of extensive areas, faster and cheaper than ground-based mapping alone. Here, we study the Waiotapu Geothermal Field, located in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand, to demonstrate the capability of such remote sensing tools for mapping surface hydrothermal lithologies and geothermal features. Application of remote sensing techniques to study the Waiotapu Geothermal Field is an optimal alternative as the site is protected for its sinter deposition springs, geysers, vulnerable geothermal features and rare thermotolerant vegetation. Airborne hyperspectral and thermal remote sensing data were complemented with 75 soil and rock samples for ground truth. These samples have been analysed using Visible Near Infrared (VNIR) and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) to constrain alteration mineralogy and bulk rock geochemistry. Lithological maps created through Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised classifications using the airborne hyperspectral data benchmarked against independent image- and ground-based validation data. Three main lithologies were mapped out, including silica sinter deposits, mixed alteration zones, and acid-sulphate alteration at 57.3% for SAM and 87.5% for SVM overall accuracy. The lithological classes have been analysed using the thermal imagery, which confirmed strong spatial heterogeneity of surface heat sources and overall higher surface temperatures for acid-sulphate alteration zones. Through Principal Component Analysis, enrichment of Ag, Au, S and Sb are found to be located around the Champagne Pool, which is where the near-neutral pH high-chloride fluids discharge at surface. The combination of airborne hyperspectral and thermal imagery with ground-based methods applied at Waiotapu Geothermal Field for the first time, can provide new data to understand the hydrothermal system and confirm that such methods are useful for geothermal initial reconnaissance surveys.

TI  - Rate and predictors of nodal pathological complete response following neoadjuvant endocrine treatment in clinically biopsy-proven nodepositive breast cancer patients
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Data on effectiveness and optimal use of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) in clinically biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer is lacking. This study examined the incidence of axillary pathological complete response (pCR) on NET in clinically biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer patients. Secondary, patient and tumour characteristics, as well as the optimal duration of NET in relation to the occurrence of axillary pCR were investigated.Material and methods: Patients diagnosed with primary hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer between 2014 and 2019, with at least one positive axillary lymph node (pathologically proven), treated with NET were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. The incidence of axillary pCR in combination with patient, tumour and treatment characteristics was analysed.Results: In a population of 561 patients, an axillary pCR of 7.3% on NET was observed. Median length of treatment was 8.1 months in the patients without vs. 8.8 months in those with axillary pCR, with no statistically significant difference. A p-value <0.30 was found for age, histologic type, clinical tumour status, hormone receptor status and the type of NET in univariable analysis. After multivariable logistic regression analyses, none of these variables were independently associated with the likelihood of an axillary pCR.Conclusion: The rate of axillary pCR after NET in HR thorn HER2-clinically biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer patients is low. Factors independently associated with the likelihood of an axillary pCR could not be identified. More research is warranted regarding optimizing the duration of NET and the prognostic value of residual disease in the axilla after NET.

TI  - Statistical Exploration of SENTINEL-1 Data, Terrain Parameters, and <i>in</i>-<i>situ</i> Data for Estimating the Near-Surface Soil Moisture in a Mediterranean Agroecosystem
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable near-surface soil moisture (theta) information is crucial for supporting risk assessment of future water usage, particularly considering the vulnerability of agroforestry systems of Mediterranean environments to climate change. We propose a simple empirical model by integrating dual-polarimetric Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) C-band single-look complex data and topographic information together with in-situ measurements of theta into a random forest (RF) regression approach (10-fold cross-validation). Firstly, we compare two RF models' estimation performances using either 43 SAR parameters (theta(SAR)(Nov)) or the combination of 43 SAR and 10 terrain parameters (theta(SAR+Terrain)(Nov)). Secondly, we analyze the essential parameters in estimating and mapping theta for S1 overpasses twice a day (at 5 a.m. and 5 p.m.) in a high spatiotemporal (17 x 17 m; 6 days) resolution. The developed site-specific calibration-dependent model was tested for a short period in November 2018 in a field-scale agroforestry environment belonging to the "Alento " hydrological observatory in southern Italy. Our results show that the combined SAR + terrain model slightly outperforms the SAR-based model (theta(SAR+Terrain)(Nov) with 0.025 and 0.020 m(3) m(-3), and 89% compared to theta(SAR)(Nov) with 0.028 and 0.022 m(3) m(-3), and 86% in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R-2). The higher explanatory power for theta(SAR+Terrain)(Nov) is assessed with time-variant SAR phase information-dependent elements of the C2 covariance and Kennaugh matrix (i.e., K1, K6, and K1S) and with local (e.g., altitude above channel network) and compound topographic attributes (e.g., wetness index). Our proposed methodological approach constitutes a simple empirical model aiming at estimating theta for rapid surveys with high accuracy. It emphasizes potentials for further improvement (e.g., higher spatiotemporal coverage of ground-truthing) by identifying differences of SAR measurements between S1 overpasses in the morning and afternoon.

TI  - Large and increasing methane emissions from eastern Amazonia derived from satellite data, 2010-2018
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We use a global inverse model, satellite data and flask measurements to estimate methane (CH4) emissions from South America, Brazil and the basin of the Amazon River for the period 2010-2018. We find that emissions from Brazil have risen during this period, most quickly in the eastern Amazon basin, and that this is concurrent with increasing surface temperatures in this region. Brazilian CH4 emissions rose from 49.8 +/- 5.4 Tg yr(-1) in 2010-2013 to 55.6 +/- 5.2 Tg yr(-1) in 2014-2017, with the wet season of December-March having the largest positive trend in emissions. Amazon basin emissions grew from 41.7 +/- 5.3 to 49.3 +/- 5.1 Tg yr(-1) during the same period. We derive no significant trend in regional emissions from fossil fuels during this period. We find that our posterior distribution of emissions within South America is significantly and consistently changed from our prior estimates, with the strongest emission sources being in the far north of the continent and to the south and south-east of the Amazon basin, at the mouth of the Amazon River and nearby marsh, swamp and mangrove regions. We derive particularly large emissions during the wet season of 2013/14, when flooding was prevalent over larger regions than normal within the Amazon basin. We compare our posterior CH4 mole fractions, derived from posterior fluxes, to independent observations of CH4 mole fraction taken at five lower- to mid-tropospheric vertical profiling sites over the Amazon and find that our posterior fluxes outperform prior fluxes at all locations. In particular the large emissions from the eastern Amazon basin are shown to be in good agreement with independent observations made at Santarem, a location which has long displayed higher mole fractions of atmospheric CH4 in contrast with other basin locations. We show that a bottom-up wetland flux model can match neither the variation in annual fluxes nor the positive trend in emissions produced by the inversion. Our results show that the Amazon alone was responsible for 24 +/- 18% of the total global increase in CH4 flux during the study period, and it may contribute further in future due to its sensitivity to temperature changes.

TI  - Global assessment of wind erosion based on a spatially distributed RWEQ model
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind erosion is a global environmental problem and affects the sustainable use of land soil. The current efforts in wind erosion modeling mainly focus on local scales, yet very few studies have attempted to quantify the soil losses by wind on a large scale. Here, we proposed a distributed version of the revised wind erosion equation model (DRWEQ) to assess the spatial and temporal variations of wind erosion globally. The DRWEQ model used meteorological, soil, topographic, and remote sensing data to simulate global wind erosion from 2001 to 2010. The results showed that (a) the areas of wind erosion in Africa and Asia accounted for approximately 62% of the global wind erosion area but accounted for 91% of the global total soil loss; (b) global wind erosion showed a decreasing tendency during the research period - the wind erosion with a trend of intensification occupied 40.62% of the global wind erosion area while about 59.38% of the global wind erosion area showed a weakening trend; and (c) the monthly dynamics of the wind erosion were closely correlated with the combined effects of weather factors and vegetation coverage. The soil loss rates were lower in summer and reached the peak from January to April. The method presented in this study was developed based on the tradeoff of accuracy and availability of global data, and has the potential for predicting wind erosion from regional to global scales.

TI  - The influence of vegetation index thresholding on EO-based assessments of exposed soil masks in Germany between 1984 and 2019
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge about the spatial and temporal distribution of exposed soils is necessary for e.g., soil erosion mitigation. Earth Observation (EO) is a valuable data source for detecting exposed soils on a large scale. In the last couple of years, the multitemporal compositing technique has been used for the generation of so-called exposed soil composites that overcome the limitation of temporarily coverage of the soils with vegetation as it is occurring at agricultural sites. The selection of exposed soil pixels from the stack of multispectral images is mainly done using spectral reflectance indices such as NDVI, NBR2 and others calculated on a per-pixel basis. The definition of the thresholds that are applicable to large areas such as regions, countries or continents is still a challenge and requires a reliable and robust sampling data base. In this study, the Soil Composite Mapping Processor (SCMaP) is used to build exposed soil masks containing all pixels in a given time period showing at least once exposed soil. For this purpose, a modified vegetation index (PV) based on the NDVI is used to separate the soils from other land cover (LC) classes by two PV thresholds. The overall goal of this study is to derive and validate exposed soil masks from multi-year Landsat data stacks for Germany from 1984 to 2019. The first focus is set on the impact of a newly developed sampling approach of LC classes such as urban areas, deciduous forests and agricultural fields that are automatically derived from Corine Land Cover (CLC) data. The spectral-temporal behavior of these LC classes in PVmin/ max index composites show larger variability of the PV values compared to a manual sampling for selective LC classes such as urban areas. It reveals that the threshold definition method previously developed by Rogge et al. (2018) is not robust enough and the percentile rule used to define the Tmax threshold had to be adapted from 0.995 to 0.900. On the other hand, the sampling data base has proven to be robust across time and region. The second focus of the paper is to validate all generated exposed soil masks covering Germany for seven time periods from 1984 to 2019. A linear correlation analysis was performed comparing the SCMaP data with surveys from the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) and the CLC inventories. The comparison with both datasets showed high regression coefficients (R2 = 0.79 to 0.90) with small regional deviations for areas in the Northern part of Germany. Strong correlation was found for time periods based on a higher number of cloud free Landsat images such as from 2000 to 2009. This demonstrates the high potential of SCMaP's to generate exposed soil masks based on an automated sampling and a robust threshold derivation. To contribute to soil erosion studies that need information about where and when soils are bare, accurate exposed soil masks in suitable time periods can be of great value.

TI  - Integration of Multisource Data to Estimate Downward Longwave Radiation Based on Deep Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Downward longwave radiation (DLR) at the surface is a key variable of interest in fields, such as hydrology and climate research. However, existing DLR estimation methods and DLR products are still problematic in terms of both accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution. In this article, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based method to estimate hourly DLR at 5-km spatial resolution from top of atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature (BT) of the Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) thermal channels, combined with near-surface air temperature and dew point temperature of ERA5 and elevation data. Validation results show that the DCNN-based method outperforms popular random forest and multilayer perceptron-based methods and that our proposed scheme integrating multisource data outperforms that only using remote sensing TOA observations or surface meteorological data. Compared with state-of-the-art CERES-SYN and ERA5-land DLR products, the estimated DLR by our proposed DCNN-based method with physical multisource inputs has higher spatiotemporal resolution and accuracy, with correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.95, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 17.2 W/m(2), and mean bias error (MBE) of -0.8 W/m(2) in the testing period on the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Machine-learning modelling of fire susceptibility in a forest-agriculture mosaic landscape of southern India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The recurrent forest fires have been a serious management concern in southern Western Ghats, India. This study investigates the applicability of various geospatial data, machine learning techniques (MLTs) and spatial statistical tools to demarcate the forest fire susceptible regions of the forested landscape of the Wayanad district in the southern Western Ghats (Kerala, India). The inventory map of 279 forest fire locations (period = 2001-2018) was developed via Sentinel 2A satellite images, NASA fire archives, and field visits. The forest fire susceptibility modelling involves twelve influencing factors, such as ambient air temperature, wind speed, rainfall, relative humidity, atmospheric water vapor pressure (WVP), elevation, slope angle, topographical wetness index (TWI), slope aspect, land use/land cover (LU/LC), distance from the road and distance from the villages. Considering the varying level of performances (i.e., receiver operating characteristics-area under curve (ROC-AUC) values ranging from 0.869 to 0.924 in the testing phase) of the MLTs, viz., artificial neural network (ANN), generalized linear model (GLM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), Naive Bayesian classifier (NBC), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) and maximum entropy (MaxEnt), we propose a weighted approach to characterize the forest fire susceptibility of the region using the outputs of the different MLTs. The proposed method demonstrates improvement in accuracy (AUC = 0.890) for mapping the forest fire susceptibility of the region compared to the individual MLTs (AUC = 0.715 to 0.869) while validating with the recent forest fire data (i.e., 2019-2021). This study suggests that roughly one-third of the study area is highly susceptible to the occurrence of forest fires, implying the severity of the disturbance regime. The analysis also indicates the role of anthropogenic factors in the occurrence of forest fires in the region. It is expected that the demarcation and prioritization of the forest fire susceptibility zones in the region, which is a part of one of the global biodiversity hotspots, have significant implications on biodiversity conservation at a regional scale.

TI  - Regional Reef Fish Survey Design and Scaling Using High-Resolution Mapping and Analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reefs are undergoing changes caused by coastal development, resource use, and climate change. The extent and rate of reef change demand robust and spatially explicit monitoring to support management and conservation decision-making. We developed and demonstrated an airborne-assisted approach to design and upscale field surveys of reef fish over an ecologically complex reef ecosystem along Hawaii Island. We also determined the minimal set of mapped variables, mapped reef strata, and field survey sites needed to meet three goals: (i) increase field survey efficiency, (ii) reduce field sampling costs, and (iii) ensure field sampling is geostatistically robust for upscaling to regional estimates of reef fish composition. Variability in reef habitat was best described by a combination of water depth, live coral and macroalgal cover, fine-scale reef rugosity, reef curvature, and latitude as a proxy for a regional climate-ecosystem gradient. In combination, these factors yielded 18 distinct reef habitats, or strata, throughout the study region, which subsequently required 117 field survey sites to quantify fish diversity and biomass with minimal uncertainty. The distribution of field sites was proportional to stratum size and the variation in benthic habitat properties within each stratum. Upscaled maps of reef survey data indicated that fish diversity is spatially more uniform than fish biomass, which was lowest in embayments and near land-based access points. Decreasing the number of field sites from 117 to 45 and 75 sites for diversity and biomass, respectively, resulted in a manageable increase of statistical uncertainty, but would still yield actionable trend data over time for the 60 km reef study region on Hawaii Island. Our findings suggest that high-resolution benthic mapping can be combined with stratified-random field sampling to generate spatially explicit estimates of fish diversity and biomass. Future expansions of the methodology can also incorporate temporal shifts in benthic composition to drive continuously evolving fish monitoring for sampling and upscaling. Doing so reduces field-based labor and costs while increasing the geostatistical power and ecological representativeness of field work.

TI  - The intersection of DNA replication with antisense 3' RNA processing in <i>Arabidopsis FLC </i>chromatin silencing
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - How noncoding transcription influences chromatin states is still unclear. The Arabidopsis floral repressor gene FLC is quantitatively regulated through an antisense-mediated chromatin silencing mechanism. The FLC antisense transcripts form a cotranscriptional R-loop that is dynamically resolved by RNA 3 ' processing factors (FCA and FY), and this is linked to chromatin silencing. Here, we investigate this silencing mechanism and show, using single-molecule DNA fiber analysis, that FCA and FY are required for unimpeded replication fork progression across the Arabidopsis genome. We then employ the chicken DT40 cell line system, developed to investigate sequence dependent replication and chromatin inheritance, and find that FLC R-loop sequences have an orientation-dependent ability to stall replication forks. These data suggest a coordination between RNA 3 ' processing of antisense RNA and replication fork progression in the inheritance of chromatin silencing at FLC.

TI  - Assessment of tropical cyclone amphan affected inundation areas using sentinel-1 satellite data
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclones as natural disturbances, influence ecosystem structure, function and dynamics at the global scale. This study assesses the inundation due to the super cyclone Amphan in coastal districts of eastern India by leveraging the computational power of Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the availability of high resolution Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. A cloud-based image processing framework was developed and implemented in GEE for classification using Random Forest algorithm. The inundation areas due to storm surge owing to cyclone Amphan, were mapped and further categorised to different land use and land cover classes based on an existing land cover map. Sentinel-1 images were useful in post-cyclone studies for the change detection analysis due to its higher temporal resolution and cloud penetration ability. The study found that the majority of agricultural and agricultural fallow lands were inundated in the coastal districts. The availability of open-source cloud-based data processing platforms provides cost effective way to rapidly gather accurate geospatial information. Such information could be useful for emergency response planning and post-event disaster management including relief, rescue and rehabilitation measures; and crop yield loss assessment. Cyclone and Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change can have significant impacts on the human population and if both coexist, the consequences for people and the surrounding environment may be severe.

TI  - Improving the consistency of multi-temporal land cover mapping of Laguna lake watershed using light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) approach, change detection analysis, and Markov chain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The enhanced temporal capability of today's satellite sensors gives us large volumes of data to be processed, analysed, and visualized. Most of the conventional remote sensing software and land cover classification approaches, however, are only designed for single-date observations. To fully utilize the amount of data we receive and to improve land use/land cover mapping (LULC), technological advancements in machine learning, open source processing, and GPU-accelerated hardware should be utilized. In this paper, a methodology for classification of temporal sequence of Sentinel-2 images was developed using open-source Python libraries. Light Gradient Boosting Machine, a machine learning algorithm that uses tree-based learning, was used to classify different land cover types based on a temporal sequence of Sentinel-2 satellite images. Although the use of powerful machine learning algorithm resulted to more accurate land cover maps, temporal inconsistencies are still pervasive when dealing with time series outputs. To remove these temporal inconsistencies that resulted from misclassifications, temporal land cover filter based on transition probability matrix was applied on the time series land cover maps to modify the illogical land cover transitions. Accuracy assessment revealed good performance of the approach, which produced higher overall accuracy.

TI  - A deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm for detecting saline flow sources and mapping the environmental impacts of the Urmia Lake drought in Iran
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urmia Lake in Northern Iran is drying up, which is causing significant environmental problems in the region, including saline storms that devastate agricultural land. We developed a remote sensing-based monitoring application to detect and map the location of saline flow sources with a novel automated deep learning convolutional neural network (DL-CCN). In order to train the model, we derived a normalised difference dust index (NDDI) from MODIS satellite images and collected ground control points (GCPs). These GCPs were randomly split for training (70%) and accuracy assessment (30%). We identified the following seven predisposing factors for saline flow source modelling: normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), humidity percentage, temperature, wind speed, geomorphology, soil and land use/cover. In order to train the DL-CNN, we used ReLu, the root mean square error function, and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for the activation, loss/cost function, and optimization, respectively. Finally, we used the frequency ratio (FR) method to identify the most effective variable for the prediction of saline storm occurrences. The results reveal a high confidence (91.86% overall accuracy and a Kappa of 90.26) for the detection of saline flow sources. According to the FR model, the NDVI (0.982), humidity percentage (0.963), and land use/cover (0.925) are the most relevant factors for detecting the occurrence of saline storms in the Urmia Lake basin. In addition, we carried out a spatial uncertainty analysis of the results based on the Dempster Shafer Theory. The results will help the local stakeholders and decision-makers to better understating the saline flow sources and their respective environmental impacts.

TI  - Stagnation of the Pensilungpa glacier, western Himalaya, India: causes and implications
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates stagnation conditions of the Pensilungpa glacier, western Himalaya. Multiple glacier parameters (length, area, debris extent and thickness, snowline altitude (SLA), velocity, downwasting and ice cliffs) were studied using field measurements (2016-18), high-resolution imagery from GoogleEarth (2013-17) and spaceborne Landsat, ASTER and SRTM data (1993-2017) to comprehend the glacier's current state. Results show a moderate decrease in length (6.62 +/- 2.11 m a(-1)) and area (0.11 +/- 0.03% a marked increase in SLA (similar to 6 m and debris cover (2.86 +/- 0.29% a(-1)) and a slowdown of similar to 50% during 1993-2016. Notable thinning of -0.88 +/- 0.04 m a(-1) was observed between 2000 and 2017 showing a similar trend as field measurements during 2016-17 (-0.88 m) and 2017-18 (-1.54 m). Further, results reveal a stagnation of the lower ablation zone (LAZ). Less mass supply and heterogeneous debris growth (6.67 +/- 0.41% a(-1)) over the previous decade resulted in slowdown, margin insulation and slope-inversion, leading to stagnation. Stagnation of LAZ caused bulging in the dynamic upper ablation zone and favored the development of supraglacial ponds and ice cliffs. Ice cliffs have grown significantly (48% in number; 41% in area during 2013-17) and their back-wasting now dominates the ablation process.

TI  - Associations of air pollution and greenness with the nasal microbiota of healthy infants: A longitudinal study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Air pollution and greenness are associated with short- and long-term respiratory health in children but the underlying mechanisms are only scarcely investigated. The nasal microbiota during the first year of life has been shown to be associated with respiratory tract infections and asthma development. Thus, an interplay between greenness, air pollution and the early nasal microbiota may contribute to short- and long-term respiratory health. We aimed to examine associations between fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and greenness with the nasal microbiota of healthy infants during the first year of life in a European context with low-to-moderate air pollution levels.Methods: Microbiota characterization was performed using 16 S rRNA pyrosequencing of 846 nasal swabs collected fortnightly from 47 healthy infants of the prospective Basel-Bern Infant Lung Development (BILD) cohort. We investigated the association of satellite-based greenness and an 8-day-average exposure to air pollution (PM2.5, NO2) with the nasal microbiota during the first year of life. Exposures were individually estimated with novel spatial-temporal models incorporating satellite data. Generalized additive mixed models adjusted for known confounders and considering the autoregressive correlation structure of the data were used for analysis.Results: Mean (SD) PM2.5 level was 17.1 (3.8 mu g/m(3)) and mean (SD) NO2 level was 19.7 (7.9 mu g/m(3)). Increased PM2.5 and increased NO2 were associated with reduced within-subject Ruzicka dissimilarity (PM2.5: per 1 mu g/m(3) -0.004, 95% CI -0.008, -0.001; NO2: per 1 mu g/m(3) -0.004, 95% CI -0.007, -0.001). Whole microbial community comparison with nonmetric multidimensional scaling revealed distinct microbiota profiles for different PM2.5 exposure levels. Increased NO2 was additionally associated with reduced abundance of Corynebacteriaceae (per 1 mu g/m(3): -0.027, 95% CI -0.053, -0.001). No associations were found between greenness and the nasal microbiota.Conclusion: Air pollution was associated with Ruzka dissimilarity and relative abundance of Corynebacteriaceae. This suggests that even low-to-moderate exposure to air pollution may impact the nasal microbiota during the first year of life. Our results will be useful for future studies assessing the clinical relevance of air-pollutioninduced alterations of the nasal microbiota with subsequent respiratory disease development.

TI  - Rapid and Accurate Detection of Lymph Node Metastases Enabled through Fluorescent Silicon Nanoparticles-Based Exosome Probes
T2  - ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection is of great significance for the prevention and treatment of cancer metastasis. Herein, we introduce silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs)-based exosome (SiNPs@EXO) probes for distinguishing normal and metastatic SLNs. Typically, SiNPs are suitable for stable and long-term tracking of exosomes, while cancer cell-driven exosomes with a tumor-homing effect allow targeting metastatic SLNs. Remarkably, the as-fabricated SiNPs@EXO has the ability to label metastatic SLNs, i.e., the fluorescence signal in SLNs reaches the peak within 0.5 h and remains up to 3 h. Comparatively, SLN tracers (e.g., indocyanine green) used clinically can illuminate SLNs 1 h post injection, whereas the signal witnesses a sharp fall then. Moreover, evaluations based on preclinical data confirm the negligible side effects of the SiNPs@EXO. Our results provide new tools for targeting SLNs and predicting lymphatic metastasis of tumor.

TI  - Adverse consequences of immediate thrombolysis-related complications: a multi-centre registry-based cohort study of acute stroke
T2  - JOURNAL OF THROMBOSIS AND THROMBOLYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Complications following thrombolysis for stroke are well documented, and mostly concentrated on haemorrhage. However, the consequences of patients who experience any immediate thrombolysis-related complications (TRC) compared to patients without immediate TRC have not been examined. Prospectively collected data from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme were analysed. Thrombolysis was performed in 451 patients (52.1% men; 75.3 years +/- 13.2) admitted with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) in four UK centres between 2014 and 2016. Adverse consequences following immediate TRC were assessed using logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex and co-morbidities. Twenty-nine patients (6.4%) acquired immediate TRC. Compared to patients without, individuals with immediate TRC had greater adjusted risks of: moderately-severe or severe stroke (National Institutes of Health for Stroke Scale score >= 16) at 24-h (5.7% vs 24.7%, OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.4-11.1); worst level of consciousness (LOC) in the first 7 days (score >= 1; 25.0 vs 60.7, OR 4.6, 95% CI 2.1-10.2); urinary tract infection or pneumonia within 7-days of admission (13.5% vs 39.3%, OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3-7.7); length of stay (LOS) on hyperacute stroke unit (HASU) >= 2 weeks (34.7% vs 66.7%, OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.5-18.4); mortality (13.0% vs 41.4%, OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.6-8.4); moderately-severe or severe disability (modified Rankin Scale score >= 4) at discharge (26.8% vs 65.5%, OR 4.7, 95% CI 2.1-10.9); palliative care by discharge date (5.1% vs 24.1%, OR 5.1, 95% CI 1.7-15.7). The median LOS on the HASU was longer (7 days vs 30 days, Kruskal-Wallis test: chi(2) = 8.9, p = 0.003) while stroke severity did not improve (NIHSS score at 24-h post-thrombolysis minus NIHSS score at arrival = - 4 vs 0, chi(2) = 24.3, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the risk of nosocomial infections, worsening of stroke severity, longer HASU stay, disability and death is increased following immediate TRC. The management of patients following immediate TRC is more complex than previously thought and such complexity needs to be considered when planning an increased thrombolysis service.

TI  - Variable coverage in an Autocidal Gravid Ovitrap intervention impacts efficacy of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> control
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Control of the arboviral disease vector Aedes aegypti has shown variable levels of efficacy around the globe. We evaluated an Autocidal Gravid Ovitrap (AGO) intervention as a stand-alone control tool for population suppression of A. aegypti in US communities bordering Mexico. We conducted a cluster randomized crossover trial with weekly mosquito surveillance of sentinel households from July 2017 to December 2018. The intervention took place from August to December of both years. Multilevel models (generalized linear and additive mixed models) were used to analyse the changes in population abundance of female A. aegypti. We observed that female populations were being suppressed 77% (2018) and four times lower outdoor female abundance when AGO coverage (number of intervention AGO traps that surrounded a sentinel home) was high (2.7 AGOs/house). However, we also observed that areas with low intervention AGO coverage resulted in no difference (2017) or slightly higher abundance compared to the control. These results suggest that coverage rate might play a critical role on how populations of female A. aegypti are being modulated in the field. The lack of larval source habitat reduction and the short duration of the intervention period might have limited the A. aegypti population suppression observed in this study. Synthesis and applications. The mosquito, A. aegypti, is a public health concern in most tropical and subtropical regions. With the rise of insecticide resistance, the evaluation of non-chemical tools has become pivotal in the fight against arboviral disease transmission. Our study shows that the AGO intervention, as a stand-alone control tool, is limited by its coverage in human settlements. Vector control programmes should consider, that if the target coverage rate is not achieved, measures will be ineffective unless coupled with other control approaches. Although our multilevel modelling was focused on A. aegypti and the AGO, the approach can be applied to other mosquito vector species.

TI  - Quantifying 3D building form effects on urban land surface temperature and modeling seasonal correlation patterns
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple factors regulate urban land surface temperature (LST), including land cover, climate, and urban form, among which urban form is now receiving more and more attention. Some studies have discussed the planar effects of urban form on LST, whereas less concern has been devoted to the vertical structure of urban areas, which can have a significant effect on heat redistribution. In this paper, we quantify the three-dimensional building form (3DBF) effects on LST captured by Landsat thermal sensors over four seasons by using a random forest (RF) regression method. The five 3DBF factors of building density (BD), building height (BH), sky view factor (SVF), frontal area index (FAI), and building shadow (BS) are calculated within a grid. The seasonal correlation of the 3DBF factors with LST is analyzed, and seven correlation patterns are modeled for the city of Wuhan in China. The results show that: 1) The best grid scale for the building form analysis in a city such as Wuhan is 180 m. 2) The 3DBF factors have a significant effect on urban LST over the four seasons. BD, BH and BS are the season-stable factors, among which BD has a heating effect, which reaches a maximum of 3.6 degrees C in spring, while BS has a cooling effect, which reaches -3.4 degrees C in winter. There is also a transition point for BH between heating and cooling at a height of 10 m. 3) SVF and FAI are season-varying factors, in which SVF has cooling effect, except in summer, while FAI also has a cooling effect, but not in winter. These findings will help us to understand how building form affects urban surface temperature, and will provide a reference for urban policy makers and planners in the future.

TI  - DInSAR Monitoring of Surface Subsidence by Fusing Sentinel-1A and-1B Data to Improve Time Resolution in a Mining Area
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring large gradient ground deformation due to temporal and spatial image decoherence has long been a challenge. We attempted an improvement using Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B C-band data fusion methods based on the variation law of subsidence velocity of ground leveling monitoring points. This approach improved the temporal resolution from 12 to 6 days. Using a mine in Datong, Shanxi Province, China as an example, 13 scenes of Sentinel-1A data and 12 scenes of Sentinel-1B data were fused and compared with ground-measured data. The results obtained were closer to the measured values than those obtained by single data set (Sentinel-1A or -1B only). Simultaneously, 61 scenes of Sentinel-1A data and 12 scenes of Sentinel-1B data were used to calculate the subsidence of the mining area over two years. The subsidence map was consistent with the actual leveling trend, which reflected the dynamic change of surface subsidence range in the mining area. This study provides an approach using DInSAR technology to monitor large gradient deformation in mining areas and provides an effective method to monitor of surface dynamic deformation.

TI  - Long-term and regional variability of phytoplankton biomass and its physical oceanographic parameters in the Yellow Sea, China
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal variation of phytoplankton biomass were analyzed for five typical regions in the Yellow Sea (YS) during 2003-2018, using monthly long-term satellite data. The correlation between phytoplankton biomass and physical oceanographic parameters were explored using multiwavelet coherence for each region. The results showed the phytoplankton biomass decreased from the inshore to the center of the YS. There were opposing trends observed for phytoplankton biomass in the coastal area and the middle of the YS. The phytoplankton biomass varied seasonally for five the different regions due to the influence of sea surface temperature (SST), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and mix layer depth (MLD). The highest and lowest phytoplankton biomass occurred in April and July in most of regions. The phytoplankton biomass increased in the spring and decreased in winter for all five regions during 2003-2018. The SST, PAR and MLD also increased in most regions during the study periods. The Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) had an interannual periodicity, mostly influenced by the MLD among the physical oceanographic parameters explored. The Chl-a showed a negative correlation with the SST and the PAR, and a positive correlation with the MLD. Among the physical oceanographic parameters explored, the PAR and the MLD were the key factors that influenced the variation of phytoplankton biomass in the estuary of the Yangtze River (EYR) and the North Yellow Sea (NYS), while the SST and the PAR were the main factors in the Jiangsu Shoal (JSS). In the Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass (YSCWM) and the south coast of Shandong Peninsula (SCSDP), the SST and the MLD were the main factors influencing for the phytoplankton biomass among the physical oceanographic parameters explored, respectively. The best three-factor combination all included Nin similar to o 3.4 in each region, which suggest that El Nin similar to o had a certain influence on the variation of the Chl-a in the YS over a long time scale.

TI  - Application of remote sensing data and geographic information system for identifying potential areas of groundwater storage in middle Moulouya Basin of Morocco
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study is to identify the groundwater storage areas in the middle Moulouya Basin by using Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) methods which are the prominent supports of groundwater modeling. Five thematic maps of lithology, rainfall, drainage, lineaments, and slope; which were respectively categorized as they were weighed. Capaciously, they have been used to generate the map of potential groundwater storage zones. The results have shown that the area of very low to low potential surfaces represents approximately 10% of the total area, indicating that the middle Moulouya Basin is rich in groundwater, where more than 2200 wells and boreholes have been drilled. The obtained results have been validated with specific yield of springs in the study area. It indicates a clear correlation between the groundwater potential zones and the specific yield, this correlation is particularly obvious in light of yield of water points and their locations, indeed, most of water points with high yield are located in excellent potential zones, while poor potential zone includes the majority of water points with low yield.

TI  - Understanding the summertime warming in canyon and non-canyon surfaces
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban landscapes, made of unique buildings, pavements, and vegetation, create complex influences on the atmosphere. These influences induce increased nighttime warming and daytime cooling, especially in arid regions. This study compared three types of surfaces, including rooftop, turfgrass, and canyons, in terms of surface temperature and surface energy fluxes. A 68 sq.km parcel in Phoenix, AZ was considered for comparison. The study found that the canyons' land surface temperatures (LST) were 5 degrees C lower than the rooftop surfaces. The turfgrass surfaces were 4 degrees C cooler than the canyon surfaces. Moreover, north and south (N-S) oriented canyons were 2 degrees C cooler than east and west (E-W) oriented canyons. No significant changes were observed in net radiation for rooftop, turfgrass, or canyon surfaces. However, conductive fluxes, warranting nighttime warming, showed higher absorption of 45 W/m2 on the rooftop surfaces, than in the canyons. The turfgrass showed nighttime cooling, as the heat absorption was 210 W/m2 lower than the rooftop surfaces and 165 W/m2 lower than the canyons. Additionally, a 50 W/m2 difference of heat absorption was observed between N-S oriented canyons and E-W oriented canyons. The study concludes that canyons are major causes of daytime cooling and nighttime warming.

TI  - Evaluation of the Priestley-Taylor method to estimate latent heat flux by triangular and trapezoidal approaches using remote sensing data
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study was carried out to evaluate the Priestley-Taylor (PT) model to estimate latent heat flux (lambda ET) and to compare the performance of the Priestley-Taylor (PT) model by computing PT parameter (phi) by triangular and trapezoidal approaches. The triangular and trapezoidal methods are well established by (e.g., Jiang and Islam, Int J Remote Sens 24:2221-2236, 2003 and Laxmi and Nandagiri, Remote Sens Lett 5:981-990, 2014). Since (Laxmi and Nandagiri, Remote Sens Lett 5:981-990, 2014) trapezoidal approach for estimating latent heat flux is applied and validated only at one flux tower. The present study's novelty is to compute, compare and validate lambda ET in different vegetation types, terrain types. For the validation purpose, lambda ET measurements were collected for diverse vegetation and terrain types where the flux tower was installed. The errors arise due to spatial mismatch between in situ station ground land surface temperature (LST) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite LST, which is minimal compared to other satellite data products. Relative performances of lambda ET values yielded R-2 of 0.72-0.94 and RMSE of 18.34-32.70 W/m(2) for PT triangular approach. The trapezoidal approach shows good results with high R-2 and low RMSE than the triangular approach. The trapezoidal approach proposed in this study provided reasonably accurate estimates of lambda ET for different types of vegetation and terrain type where the flux towers data available during specific years on AsiaFlux website (https://db.cger.nies.go.jp/asiafluxdb/?page_id=16) were retrieved. As a result of the methods developed in this study, actual evapotranspiration can be derived using XET at regional to spatial scales.

TI  - Assessing the thermal regime of poorly monitored reservoirs with a combined satellite and three-dimensional modeling approach
T2  - INLAND WATERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal regime of lakes and reservoirs is a major driver of their functioning, yet water temperature measurements are scarce and time-series are frequently interrupted by missing data in many lakes and reservoirs. Our aim was to assess whether satellite imagery combined with 3-dimensional (3D) modeling can overcome this limitation. We assessed the performance of a 3D model (Delft3D-Flow) and compared simulated temperature to satellite data on Karaoun Reservoir in a semiarid region of Lebanon. Surface water temperatures were retrieved from Landsat 8, atmospherically corrected using a single channel algorithm and adjusted with in situ measurements as a proxy of bulk temperatures. With limited calibration, the model reproduced water level fluctuations, water temperature, stratification, and mixing, with low discrepancies from measurements. Satellite temperatures agreed well with observations and simulations. Satellite temperature distribution across the reservoir exhibited low spatial heterogeneity. The 3D model partly reproduced this spatial distribution of surface temperature and generally was able to simulate the thermal regime of the reservoir with limited datasets for initial conditions and for hydrological and meteorological forcing, and with limited calibration. For validating 3D hydrodynamic models, satellite temperatures constitute a valuable source of data complementary to point measurements. Coupling satellite imagery and modeling can improve operational surveys of poorly monitored lakes and reservoirs and enhance knowledge of their thermal functioning.

M3  - Article
AB  - Indocyanine green (ICG) is a water-soluble, iodine-containing molecule with a wide variety of applications in various fields of medicine. In this paper, we report an adverse event of ICG infiltration into subcutaneous tissue from a malpositioned intravenous (IV) catheter. Although ICG can be injected intradermally and subcutaneously for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer surgery, no reports exist regarding inadvertent infiltration from an IV catheter. It is our objective to provide an example should this unfortunate event occur in other populations, to describe the timing of resolution from infiltration, and to provide recommendations for future occurrences. In this case, the discoloration from infiltration became apparent on postoperative day one and had resolved completely at the time of the follow-up appointment on postoperative day 18.

TI  - Decreasing the Use of Sentinel Lymph Node Surgery in Women Older than 70 Years with Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer and the Impact on Adjuvant Radiation and Hormonal Therapy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In 2016, SSO Choosing Wisely guidelines recommended against routine sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery in women >= 70 with HR+ cN0 breast cancer. Following this, we identified a group of women at low-risk of nodal positivity where SLN may be omitted (grade 1, cT1mi-T1c, or grade 2, cT1mi-T1b). This study evaluates the impact of these changes on our practice. Methods Retrospective chart review of women aged >= 70 years with HR+ cN0 breast cancer at our institution from 2010 to 2020. We compared SLN use before (2010-2016)/after (2017-2020) guideline release according to clinical risk and the association with adjuvant therapy. Results A total of 1015 breast cancers in 987 women identified. SLN surgery rate significantly decreased from 90.6% (2010-2016) to 62.8% in 2020 (p < 0.001). This was driven by breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with SLN rates of 88.2% (2010-2016) and 46.7% in 2020. During 2017-2020, SLN use varied by risk within BCS patients: 52.2% low-risk, 81.9% higher-risk, p < 0.001. In contrast, in mastectomy patients SLN was performed in >= 98% regardless of risk level. SLN positivity was 13.4% overall: 7.4% in low-risk and 20.8% in higher-risk, p < 0.001. After adjusting for age and clinical risk, SLN use was not associated with adjuvant radiation [odds ratio (OR) 1.61, p = 0.11] or endocrine therapy (OR 1.12, p = 0.71). Conclusions The Society of Surgical Oncology guideline release, followed by implementation of a clinical tool to stratify by nodal risk, was associated with decreased SLN use in women aged >= 70 years, in those with clinically low-risk HR+ disease surgically treated with BCS. Adjusting for confounders, omission of SLN surgery was not associated with use of subsequent adjuvant radiation or hormonal therapy.

TI  - Spatially explicit changes in forest biomass carbon of China over the past 4 decades: Coupling long-term inventory and remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification of the spatial pattern of forest carbon (C) sinks in high resolution is helpful to reveal the factors that affect the C cycle and provides valuable information for developing sustainable forest management policies. Here we developed a method using the data of long-term forest inventories (1977-2018) and spatially-explicit remotely sensed information from land-use maps and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets, to estimate the spatial and temporal variation of forest biomass C in China. At first, we calculated forest biomass C stocks using the refined Continuous Biomass Expansion Factor (CBEF) model with parameters for each forest type based on eight national forest inventories. Secondly, based on multi-temporal land-use remote sensing and national forest inventory datasets, we obtained forest coverage datasets with high resolution (1 km*1 km). Thirdly, we downscaled the forest biomass C density using the calibrated forest coverage maps and the maximum NDVI values derived from GIMMS-NDVI3g imagery. Our results showed that China's forest functioned as a C sink of 3777.73 Tg C, and the C density of forest stands increased from 35.41 Mg C ha? 1 during 1977-1981 to 43.95 Mg C ha? 1 during 2014-2018. In addition, the validation results for most of the provinces based on published inventory estimates during the eight periods showed that the forest area at the pixel scale was successfully calibrated. From this, we produced the maps with a finer resolution for a series of spatially continuous forest biomass carbon density distribution and carbon sinks. Notably eight major forest projects have accounted for 44%-51% of the forest C stocks added in China from 1977 to 2018. Our research provides new insights for understanding and monitoring the spatiotemporal variations in of forest biomass and key information to support the development of new afforestation policies moving forward.

TI  - Evaluation of Remotely Sensed Precipitation Estimates from the NASA POWER Project for Drought Detection Over Jordan
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts can cause devastating impacts on water and land resources and therefore monitoring these events forms an integral part of planning. The most common approach for detecting drought events and assessing their intensity is use of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), which requires abundant precipitation records at good spatial distribution. This may restrict SPI usage in many regions around the world, particularly in areas with limited numbers of ground meteorological stations. Therefore, the use of remotely sensed derived data of precipitation can contribute to drought monitoring. In this study, remotely sensed precipitation estimates from the POWER/Agroclimatology archive of NASA and their derived SPI for different time intervals were evaluated against gauged observations of precipitation from 13 different stations in arid and semiarid locations in Jordan. Results showed significant correlations between remotely sensed and ground data with relatively high R values (0.67-0.91), particularly where seasonal precipitation exceeded 50 mm/year. For evaluation of remotely sensed data in SPI calculation, several objective functions were used; the results showed that SPI based on satellite estimates (SAT-SPI) showed good performance in detecting extreme droughts and indicating wet/dry conditions. However, SAT-SPI showed high tendency to overestimate drought intensity. Based on these findings, remotely sensed precipitation from the POWER/Agroclimatology archive showed good potential for use in detecting extreme meteorological drought with the provision of careful interpretation of the data. These types of studies are essential for evaluating the applicability of new drought monitoring information and tools to support decision-making at relevant scales.

Such changes result in a different energy balance according to land use and occupation characteristics, contributing to the generation of heat islands. This research aims to compare and analyze the intensities of day and night atmospheric and surface urban heat islands in Presidente Prudente, Brazil, and in Rennes, France. These are medium-sized cities located in continental tropical and temperate climates, respectively. Air temperatures were recorded in urban built areas and in other representative areas of rural environments in both cities. Surface temperature maps were plotted using images from the Landsat 8 satellite, band 10, thermal infrared channel/TIRS 1, taken during the night and the day. The results show that atmospheric (UHI) and surface (SUHI) heat islands do not present the same characteristics and that the dynamics of each heat island varies not only throughout the day, but also depending on the region's climate, meteorological condition, location, and types of land use. The details of surface temperatures and air temperatures during the satellite passage time (day and night) through points with typical characteristics of each city show the effects of vegetation and less built-up areas on reducing the differences between air and surface temperatures, evidencing the effects of buildings on increasing air temperatures, especially at night, when atmospheric heat islands are more intense. This research is original because relations between air and surface temperatures during the day and night were not previously studied in these cities. Thus, the results of this study may contribute to improving knowledge on urban climate and surface and atmospheric heat islands aiming to provide information for the management and planning of cities with different climate and historical backgrounds.

TI  - A two-year study of emerging micro-pollutants and drugs of abuse in two Western Cape wastewater treatment works (South Africa)
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the occurrence and fate of fourteen contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) at two South African wastewater treatment works (WWTW). Daily loads of the drug targets were calculated in the aqueous phase of influent- and effluent wastewater to evaluate their fate at the treatment works, along with populationnormalised daily loads in raw influent wastewater to identify community-wide substance use patterns in the two study areas. Environmental risk characterisation of the CECs at WWTW effluent discharge was done using conventional risk quotient (RQ) estimations. A significant reduction of most CECs was observed at both WWTW locations, except for some that have been previously recorded to persist through various WWTW processes globally, including the illicit drug methaqualone that was reported here for the first time to evaluate its fate during wastewater treatment, substance use trends, and potential toxicological risk. Moderate-to high-RQs were estimated for several target CECs during the sampling period for both treatment facilities. The results presented here suggest the need for a multi-disciplinary approach to WWTW monitoring of CECs and highlight the need for further refinement of risk assessment approaches to mitigate recalcitrant- or pseudo-persistent CECs in wastewater discharge. Such refinement should include: (1) identifying the potential ecological risk on a wider range of sentinel indicators, (2) interaction of CECs with various biochemical pathways (including sub-lethal toxicity responses), (3) identifying the persistence and toxicological risks of breakdown products and (4) partitioning of CECs in the aqueous environment and/or bioaccumulation in freshwater biota.

TI  - A deep learning method for building height estimation using high-resolution multi-view imagery over urban areas: A case study of 42 Chinese cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of building height is critical for understanding the urban development process. High-resolution optical satellite images can provide fine spatial details within urban areas, while they have not been applied to building height estimation over multiple cities and the feasibility of mapping building height at a fine scale (< 5 m) remains understudied. Multi-view satellite images can describe vertical information of buildings, due to the inconsistent response of buildings (e.g., spectral and structural variations) to different viewing angles, but they have not been employed to deep learning-based building height estimation. In this context, we introduce high-resolution ZY-3 multi-view images to estimate building height at a spatial resolution of 2.5 m. We propose a multi-spectral, multi-view, and multi-task deep network (called M(3)Net) for building height estimation, where ZY-3 multi-spectral and multi-view images are fused in a multi-task learning framework. A random forest (RF) method using multi-source features is also carried out for comparison. We select 42 Chinese cities with diverse building types to test the proposed method. Results show that the M(3)Net obtains a lower root mean square error (RMSE) than the RF, and the inclusion of ZY-3 multi-view images can significantly lower the uncertainty of building height prediction. Comparison with two existing state-of-the-art studies further confirms the superiority of our method, especially the efficacy of the M(3)Net in alleviating the saturation effect of high-rise building height estimation. Compared to the vanilla single/multi-task models, the M(3)Net also achieves a lower RMSE. Moreover, the spatial-temporal transferability test indicates the robustness of the M(3)Net to imaging conditions and building styles. The test of our method on a relatively large area (covering about 14,120 km(2)) further validates the scalability of our method from the perspectives of both efficacy and quality. The source code will be made available at https://github.com/lauraset/BuildingHeightModel.

TI  - Exploring the spatial pattern of urban heat island formation in relation to land transformation: A study on a mining industrial region of West Bengal, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth surface has transformed a lot by various deliberate and inadvertent anthropogenic activities; most profound among them are perhaps the changes in the land use land cover pattern of any area. It is considered to be responsible for many irreversible changes in the regional heat budget and water balance. Expansion of the built up area found to be modified the surface interaction of solar radiation thereby alters the surface temperature pattern of any region. Present study has been carried out in the Jamuria community development (C D.) block of West Bengal to examine the relation between land use land cover (LULC) change and its impact on the rising land surface temperature (LST) by using multi temporal satellite data. Urbanization, industrialization and mining activity in the study area found to be alters the LULC to a great extent which seems to be responsible for the general rise in the ambient temperature and micro climatic variation. Definite association has been found to be exists between LST and LULC pattern of the study area. Rise in the LST pattern are considered to be spatially associated with those areas where the intensity of land use change is maximum. Correlation between them, land use indices like normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built index (NDBI) etc and transect profile also confirmed these facts.

TI  - Assessment of the Grisotti oncoplastic procedure for the management of central breast tumors
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction The Grisotti technique consists to excise central breast tumor with nipple areolar and mobilize a dermo-glandular flap which is de-epithelized in order to reshape the breast and recreate an areola. The objective was to assess oncological results, postoperative side-effects, and patient and surgeon satisfaction rates resulting from this technique. Materials and methods From September 2016 to December 2019, 38 patients have been treated with a central breast tumor using the Grisotti technique. Results The mean age was 61.6 +/- 11. The median body mass index was 27 kg/m(2) [20-42]. Thirty one patients benefited from a sentinel lymph node dissection. Preoperative histology found a majority of invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) (71%). There were no intraoperative complications, and the average operating time was 90 min [60-200]. Postoperative histology found IDC associated with ductal carcinoma in situ in 28 patients. The surgical margins were invaded in two patients (reoperated by mastectomy after adjuvant treatment) and invasion of a margin of less than 1 mm in another six patients (supplemented by re-excision). The main postoperative complications were an abscess of the operating site and a partial necrosis of the neo-areola. The appearance of the breasts after radiotherapy gives a high satisfaction rate, both for patients and for surgeons. Conclusion The Grisotti technique is an easily reproducible procedure without major complications. It makes it possible to perform a carcinological satisfactory central lumpectomy, correction of the central glandular defect, and reconstruction of a new areola.

TI  - What shall we call God? An exploration of metaphors coded from descriptions of God from a large US undergraduate sample
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - People use numerous metaphors to describe God. God is seen as a bearded man, light, and love. Based on metaphor theories, the metaphors people use to refer to God reflect how people think about God and could, in turn, reflect their worldview. However, little work has explored the common metaphors for God. This was the purpose of the current investigation. Four trained raters coded open-ended responses from predominantly Christian U.S. undergraduates (N = 2,923) describing God for the presence or absence of numerous metaphoric categories. We then assessed the frequency of each of the metaphor categories. We identified 16 metaphor categories that were present in more than 1% of the responses. The top categories were "GOD IS POWER," "GOD IS HUMAN," and "GOD IS MALE." These findings were similar across religious affiliations. We attempted to support our coding analysis using top-down and bottom-up automated language analysis. Results from these analyses provided added confidence to our conclusions. We discuss the implications of our findings and the potential for future studies investigating important psychological and behavioral outcomes of using different metaphors for God.

TI  - A machine learning approach for monitoring Brazilian optical water types using Sentinel-2 MSI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical Water Type (OWT) is a useful parameter for assessing water quality changes related to different turbidity levels, trophic state and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) while also helpful for tuning chlorophyll-a algorithms. For this reason, interest in the satellite remote sensing of OWTs has recently increased in recent years. This study develops a machine learning method for monitoring Brazilian OWTs using the Sentinel-2 MSI, which can detect OWTs already assessed by field measurements and recognize new OWTs. The already assessed OWTs used for calibrating the machine learning algorithm are clear, moderate turbid, eutrophic turbid, eutrophic clear, hypereutrophic, CDOM richest, turbid, and very turbid waters. The classification method consists of two Support Vector Machines for classifying the known OWTs, while a novelty detection method based on sigmoid functions is used for assessing new OWTs. Results show the classification based on Sentinel-2 MSI bands simulated using field radiometric data is accurate (accuracy = 0.94). However, when radiometric errors are simulated, the accuracy significantly decreases to 0.75, 0.56, 0.45, and 0.37 as the mean absolute percent error increases to 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%, respectively. Considering the errors retrieved when comparing the field and satellite measurements, the expected accuracy of Sentinel-2 MSI images is 0.78. In the satellite images, the novelty detection distinguishes new OWTs originated from the mixture among the known OWTs and a new OWT that was not part of the training database (clear blue waters). Two examples of time series in the Funil reservoir and the Curuai lake are used to show the applicability of monitoring OWTs. In the Funil reservoir, OWTs could indicate eutrophication and turbid changes caused by river inflow and sediment sinking. In the Curuai lake, OWTs could indicate areas susceptible to algae bloom and turbidity increases related to river inflow and particle resuspension. In the future, the proposed algorithm could be used for large-scale assessment of water quality degradation and supports rapid mitigation and recovery responses. For improving the classification accuracy, adjacency correction and more robust glint removal methods should be developed.

TI  - Microsurgical techniques in the treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema: a systematic review of efficacy and patient outcomes
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Secondary lymphedema is the abnormal collection of lymphatic fluid within subcutaneous structures. Patients with lymphedema suffer a low quality of life. In our study, we aim to provide a systematic review of the current data on patient outcomes regarding breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL), and the most prevalent reconstructive techniques. Methods A PubMed (MEDLINE) and Scopus literature search was performed in September 2020. Studies were screened based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. The protocol was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), and it was reported in line with the PRISMA statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Results The search yielded 254 papers from 2010 to 2020. 67 were included in our study. Lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA)-a minimally invasive procedure diverting the lymph into the dermal venous drainage system-combined with postoperative bandaging and compression garments yields superior results with minimal donor site lymphedema morbidity. Vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT)-another microsurgical technique, often combined with autologous free flap breast reconstruction-improves lymphedema and brachial plexus neuropathies, and reduces the risk of cellulitis. The combination of LVA and VLNT or with other methods maximizes their effectiveness. Vascularized lymph vessel transfer (VLVT) consists of harvesting certain lymph vessels, sparing the donor site's lymph nodes. Conclusion Together with integrated lymphedema therapy, proper staging, and appropriate selection of procedure, safe and efficient surgical techniques can be beneficial to many patients with BCRL.

TI  - Mapping inter- and intra-annual dynamics in water surface area of the Tonle Sap Lake with Landsat time-series and water level data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water monitoring is the foundation of water resources management. However, large-scale surface water monitoring based on long-sequence Landsat images is easily affected by cloud cover. In this study, taking the Tonle Sap Lake in the lower Mekong as an example, a series of water-land boundaries with height attributes based on water level data were extracted from multi-temporal Landsat images without cloud cover using the optimal water index and the lakeshore elevation model (LEM) of Tonle Sap Lake was constructed. On this basis, with the help of the limited land-water boundary provided by the Landsat image over a longer period, long-term monitoring of the changes in the water area of the entire lake area was realized. The results show that the Landsat image data in conjunction with the LEM can effectively remove the effect of cloud cover in monitoring the change of long time series water bodies. Reconstruction of historical data on changes in the waters of Tonle Sap Lake with the proposed method shows that in the past 30 years, there has been no significant change in the water areas of Tonle Sap Lake in either the dry or rainy seasons. Water area changes of the lake have a delayed response of 1-3 months to changes in the water level of the Mekong River, which is more affected by the mainstream recharge. The water area of the lake is unaffected in the dry season; however, it is weakly affected in the rainy season by the Xiaowan and Nuozhadu hydropower stations in China.

TI  - Genomic-polygenic evaluations using random regression models with Legendre polynomials and linear splines for milk yield and fat percentage in the Thai multibreed dairy cattle population
T2  - LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aimed to compare single-step random regression models with third-order Legendre polynomials (RRLP) and splines with four (RRSP4) and five (RRSP5) knots for milk yield (MY) and fat percentage (FP) genomic-polygenic evaluations in the Thai multibreed dairy population. Models were compared using estimates of variance components, genetic parameters, goodness of fit, genomic-polygenic EBV (GPEBV) accuracies, and animal rankings. The dataset included pedigree and monthly test-day records (69,029 for MY; 29,878 for FP) of 7,206 first-lactation cows from 761 farms, and genotypic records (74,144 actual and imputed SNP) from 2,661 animals. Variance components and genetic parameters for MY and FP were estimated using REML procedures. Models contained contemporary group (herd-year-season), calving age, hetemzygosity, and population lactation curve regression coefficients as fixed effects. Random effects were animal additive genetic, permanent environment random regression coefficients, and residual. The population lactation curve, additive genetic, and permanent environment effects were fitted using regression coefficients of third-order Legendre polynomials for RRLP, splines of four knots for RRSP4, and five knots for RRSP5. The estimates of 305-day additive genetic variances ((sigma) over cap (2)(a)) and heritabilities ((h) over cap (2)) were higher for RRLP (MY: ((sigma) over cap (2)(a)) = 279,893.2 kg(2), (h) over cap (2) = 0.27; FP: ((sigma) over cap (2)(a)) = 0.10%(2), (h) over cap (2) = 0.16) than for RRSP4 (MY: ((sigma) over cap (2)(a)) = 260,178.1 kg(2), (h) over cap (2) = 0.19; FP: ((sigma) over cap (2)(a)) = 0.08%(2) , (h) over cap (2) = 0.11), and for RRSP5 (MY: ((sigma) over cap (2)(a)) = 266,198.0 kg(2), (h) over cap (2) = 0.20; FP: ((sigma) over cap (2)(a)) = 0.08% 2 , (h) over cap (2) = 0.12). Similarly, RRLP yielded better goodness of fit and higher GPEBV accuracies than RRSP4 and RRSP5. The goodness of fit values for RRLP were 293,813 for -2 loglikelihood (-21ogL), 293,855 for the Akaike's information criterion (AIC), and 293,915 for the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The corresponding values for RRSP4 were 362,738 for -21ogL, 362,888 for AIC, and 363,101 for BIC, and those for RRSP5 were 354,473 for -21ogL, 354,699 for AIC, and 355,020 for BIC. Lastly, the GPEBV accuracies for RRLP were 49.3% for MY and 38.6% for FP, those for RRSP4 were 47.2% for MY and 37.8% for FP, and the ones for RRSP5 were 47.4% for MY, 37.5% for FP. Rank correlations between animal GPEBV from these three models were high ranging from 0.91 to 0.98 for MY and 0.88 to 0.98 for FY. Results indicated that GPEBV from RRLP should be preferred to GPEBV from RRSP4 and RRSP5 to increase selection responses for MY and FP in the Thai multibreed dairy population.

TI  - Floods in Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur and lessons for French flood risk governance
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - France experiences catastrophic floods on a yearly basis, with significant societal impacts. In this study, we use multiple sources (insurance datasets, scientific articles, satellite data, and grey literature) to (1) analyze modern flood disasters in the PACA Region; (2) discuss the efficiency of French public policy instruments; (3) perform a SWOT analysis of French flood risk governance (FRG); and (4) suggest improvements to the FRG framework. Despite persistent government efforts, the impacts of flood events in the region have not lessened over time. Identical losses in the same locations are observed after repeated catastrophic events. Relative exposure to flooding has increased in France, apparently due to intense urbanization of flood-prone land. We suggest that the French FRG could benefit from the following improvements: (1) regular updates of risk prevention plans and tools; (2) the adoption of a build back better logic; (3) taking undeclared damages into account in flood risk models; (4) better communication between the actors at the different steps of each cycle (preparation, control, organization, etc.); (5) better communication between those responsible for risk prevention, emergency management, and disaster recovery; (6) an approach that extends the risk analysis outside the borders of the drainage basin; and (7) increased participation in FRG from local populations.

TI  - Functional land cover scale for three insect pests with contrasting dispersal strategies in a fragmented coffee-based landscape in Central Kenya
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Eastern Africa highlands, the gradual transformation of natural ecosystems to smallholding coffee-based agrosystems has resulted in more fragmented landscapes. Major pests of coffee find appropriate living conditions leading to high infestation rates and the need for smallholder farmers to implement pest control measures. This study aims to understand the influence of landscapes on the ecology of three major coffee pests: the coffee berry borer (CBB), Hypothenemus hampei, and the Antestia bugs Antestiopsis thunbergii (ABT) and A. facetoides (ABF). The study was conducted on a typical smallholder coffee-based landscape in central Kenya. The pest abundance was assessed monthly for two years in a network of 30 coffee plots spread across the coffee agroecological subzones (AEsZ), namely upper midland UM1 and UM2, and the transition zones between UM1 and UM2 and between UM2 and UM3, herein referred to as TZ1 and TZ2, respectively. Landscape metrics, viz. patch density, Euclidean nearest neighbour distance, proximity index, contagion index, interspersion and juxtaposition index were derived from a spatially explicit land cover map, based on 10 m Sentinel 2 data for nine buffer zones of radius ranging from 50 m to 1000 m around each sampled plot. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to establish the relationships between the observed pest abundances and landscape metrics, elevation, and AEsZ. Landscape indicators achieved the highest correlation with the pest abundances within a 300 m radius (Adjusted R2 0.5). Whereas beyond 300 m landscape scale, the predictor variables resulted in weak relationships (Adjusted R2 < 0.5) between the pests abundance and landscape metrics. We noted a strong influence of elevation and adjacency to cropland on Antestia bug populations. Specifically, ABF populations were negatively correlated with low elevation, whereas ABT's were positively correlated with high elevation zone. On the other hand, CBB was strongly influenced by contiguous coffee patches, especially in UM1 and UM2. Therefore, we recommend reducing connectivity between coffee patches for the management of CBB, whereas further studies should be conducted to identify secondary hosts of Antestia bugs that should not be adjacent or within coffee stands.

TI  - Phytoplankton blooms and its influencing environmental factors in the southern Yellow Sea
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton blooms are a widespread phenomenon in oceans that support the food webs and ecosystem. In this study, we analyzed temporal and spatial variations of phytoplankton blooms in the southern Yellow Sea (SYS) during 2003-2018, using the 8-day satellite datasets. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was performed to evaluate seasonal variability of phytoplankton blooms in the SYS. The first two EOF modes explained the main features of phytoplankton blooms in the SYS. The first EOF mode and the second EOF mode accounted for 49% and 10% of the total spatial variance of blooms in the SYS, respectively. The indices of phytoplankton phenology (bloom timing) revealed distinct phytoplankton growth patterns/regimes in different subregions of the SYS. Specifically, the coastal area of Shandong Peninsula (CASP) showed significantly higher biomass and longer duration of phytoplankton blooms from fall to following early spring, which spanned an average of about 20 weeks. However, spring and fall blooms were observed in the central area of the SYS (CASYS). The spring bloom was more than twice the size of the fall bloom. By exploring the relationships between the phytoplankton biomass and the physical and biological parameters between these two regions, we established that a relatively stable shallow water depth and sufficient nutrients concentrations were the mechanisms driving phytoplankton blooms.

TI  - A global analysis of the temporal availability of PlanetScope high spatial resolution multi-spectral imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The PlanetScope CubeSat constellation is providing unprecedented global coverage, visible to near infrared, atmospherically corrected, 3 m imagery. The revisit interval between successive overpasses varies in space and time in a complex manner because of a variety of factors and particularly because of the different sensor orbits. The temporal availability of PlanetScope imagery is quantified in this study considering all of the publicly available images acquired globally for a 12 month period from December 1st 2019 to November 30th 2020. A total of 175.8 million images were acquired by the constellation that was composed of between 100 and 133 unique PlanetScope sensors each month and three sensor generations. The local morning overpass times of the three sensor generations were quantified and the most frequently occurring times were 10:16, 10:29, and 10:03 (to the nearest minute) with 90% of the images acquired with a range of morning overpass times of 2 h and 13 min, 1 h and 30 min, and 1 h and 50 min, for PlanetScope-0, PlanetScope-1, and PlanetScope-2, respectively. Maps, histograms and summary statistics of the total number of observations and revisit intervals are derived with respect to a global grid of 4.7 million land points spaced 5.6 km apart in the equal area sinusoidal projection. The annual and monthly number of PlanetScope observations and average revisit intervals did not vary in a geographically uniform manner. This is due to several factors including the different PlanetScope orbits, seasonal high latitude darkness at the time of sensor overpass, and because of the changing number of sensors on orbit as PlanetScope sensors were decommissioned and later generations became operational over the 12 month study period. In addition, the images in each frame of sensed data are not made available if they cannot be geolocated due to cloud and/or featureless or unstructured terrain precluding ground control matching. The PlanetScope constellation provided higher temporal resolution than provided by sensors such as Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2 although 9% of the global land grid locations, predominantly in the interior of Greenland and non coastal Antarctica, had no observations. Considering the 12 months of global observations, the median average revisit interval was only 30.3 h, and 9.6%, 71.8%, and 88.4% of the land points had average revisit intervals <24 h, <36 h, and < 48 h, respectively. Globally, the median minimum revisit interval was 25 s and the median maximum revisit interval was 9.15 days; 95.4% of the land grid points had a minimum revisit <180 s, and 89.1% had a maximum revisit <480 h (20 days). The PlanetScope images are labelled as "standard" or as "test" quality based on solar geometry, saturated pixel, and geolocation accuracy criteria. The median annual proportion of observations labelled as "standard" at each land grid point over the 12 months was 78.14%. A global cloud analysis was undertaken to quantify the probability of there being at least one and at least two cloud-free PlanetScope observations within 5, 7 and 10 day consecutive periods. Lower probabilities occurred in cloudy regions and where there were fewer observations. The global mean average probability of there being at least one cloud-free observation over the 12 study months was 0.84, 0.88 and 0.92 for the 5, 7 and 10 day periods respectively. The global mean average probability of there being at least two cloud-free observations was 0.65, 0.76 and 0.84 for the 5, 7 and 10 day periods respectively.The probabilities varied seasonally and the northern hemisphere winter (December-February) and spring (March-May) had lower and higher global mean average seasonal probabilities, respectively, than those derived over the 12 months. The high temporal global coverage provided by the PlanetScope constellation will benefit new applications in particular those concerned with assessment of rapidly changing phenomena and assessment of phenomena that cannot be resolved at moderate and coarse resolution.

TI  - Breast cancer metastasis: immune profiling of lymph nodes reveals exhaustion of effector T cells and immunosuppression
T2  - MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph nodes are the first nodes draining the lymph from a breast and could reveal early changes in the host immune system upon dissemination of breast cancer cells. To investigate this, we performed single-cell immune profiling of lymph nodes with and without metastatic cells. Whereas no significant changes were observed for B-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell subsets, metastatic lymph nodes had a significantly increased frequency of CD8 T cells and a skewing toward an effector/memory phenotype of CD4 and CD8 T cells, suggesting an ongoing immune response. Additionally, metastatic lymph nodes had an increased frequency of TIGIT (T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains)-positive T cells with suppressed TCR signaling compared with non-metastatic nodes, indicating exhaustion of effector T cells, and an increased frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs) with an activated phenotype. T-cell alterations correlated with the percentage of metastatic tumor cells, reflecting the presence of metastatic tumor cells driving T effector cells toward exhaustion and promoting immunosuppression by recruitment or increased differentiation toward Tregs. These results show that immune suppression occurs already in early stages of tumor progression.

TI  - Dispersion of adeleid oocysts by vertebrates in Gran Canaria, Spain: report and literature review
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Within the family Adeleidae, Adelina spp. belong to a group of arthropod pathogens. These parasites have been reported to have a wide geographic distribution, however, there are no reports of these protists in the Canary Islands, Spain. One of the peculiarities of the life cycle of Adelina spp. is the participation of a predator, because fecundation and sporulation occur inside the body cavity, and so necessitate destruction of the definitive host. The involvement therefore of a 'dispersion host', which eats the definitive host and spreads the oocysts through its faeces, is critical for the maintenance of certain Adelina spp. On the island of Gran Canaria, adeleid oocysts have been found in stool samples from four animals, three California kingsnakes (Lampropeltis californiae), and one feral cat. These animals were part of a larger coprological study of vertebrate parasites (117 snakes, 298 cats), where pseudoparasitic elements were also recorded. L. californiae and feral cats are invasive species which are widespread across the island and this novel finding of Adelina spp. oocysts in their faeces suggests that they could also serve as potential sentinel species for arthropod parasites.

TI  - Season of Data Collection of Child Dietary Diversity Indicators May Affect Conclusions About Longer-Term Trends in Peru, Senegal, and Nepal
T2  - CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The WHO-UNICEF minimum dietary diversity (MDD) indicator for children aged 6-23 mo is a global monitoring indicator used to track multi-year population-level changes in dietary quality, but the influence of seasonality on MDD estimates remains unclear.Objectives: To examine how seasonality of data collection may influence population-level MDD estimates and inferences about MDD changes over multiple survey years.Methods: We selected countries with 3 or more consecutive years of MDD data collection, including continuous national Demographic Health Surveys in Senegal (2012-2017; n = 12,183) and Peru (2005-2016; n = 35,272) and the Policy and Science for Health, Agriculture, and Nutrition sentinel site seasonal surveys (covering 3 seasons/y) in Nepal (2013-2016; n = 1309). The MDD prevalence (>= 5 of 8 food groups) and an 8-item continuous Food Group Score (FGS) and 95% CIs were estimated by month and compared for lean and non-lean seasons using ordinary least squares regression with dummy variables for year.Results: The national prevalence of MDD was higher in Peru (75.4%) than in Nepal (39.1%) or in Senegal (15.7%). Children in Peru were 1.8% (coefficient, -0.0179; 95% CI, -0.033 to -0.002) less likely to achieve MDD during the lean season. Similar seasonal magnitudes were observed in Senegal (coefficient, -0.0347; 95% CI, -0.058 to -0.011) and Nepal (coefficient, -0.0133; 95% CI, -0.107 to 0.081). The FGS was about 0.1 item lower during the lean season in all 3 countries. In comparison, MDD increased by an average rate of only 4.2 and 4.4 percentage points per 5 y in Peru and Senegal, respectively. Intakes of specific food groups were stable across months in all countries, with the provitamin A-rich food group exhibiting the most seasonality.Conclusions: The magnitude of seasonal variation in MDD prevalence was smaller than expected but large relative to longer-term changes. If large-scale surveys are not conducted in the same season, biased conclusions about trends are possible.

TI  - Risk factors and preventive strategies for unintentionally retained surgical sharps: a systematic review
T2  - PATIENT SAFETY IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background A retained surgical item (RSI) is defined as a never-event and can have drastic consequences on patient, provider, and hospital. However, despite increased efforts, RSI events remain the number one sentinel event each year. Hard foreign bodies (e.g. surgical sharps) have experienced a relative increase in total RSI events over the past decade. Despite this, there is a lack of literature directed towards this category of RSI event. Here we provide a systematic review that focuses on hard RSIs and their unique challenges, impact, and strategies for prevention and management. Methods Multiple systematic reviews on hard RSI events were performed and reported using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and AMSTAR (Assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews) guidelines. Database searches were limited to the last 10 years and included surgical "sharps," a term encompassing needles, blades, instruments, wires, and fragments. Separate systematic review was performed for each subset of "sharps". Reviewers applied reciprocal synthesis and refutational synthesis to summarize the evidence and create a qualitative overview. Results Increased vigilance and improved counting are not enough to eliminate hard RSI events. The accurate reporting of all RSI events and near miss events is a critical step in determining ways to prevent RSI events. The implementation of new technologies, such as barcode or RFID labelling, has been shown to improve patient safety, patient outcomes, and to reduce costs associated with retained soft items, while magnetic retrieval devices, sharp detectors and computer-assisted detection systems appear to be promising tools for increasing the success of metallic RSI recovery. Conclusion The entire healthcare system is negatively impacted by a RSI event. A proactive multimodal approach that focuses on improving team communication and institutional support system, standardizing reports and implementing new technologies is the most effective way to improve the management and prevention of RSI events.

TI  - Development of a Practical Atmospheric Correction Algorithm for Inland and Nearshore Coastal Waters
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A practical Atmospheric Correction algorithm for inLand and Nearshore Coastal waters (ACLANC) is proposed in this study. The ACLANC algorithm uses interpolated aerosol optical depth (AOD) products (AOD $_{{interp}})$ from nearby land surfaces and simulates the corresponding aerosol reflectance spectrum using a combination of the continental model in the satellite signal in the solar spectrum-vector (6SV) radiative transfer code and an approximate aerosol model (r85f20) in the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Data Analysis System (SeaDAS). Validations with worldwide $in situ$ measurements show that the ACLANC-derived remote-sensing reflectance ( $R_{{rs}}$ ) for nine Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bands agreed well with the $in situ$ datasets, where the mean R-2 was 0.77 +/- 0.09 and the mean unbiased percent difference was 28.7% +/- 9.8%. ACLANC outperformed the existing atmospheric correction algorithms in not only the accuracy of the $R_{{rs}}$ retrievals but also data coverage. Vicarious calibration over the ACLANC algorithm showed minor improvement in the derived $R_{{rs}}$ products. Error budget analysis revealed that the uncertainties in AOD $_{{interp}}$ represent >50% of the errors for ACLANC and that this proportion increases with decreasing AOD. Further efforts can also be applied to improve the aerosol models, especially for turbid aerosol environments, where the fixed aerosol model in SeaDAS contributes up to 30% of the error budget. The ACLANC algorithm can potentially be implemented in ocean color missions other than MODIS to obtain $R_{{rs}}$ with high accuracy and wide coverage for global inland and nearshore coastal waters.

TI  - A review of GIS methodologies to analyze the dynamics of COVID-19 in the second half of 2020
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Review
AB  - COVID-19 has infected over 163 million people and has resulted in over 3.9 million deaths. Regarding the tools and strategies to research the ongoing pandemic, spatial analysis has been increasingly utilized to study the impacts of COVID-19. This article provides a review of 221 scientific articles that used spatial science to study the pandemic published from June 2020 to December 2020. The main objectives are: to identify the tools and techniques used by the authors; to review the subjects addressed and their disciplines; and to classify the studies based on their applications. This contribution will facilitate comparisons with the body of work published during the first half of 2020, revealing the evolution of the COVID-19 phenomenon through the lens of spatial analysis. Our results show that there was an increase in the use of both spatial statistical tools (e.g., geographically weighted regression, Bayesian models, spatial regression) applied to socioeconomic variables and analysis at finer spatial and temporal scales. We found an increase in remote sensing approaches, which are now widely applied in studies around the world. Lockdowns and associated changes in human mobility have been extensively examined using spatiotemporal techniques. Another dominant topic studied has been the relationship between pollution and COVID-19 dynamics, which enhance the impact of human activities on the pandemic's evolution. This represents a shift from the first half of 2020, when the research focused on climatic and weather factors. Overall, we have seen a vast increase in spatial tools and techniques to study COVID-19 transmission and the associated risk factors.

TI  - Seasonal variability of daily evapotranspiration and energy fluxes in the Central Andes of Peru using eddy covariance techniques and empirical methods
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyze the mechanisms associated to evapotranspiration over the high central Peruvian Andes, a place where evapotranspiration has been poorly characterized. We made use of the eddy covariance system (sonic anemometer and a krypton hygrometer) installed at the Huancayo Observatory (12.04 degrees S, 75.32 degrees, 3330 m. a.s.l.) to document for the first time the hourly, daily and monthly variability of surface energy fluxes from July 2016 to June 2017. The relationship between evapotranspiration and meteorological variables is also examined. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of three empirical equations that estimate the potential evapotranspiration to explore their adequacy in the central Peruvian Andes. These are the FAO Penman-Monteith (PM), Priestley-Taylor (PT) and Hargreaves. Likewise, the accuracy of the MODIS16A2 evapotranspiration product was also examined. We show that evapotranspiration over the high central Peruvian Andes is modulated by the water- and energylimited states during the dry and wet season, respectively. During the wet season (January-March), latent heat flux (LE) is greater than sensible heat flux (H), and the daily evapotranspiration variability is mainly related to incoming solar radiation (SW down arrow; R2 = 0.76, p-value < 0.01), having a daily mean of 3.45 mm. In contrast, the dry season (June-August) is characterized by a greater H with a daily mean evapotranspiration of 0.95 mm. Furthermore, evapotranspiration is significantly tied to the soil moisture variability on daily time scales (R2 = 0.77, p-value < 0.01). Of the three equations, PT has a good performance in reproducing the daily evapotranspiration variability (R2 > 0.72; p-value < 0.01). In contrast, strong biases are noticed during the dry season mainly because this empirical equation does not account for the soil water content. Thus, our results show that the inclusion of soil water content or a physiological-plant parameter would be necessary to estimate the real evapotranspiration during the dry season.

TI  - Can vegetation index track the interannual variation in gross primary production of temperate deciduous forests?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Vegetation indices (VIs) by remote sensing are widely used as simple proxies of the gross primary production (GPP) of vegetation, but their performances in capturing the inter-annual variation (IAV) in GPP remain uncertain. Methods We evaluated the performances of various VIs in tracking the IAV in GPP estimated by eddy covariance in a temperate deciduous forest of Northeast China. The VIs assessed included the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) obtained from tower-radiometers (broadband) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), respectively. Results We found that 25%-35% amplitude of the broadband EVI tracked the start of growing season derived by GPP (R-2: 0.56-0.60, bias < 4 d), while 45% (or 50%) amplitudes of broadband (or MODIS) NDVI represented the end of growing season estimated by GPP (R-2: 0.58-0.67, bias < 3 d). However, all the VIs failed to characterize the summer peaks of GPP. The growing-season integrals but not averaged values of the broadband NDVI, MODIS NIRv and EVI were robust surrogates of the IAV in GPP (R-2: 0.40-0.67). Conclusion These findings illustrate that specific VIs are effective only to capture the GPP phenology but not the GPP peak, while the integral VIs have the potential to mirror the IAV in GPP.

TI  - Modeling air pollution-related hospital admissions employing remote sensing and geographical information systems
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use regression models and remote sensing data have been widely employed to forecast atmospheric aerosol levels. Recently, these methodologies have been combined to predict the influence of this pollutant on human health. However, traditional land-use regression models do not often consider the complex interactions between predictors, and most of these do not include socioeconomic variables. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to estimate suspended particle-related hospital admissions by employing remote sensing, meteorological, environmental, and demographic parameters. In this cohort study, we analyzed 1,612,049 hospital admissions from C ' ordoba city, Argentina, from 2005 to 2011, and developed several regression and machine learning land-use models to compare their predictive powers. We found that childhood was the age group with the highest number of hospital admissions related with upper respiratory tract diseases. When predicting populationnormalized hospital admissions, the machine learning models, in particular the generalized boosted machine, revealed a better performance than regression models, exhibiting the lowest root mean square error (0.4264) in the test data set. This model also achieved the best R2adj (0.6088) when plotting predicted vs. reported normalized cases. The most important predictors were the meteorological variables, followed by the aerosol optical depth and the planet boundary layer height. Some other predictors, such as educational level, land value, and unsatisfied basic needs, showed less relevance but enhanced the model's prediction power. Furthermore, the predictive power increased after a 1-day lag in hospital admissions (RMSE = 0.4121), highlighting the importance of meteorological and environmental variables in the onset of respiratory diseases.

TI  - Prognosis and Chemotherapy Use in Breast Cancer Patients with Multiple Lymphatic Micrometastases: An NCDB Analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The number of involved lymph nodes negatively affects prognosis in breast cancer patients. Nevertheless, current staging and treatment recommendations do not distinguish between patients with single versus multiple lymphatic micrometastases. In this study, we aim to better characterize these patients. Methods The National Cancer Database was retrospectively queried to identify 486,800 women with stage I-III, estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/PR+/HER2-) breast cancer and nodal status of N0, N1mi with 1 (Nmic1) or more (Nmic > 1) involved nodes, and N1 with 1 involved node (N1.1), from 2010 to 2016. Patients with different nodal statuses were compared regarding treatment characteristics, survival, and benefit from chemotherapy by their 21-gene recurrence score (RS). Results Of the 23,072 N1mi patients, 88.3% were Nmic1 and 11.7% were Nmic > 1. Nmic > 1 patients were younger, had larger and higher-grade tumors, with more lymphovascular invasion, and were more commonly treated by axillary dissection, radiation, and chemotherapy than Nmic1 patients. In that, they were comparable with N1.1 patients. Five-year survival of Nmic > 1 patients (88.1%) was worse than Nmic1 patients (90.1%; p = 0.02), but similar to N1.1 patients (87.9%). Nmic1, Nmic > 1, and N1.1 patients with RS 11-25 exhibited a 25, Nmic > 1 patients showed a 3.5% benefit, similar to Nmic1 (4.8%) and lower than N1.1 (10.9%) patients. Conclusions Nmic > 1 breast cancer patients have worse prognoses than Nmic1 patients, similar to N1.1 patients. Our data suggest those patients with RS 11-25 have minimal benefit from chemotherapy. These findings should be taken into account when discussing prognosis and considering chemotherapy in patients with lymphatic micrometastases.

TI  - Histological regression in melanoma: impact on sentinel lymph node status and survival
T2  - MODERN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Regression in melanoma is an immunological phenomenon that results in partial or complete replacement of the tumor with variably vascular fibrous tissue, often accompanied by pigment-laden macrophages and chronic inflammation. In some cases, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) may represent the earliest phase of this process. The prognostic significance of regression has long been a matter of debate, with inconsistent findings reported in the literature to date. This study sought to determine whether regression in primary cutaneous melanomas predicted sentinel lymph node (SLN) status and survival outcomes in a large cohort of patients managed at a single centre. Clinical and pathological parameters for 8,693 consecutive cases were retrieved. Associations between regression and SLN status, overall survival (OS), melanoma-specific survival (MSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were investigated using logistic and Cox regression. Histological evidence of regression was present in 1958 cases (22.5%). Regression was significantly associated with lower Breslow thickness, lower mitotic rate, and absence of ulceration (p < 0.0001). Multivariable analysis showed that regression in combination with TILs independently predicted a negative SLN biopsy (OR 0.33; 95% C.I. 0.20-0.52; p < 0.0001). Patients whose tumors showed both regression and TILs had the highest 10-year OS (65%, 95% C.I. 59-71%), MSS (85%, 95% C.I. 81-89%), and RFS (60%, 95% C.I. 54-66%). On multivariable analyses, the concurrent presence of regression and TILs independently predicted the lowest risk of death from melanoma (HR 0.69; 95% C.I. 0.51-0.94; p = 0.0003) as well as the lowest rate of disease recurrence (HR 0.71; 95% C.I. 0.58-0.85; p < 0.0001). However, in contrast, in the subgroup analysis of Stage III patients, the presence of regression predicted the lowest OS and RFS, with MSS showing a similar trend. Overall, these findings indicate a prognostically favorable role of regression in primary cutaneous melanoma. However, in Stage III melanoma patients, regression may be a marker of more aggressive disease.

TI  - Impacts of changes in mangrove ecosystems in the Ba and rewa deltas, Fiji using multi-temporal landsat data and social survey
T2  - COASTAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the expected importance, the changes in mangrove ecosystems and the main causes in Fiji have not been well addressed. To address the issues, we collected data from multiple sources to assess mangrove ecosystem variation due to both natural factors and human impacts in the Ba and Rewa deltas, Fiji. Landsat satellite data were used to map the land use and cover of the study area from 2000 to 2020. Questionnaire surveys were conducted to identify the main uses of mangroves that could influence mangrove ecosystems. Over the period investigated, the mangrove area increased by 572 ha (by 12%) in Ba and decreased by 697 ha (by 9%) in Rewa. The social survey revealed that 45% of respondents in the Ba delta and 20% in the Rewa delta visited the mangrove area daily in search of food resources. The net annual economic loss and lost functioning of mangroves as an anthropogenic CO2 reservoir caused by mangrove degradation in the two deltas were estimated to be 335,000 USD and 202 t-C, respectively. Because local livelihoods are strongly linked with mangroves, the outcomes of this study will provide preliminary information for policy interventions to ensure the sustainability of the mangrove ecosystem.

TI  - Microwave versus Optical Remote Sensing Data in Urban Footprint Mapping of the Coastal City of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban dynamic temporal analysis is essential for the policymaker, natural resources management plan, decision-makers, and scientific purposes. Satisfactory urban management strategies depend on consistent plotting of land use land cover changes. Remote sensing procedures in temporal change detection bring reliability to the decision taker for wide-cover management plans. Two temporal datasets of images were processed to estimate the urban dynamics in current research. SAR microwave data and MSI optical data were acquired from the European Space Agency in 2016 and 2020. For each dataset, preprocessing and data-specific processing procedures were followed to estimate the Urban Footprint within the study area. The urban coherence technique was applied to SAR data, and the change detection technique based on supervised classification was applied on MSI data to estimate the Urban Footprint. The accuracy assessment was estimated using ground truth points (150) as well as training sites (30). The results indicated that the urban expansion in Jeddah city was increased to be nearly 8% using optical data; however, it was increased to be less than 3% using SAR data. Irrespective of MSI data accuracy assessment (83.19%), SAR data showed more consistent Urban Footprinting (92.35%). Therefore, the urban coherence of the coastal city of Jeddah is reliably emphasized using SAR data over MSI data which is a decision-making significance to manage the natural resources within comparable arid environments.

TI  - 'I just want to be a grandmother, not a caregiver for their kids' Perceptions of childminding among Pacific grandparents living in Aotearoa, New Zealand
T2  - HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A growing body of research indicates both positive and negative effects of grandparent childcare; effects that are largely dependent upon the context and intensity of the care are required. Here, we suggest that context to be inclusive of cultural background. Drawing on the indigenous methodological framework, talanoa, the views of 13 Pacific Island grandparents in relation to themes of grandparent childminding are explored, as well its proximity to perceptions of elder abuse. A cultural analysis reveals that traditions specific to the Pacific way of life may lead to increased risk of prolonged childcare. The participants in this study felt that prolonged childminding deprived them of time which could be used to benefit them and their community in the long run. It was viewed as a form of disrespect, as older people are revered and held in high regard in decision making activities from the Pacific worldview. The participants embraced their roles as the knowledge holders of cultural treasures; responsible for teaching children and grandchildren their genealogy and language, and for upholding the protocols of their cultural heritage. However, they felt their contributions were not reciprocated nor valued, but instead exploited.

TI  - Effectiveness of monovalent rotavirus vaccine against hospitalizations due to all rotavirus and equine-like G3P[8] genotypes in Haiti 2014-2019
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Rotavirus vaccines are effective in preventing severe rotavirus. Haiti introduced 2-dose monovalent (G1P[8]) rotavirus vaccine recommended for infants at 6 and 10 weeks of age in 2014. We calculated the effectiveness of rotavirus vaccine against hospitalization for acute gastroenteritis in Haiti.Methods: We enrolled children 6-59 months old admitted May 2014-September 2019 for acute watery diarrhea at any sentinel surveillance hospital. Stool was tested for rotavirus using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and genotyped with multiplex one-step RT-PCR assay and Sanger sequencing for stratification by genotype. We used a case-negative design where cases were children positive for rotavirus and controls were negative for rotavirus. Only children eligible for vaccination were included and a child was consid-ered vaccinated if vaccine was given >= 14 days before enrollment. We used unconditional logistic regres-sion to calculate odds ratios and calculated 2-dose and 1-dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) as (1 -odds ratio) * 100.Results: We included 129 (19%) positive cases and 543 (81%) negative controls. Among cases, 77 (60%) were positive for equine-like G3P[8]. Two doses of rotavirus vaccine were 66% (95% CI: 44, 80) effective against hospitalizations due to any strain of rotavirus and 64% (95% CI: 33, 81) effective against hospital-izations due to the equine-like G3P[8] genotype.Conclusions: These findings are comparable to other countries in the Americas region. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first VE estimate both against the equine-like G3P[8] genotype and from a Caribbean country. Overall, these results support rotavirus vaccine use and demonstrate the importance of complete vaccination. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A National Survey of Breast Surgeons and Radiation Oncologists on Contemporary Axillary Management in Mastectomy Patients
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Management of axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer has undergone significant change over the past decade through landmark clinical trials. This study aimed to assess national practice patterns in axillary management in patients undergoing upfront mastectomy and examines what guides provider recommendations. Methods A national case-based survey study was performed of surgeons and radiation oncologists from July to August 2020. Surgeons were identified through the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) after review and approval by the ASBrS Research Committee, and radiation oncologists were identified through an institutional database. Both descriptive and comparative statistical analyses were performed. Results Overall, 994 providers responded-680 surgeons and 314 radiation oncologists. Surgeons were older and in practice longer (p < 0.05) and treated a higher percentage of breast patients (81% vs. 40%, p < 0.001). Most surgeons were hospital-employed (43%), whereas most radiation oncologists were in private practice (40%; p < 0.001). Fifty-two percent of surgeons routinely send sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) for frozen section (52%) during mastectomy, of which 78% proceed directly to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) if positive. There was significant variability in treatment recommendations between the two groups among the hypothetical cases (p < 0.001). In the setting of low disease burden in the SLNs, > 30% of surgeons recommended ALND, while radiation oncologists recommend axillary radiotherapy over axillary clearance (p < 0.001). Conclusion There is significant heterogeneity in the management of the axilla in mastectomy patients with pathologically positive SLNs, both between and among surgeons and radiation oncologists. Efforts should be made to assist both groups in identifying de-escalation opportunities to ensure that mastectomy patients with positive SLNs are treated appropriately.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy versus elective neck dissection in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity with a clinically N0 neck: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an emerging strategy for managing early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with a clinically N0 (cN0) neck. However, the role of SLNB in this scenario is debatable. Herein, relevant literature was systematically reviewed, and a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the potential dividends of SLNB compared to elective neck dissection (END) for these patients. The meta-analysis, including six prospective studies, showed comparable results of the two management strategies in terms of regional recurrence (risk ratio [RR] = 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-1.70), 5-year disease-free survival (RR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.87-1.11), and 5-year overall survival (RR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.90-1.13). Fewer adverse events occurred in the SLNB arm than in the END arm (RR = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.70). Overall, SLNB results in as favorable an oncologic prognosis for patients with cN0 oral SCC as END, while significantly lessening side effects and unnecessary surgeries.

TI  - Hospitalization of unintentional fall injuries in Kuwait: a national database study
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Accidental falls are a major cause of morbidity placing pressure on hospital capacity and utilizing costly services. Evaluating the burden of falls is key for planning, implementation, and evaluation of prevention strategies. To date, no studies have been published on accidental falls at the population level in Kuwait. We studied the burden of accidental falls on public hospital inpatient capacity in Kuwait and identified the subgroups with the highest utilization of inpatient service days. Methods From the national database of inpatient hospitalizations, we selected hospitalizations of patients admitted to Kuwait's public hospitals for unintentional injury caused by an accidental fall from 1 January through 31 December 2016. We studied the number of inpatient service days (bed days), length of stay (LOS), and number of hospitalizations by age group, gender, and nationality. Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and Chi square tests were used for comparison. Logistic regression was used to quantify the risk of prolonged LOS and fractures among fall-related hospitalizations. Results Accidental falls were responsible for 2.9% of inpatient hospitalizations, 3.7% of inpatient service days (61,140 days) with an ALOS of 9.1 days in Kuwait's public hospitals in 2016. Accidental falls were responsible for 4.6% of older adult service days, and an even higher 5.6% of older women service days. In the age group 13-64, fall-related service days for non-Kuwaitis (5.7%) were more than triple those for Kuwaitis (1.8%) with a substantial percentage among male non-Kuwaitis (8.1%). The risk factors for exceeding the national ALOS for fall-related hospitalizations were female gender (OR 1.36), age 65 and older (OR 9.72), age 13-64 (OR 5.20), being non-Kuwaiti (OR 1.39), sustaining a femur fracture (OR 11.67), and undergoing surgery (OR 2.63). Fall-related hospitalizations associated with a higher risk of fractures were females (OR 1.22), patients 65 years and older (OR 5.09), patients aged 13-64 (OR 3.65), and non-Kuwaitis (OR 1.28). Conclusions Accidental falls impose a considerable burden on inpatient service utilization in Kuwait. This varies by age, gender, and nationality. To reduce this burden, prevention programs should target working-age non-Kuwaiti males and older females.

TI  - Integration of Landsat 8, gravity, and field data for exploration of gold mineralization in Gamba District, Northern Cameroon
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is a robust and useful tool for providing high-resolution image data and enabling reliable geological mapping during the initial stage of mineral exploration. One of its main applications is the extraction of lineaments and to locate alteration areas to target gold exploration. It has been long used in the Pan-African belt of Cameroon to identify a hydrothermal alteration and a great number of lineaments associated with mineralizations. The study area located in the Pan-African belt hosts numerous alluvial gold deposits where the primary mineralization was still largely poorly unknown until now, due to deep weathering. Therefore, remote sensing combined with field data is useful for targeting potential zones of primary gold resources involved in the hydrothermal and lineament systems. In this study, remote sensing data from Landsat 8 imagery were selected to map the distribution of hydrothermal minerals, and gravity data were interpreted for highlighting structural patterns related to the control of high-potential zone for gold mineralization, generating a mineral prospect map. The lineaments network shows directions ranging from ENE-WSW to E-W, with main direction N45 degrees and a secondary striking N275 degrees. Image enhancement/processing techniques included the application of band ratio and principal component analysis that were helpful to demarcate potential alteration zones marked by iron oxide/hydroxides in which haematite and pyrite are used as proximal alterations and hydroxyl-bearing minerals in which sericite (muscovite) is used as a marker of proximal alteration, while chlorite, epidote, biotite, quartz, and calcite are used as distal alteration zone, as described by field and petrographic data. The identified alteration zones display a high consistency with the known locations of gold occurrences (mining sites) and closely concordant with large-scale gold mineralization in the study area. This study presents an integrated approach of Landsat 8 imagery with gravity data and field data for discovering primary mineral resources in a deep weathering area.

TI  - Stage-specific trends in incidence and survival of cutaneous melanoma in the Netherlands (2003-2018): A nationwide population-based study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To examine stage-specific trends in the incidence and survival of cutaneous melanoma in the Netherlands between 2003 and 2018, as well as the uptake of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and novel drugs during that period.Methods: Data were obtained from the nationwide population- based Netherlands Cancer Registry for all patients diagnosed with invasive primary cutaneous melanoma (n = 60,267). We presented age-standardized incidence rates, the proportion of patients with an SLNB, the proportion of patients who received a novel drug (for their primary diagnosis) and one- and five-year relative survival rates.Results: Between 2003 and 2018, the incidence rate increased from 10.9 to 23.9 for men and from 15.6 to 27.3 for women. This increase reflected the increasing incidence rate of patients with stage I and III. The proportion of patients with an SLNB increased from 23% to 64%. A reasonable increase was observed in the proportion of patients with a positive outcome (from 2% to 11%). For patients with stage IV, there was a shift from chemotherapy towards novel drugs as from 2013. The five-year relative survival rate increased from 81% to 92% for men and from 88% to 96% for women. This increase reflected the increasing five-year relative survival rate of patients with stage II, III, and IV.Conclusion: We observed an increase in incidence for patients with stage I and III and an improvement in survival for patients with stage II, III and IV. These trends can be partly explained by the introduction of the SLNB and the novel drugs. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Urbanization, ambient air pollution, and prevalence of chronic kidney disease: A nationwide cross-sectional study
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - An increasing number of studies have linked ambient air pollution to chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence. However, its potential effect modification by urbanization has not been investigated. Based on data of 47,204 adults from the China National Survey of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKSCKD) dataset, night light satellite remote sensing data and high-resolution air pollution inversion products, the present cross-sectional study investigated the association between fine particulate matter <2.5 mm in diameter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), night light index (NLI) and CKD prevalence in China, and the effect modification by urbanization characterized by administrative classification and NLI on the pollutant-health associations. Our results showed that a 10-mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 at 3-year moving average, a 10-mu g/m(3) increase in NO2 at 5-year moving average, and a 10-U increase in NLI at 5-year moving average were significantly associated with increased odds of CKD prevalence [OR = 1.24 (95 %CI:1.14, 1.35); OR = 1.12 (95 %CI:1.09, 1.15); OR = 1.05 (95 %CI:1.02, 1.07)]. Meanwhile, the pollutant-health associations were more apparent in medium-urbanized areas compared to low- and high-urbanized areas. For instance, a 10-mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 concentration at 2-year moving average was associated with increased odds of CKD in the areas with NLI level in the second [OR = 2.78 (95 %CI:1.77, 4.36)] and third quartiles [OR = 1.49 (95 %CI:1.14, 1.95)], compared to the lowest [OR = 0.96 (95% CI: 0.73, 1.26)] and highest [OR = 0.63 (95% CI: 0.39-1.02)] quartiles. PM2.5 and NO2 were associated with increased odds of CKD prevalence, especially in areas with medium NLI levels, suggesting the necessity of strengthening environmental management in medium-urbanized regions.

TI  - The impacts of vegetation on the soil surface freezing-thawing processes at permafrost southern edge simulated by an improved process-based ecosystem model
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost degradation due to climate warming would potentially increase the release of previously frozen soil carbon and change the carbon budget of the cold region ecosystem. The underlying permafrost degradation would be effectively mediated by soil surface freezing-thawing (FT) processes. Aboveground vegetation can regulate soil FT processes, however its effects on ground thermal transfer have not been well represented by ecosystem models. In this study, we improved the hydrothermal module of the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) through more careful parameterization of snowpack density, puddled water, soil organic matter and super-cooled soil water. The impacts of vegetation on the soil surface FT processes have also been investigated using the improved BEPS model and the measured soil temperature data at forest and grassland sites on the southern edge of permafrost region in Mongolia and northeastern China. The improved BEPS model performs better than the original model in simulations of soil temperature and soil FT processes. Smaller amplitudes of soil diurnal FT cycles were found in forest sites compared to grassland sites. Forest sites have delayed soil thaw timing and similar soil freezing time compared to grassland sites. Differences in snow depths and soil organic matter content due to distinct vegetation community structures have considerable influences on the disparity in soil FT processes. Thus, it is important to improve the simulation of the impacts of vegetation on soil surface FT processes for better forecasting the permafrost degradation.

TI  - Melt Pond Scheme Parameter Estimation Using an Adjoint Model
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Melt ponds significantly affect Arctic sea ice thermodynamic processes. The melt pond parameterization scheme in the Los Alamos sea ice model (CICE6.0) can predict the volume, area fraction (the ratio between melt pond area to sea ice area in a model grid), and depth of melt ponds. However, this scheme has some uncertain parameters that affect melt pond simulations. These parameters could be determined through a conventional parameter estimation method, which requires a large number of sensitivity simulations. The adjoint model can calculate the parameter sensitivity efficiently. In the present research, an adjoint model was developed for the CESM (Community Earth System Model) melt pond scheme. A melt pond parameter estimation algorithm was then developed based on the CICE6.0 sea ice model, melt pond adjoint model, and L-BFGS (Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfard-Shanno) minimization algorithm. The parameter estimation algorithm was verified under idealized conditions. By using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) melt pond fraction observation as a constraint and the developed parameter estimation algorithm, the melt pond aspect ratio parameter in CESM scheme, which is defined as the ratio between pond depth and pond area fraction, was estimated every eight days during summertime for two different regions in the Arctic. One region was covered by multi-year ice (MYI) and the other by first-year ice (FYI). The estimated parameter was then used in simulations and the results show that: (1) the estimated parameter varies over time and is quite different for MYI and FYI; (2) the estimated parameter improved the simulation of the melt pond fraction.

TI  - Integrated meteorological drought monitoring framework using multi-sensor and multi-temporal earth observation datasets and machine learning algorithms: A case study of central India
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Devising strategies for drought planning and risk mitigation in predominantly small holder agriculture regions like South Asia requires improved understanding of spatio-temporal characteristics of droughts at finer spatial scales. In this study, an integrated framework is developed to generate high-resolution gridded precipitation products from publicly available coarse scale data, and use the downscaled products for analysis of meteorological droughts. Data from a region in Central India is used to develop and test the framework. The Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) is used to characterize meteorological drought. The proposed framework incorporates: (i) a Random Forest machine learning algorithm to downscale CHIRPS (5 km) gridded long term rainfall data to a higher resolution gridded product (1 km) using high resolution multi-sensor and multi-temporal earth observation data of land surface characteristics (vegetation, temperature, and topography) as cofactors; (ii) Computation of 3-month SPI (SPI-3) for the downscaled gridded rainfall; (iii) Run theory applied to downscaled SPI grid to determine drought characteristics - duration, severity, intensity, frequency, and onset and cessation of droughts, and (iv) Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to combine effects of multiple drought characteristics into a single composite Effective Meteorological Drought Index (EMDI), to identify sub-regional drought patterns. The downscaled gridded precipitation product (1 km) was validated using: (i) original CHIRPS (5 km) data, and (ii) measured rainfall data from 65 rain gauge stations in the study area, with respect to conservation of both statistical properties and spatial structure. Comparisons were also made with drought characteristics obtained from Standardized Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) derived from MODIS evapotranspiration data. The downscaled product captures spatio-temporal variability of droughts at finer village and sub-village scales, compared to original CHIRPS (5 km) data for which each pixel encompassed multiple villages. Spatial distribution of composite index EMDI delineates the study area into two characteristic drought risk regions. In one region, droughts are of longer duration, but are less frequent, with lower severity and intensity. In the second region droughts are of shorter duration but of higher severity, intensity and frequency. The integrated framework developed in this study for high resolution spatio-temporal analysis of droughts, starting from coarse scale precipitation data, is practical and sufficiently general to adopt in other regions to support local drought risk planning and targeting mitigation decisions and actions.

TI  - A detectable urbanization effect in observed surface air temperature data series in Pyongyang region, Democratic People's Republic of Korea
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - A significant urbanization effect in the observed surface air temperature (SAT) data series have been found in developing regions. Here we analyzed the possible impact of urbanization on longterm SAT trends in the Pyongyang region of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by using data of SAT, wind data and Landsat TM images. Results show that the annual mean urbanization effect in the SAT series was about 0.051 degrees C/decade for Pyongyang station, 0.031 degrees C/decade for stations of medium-size cities, and 0.019 degrees C/decade for stations of small cities and towns, over the period 1969-2019. The annual mean urbanization contributions to the overall warming ranged from 5.3% to 13.1% for different city stations during the study periods, with Pyongyang station witnessing the largest urbanization contribution. Seasonally, the urbanization effect was the largest during wintertime. Urbanization contributions to trend of extreme temperature events are more evident in cold weather indices than warm indices, which reached nearly one-quarter or one-fifth and even 30%. Compared to China's mainland and Japan, the urbanization effect on the regional SAT trend in the Pyongyang region is smaller, but it is detectable.

TI  - Time to maximum indocyanine green fluorescence of gastric sentinel lymph nodes and feasibility of combined indocyanine green/sodium fluorescein gastric lymphography
T2  - LANGENBECKS ARCHIVES OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Indocyanine green (ICG) and sodium fluorescein (SF) are fluorescent dyes used for sentinel lymph node mapping. In oncological gastric surgery, ICG lymphography has increased the number of resected lymph nodes. However, the optimal time to administer ICG is unclear, and both preoperative and intraoperative injections have been practised. As dye spillage will diminish lymphogram visibility, a second dye with different excitation and emission spectra may present a clinical alternative. We measured the time until maximum ICG fluorescence of gastric sentinel lymph nodes and investigated the feasibility of combined lymphography with two fluorescent dyes: ICG and SF. Methods Ten Danish Landrace/Yorkshire pigs were used in this study. After completion of the laparoscopic setup, ICG and then SF were endoscopically injected into the gastric submucosa. Lymphograms for both dyes were recorded, and the time until maximum ICG sentinel lymph node fluorescence was determined. Results The mean time until maximum ICG fluorescence of gastric sentinel lymph nodes was 50 s (+/- 12.5), and the fluorescent signal then remained stable until the end of the recorded period (45 min). A lymphogram showing both ICG and SF was acquired for eight of the ten pigs. Conclusions Because of the short time until maximum ICG fluorescence of sentinel lymph nodes, intraoperative injections could be a sufficient alternative to preoperative injections for oncological gastric surgery. Combined ICG and SF lymphography was feasible and resulted in clear lymphograms with no interference between the two dyes. The ability to use multiple dyes during a surgical procedure offers the exciting prospect of simultaneously assessing perfusion and performing fluorescence lymphography.

TI  - Postdischarge Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Are not Associated with Risk of Hematoma after Lumpectomy and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy with Multimodal Analgesia
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are increasingly used in ambulatory breast surgery. The risk of hematoma associated with intraoperative ketorolac is low, but whether concomitant routine discharge with NSAIDs increases the risk of hematoma is unclear. Methods We retrospectively identified patients who underwent lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and compared the 30-day risk of hematoma between patients discharged with opioids (opioid period: January 2018-August 2018) and patients discharged with NSAIDs with or without opioids (NSAID period: January 2019-April 2020). The association between study period and hematoma risk was assessed using multivariable models. Covariates included intraoperative ketorolac, home aspirin, and race/ethnicity. During the NSAID period, a survey was used to assess analgesic consumption on postoperative days 1-5. Results In total, 2724 patients were identified: 858 (31%) in the opioid period and 1866 (69%) in the NSAID period. In the NSAID period, 867 (46%) received NSAIDs and opioids, and 999 (54%) received NSAIDs only. Receipt of intraoperative ketorolac was higher in the NSAID period (78 vs. 64%, P < 0.001). The risks of any hematoma (4.1 vs. 3.6%, P = 0.6) and reoperation for bleeding (0.5 vs. 0.6%, P = 0.8) were similar between groups. Study period was not associated with hematoma risk (odds ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.56-1.35, P = 0.5). Among survey respondents (41%), nonopioid analgesic consumption did not increase after opioids were removed from the discharge regimen (median, 6 pills/group, P = 0.06). Conclusions NSAIDs are associated with a low risk of hematoma after lumpectomy and SLNB, and should be prescribed instead of opioids, unless contraindicated.

TI  - Machine-learning and HEC-RAS integrated models for flood inundation mapping in Baro River Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an integrated machine-learning and HEC-RAS models for flood inundation mapping in Baro River Basin, Ethiopia. ANN and HEC-RAS models were integrated as a predictive hydrological and hydraulic model to generate runoff and the extent of flood, respectively. Daily rainfall and temperature data of 7-years (1999-2005), daily discharge (1999-2005) and 30 m x 30 m gridded Topographical Wetness Index (TWI) were used to train a predictive ANN hydrological model in RStudio. The predictive performance of the developed ANN hydrological model was evaluated in RStudio using Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.86 and 0.88 during the training period (1999-2005) and testing period (2006-2008), respectively, with the corresponding observed daily discharge. The validated ANN predictive hydrological model was linked with HEC-RAS to generate the flood extent along the river course. The HEC-RAS model result was calibrated and validated using the water body delineated using Normal Difference Water Index (NDWI) from LANDSAT 8 imagery based on historical flood events of 2005 and 2008. It was found that about 96% of an agreement was made between the flood-prone areas generated in HEC-RAS and the water body delineated using NDWI. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the integration of a machine-learning approach with the HEC-RAS model has improved the spatiotemporal uncertainties in traditional flood forecasting methods. This integrated model is powerful tool for flood inundation mapping to warn residents of this basin.

T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The suddenly enforced COVID-19 pandemic lockdown has impacted the Earth's environment, and several studies have reported a significant change in air pollution using remote sensing data. In this study, we highlight significant changes in the environment due to reduced human activities using MODIS, Sentinel-5 and NASA-USDA/SMAP satellite data. Critical parameters such as nitrogen dioxide, land surface temperature, surface soil moisture and normalized difference vegetation index were compared (pre-pandemic and post-pandemic) for six highly impacted cities around the world. This study is crucial for environmental management to maintain sustainability of the Earth's ecosystem.

TI  - The Significant Role of Radiosonde-measured Cloud-base Height in the Estimation of Cloud Radiative Forcing
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite-based quantification of cloud radiative forcing remains poorly understood, due largely to the limitation or uncertainties in characterizing cloud-base height (CBH). Here, we use the CBH data from radiosonde measurements over China in combination with the collocated cloud-top height (CTH) and cloud properties from MODIS/Aqua to quantify the impact of CBH on shortwave cloud radiative forcing (SWCRF). The climatological mean SWCRF at the surface (SWCRFSUR), at the top of the atmosphere (SWCRFTOA), and in the atmosphere (SWCRFATM) are estimated to be -97.14, -84.35, and 12.79 W m(-2), respectively for the summers spanning 2010 to 2018 over China. To illustrate the role of the cloud base, we assume four scenarios according to vertical profile patterns of cloud optical depth (COD). Using the CTH and cloud properties from MODIS alone results in large uncertainties for the estimation of SWCRFATM, compared with those under scenarios that consider the CBH. Furthermore, the biases of the CERES estimation of SWCRFATM tend to increase in the presence of thick clouds with low CBH. Additionally, the discrepancy of SWCRFATM relative to that calculated without consideration of CBH varies according to the vertical profile of COD. When a uniform COD vertical profile is assumed, the largest SWCRF discrepancies occur during the early morning or late afternoon. By comparison, the two-point COD vertical distribution assumption has the largest uncertainties occurring at noon when the solar irradiation peaks. These findings justify the urgent need to consider the cloud vertical structures when calculating the SWCRF which is otherwise neglected.

TI  - Estimation and Long-term Trend Analysis of Surface Solar Radiation in Antarctica: A Case Study of Zhongshan Station
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term, ground-based daily global solar radiation (DGSR) at Zhongshan Station in Antarctica can quantitatively reveal the basic characteristics of Earth's surface radiation balance and validate satellite data for the Antarctic region. The fixed station was established in 1989, and conventional radiation observations started much later in 2008. In this study, a random forest (RF) model for estimating DGSR is developed using ground meteorological observation data, and a high-precision, long-term DGSR dataset is constructed. Then, the trend of DGSR from 1990 to 2019 at Zhongshan Station, Antarctica is analyzed. The RF model, which performs better than other models, shows a desirable performance of DGSR hindcast estimation with an R-2 of 0.984, root-mean-square error of 1.377 MJ m(-2), and mean absolute error of 0.828 MJ m(-2). The trend of DGSR annual anomalies increases during 1990-2004 and then begins to decrease after 2004. Note that the maximum value of annual anomalies occurs during approximately 2004/05 and is mainly related to the days with precipitation (especially those related to good weather during the polar day period) at this station. In addition to clouds and water vapor, bad weather conditions (such as snowfall, which can result in low visibility and then decreased sunshine duration and solar radiation) are the other major factors affecting solar radiation at this station. The high-precision, long-term estimated DGSR dataset enables further study and understanding of the role of Antarctica in global climate change and the interactions between snow, ice, and atmosphere.

TI  - The consecutive lake group water storage variations and their dynamic response to climate change in the central Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are a reliable indicator of local and global climate changes. Surveying lake water storage (LWS) and understanding the causes of lake variations are crucial to regulate water resources and protect local ecology. However, the lake bathymetric survey and the analysis of consecutive lake changes were absent on the TP. In this study, we investigated the LWS for seven lakes in the central TP and estimated their water storage variations during the period of 1976-2018 by utilizing long-term time series Landsat images and bathymetric data. Then, the driving factors of lake water storage variations were also analyzed based on the data of the meteorological station. The results suggested that the LWS of the seven lakes (Co Nag, Daru Co, Dung Co, Pung Co, Co Ngoin, Bam Co, and Neri Punco) in the central TP expanded by 2.54 km(3) (22.12%) from 1976 to 2018, with total lake area increased by 183.42 km(2) (22.73%), especially experienced obviously increasing trend between 1997 and 2006. The growth of LWS between 1997 and 2006 explained 70.63% of the net increase during the whole period. While the correlation analysis of LWS and climate change revealed that temperature, precipitation, and evaporation all had impacts on the changes of LWS, temperature and precipitation dominated the main role for the expansion of these lakes during the period of 1997-2006, and LWS had approximately 3 years of lag time in response to precipitation. We also found that the time of the abrupt increase of LWS was probably associated with the step change point of annual precipitation.

TI  - Albedo reduction as an important driver for glacier melting in Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding areas
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Commonly known as the Asian Water Tower, glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and its surrounding regions are vital to the regional water cycle and water resources in the downstream areas. Recently, these glaciers have been experiencing significant shrinkage mostly due to climate warming, which is also profoundly modulated by the surface snow albedos. In this study, we summarized the current status of the glaciers in the TP and its sur-rounding region, focusing on glacier retreat and mass balance. Furthermore, based on glacier surface snow al-bedo data retrieved from MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer, with resolution of 500 m x 500 m), we investigated the potential impact of glacier surface snow albedo changes on glacier melting. The results demonstrated that glacier shrinkage was pronounced over the Himalayas and the southeast TP. The regional distribution of the average albedos on the glacier surface (during summer) exhibited similar patterns to those of glacier retreat and mass balance changes, indicating a significant relationship between the annual glacier mass balance and glacier surface albedos during the past decades (2001-2018). This reflected that albedo reduction, in addition with rising temperatures and changing precipitation, was a significant driver of glacier melting in the TP. Estimations based on glacier surface summer albedos and snowmelt model further suggested that the effect of surface albedo reduction can drive about 30% to 60% of glacier melting. Due to its strong light absorption, black carbon (BC) in snow can be a substantial contributor to albedo reduction, which enhanced glacier melting in summer in the TP by approximately 15%. This study improved our insights into the causes of glacier melting in the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - To the rescue-Evaluating the social-ecological patterns for bird intakes
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Animals from urban areas are regularly brought into wildlife rehabilitation centers, providing untapped potential data records to inform management of wildlife species. Although rescues may be considered a wildlife stewardship behavior, not all 'rescues' may be warranted. Some animals are more likely to be brought into a rescue center than others, suggesting that human drivers underlying wildlife rehabilitation efforts are important to understand for urban conservation efforts. Literature has primarily focused on understanding the ecological drivers and implications of wildlife rescues. Our study is the first to investigate both the social and ecological drivers of bird rescues using census, household survey, and intake data. In Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona, USA in 2017-2018, we found doves and common species were sent to the center most often. Altricial species (helpless at hatching) and young birds were more likely to be brought to the center, perhaps due to perceptions of young animals as vulnerable. We found rescues came from neighborhoods with higher incomes and residents with pro-ecological worldviews, perhaps reflecting a perceived responsibility for wildlife. Conversely, few rescues came from neighborhoods with a high percentage of Hispanic/Latinx residents, who often feel more interdependent with nature. Neighborhoods with greater numbers of rescues were more likely to have residents participating in yard stewardship activities as compared to neighborhoods with fewer rescues. Our findings are relevant to understanding drivers of wildlife stewardship actions and for intake centers who wish to reduce the occurrence of people bringing in wildlife that do not need to be rescued.

TI  - Delineation of submarine groundwater discharge and seawater intrusion zones using anomalies in the field water quality parameters, groundwater level fluctuation and sea surface temperature along the Gujarat coast of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nature mediated processes like seawater intrusion (SWI) and its complementary processes like submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) often cause severe water stress on the coastal water resources worldwide. The present work attempts to delineate the SWI and SGD zones along the North-Western coast of India (constituting the entire coastline of Gujarat) which is currently facing severe water crises due to the freshwater salinization and water loss through the coastal aquifer system. In the present work site-specific water characteristics and groundwater level were used as a proxy for identifying the probable zones of SWI and SGD. For the delineation purpose, we have collected 540 water samples distanced at 5-10 km (seawater, porewater and groundwater; 180 each) from the entire coastline of Gujarat. Further, a three-tier validation system has been adopted for delineating the SWI and SGD zones followed by the physical verification of the locations through the integration of (i) Groundwater fluctuation dynamic, (ii) MODIS derived sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly, and (iii) Electrical conductivity (EC) based gradient mapping. The study has identified 9 out of 14 districts being vulnerable to SWI, whereas the remaining five districts from south Gujarat and the Saurashtra coast are suspectable for SGD. The present work will act as a preliminary basis for formulating a framework for the detailed investigation of the mixing process along the coast.

TI  - Automated detection of tumor regions from oral histological whole slide images using fully convolutional neural networks
T2  - BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - The diagnosis of different types of cancer, including oral cavity-derived cancer, is made by a pathologist through complex and time-consuming microscopic analysis of tissue samples. This paper presents a method based on a fully convolutional neural network to localize and perform refined segmentation of oral cavity-derived tumor regions in H&E-stained histological whole slide images. The proposed method uses color features in the HSV color model to identify tissue regions in a pre-processing step to remove background and nonrelevant areas. The identified tissue regions are then transformed into the CIE L*a*b* color model and split into image-patches. The method was applied in a WSI dataset of oral squamous cell carcinoma tissue samples. In addition, for further validation and comparison with other proposals, we also applied the proposed method in a WSI dataset of sentinel lymph nodes with breast cancer metastases. Experimental evaluations were performed using a total of 85,621 image-patches of size 640 x 640 pixels and the proposed method achieved good results in different cancer-derived datasets with images of different tumors. The results revealed that the proposal is robust and capable to localize and perform refined segmentation, achieving accuracy results up to 97.6%, specificity up to 98.4%, and sensitivity up to 92.9%. The influence of different color spaces and different image-patch sizes in the proposed method also were explored.

TI  - The Effects of Dry Snow on the SAR Impulse Response and Feasibility for Single Channel Snow Water Equivalent Estimation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow water equivalent (SWE) is an important surface parameter for understanding a number of Earth system processes. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has considerable potential for measuring SWE of dry-snow because SAR can penetrate through the snow to the ground surface and is both amplitude- and phase-sensitive to refraction from the snow. Previous work on refraction-based SWE measurement by SAR has utilized the repeat-pass InSAR phase signal to estimate changes in SWE that occur between SAR acquisitions. These are subject to temporal decorrelation effects and consider only the refraction that occurs along the SAR beam center rather than the entire synthetic aperture. This study examines the refractive effect of dry-snow along the synthetic aperture and its impact on SAR image formation including defocusing and phase bias of the system impulse response. Snow phase compensation during time domain processing to recover the snow-free impulse response function (IRF) is described and demonstrated. The feasibility of using the mapdrift and image sharpness autofocus methods to estimate SWE is examined, and the effect of key system parameters on the estimation performance is derived. Experimental validation of the method was conducted by acquiring L-band data with the Simon Fraser University (SFU) Airborne SAR System over a pair of corner reflectors installed on the Kluane icefield in northwestern Canada. Results from both simulations and the icefield experiment are presented and compared including an analysis of errors affecting the estimation.

TI  - Secretory carcinoma of the breast limited to the dermis: Cutaneous or breast primary?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We offer a case of a 22-year-old woman who presented with a painless breast mass. Physical examination of the breast was unrevealing other than a palpable mass in close proximity to the nipple areolar region. No lymphadenopathy was noticed in the axilla or supraclavicular region. Sonographic assessment was performed and the findings were classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category 4. Because of the proximity of the mass to the skin surface, an excisional biopsy was performed. Final pathology disclosed a 5-mm invasive carcinoma. On pathologic examination, histopathologic and immunophenotypes supported the diagnosis of secretory carcinoma; however, whether the origin was from the breast parenchyma or skin tissue was not clearly discernable. Therefore, the patient was scheduled for sentinel lymph node biopsy with plans for axillary dissection if positive. While the overall prognosis for secretory carcinoma is good, with a low chance of metastasis, any ambiguity in breast mass diagnosis should be discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board and should be treated aggressively particularly in younger patients.

TI  - Luminance Learning for Remotely Sensed Image Enhancement Guided by Weighted Least Squares
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Low/high or uneven luminance results in low contrast of remotely sensed images (RSIs), which makes it challenging to analyze their contents. In order to improve the contrast and preserving fine weak details of RSIs, this letter proposes a novel enhancement framework to correct luminance guided by weighted least squares (WLS), including the following key parts. First, an image is separated into a base layer and a detail layer by employing the WLS. Then, a learning network is proposed to correct luminance for the base layer enhancement. Next, an enhancement operator for improving the detail layer is computed by using the original image and the enhanced base layer. Finally, the output image is obtained with a fusion of the enhanced base and detail components. Both quantitatively and qualitatively experimental results verify that the proposed method performs better than the state of the arts in contrast improvement and detail preservation.

TI  - Free the Bun: Prevalence of Alopecia Among Active Duty Service Women, Fiscal Years 2010-2019
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Active duty service women (ADSW) constitute 16% of the force. The prevalence of alopecia, a dermatologic condition characterized by hair loss, is understudied in regard to hairstyle regulations across the U.S. military services. Alopecia has several causes; one of which is due to tension on the scalp secondary to tight hairstyles. In the U.S., alopecia has a lifetime prevalence of 1.7-2.1%; no previous studies which evaluated this condition in service women were found. Materials and Methods We used the Military Health System Data Repository to perform a retrospective study to assess the prevalence of alopecia in ADSW from fiscal years (FYs) 2010 to 2019. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics on patient demographics and trend analysis on the prevalence of alopecia over the 10-year study period. Results A total of 498,219 ADSW were identified over the 10-year study period, of which 2.40% had a diagnosis of alopecia. Overall, the prevalence of alopecia decreases over the 10-year period, with two observed periods of slight increase (FY 2013 to 2014 and FY 2018 to 2019) when comparing prevalence year-to-year. Of those diagnosed, the majority were young, Black, with a senior enlisted rank, and in the U.S. Army. Conclusion The prevalence of alopecia in ADSW is slightly higher than that in civilian populations and is most likely underreported. It is more commonly diagnosed in Black women than would be expected based on ratios of this population in military service. Policy changes to ensure that traction alopecia is a qualifying medical condition for Veterans Affairs disability compensation, mechanisms are in place for more specific coding in the electronic medical record, and treatment options to be covered by TRICARE are recommended. All U.S. military services should consider updating and evaluating regulations to improve the health and quality of life of ADSW.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we present a glacial and periglacial geomorphological map of a similar to 6800 km(2) region of central Troms and Finnmark county, Arctic Norway. The map is presented at a 1:115,000 scale with the aim of characterising the spatial distribution of glacial and periglacial landforms and facilitating the reconstruction of the glacial history of the region during the latter stages of deglaciation from the Last Glacial Maximum and into the Holocene. Mapping was conducted predominantly by manual digitisation of landforms using a combination of Sentinel-2A/2B satellite imagery (10 m pixel resolution), vertical aerial photographs (<1 m pixel resolution), and Digital Elevation Models (10 and 2 m pixel resolution). Over 20,000 individual features have been mapped and include moraines (subdivided into major and minor moraines), ridges within areas of discrete debris accumulations (DDAs), flutings, eskers, irregular mounded terrain, lineations, glacially streamlined bedrock, possible glacially streamlined terrain, pronival ramparts, rock glaciers (subdivided into valley wall and valley floor, and rock glacierised moraines), lithalsas, contemporary glaciers and lakes. The map records several noteworthy large moraine assemblages within individual valleys, forming inset sequences from pre-Younger Dryas limits up to the 2018/19 ice margins and represents a valuable dataset for reconstructing Holocene glacial and periglacial activity.

TI  - Exposure to low-dose ambient fine particulate matter PM<sub>2.5</sub> and Alzheimer's disease, non-Alzheimer's dementia, and Parkinson's disease in North Carolina
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), non-AD dementia, and Parkinson's disease (PD) are increasingly common in older adults, yet all risk factors for their onset are not fully understood. Consequently, environmental exposures, including air pollution, have been hypothesized to contribute to the etiology of neurodegeneration. Because persistently elevated rates of AD mortality in the southern Piedmont area of North Carolina (NC) have been documented, we studied mortality and hospital admissions for AD, non-AD dementia, and PD in residential populations aged 65+ with long-term exposures to elevated levels of ambient air particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality standards (>= 10 mu g/m(3)). Health data were obtained from the State Center for Health Statistics and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. PM2.5 levels were obtained from the MODIS/MISR and SeaWiFS datafiles. Residents in the Study group of elevated air particulate matter (87 zip codes with PM2.5 >= 10 mu g/m(3)) were compared to the residents in the Control group with low levels of air particulate matter (81 zip codes with PM2.5 <= 7.61 mu g/m(3)), and were found to have higher age-adjusted rates of mortality and hospital admissions for AD, non-AD dementia, and PD, including a most pronounced increase in AD mortality (323/100,000 vs. 257/100,000, respectively). After adjustment for multiple co-factors, the risk of death (odds ratio, or OR) from AD in the Study group (OR = 1.35, 95%CI[1.24-1.48]) was significantly higher than ORs of non-AD dementia or PD (OR = 0.97, 95%CI[0.90-1.04] and OR = 1.13, 95%CI[0.92-1.31]). The OR of hospital admissions was significantly increased only for AD as a primary case of hospitalization (OR = 1.54, 95%CI[1.31-1.82]). Conclusion: NC residents aged 65+ with long-term exposures to ambient PM2.5 levels exceeding the WHO standard had significantly increased risks of death and hospital admissions for AD. The effects for non-AD dementia and PD were less pronounced.

TI  - Seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus in Northern Serbia (Vojvodina): A four consecutive sentinel population-based survey study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Monitoring changes of seroprevalence over time is important at the beginning and during of COVID-19 outbreak to anticipate its dynamics and plan an adequate public health response. Methods We conducted a repeated cross-sectional investigation among asymptomatic outpatient subjects and covered 0.1% of total population of Northern Serbia (Autonomous Province of Vojvodina). Each participant was tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using an immunochromatographic qualitative test (point-of-care rapid test). In the last round of survey IgG antibodies targeting the S1 subunit of the spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus were assessed. Results During the four rounds of survey (between the end of April and the end of September), anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositivities based on immunochromatographic test results were 2.60% (95% CI 1.80-3.63), 3.93% (95% CI 2.85-5.28), 6.11% (95% CI 4.72-7.77) and 14.60% (95% 12.51-16.89), respectively. After adjusting with results obtained from the Line immunoassay test, the estimated overall seroprevalence increased to 16.67% (95% CI 14.45-19.08) corresponding to 322,033 infections in total by the end of September 2020 in Vojvodina's population. Throughout the course of the study, for every RT-PCR confirmed case of COVID-19, there were 39-87 additional infections in Vojvodina. No significant difference (p>0.05) in SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity regarding gender and between age subgroups was observed over the course of the survey. Conclusions The population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies implies much more widespread infection in Vojvodina than indicated by the number of confirmed cases. However, our results suggest that the population of Vojvodina has not reached a desirable level of protection from SARS-CoV-2 virus by the end of September 2020.

TI  - A Novel Polarimetric PSI Method Using Trace Moment-Based Statistical Properties and Total Power Interferogram Construction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the launch of various multipolarimetric satellites, many scholars have introduced the persistent scatterer (PS)-oriented polarimetric optimization methods and extended the persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) method to multipolarimetric data configuration, called polarimetric PSI (PolPSI) technology. Most PolPSI methods mainly take the amplitude dispersion index (ADI) as the optimization criterion and evaluate the temporal amplitude stationarity of each polarimetric channel for finding an optimal one. However, due to the unstable statistical characteristics of the quality indicator, many non-PS pixels are easily mistaken for the PS candidates (PSCs), and the performance of interferometric phase optimization is also limited. To overcome these restrictions, in this article, a novel PolPSI method is proposed based on the following two improved innovations. First, in terms of PSC selection, the trace moment (TM)-based statistical properties of time-series polarimetric coherency matrices are utilized for selecting the scatterers with the temporal polarimetric stationarity. Second, in terms of interferometric phase optimization, all interferometric coherency matrices of multipolarization channels are added up together to construct the total power (TP) interferogram for suppressing the effect of speckle noise and decorrelation. In the experiment, 13 scenes of quad-polarization ALOS PALSAR-1 image are selected to verify the algorithm's effectiveness. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PolPSI method can better improve the deformation monitoring performance in three aspects than both the single-polarimetric HH and traditional exhaustive search polarimetric optimization (ESPO) methods, including phase quality improvement, density of PSs, and computational efficiency.

TI  - Machine learning for satellite-based sea-state prediction in an offshore windfarm
T2  - OCEAN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate wave forecasts are essential for the safe and efficient maritime operations and, in particular, the maintenance of offshore wind farms. Here, machine learning and remote monitoring from satellites are integrated to provide uniquely detailed predictions of significant wave height (SWH). C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar images from European Space Agency Sentinel-1 satellites were combined with wave-buoy data from around the UK, using the CEFAS Wavenet. A total of 240 images in wide swarth mode were collected, that represent significant wave height ranging from 0 to 4.7 m. Image properties related to sea surface roughness in dual-polarization mode, together with the wave buoy data, trained an ensemble of artificial neural networks. The trained networks were shown to provide an effective method for the estimation of the SWH, having an RMSE = 0.23 m for SWH<3 m, which is the region of interest for offshore wind energy applications. The methodology enables information on the spatial distribution of wave height in very high resolution to be obtained. Sea-state resolved from the satellite data, using the artificial neural network shows that windfarm infrastructure directly influences wave propagation. The overall variance of significant wave height throughout a wind farm was calculated, providing information on regions of interest with considerably different wave heights as compared to the nearest wave buoy. The new model will help towards improved downscaling of general sea state forecasts, locating hotspots of different wave height properties and correct prioritization of maintenance jobs to perform in wind turbines.

TI  - The combination of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography with blue dye for sentinel lymph node detection in clinically negative node breast cancer
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the value of the combination of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) and blue dye (BD) for SLN detection in patients with clinically negative node breast cancer. Methods Patients with clinically negative node breast cancer were randomized into two cohorts for SLN biopsy (SLNB): the combination method cohort using CEUS and BD together, and the single BD method cohort. Standard axillary lymph node dissection was performed if any of the SLNs confirmed positive by pathology. The identification rate, the number of SLNs removed and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were evaluated between two cohorts. In addition, we assessed the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, false-negative rate of CEUS for diagnosis of SLNs based on patterns of CEUS enhancement. Results 144 consecutive patients with clinically negative node breast cancer were randomized into two cohorts. Each cohort consisted of 72 cases. In the combination method cohort, contrast-enhanced lymphatic vessels were clearly visualized and SLNs were accurately localized in 72 cases. The identification rate and the mean number of SLNs detected by the combination method were 100% (72/72) and 3.26 (1-9), respectively. In contrast, in the single BD method cohort, SLNs in 69 cases were successfully identified. The identification rate and the mean number of SLNs using BD alone were 95.8% (69/72) and 2.21 (1-4), respectively. According to patterns of CEUS enhancement, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the FNR of CEUS for SLN diagnosis were 69.2%, 96.6%, 91.7%, and 30.8%, respectively. After a median follow-up of 50 months for the combination method cohort and 51 months for the blue dye alone cohort, five patients in the combination method cohort and nine in the blue dye alone cohort had recurrence. RFS rates showed no significant difference (P = 0.26) between two cohorts. Conclusion The combination of CEUS and BD is more effective than BD alone for SLNB in clinically negative node patients with an identification rate as high as 100%. Use of BD and CEUS in combination may provide the possibility of a non-radioactive alternative method for SLNB in centers without access to radioisotope.

TI  - Ecohydrological metrics for vegetation communities in turloughs (ephemeral karstic wetlands)
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A 28-year hydrological record on four intermittent wetlands (turloughs) in a hydraulically linked karst area in the west of Ireland was used to assess ecohydrological metrics for different vegetation communities. A methodology using a combination of continuous water level monitoring and high resolution topographic surveying was used to develop a detailed hydrological model of the karst network, from which water levels at any point within the turloughs can be defined at any time during the 28-year period (1989 to 2017). The flood conditions experienced across the spatial distributions for different vegetation communities (as mapped by a field survey) have then been collated and presented as statistical distributions for flood duration, flood depth, flood frequency and mean temperature/global radiation at the time of year in spring when the flood waters start to recede. Analysis of these four turloughs has revealed distinct differences between vegetation communities, from Eleocharis acicularis communities at the turlough base typically experiencing 6 to 7 months of inundation per year compared to the limestone pavement community at the top fringes of the turloughs only flooded from 1 to 2 months per year. An approach that used Sentinel-2 satellite data to provide an assessment of whether there have been changes in the spatial distribution of the communities is also presented. Such metrics can be evaluated alongside other variables such as water quality (particularly nutrients), soil type and land-use, in order to understand the habitat requirements for such plant communities and their associated ecological systems.

TI  - Assessment of the morphological trends and sediment dynamics in the Indus River, Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lower Indus reaches - Guddu and Sukkur - are among the most complicated areas in terms of reach migration. Both climate change and human activities in recent periods along with pond system operation accelerated riverine channel morphology. A GIS-based approach using multi-temporal Landsat images (1986-2020) was employed to characterize the morphometric parameters. Results showed that width of the study reaches varied from 2.1 to 12 km. The braiding index (BI) value for Guddu reach varied from 3.47 to 7.18, and BI value for Sukkur reach varied from 2.11 to 4.92. It is observed that no erosive activity of banks occurred for peak runoff value of <5,880 m(3)s(-1). The sediment load during low flow (LF) period was estimated to be 0.715 million tons/day which comprised 77% fine sediment and 23% sand. The sediment load during high flood (HF) period was about 1.296 million tons/day. The median size (D-50) of bed material during the HF period was 0.101-0.206 mm and during LF period was . The rough set theory (RST) showed that velocity, shear stress, slope, runoff, and sediment load factors are majorly causing the river shape changes. This study is a standpoint of planning flood recovery, riverine regulations, and navigation safety.

AB  - Background Pagetoid urothelial intraepithelial neoplasia (PUIN) is a form of secondary Extramammary Paget Disease (EMPD). It is a rare malignant condition seen on the female genitalia synchronous or metachronous with bladder cancer (BC). Case presentation A 66-year-old female presented with PUIN at the labia minora 2 years after an open anterior pelvic exenteration with ileal conduit urinary diversion for carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the bladder. PUIN of the vulva and vagina was confirmed by a punch biopsy and the patient underwent a radical vaginectomy with urethrectomy and inguinal sentinel node procedure. Immunohistochemically EMPD was identified by the expression tumor protein 63 (p63), cytokeratin 7, and cytokeratin 20 (CK20). Conclusions PUIN is a rare but distinct clinical entity as a form of secondary EMPD which can be differentiated from primary EMPD based on medical history, histology, and immunohistochemistry.

TI  - Evaluation of natural aerosols in CRESCENDO Earth system models (ESMs): mineral dust
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an analysis of the mineral dust aerosol modelled by five Earth system models (ESMs) within the project entitled Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach (CRESCENDO). We quantify the global dust cycle described by each model in terms of global emissions, together with dry and wet deposition, reporting large differences in the ratio of dry over wet deposition across the models not directly correlated with the range of particle sizes emitted. The multi-model mean dust emissions with five ESMs is 2836 Tg yr(-1) but with a large uncertainty due mainly to the difference in the maximum dust particle size emitted. The multi-model mean of the subset of four ESMs without particle diameters larger than 10 mu m is 1664 (sigma = 651) Tg yr(-1). Total dust emissions in the simulations with identical nudged winds from reanalysis give us better consistency between models; i.e. the multi-model mean global emissions with three ESMs are 1613 (sigma = 278) Tg yr(-1), but 1834 (sigma = 666) Tg yr(-1) without nudged winds and the same models. Significant discrepancies in the globally averaged dust mass extinction efficiency explain why even models with relatively similar global dust load budgets can display strong differences in dust optical depth. The comparison against observations has been done in terms of dust optical depths based on MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite products, showing global consistency in terms of preferential dust sources and transport across the Atlantic. The global localisation of source regions is consistent with MODIS, but we found regional and seasonal differences between models and observations when we quantified the cross-correlation of time series over dust-emitting regions. To faithfully compare local emissions between models we introduce a re-gridded normalisation method that can also be compared with satellite products derived from dust event frequencies. Dust total deposition is compared with an instrumental network to assess global and regional differences. We find that models agree with observations within a factor of 10 for data stations distant from dust sources, but the approximations of dust particle size distribution at emission contributed to a misrepresentation of the actual range of deposition values when instruments are close to dust-emitting regions. The observed dust surface concentrations also are reproduced to within a factor of 10. The comparison of total aerosol optical depth with AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) stations where dust is dominant shows large differences between models, although with an increase in the inter-model consistency when the simulations are conducted with nudged winds. The increase in the model ensemble consistency also means better agreement with observations, which we have ascertained for dust total deposition, surface concentrations and optical depths (against both AERONET and MODIS retrievals). We introduce a method to ascertain the contributions per mode consistent with the multi-modal direct radiative effects, which we apply to study the direct radiative effects of a multi-modal representation of the dust particle size distribution that includes the largest particles.

TI  - Liver biomarkers response of the neotropical fish Aequidens metae to environmental stressors associated with the oil industry
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Y The Acacias River in Colombia receives large volumes of industrial effluents mostly derived from the oil industry. To contribute to the study of the possible effects of industrial wastewaters on the aquatic environment and particularly on fish populations, a native neotropical fish, Aequidens metae was used as a sentinel species. Wild specimens of A. metae were caught at three different places of the Acacias River taking as reference the point of discharge of an oil industry effluent; upstream, downstream, and at the vicinity of the discharge pipe. A fourth sampling site was chosen as a reference site away from urban settlements. Samplings were performed twice, during the rainy and dry seasons. After anesthesia animals were weighted and measured, and humanely sacrificed. Livers were extracted, frozen on site and transported to the laboratory. Condition indices were calculated. Total protein content and the detoxification 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) enzyme activity were estimated. Histopathological alterations were also evaluated. Water quality was estimated through the measurement of several variables. Results obtained evidenced that the highest induction in EROD activity and the strongest histological alterations in liver of the monitored fish appeared during the dry seasons at the discharge site and downstream to this point.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 in Human Sewage and River Water from a Remote and Vulnerable Area as a Surveillance Tool in Brazil
T2  - FOOD AND ENVIRONMENTAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was monitored in environmental samples from rural and vulnerable areas (a presidio, worker accommodation units, and river waters upstream and downstream of a rural community) from Minas Gerais State region, Southern Brazil, in August 2020. The sampling was performed prior to official declaration of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in those sites. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the presidio and workers accommodation units (3.0 x 10(4) virus genome copies (GC)/mL and 4.3 x 10(4) GC/mL of sewage, respectively). While SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the river water upstream of the rural community, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in downstream river waters (1.1 x 10(2) SARS-CoV-2 GC/mL). The results obtained in this study highlight the utility of SARS-CoV-2 monitoring in wastewater and human sewage as a non-invasive early warning tool to support health surveillance in vulnerable and remote areas, particularly in development countries.

TI  - Quantifying the Source Term and Uniqueness of the August 12, 2017 Pacific Northwest PyroCb Event
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) firestorm event known as the Pacific Northwest Event (PNE), on August 12, 2017, is examined with a focus on newly reported details of the pyroconvective injections, transport pathway, and young-plume altitude. Because PNE and a subsequent pyroCb event in Australia have been compared to classic stratospheric volcanic plumes, a prime motivation for this work was to exhaustively characterize the beginning of PNE, and to show how it compared to major stratospheric plumes from prior events. We find and report direct evidence that PNE pyroconvection involved seven discrete storms, at least two of which injected a plume to at least 13.7 km, up to 2.5 km above the local tropopause. The morning after, stratospheric smoke was observed above the tropopause to altitudes as great as 16 km. We also quantify for the first time that PNE was preceded by a pyroCb injection one day earlier, generating a plume noteworthy on its own but overwhelmed by the PNE smoke. Our comparison of PNE with five earlier pyroCb events reveals that PNE was not distinctive with respect to its injection and nascent plume height. However, it did produce the greatest known ultraviolet absorbing aerosol index and plume longevity as of 2017.Plain Language Summary Wildfire-generated thunderstorms, which in ways resemble explosive volcanic eruptions, can dot the landscape as an individual blowup or a cluster over a complex of fires. A technical term for these storm clouds is "pyrocumulonimbus" ("pyroCb" for short). The Pacific Northwest Event (PNE) pyroCbs in 2017 gained wide attention. Its stratospheric smoke plume was extraordinary for having ascended to a height far above its injection. It was notable also for its long stratospheric lifetime. There is growing recognition that such noteworthy pyroCb eruptions are comparable to major volcanic plumes. But pyroCb science is still evolving and there is considerable uncertainty regarding PNE in the context of other documented pyroCb and volcanic events in terms of a host of important quantifiable measures. We, therefore, undertake an effort to quantify PNE's beginning and effect, then compare it with other major pyroCbs that have been incompletely characterized in the literature. We find that PNE was unprecedented in some but not all metrics. These results invite a renewed study of major pyroCb events in the satellite-data era (i.e., since 1979) and a new baseline with which to assess more recent and likely future pyroCb events in the climate system.Key PointsThe height and lifetime of a 2017 stratospheric pyroCb smoke plume exceeded prior observations post 1979 despite some ordinary source termsDirect pyroCb injection above the tropopause is confirmed by radar data, and MISR stereographic plume-height the morning after the eventSeveral previous, published pyroCb events were characterized by diabatic lofting of smoke from an initial residence in the stratosphere

TI  - DeepYield: A combined convolutional neural network with long short-term memory for crop yield forecasting
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield forecasting is of great importance to crop market planning, crop insurance, harvest management, and optimal nutrient management. Commonly used approaches for crop prediction include but are not limited to conducting extensive manual surveys or using data from remote sensing. Considering the increasing amount of data provided by remote sensing imagery, this approach is becoming increasingly important for the task of crop yield forecasting and there is a need for more sophisticated approaches to extract the inherent spatiotemporal patterns of these data. Although considerable progress has been made in this field by using Deep Learning (DL) methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), no study before has investigated the use of Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) for crop yield forecasting. Here, we propose DeepYield, a combined structure, that integrates the ConvLSTM layers with the 3-Dimensional CNN (3DCNN) for more accurate and reliable spatiotemporal feature extraction. The models are trained by using county-based historical yield data and MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST), Surface Reflectance (SR), and Land Cover (LC) data over 1836 primary soybean growing counites in the Contiguous United States (CONUS). The forecasting performance of the developed models is compared against the competing approaches including Decision Trees, CNN + GP, and CNNLSTM and results indicate that DeepYield significantly outperforms these techniques and also performs better than both ConvLSTM and 3DCNN.

TI  - Forest loss in Indonesian New Guinea (2001-2019): Trends, drivers and outlook
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The rich forests of Indonesian New Guinea are understudied and threatened. We used satellite data to examine annual forest loss, road development and plantation expansion from 2001 to 2019, then developed a model to predict future deforestation. No previous studies have attempted such a detailed assessment of past and future deforestation. In 2019, 34.29 million hectares (Mha), or 83% of Indonesian New Guinea, supported old-growth forest. Over nineteen years, 2% (0.75 Mha) were cleared: 45% (0.34 Mha) converted to industrial plantations, roads, mine tailings, or other uses near cities; 55% (0.41 Mha) cleared by transient processes including selective natural timber extraction, inland water bodies-related processes, fires, and shifting agriculture. Industrial plantations expanded by 0.23 Mha, with the majority (0.21 Mha; 28% of forest loss) replacing forests and reaching 0.28 Mha in 2019 (97% oil palm; 3% pulpwood). The Trans-Papua Highway, a similar to 4000 km national investment project, increased by 1554 km. Positive correlations between highway and plantations expansion indicate these are linked processes. Plantations and roads expanded rapidly after 2011, peaked in 2015/16, and declined thereafter. Indonesian government allocated 2.62 Mha of land for the development of industrial plantations (90% oil palm 10% pulpwood) of which 74% (1.95 Mha) remained forest in 2019. A spatial model predicts that an additional 4.5 Mha of forest could be cleared by 2036 if Indonesian New Guinea follows similar relationships to Indonesian Borneo. We highlight the opportunities for policy reform and the importance of working with indigenous communities, local leaders, and provincial government to protect the biological and cultural richness still embodied in this remarkable region.

TI  - Damage Assessment of a Salt Dome in Jizan, Southwestern Saudi Arabia, Using High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The salt dome in Jizan, southwestern Saudi Arabia, has caused several problems related to underground dissolution, particularly in the old part of the city. Examples of these problems include surface collapse, building failure, fracturing, tilting, and road cracking. Analysis of the salt dome using X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the dominance of gypsum, anhydrite, and halite. This study evaluates the damage assessment using multitemporal high spatial resolution data of the GeoEye-1, and QuickBird-2 sensors. Change detection technique, textural analysis, and visual interpretation were applied to these data. Analysis of the data recorded before and after a particular damage event revealed that three neighborhoods located above the Jizan salt dome-Al-Ashaima, Shamiya, and Aljabal-were affected to the greatest extent. The entire residential neighborhood of Al-Ashaima was evacuated, and the buildings located in it were demolished. Several buildings in the Shamiya and Aljabal neighborhoods were also demolished. Therefore, high spatial remote sensing data are effective in assessing building damage and for anticipating future damage, thus benefiting decision making for the affected cities.

TI  - A generalized machine learning approach for dissolved oxygen estimation at multiple spatiotemporal scales using remote sensing
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved oxygen (DO) is an effective indicator for water pollution. However, since DO is a non-optically active parameter and has little impact on the spectrum captured by satellite sensors, research on estimating DO by remote sensing at multiple spatiotemporal scales is limited. In this study, the support vector regression (SVR) models were developed and validated using the remote sensing reflectance derived from both Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and synchronous DO measurements (N = 188) and water temperature of Lake Huron and three other inland waterbodies (N = 282) covering latitude between 22-45 degrees N. Using the developed models, spatial distributions of the annual and monthly DO variability since 1984 and the annual monthly DO variability since 2000 in Lake Huron were reconstructed for the first time. The impacts of five climate factors on long-term DO trends were analyzed. Results showed that the developed SVR-based models had good robustness and generalization (average R-2 = 0.91, root mean square percentage error = 2.65%, mean absolute percentage error = 4.21%), and performed better than random forest and multiple linear regression. The monthly DO estimates by Landsat and MODIS data were highly consistent (average R-2 = 0.88). From 1984 to 2019, the oxygen loss in Lake Huron was 6.56%. Air temperature, incident shortwave radiation flux density, and precipitation were the main climate factors affecting annual DO of Lake Huron. This study demonstrated that using SVR-based models, Landsat and MODIS data could be used for long-term DO retrieval at multiple spatial and temporal scales. As data-driven models, combining spectrum and water temperature as well as extending the training set to cover more DO conditions could effectively improve model robustness and generalization.

TI  - Quantification of Enhancement in Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Background Due to Indian Biospheric Fluxes and Fossil Fuel Emissions
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional carbon emissions impact global atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) background concentrations. This study quantified the enhancement in the atmospheric CO2 mole fractions due to biospheric and fossil fuel fluxes from India. Sensitivity experiments using model simulations were conducted, allowing CO2 enhancement due to biospheric and fossil fuel fluxes from India to diffuse into the global atmospheric background. The areal extent of column-averaged enhancement of 0.2 ppm and above due to Indian fluxes are spread over a larger area covering the Indian subcontinent, neighboring Asian regions, and the north Indian Ocean in all four seasons. The boundary layer CO2 enhancement due to biospheric fluxes (fossil fuel fluxes) have a maximum range of -2.6 to +1.4 ppm (1.8-2.0 ppm) most time of the year. At higher altitude, the amplitudes of enhancement are reduced from 1.8 to 0.6 ppm as we go up from 850 to 500 hPa due to diffusion by prevailing atmospheric dynamics and convection. With the information of the areal extent of >0.2 ppm CO2 enhancement due to Indian fluxes, we have evaluated the representativeness of satellite observations (GOSAT and OCO-2) in capturing those enhancements. Both the satellite coverage show a similar number of observations (0.1 per day) during all seasons except for June to August, wherein the cloud screening eliminates almost all the satellite data over the region. Within this areal extent, the satellite XCO2 shows average anomalies of nearly 2.0 ppm; it is a valuable piece of information because it is well above the retrieval uncertainty, yet capturing the potential enhancement due to fluxes from India. The study implies that the regions of enhancement greater than 0.2 ppm can be considered locations for surface observations representing Indian fluxes. Similarly, the region with enhancement greater than one ppm could be covered by satellites/airborne observations to discern enhancement in the atmospheric CO2 mole fractions due to Indian fluxes.Plain Language Summary This study calculates the seasonal enhancement of the atmospheric CO2 concentration (in ppm) due to biospheric fluxes and fossil fuel emissions from India. The regional fluxes of fossil fuel and biospheric activities contribute to the global atmospheric CO2 within a few ppm. Using a global atmospheric tracer transport model and regional fluxes, we show that the enhancement of the atmospheric CO2 due to India's biospheric fluxes and fossil fuel emission spread over a large extent over India and surrounding regions. A tangible value of 1.8 ppm and above can be found in most parts of India and its surrounding regions during significant seasons. The areal extent grows from the boundary layer to the upper atmosphere due to corresponding atmospheric mixing and dynamics. On the surface, the enhancement due to biospheric fluxes is about -2.6 to +1.4 ppm in all four seasons, whereas the enhancement due to fossil fuel shows about 1.8-2 ppm. The extent of discernible enhancement in the global atmospheric background due to Indian fluxes helps us understand the optimum location where all observational efforts should be made to sample Indian emission scenarios from global backgrounds. This study also points out the capability in observing the enhancement of XCO2 by the satellite over India and its surroundings. Satellite observations are crucial where the observations of atmospheric CO2 are limited to constrain the surface fluxes in the inverse modeling study. Satellite measurements can capture the enhancement except June to August when the observations are screened out for cloud contamination. Therefore, surface observations are necessary to capture the enhancement of Indian emissions in the global atmospheric CO2 background in all seasons.Key PointsIndian carbon fluxes significantly contribute to the CO2 concentrations as large as +/- 2.0 ppm over India and neighboring regions throughout the year at surface level (i.e., 975 hPa)Satellites are capable of representing the XCO2 anomalies up to +/- 2.0 ppm over corresponding regions; however, they have no data coverage during rainy seasonsThe study recommends both ground-based and satellite/aircraft measurements of CO2 be employed to observe the larger area of Indian CO2 enhancements

TI  - Predicting Harbor Porpoise Strandings Based on Near-Shore Sightings Indicates Elevated Temporal Mortality Rates
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in anthropogenic activities and their potential impact on wildlife requires the establishment of monitoring programs and identification of indicator species. Within marine habitats, marine mammals are often used as ecosystem sentinels, which has led to investigations into their abundance, distribution, and mortality patterns. However, trends in sightings and strandings are rarely analyzed in combination. This is necessary to distinguish elevated stranding rates caused by changes in local abundance from increased mortality as a consequence of other natural, environmental or anthropogenic factors. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess whether harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) stranding frequency in the southern North Sea can be explained by local population density derived from more than 400 thousand hours of systematic observations along the Dutch coast between 1990 and 2018. Since the late 1990s, both the number of stranded porpoises and the sighting rate increased rapidly up to around the mid-2000s, after which they remained high, but with large inter-annual fluctuations. On an annual basis there was a strong correlation between porpoise strandings and sightings, but with a seasonal mismatch. Highest stranding rates occur in late summer, while highest sighting rates occur in early spring. Despite low sighting rates in late summer, August appears to be the best predictor for the monthly variation in the number of stranded porpoises, which could be explained by post-reproductive dispersal and mortality. Excessive high porpoise stranding numbers after accounting for variations in local density could signpost unusual mortality events (UMEs). The corrected stranding rates show that in the early 1990s, when porpoise sightings were rare, and after 2010, the number of stranded porpoises exceeds the expected number. Especially in the summer of 2011, the number of dead porpoises found ashore was excessively high and this might reflect an UME. These results demonstrate that a comparative interpretation of marine mammal strandings and coastal sightings can be a valuable management and conservation tool that could provide an early warning signal for population change.

TI  - Remote sensing of natural hazard-related disasters with small drones: Global trends, biases, and research opportunities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Small (< 25 kg) aerial drones have expanded the remote sensing toolkit for disaster management activities. Here, we provide a critical review of drone-based remote sensing of natural hazard-related disasters to highlight research trends, biases, and expose new opportunities. We performed a systematic literature search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology, resulting in 635 relevant articles from which we derived statistics relating to geography, drone hardware, disaster management application, and drone remote sensing data type and analysis method. Key findings include a bias towards: (i) mass movement hazards (38%); (ii) small (< 1 km(2)) (76%) and rural (79%) study areas in high-income countries and territories (64%); (iii) image-based observations of features from the natural environment (77%); and (iv) support of mitigation-related vulnerability assessment and risk modeling (54%) and environmental recovery (23%). We recommend that future studies focus on: (i) earthquakes, floods, and cyclones and other windstorms due to higher loss of life and economic impacts; (ii) larger and urban study areas in low, lower-middle, and upper-middle income countries and territories to support vulnerable populations; (iii) under-demonstrated (and especially response-related) disaster management activities, which generally require observations of built features from urban environments; and (iv) data standards for integrating drone-based remote sensing with international disaster management methodologies.

TI  - Landscape analyses using eDNA metabarcoding and Earth observation predict community biodiversity in California
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems globally are under threat from ongoing anthropogenic environmental change. Effective conservation management requires more thorough biodiversity surveys that can reveal system-level patterns and that can be applied rapidly across space and time. Using modern ecological models and community science, we integrate environmental DNA and Earth observations to produce a time snapshot of regional biodiversity patterns and provide multi-scalar community-level characterization. We collected 278 samples in spring 2017 from coastal, shrub, and lowland forest sites in California, a complex ecosystem and biodiversity hotspot. We recovered 16,118 taxonomic entries from eDNA analyses and compiled associated traditional observations and environmental data to assess how well they predicted alpha, beta, and zeta diversity. We found that local habitat classification was diagnostic of community composition and distinct communities and organisms in different kingdoms are predicted by different environmental variables. Nonetheless, gradient forest models of 915 families recovered by eDNA analysis and using BIOCLIM variables, Sentinel-2 satellite data, human impact, and topographical features as predictors, explained 35% of the variance in community turnover. Elevation, sand percentage, and photosynthetic activities (NDVI32) were the top predictors. In addition to this signal of environmental filtering, we found a positive relationship between environmentally predicted families and their numbers of biotic interactions, suggesting environmental change could have a disproportionate effect on community networks. Together, these analyses show that coupling eDNA with environmental predictors including remote sensing data has capacity to test proposed Essential Biodiversity Variables and create new landscape biodiversity baselines that span the tree of life.

TI  - Complexity of the relationship between 2D/3D urban morphology and the land surface temperature: a multiscale perspective
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban morphology is a crucial contributor to urban heat island (UHI) effects. However, few studies have explored the complex effect of 2D/3D urban morphology on UHIs from a multiscale perspective. In this study, we chose the central area of Jinan city, which is commonly known as the "furnace," as the case study area. The 2D/3D urban morphology indexes-building coverage ratio (BCR) (for assessing the 2D building density), building volume density (BVD) (for assessing the 3D building density), and frontal area index (FAI) (for assessing 3D ventilation conditions) were calculated and derived to investigate the complexity of the relationship between 2D/3D urban morphology and the land surface temperature (LST) at different scales using the maximum information coefficient (MIC) and geographically weighted regression (GWR). The results indicated that (1) these 2D/3D urban morphology indexes are essential factors that are responsible for LST variation, and BCR is the most important urban morphology index affecting LST, followed by BVD and FAI. Importantly, the relationship between the BCR, BVD, FAI, and LST was an inverse U-shaped curve. (2) The relationship between 2D/3D urban morphology and LST variation showed a significant scale effect. With increased grid size, the correlation between the BCR, BVD, and FAI and the LST strengthened, "inflection point" of inverse U-shaped curve significantly declined, and their explanation rate of the LST first increased and then decreased, with a maximum value at the 700 m scale. Additionally, the FAI exerted a stronger negative effect, while the BCR and BVD generally had stronger positive effects on the LST as the grid size increased. This study extends our scientific understanding of the complex effect of urban morphology on the LST and is of great practical significance for multiscale urban thermal environment regulation.

TI  - Ecosystem water use efficiency response to drought over southwest China
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is showing an increasing trend as a result of the significant variation in precipitation and temperature in China. This study investigated the impacts of drought on ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) in southwest China. The spatiotemporal distribution of drought and ecosystem WUE were analysed through integrated approaches based on observed climate and satellite remote sensing datasets to understand the response of ecosystem WUE to drought. Also, the impacts of climatic variables on gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET) and WUE have been discussed. More than 30% of the total area can be categorized as suffering moderate drought. Six drought events (autumn 2006, autumn 2009, winter 2010, summer 2011, autumn 2011 and winter 2013) were identified during the period of 2001-2016. The average monthly WUE was 2.37 gC/kgH(2)O, showing a decreasing trend under the combined effects of drought and other environmental factors. Autumn 2006 exhibited the highest significant positive effect of drought on WUE on more than 80% of the total area that concentrated in the forest, shrubland, savanna and agriculture ecosystems. The results of this study have implications for ecosystem management and climate policy making that could allow implementing feasible water use strategies under a warming climate.

TI  - Future snow projections in a small basin of the Western Himalaya
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow is a crucial component of the hydrological cycle in the Western Himalaya. Water from snowmelt is used in various sectors in downstream regions, thus playing a critical role in securing the livelihoods of millions of people. In this study, we investigated the future evolution of snow cover and snowmelt in the Panjshir catchment of Afghanistan, a sub-basin of the Indus, in the Western Himalaya. We applied a three-step approach to select a few global climate model (GCM) simulations from CMIP5 climate datasets for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, which showed reasonable performance with ERA5-Land dataset for the chosen historical period (1981-2010). The selected model simulations were then segregated into two groups: those projecting a cold-wet climate and those projecting a warm-dry climate by the end of the 21st century (2071-2100). These GCMs were downscaled to a higher resolution using empirical statistical downscaling. To simulate the snow processes, we used the distributed cryospheric-hydrological J2000 model. The results indicate that the model captures well the snow cover dynamics for the historical period when compared with the daily MODIS-derived snow cover. The J2000 model was then forced by climate projections from the selected GCMs to quantify future changes in snow cover area, snow storage and snowmelt. While a 10-18% reduction in annual snow cover area is projected in the cold-wet models, a 22-36% reduction is projected in the warm-dry models. Similarly, the snow cover area is projected to decrease in all elevation bands under climate change. At the seasonal scale, across all models and scenarios, the snow coverin the autumn and spring seasons are projected to reduce by as much as 25%, with an increase in winter and spring snowmelt and a decrease in summer snowmelt. The projected changes in the seasonal availability of snowmelt-drivenwater resources are likely to have direct implications forwater-dependent sectors in the region and call for a better understanding of water usage and future adaptation practices.

TI  - Mapping the spatial distribution of tree species selected by elephants (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>) in Venetia-Limpopo Nature Reserve using Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees that elephants select are generally at risk to local extirpation. Elephants are the primary drivers of change to large savannah trees, pushing trees over, ring barking or damaging them. These impacts have an adverse effect on the diversity and structure of woody vegetation. Many tree species have slow growth and recruitment rates. This makes it difficult for ecosystems to recover after damage, especially in areas with high densities of elephants. In this study, we mapped the spatial distribution of six endemic and priority tree species that are selected by elephants using Sentinel-2 imagery. Data on the GPS locations of the selected trees were collected and a machine learning algorithm, Random Forest, was used to discriminate between species and to map their spatial distribution in the Venetia-Limpopo Nature Reserve. The algorithm successfully discriminated the different tree species with an overall accuracy of 79.6%, ranking the vegetation red edge (Band-7) and water vapour (Band-9) as the most important bands in the classification. Colophospermum mopane is a dominant tree species in terms of its distribution on the reserve, and according to the classification results, canopies of this species cover approximately 17% of the study area, while Commiphora spp. cover 19%. These findings indicate the effectiveness of Sentinel-2 imagery for mapping savannah tree species that are valuable for conservation and selected by elephants.

TI  - Provider Attitudes and Practices Regarding Intrauterine System (IUS) Insertion in Adolescents With and Without Bleeding Disorders for Management of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC AND ADOLESCENT GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objective: Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) may be the sentinel event for identifying a patient with a bleeding disorder (BD). The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG IUS) has been proposed as a treatment for HMB in adolescents with and without BDs; however, no standard protocols for LNG IUS insertion in these populations exist. Providers were surveyed regarding the use of the LNG IUS in adolescents with HMB, with and without BD.Design, Setting, Participants, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measures: An institutional review board-approved survey assessing provider attitudes, LNG IUS insertion practices, and patient outcomes in adolescents with HMB, with and without BD, was electronically distributed to 3523 providers in the fields of hematology, adolescent medicine, and obstetrics and gynecology. Descriptive analysis was performed.Results: A total of 312 respondents across all 3 specialties completed the survey. Nearly 100% of respondents considered the LNG IUS safe and effective treatment for adolescents with HMB, both with and without BD. Additionally, 66% of providers chose LNG IUS as the ideal treatment for HMB in patients with BD. Differences were noted in clinical setting for LNG IUS insertion, peri-procedural medication use, and post-procedure follow-up among specialties. Providers across all specialties reported low complication rates related to IUS insertion and use in both patient groups.Conclusion: Providers considered the LNG IUS safe and effective treatment for HMB in adolescents with and without a diagnosed BD. Practice patterns regarding LNG IUS insertion in this population vary. Further research is necessary to explore IUS outcomes in adolescent patients with HMB, with and without BD, and to inform evidence-based protocols for LNG IUS insertion.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 10-year results after national introduction of pelvic lymph node staging in Danish intermediate-risk endometrial cancer patients not given postoperative radiotherapy. Gitte Ortoft; Claus Hogdall; Estrid S Hansen; Margit Dueholm. Objective: To prepare for the national introduction of sentinel node staging, we evaluated the consequences of the previous national decision to introduce lymph node staging in intermediate-risk endometrial cancer patients (grade 1/2 with > 50% or grade 3 with < 50% myometrial invasion) by determining the number of patients upstaged by lymphadenectomy and whether upstaging affected the survival and recurrence patterns of non-staged patients and patients with and without lymph node metastases. Study Design: In a national cohort study, 2005-12, 1294 stage I-IV patients who should have been offered lymphadenectomy were progressively registered. The number of patients upstaged by lymphadenectomy, 10-year survivals were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and adjusted Cox regression. Results: This study demonstrates that it takes time to introduce lymphadenectomy at a national level, as indicated by the increasing number of cases staged per year, from 12% in 2005 to 74% in 2012. Pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 43.8% (567/1294) and lymph node metastases were found in 13.6% (77/567). As 54 patients had further dissemination outside the uterine body, only 23 patients (6%) were upstaged from stage I to IIIC. Compared to lymph node-negative patients, the 77 patients with lymph node metastasis had significantly lower overall, (55% versus 68%), disease-specific (64% versus 86%), and progression-free survival (51% versus 77%), mainly due to non-local recurrences including a high number of paraaortic recurrences. In 873 final stage I intermediate-risk patients, 10-year survival and recurrence rates were not significantly lower in non-staged as compared to lymph node-negative patients (overall survival 62% versus 70%: disease-specific survival: 90% versus 90%, progression-free survival: 81% vs 83%), probably due to the low number of patients upstaged from stage I to stage IIIC. Conclusion: Lymph node metastases were present in 13.6% of patients with intermediate-risk who underwent pelvic lympadenectomy, and these patients had a lower 10-year survival than lymph node-negative patients. Because lymphadenectomy upstaged only 6% from stage I to stage IIIC, survival and recurrence rates were not significantly compromised in non-staged as compared to lymph node-negative intermediate-risk stage I patients. Sentinel node staging has now been implemented in Danish intermediate-risk endometrial cancer patients. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Practical aspects of sentinel node biopsy in oral cavity cancer: all nodes that emit a signal are important
T2  - ACTA OTO-LARYNGOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is a safe and effective way to examine an N0 neck in early-stage oral cavity cancer (OCC). In this study, we evaluated the variables of SNB detection, surgery, and outcome. Material and methods Ninety-two patients with N0 OCC examined with SNB were included. Number and brightness of nodes detected on preoperative imaging and during surgery were analyzed and compared with histological findings. Patients with recurrent disease were evaluated separately and the effect of smoking and alcohol consumption was analyzed. Results Eighteen patients had at least malignant cells in the sentinel lymph node (SLN); 18 patients had recurrent disease and nine patients died from the cancer. The negative predictive value of SNB was 95%. Six patients did not have metastases in the node with the strongest signal, but metastases were found in an SLN with a weaker signal. Smoking and alcohol consumption did not affect disease-specific or overall survival. Conclusion and significance SNB has been confirmed to be safe and effective in early stage N0 OCC. However, it is important to carefully harvest up to four hottest SLNs that emit a signal. Treatment of patients with only isolated tumor cells (ITC) in the SLN appears to be necessary.

TI  - Selection of optimal bands of AVIRIS - NG by evaluating NDVI with Sentinel-2
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data consists of continuous spectral bands with low bandwidth, Sentinel-2 multispectral image has less number of bands with higher bandwidth. Several studies are carried out to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) of hyperspectral data. The studies considered a single band in the red and NIR region of hyperspectral data. In this present study, NDVI analysis is carried out by taking the mean reflectance of red and NIR wavelength region bands of the AVIRIS image. To choose the bands, a methodology is devised for AVIRIS image by analyzing and evaluating the NDVI between AVIRIS and Sentinel-2 image. The AVIRIS data consists of 7 red bands and 22 NIR bands. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between NDVI of all the 154 combinations of AVIRIS image bands and Sentinel-2 image is calculated for each Land Use Land Cover (LULC). Three mean NDVI are evaluated such as (i) mean of all bands reflectance; (ii) mean of band reflectance higher than [Mean + Standard deviation] (iii) the mean of the band reflectance involved lower than [Mean-Standard deviation] are compared using RMSE and linear regression. The bands that contribute to lower RMSE values are chosen and separated into band sets. The distinct sets of NDVI on various classes are validated with the existing studies and the other field data to check the RMSE and correlation. The proposed statistical sets are performed better than the existing models on various classes of land use and land cover.

TI  - Yield estimation of the 2020 Beirut explosion using open access waveform and remote sensing data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on a multi-technique analysis using publicly available data for investigating the huge, accidental explosion that struck the city of Beirut, Lebanon, on August 4, 2020. Its devastating shock wave led to thousands of injured with more than two hundred fatalities and caused immense damage to buildings and infrastructure. Our combined analysis of seismological, hydroacoustic, infrasonic and radar remote sensing data allows us to characterize the source as well as to estimate the explosive yield. The latter is determined within 0.13 to 2 kt TNT (kilotons of trinitrotoluene). This range is plausible given the reported 2.75 kt of ammonium nitrate as explosive source. As there are strict limitations for an on-site analysis of this catastrophic explosion, our presented approach based on data from open accessible global station networks and satellite missions is of high scientific and social relevance that furthermore is transferable to other explosions.

TI  - Extrapolating shortwave geostationary satellite imagery of clouds into nighttime using longwave observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of shortwave (SW, visible, and near-infrared) geostationary satellite data at night results in degradation of many weather forecasts and real-time diagnostic products. We present a method to extrapolate SW GOES-16 advanced baseline imager data through night using nighttime longwave (LW, infrared) observations and the relationships between LW and SW data observed during the previous day. The method is not a forecast since it requires LW nighttime observations but can provide continuity through day, night, and satellite terminator hours. To provide performance statistics, the algorithm is applied during the day so the SWextrapolations can be compared to observations. Typical mean absolute errors (MAEs) range from 1.0% to 12.7% reflectance depending on the SW channel. These MAEs can be predicted using a diagnostic metric called 0-hMAE which quantifies the quality of the algorithm's input data. In addition to quantitative error statistics, three case studies are presented, including an animation of extrapolated imagery from dusk through dawn. Considerations for future improvements include use of convolutional neural networks and/or object-based extrapolations where mesoscale features are extrapolated individually. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Effect of BG-Lures on the Male <i>Aedes</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) Sound Trap Capture Rates
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - With global expansion of the two main vectors of dengue, Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, Diptera: Culicidae) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse, Diptera: Culicidae), there is a need to further develop cost-effective and user-friendly surveillance tools to monitor the population dynamics of these species. The abundance of Ae. aegypti and Ae. Albopictus, and associated bycatch captured by Male Aedes Sound Traps (MASTs) and BG-Sentinel (BGS) traps that were unbaited or baited with BG-Lures were compared in Cairns, Australia and Madang, Papua New Guinea. Mean male Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus catch rates in MASTs did not significantly differ when deployed with BG-Lures. Similarly, males of both these species were not sampled at statistically different rates in BGS traps with or without BG-Lures. However, MASTs with BG-Lures caught significantly less male Ae. aegypti than BGS traps baited with BG-Lures in Cairns, and MASTs without BG-Lures caught significantly more male Ae. albopictus than BGS traps without BG-Lures in Madang. Additionally, BG-Lures significantly increased female Ae. aegypti catch rates in BGS traps in Cairns. Lastly, bycatch capture rates in BGS traps were not significantly influenced by the addition of the BG-Lures. While this study provides useful information regarding the surveillance of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in these locations, further development and investigation is required to successfully integrate an olfactory lure into the MAST system.

TI  - Effects of Mosaic Representation of Land Use/Land Cover on Skin Temperature and Energy Fluxes in Noah-MP Land Surface Model Over China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The representations of land use/land cover (LULC) play an important role in land surface models (LSMs) for the simulation of the energy flux partition, soil moisture redistribution, and runoff generation. This study was designed to investigate the regional effects of mosaic LULC representations on skin temperature (Ts) and energy fluxes over China at three horizontal resolutions and how these effects changed with climate regimes, using Noah with multiparameterization (Noah-MP) LSM. The current officially released Noah-MP only considered the most abundant LULC type within one model grid. In this study, the mosaic method considering all the LULC types existing in one model grid was implemented into Noah-MP. Against the reference data (including MODIS land surface temperature products, FLUXCOM energy flux data and Numerical Terra dynamic Simulation Group evapotranspiration data), the mosaic method generally performed better than the default method and reduced the root-mean-squared-error of Ts and energy fluxes significantly over urban region. The mosaic method affected the Ts and energy fluxes by changing leaf area index and soil moisture, mainly by the former. The warm (monthly mean air temperature larger than 10 degrees C) and relatively humid climate (annual total precipitation larger than 200 mm) could enlarge the effect of mosaic method on Ts and energy fluxes. The mosaic method reduced discrepancies of Ts and energy fluxes among three horizontal resolutions (0.0625 degrees, 0.25 degrees, and 0.50 degrees), especially over the heterogeneous vegetated and urban region.Key PointsMosaic representation of land use/land cover was implemented in Noah-MP to obtain more accurate land surface informationNoah-MP incorporated with the mosaic method improved the skin temperature and energy fluxesWarm climate regimes enlarged the effect of mosaic method on skin temperature and energy fluxes through LAI changes

TI  - Impact of Urban Water Networks on Microclimate and PM2.5 Distribution in Downtown Areas: A Case Study of Wuhan
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization in China has resulted in highly dense urban forms and marked reductions in ecological resources, which in turn have caused severe urban heat islands and PM2.5 pollution. In typical cities with a water network, such as Wuhan, the use of water resources to improve the urban climate environment has become an urgent issue. In this study, we explored the impact of water networks on the microclimate and PM2.5 distribution in Wuhan by using multi-source remote sensing data and the weather research and forecasting model. Our results indicated that the water network has a blocking effect on PM2.5. Taking pollutant sources into consideration, the coverage of the water surface is positively correlated with a PM2.5 concentration of 0.606-0.703; the concentration of PM2.5 over suburban lakes with an area larger than 60 km2 is approximately 6%-13% higher than that of the surrounding land surface. We also found that the water network reduced the average temperature of the downtown and the urban hinterland at noon by 1 K and 0.5 K, respectively, and increased the height of boundary layer at night by more than 60 m-an approximately one-third increase-which helped decrease the level of PM2.5. In addition, the impact of water bodies located in different "ring loops" on the downtown microclimate varied significantly. Water bodies located downtown significantly increased the night wind speed in downtown areas to as much as 2 m/s, while those in nearby and outer suburbs increased the wind speed downtown by more than 1 m/s at noon.

TI  - Use of earth observation satellite data to guide the implementation of integrated pest and pollinator management (IPPM) technologies in an avocado production system
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Insect pollinators provide an important ecosystem service by improving agricultural productivity. However, their populations have been declining in recent years due to excessive use of synthetic pesticides, climate and land use/land cover (LULC) changes. Climate and LULC changes have resulted in land fragmentation and consequently pollinator habitat loss. To conserve pollinators, there is a need for sustainable agricultural practices such as integrated pest and pollinator management (IPPM), which is a holistic landscape management approach that minimizes pesticides use while conserving pollinator abundance and diversity. This study aimed to use earth observation (EO) data to characterize landscape dynamics in terms of vegetation productivity to guide the implementation of IPPM interventions in an avocado production system in Murang'a (Kenya). Specifically, we utilized Sentinel-2 (S-2)-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation productivity to assess IPPM implementation sites. The NDVI was calculated using multi-date S-2 data acquired during the dry and wet seasons and categorized into three vegetation productivity classes - low, medium, and high - using a K-means unsupervised clustering method. We also collected socio-economic baseline data from 410 farmers with a focus on their perception to implement one of four avocado pest management and pollination options: (1) IPPM, (2) integrated pest management (IPM), (3) pollinator supplementation (P), and (4) no intervention (control). The three landscape vegetation productivity classes were then linked with the four farmer preferences with regards to the implementation options. Criteria based on the distances among the sites for implementing the different four options were set for farmer selection and the experiment was replicated three times in each vegetation productivity class (i.e. in total 12 farmers in each class). The results showed that the Kmeans method was successful in characterizing the landscape vegetation productivity with an overall accuracy of 86.2%. One the other hand, we successfully selected the 36 (12 in each of the 3 vegetation productivity classes) out of 410 farmers who met our distance-based criteria and participated in the implementation of one of the four technology options (i.e. IPPM, IPM, P, and control). In conclusion, NDVI proved to be a vital proxy for assessing the landscape dynamics as it provided a robust view of vegetation productivity patterns, which enabled a wellrepresentative distribution of the four pest management and pollination options across the landscape. Overall, the study shows the utility of integrating EO and socio-economic data in selecting sites for implementing agrotechnologies at a landscape scale.

T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Secchi Disk Depth is an important water quality measurement linked to many aspects of coastal and marine ecosystems. Understanding the role of this important indicator at regional scale requires synoptic observations through ocean color sensors, such as Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In this study, the spatial and temporal distributions of Secchi depths were mapped over the North Arabian Gulf (NAG) from 2003 to 2020 using a regional Secchi depth model. Spatiotemporal patterns and trends of Secchi depths within the NAG were also investigated using time series analysis. Generally, the MODIS SDD retrievals revealed that NAG Secchi depths increased toward south and offshore waters of the study area. The northern areas exhibited very low Secchi depths with monthly means less than 1.7 m, whereas the middle and southern areas had the highest Secchi depths in all seasons with monthly means higher than 9 m. The Secchi depths were lower during the fall and winter seasons while higher during the spring and summer seasons with a general peak in June. The time series analysis approach used in this study can be a systematic guideline for the future remote sensing studies of Secchi depths and other water quality indicators over different geographical locations.

TI  - Receipt of medications for opioid use disorder among youth engaged in primary care: data from 6 health systems
T2  - ADDICTION SCIENCE & CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Little is known about prevalence and treatment of OUD among youth engaged in primary care (PC). Medications are the recommended treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) for adolescents and young adults (youth). This study describes the prevalence of OUD, the prevalence of medication treatment for OUD, and patient characteristics associated with OUD treatment among youth engaged in PC.Methods: This cross-sectional study includes youth aged 16-25 years engaged in PC. Eligible patients had >= 1 PC visit during fiscal years (FY) 2014-2016 in one of 6 health systems across 6 states. Data from electronic health records and insurance claims were used to identify OUD diagnoses, office-based OUD medication treatment, and patient demographic and clinical characteristics in the FY of the first PC visit during the study period. Descriptive analyses were conducted in all youth, and stratified by age (16-17, 18-21, 22-25 years).Results: Among 303,262 eligible youth, 2131 (0.7%) had a documented OUD diagnosis. The prevalence of OUD increased by ascending age groups. About half of youth with OUD had documented depression or anxiety and one third had co-occurring substance use disorders. Receipt of medication for OUD was lowest among youth 16-17 years old (14%) and highest among those aged 22-25 (39%).Conclusions: In this study of youth engaged in 6 health systems across 6 states, there was low receipt of medication treatment, and high prevalence of other substance use disorders and mental health disorders. These findings indicate an urgent need to increase medication treatment for OUD and to integrate treatment for other substance use and mental health disorders.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of the hydrological response to land cover changes in the sub-basin of the Chicu river, Colombia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last years, in the sub-basin of the Chicu river, the agricultural and cattle exploitation has intensified and has depleted the water resources, thereby causing a deficit that has limited the continuity of such agricultural activity. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify land use and land cover changes contribute to the hydrological response to achieve sustainable management of the water resources in the sub-basin. In this sense, an integrated approach was used, which includes the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) hydrological model and the different LUCC (Land use and cover change) maps obtained through tele-detection by using Landsat images to decide the hydrological response in the basin with the changes in land cover and uses in 1997, 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016. As a result of the SWAT modeling, it can be noticed that the surface run-off varies according to the type of cover and extension, increasing or decreasing the water flow according to the characteristics of each cover, as in the case of bare lands (AGRL). While in 2006 it represented an area of 7.32% with a run-off of 39.25 mm, in 2001 its area decreased to 5.66% with a run-off of 44.9 mm. Moreover, in 1997 a flow of 4.45 m(3)/s can be observed, whereas in 2001 it decreases by 15% in the main current, which can be justified by a decrease of 8.8% in dense (FRSD) and fragmented (FRDT) forests. For 2006 and 2011 scenarios, the flow increases 13% and 50%, respectively, which corresponds to an increase of 36% and 48% concerning 2001 in clean grasses (PAST); despite the increase in clean grasses (PAST), the surface run-off was maintained almost constant above 9 mm, and it is thus considered a more stable vegetation cover.

TI  - A Boxed Warning for Montelukast: The FDA Perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY-IN PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) became aware of postmarketing reports of neuropsychiatric adverse events with Singulair (montelukast) use in 2007. Over the years, the FDA has conducted reviews of the clinical trial safety data, focused analyses of postmarketing reports, and reviews of the published literature. These activities have resulted in successive labeling updates and public communications. However, there has been continued concern among stakeholders about the risk of neuropsychiatric events and the lack of awareness among prescribers and patients/caregivers. On the basis of these concerns, the FDA embarked on another comprehensive review and also conducted a new observational study using claims data in the Sentinel Distributed Database. In September 2019, the FDA held a public Advisory Committee meeting to discuss its review and solicit recommendations from the panel regarding labeling and communication strategies. After careful consideration of the available data and feedback received during the FDA Advisory Committee meeting, the FDA required a boxed warning and a revision specifically for the allergic rhinitis indication to reserve use of montelukast to patients who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies. Based on benefit-risk considerations, the asthma indication was not changed. To provide insight into the process and rationale for the required labeling changes, we provide an overview of the decision-making framework we used.

TI  - Importance of satellite observations for high-resolution mapping of near-surface NO<sub>2</sub> by machine learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an important air pollutant with negative health effects and a precursor of ozone and particulate matter responsible for photo-chemical smog and wintertime air pollution. To evaluate human exposure to NO2 for public health assessment, maps of near-surface NO2 concentrations at a high resolution of 100 m are desirable. In this study, we report hourly maps of gridded near-surface NO2 concentrations that are produced using an extreme gradient-boosted tree ensemble for an Alpine domain (Switzerland and northern Italy) spanning two years, from June 2018 to May 2020. To estimate the NO2 distribution at ground level, we used satellite observations of NO2 vertical column density, land use data, meteorological fields and topographical information to train models with in situ NO2 ground measurements. The best model with this approach captured up to 59% of hourly NO2 variation for 40 test stations in the domain with a mean absolute error of 7.69 mu g/m(3), performing especially well for urban regions with dense sampling. We present the first hourly maps of NO2 concentrations that reveal previously unresolved spatio-temporal variations. Local interpretations of the machine learning model demonstrate that TROPOMI NO2 satellite observations make a strong contribution to the information content of the near-surface NO2 maps besides their relatively coarse resolution (3.5 x 5.5 km(2)) and the fact that they are only available once a day under cloud-free conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown presents a case study that offers new insights into the importance of satellite data that can partially re-mediate statistical models' unsusceptibility to unusual events (like changes due to political intervention) with regard to model training.

TI  - Object-based machine learning approach for soybean mapping using temporal sentinel-1/sentinel-2 data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soybean mapping in Indian context is challenging owing to its short growing period coinciding with the monsoon clouds, inter-cropping and smallholders' land. This study proposes an approach for mapping soybean by integrating object-based image analysis with machine learning (ML) based classification using temporal Sentinel-1 SAR (S-1) and Sentinel-2 optical (S-2) data. Field objects were delineated with scale-optimized multi-resolution segmentation using historical S-2 data. Object-based temporal VH-backscatter and NDVI were extracted for training, validation and testing of the three ML models. Validation results showed the outperformance of Extreme gradient boosting (OB-XGBoost) over Random Forest (OB-RF) and Support vector machine (OB-SVM) with an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.50, 91.08 and 90.1, respectively. Testing of OB-XGBoost model resulted in OA, kappa statistics, and F-score (soybean) of 86.12%, 0.82, and 87.23%, respectively. The soybean map produced by the proposed methodology has shown better representation in terms of homogeneity and uniformity than the pixel-based classification.

TI  - Antimicrobial use in hospitalized patients: a multicentre point prevalence survey across seven hospitals in Ghana
T2  - JAC-ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a public health crisis of global proportions. Data is required to understand the local drivers of antimicrobial resistance and support decision-making processes including implementation of appropriate antimicrobial stewardship strategies.Objectives: To measure antimicrobial usage in hospitals in Ghana.Methods: Using the Global Point Prevalence instruments and processes, we conducted point prevalence surveys across AMR surveillance sentinel hospitals in Ghana, between September and December 2019. Hospital records of all inpatients on admission at 0800 hours on a specific day were reviewed for antimicrobial use at the time of the survey. Data on antibiotic use, including indication for use and quality of prescribing were recorded.Results: Overall prevalence of antibiotic use across the sentinel sites was 54.9% (n" 1591/2897), ranging between 48.4% (n = 266/550) and 67.2% (n = 82/122). The highest prevalence of antibiotic use 89.3% (n = 25/28) was observed in adult ICUs. The average number of antibiotics prescribed per patient was 1.7 (n = 1562/2620), with the majority (66%, n = 728/2620) administered via the parenteral route. The five most-commonly used antibiotics were metronidazole (20.6%, n = 541/2620), cefuroxime (12.9%, n = 338/2620), ceftriaxone (11.8%, n = 310/2620), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (8.8%, n = 231/2620) and ciprofloxacin (7.8%, n = 204/2620). The majority (52.2%; n = 1367/2620) of antibiotics were prescribed to treat an infection, whilst surgical prophylaxis accounted for 26.1%(n = 684/2620).Conclusions: We observed a high use of antibiotics including metronidazole and cephalosporins at the participating hospitals. Most antibiotics were empirically prescribed, with low use of microbiological cultures. High usage of third-generation cephalosporins especially for community-acquired infections offers an opportunity for antibiotic stewardship interventions.

TI  - Automated and rapid detection of cancer in suspicious axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer
T2  - NPJ BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Preoperative staging of suspicious axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) allows patients to be triaged to ALN dissection or to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) and cytology of ALN is moderately sensitive but its clinical utility relies heavily on the cytologist's experience. We proposed that the 5-h automated GeneXpert system-based prototype breast cancer detection assay (BCDA) that quantitatively measures DNA methylation in ten tumor-specific gene markers could provide a facile, accurate test for detecting cancer in FNA of enlarged lymph nodes. We validated the assay in ALN-FNA samples from a prospective study of patients (N = 230) undergoing SLNB. In a blinded analysis of 218 evaluable LN-FNAs from 108 malignant and 110 benign LNs by histology, BCDA displayed a sensitivity of 90.7% and specificity of 99.1%, achieving an area under the ROC curve, AUC of 0.958 (95% CI: 0.928-0.989; P < 0.0001). Next, we conducted a study of archival FNAs of ipsilateral palpable LNs (malignant, N= 72, benign, N = 53 by cytology) collected in the outpatient setting prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Using the ROC-threshold determined in the prospective study, compared to cytology, BCDA achieved a sensitivity of 94.4% and a specificity of 92.5% with a ROC-AUC = 0.977 (95% CI: 0.953-1.000; P < 0.0001). Our study shows that the automated assay detects cancer in suspicious lymph nodes with a high level of accuracy within 5 h. This cancer detection assay, scalable for analysis to scores of LN FNAs, could assist in determining eligibility of patients to different treatment regimens.

TI  - Pathogenicity Analysis of Weaned Piglets Challenged With Novel Emerging Senecavirus A in Fujian, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to evaluate the pathogenicity of Senecavirus A (SVA) to weaned piglets preliminarily, 28-day-old weaned piglets were challenged with SVA by intramuscular injection. The clinical manifestations, antibody levels, and tissue viral load of infected piglets were detected. The results indicated that the piglets challenged with SVA CH/FuJ/2017 showed drowsiness, lameness, oral blisters, diarrhea, and other clinical signs. Lesions on the hooves were observed. Red spots or plaques were initially observed on the hoof and then developed into blisters that cracked and gradually formed scab. The symptoms and signs were relieved after 8 days post-infection (dpi). The sentinel piglet, feeding together with the challenged piglets, showed similar clinical signs with the challenged piglets after 3 dpi. Monitoring of antibody levels showed that anti-SVA antibody could be detected at 5 dpi by competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) method, and neutralizing antibody could be detected after 7 dpi. Analysis of viral tissue distribution and viral load indicated that SVA could replicate in the liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and lymph node. In all, Senecavirus disease was successfully replicated by SVA CH/FuJ/2017 isolate, which verified the clinical manifestations of SVA infection in weaned piglets, and provided a foundation for further SVA pathogenesis and vaccine development.

TI  - Local Awareness and Interpretations of Species Extinction in a Rural Chinese Biodiversity Hotspot
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Incorporating local perspectives is fundamental to evidence-based conservation, for both understanding complex socio-ecological systems and implementing appropriate management interventions. How local communities understand extinction, and whether these views affect perceptions of biodiversity loss and the effect of anthropogenic activities, has rarely been evaluated explicitly in conservation projects. To target this data gap, we conducted 185 interviews to assess levels and patterns of understanding about wildlife decline and extinction in rural communities around Bawangling National Nature Reserve, Hainan, China, a priority conservation site that has experienced recent species losses. Interviewees showed varying awareness of declines and extirpation of local wildlife species. Two-thirds did not consider the permanent disappearance of wildlife to be possible; among those who did, only one-third could comprehend the scientific term "extinction." Thinking extinction is possible was associated with identifying declined and extirpated species, but not with perceiving locally-driven human activities, such as hunting, as the reason for wildlife loss. The government was seen as the entity most responsible for conservation. Variation found around local perceptions of extinction, its drivers, and conservation responsibility demonstrates that comprehension of key conservation concepts should not be assumed to be homogenous, highlighting the challenge of transposing scientific concepts between different social and cultural settings. Proactively incorporating local perspectives and worldviews, especially by obtaining context-specific baseline understandings, has major implications for other contexts worldwide and should inform conservation planning and management.

TI  - Impact of sea level rise and shoreline changes in the tropical island ecosystem of Andaman and Nicobar region, India
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - We report here a four decades of shoreline changes and possible sea level rise (SLR) impact on land use/land cover (LULC) in Little Andaman Island by using remote sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. A total of six remote sensing data sets covering years between 1976 and 2018 were used to understand the shoreline changes. Moreover, a Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) was used to estimate short- and long-term shoreline changes from ArcGIS environment. Besides, the island vulnerability due to SLR was studied through using digital elevation model (DEM). As a result of Sumatra earthquake (2004), the results were showed a significant variation in shoreline upliftment and subsidence. The land subsidence was noticed in the range of 1042-3077 ha with sea level rise between 1 and 5 m. Hence, we conclude that Little Andaman Island is vulnerable to SLR and overwhelm low-elevation coastal zone.

TI  - Deep learning-based tree species mapping in a highly diverse tropical urban setting
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially explicit information on urban tree species distribution is crucial for green infrastructure management in cities. This information is usually acquired with ground-based surveys, which are time-consuming and usually cover limited spatial extents. The combination of machine learning algorithms and remote sensing images has been hailed as a promising way to map tree species over broad areas. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning method, have achieved outstanding results for tree species discrimination in various remote sensing data types. However, there is a lack of studies using CNN-based methods to produce tree species composition maps, particularly for tropical urban settings. Here, we propose a multi-task CNN to map tree species in a highly diverse neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Our network architecture takes an aerial photograph (RGB bands and pixel size = 0.15 m) and delivers two outputs: a semantically segmented image and a distance map transform. In the former, all pixel positions are labeled, while in the latter, each pixel position contains the Euclidean distance to the crown boundary. We developed a post-processing approach that combines the two outputs, and we classified nine and five tree species with an average F1-score of 79.3 +/- 8.6% and 87.6 +/- 4.4%, respectively. Moreover, our post-processing approach produced a realistic tree species composition map by labeling only pixels of the target species with high class membership probabilities. Our results show the potential of CNNs and aerial photographs to map tree species in highly diverse tropical urban settings, providing valuable insights for urban forest management and green spaces planning.

TI  - Brief communication: Ice sheet elevation measurements from the Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B tandem phase
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the coming decade, the quartet of Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite altimeters will provide a continuous record of ice sheet elevation change. Ensuring consistency of measurement between the four satellites requires rigorous in-flight inter-comparison. To facilitate this, Sentinel-3B was initially flown in a unique tandem formation with Sentinel3A, enabling near-instantaneous, co-located measurements of surface elevation to be acquired. Here, we analyse tandem measurements of ice sheet elevation, to show that both instruments operate with statistically equivalent accuracy and precision, even over complex ice margin terrain. This analysis demonstrates that both satellites can be used interchangeably to study ice sheet evolution.

TI  - A Novel Technique for Robust Training of Deep Networks With Multisource Weak Labeled Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the reliability of each source is taken into consideration. This is done by exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used during the training process to weigh each label according to the related source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

TI  - Assessing the effectiveness of ground truth data to capture landscape variability from an agricultural region using Gaussian simulation and geostatistical techniques
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Predictive modeling with remotely sensed data requires an accurate representation of spatial variability by ground truth data. In this study, we assessed the reliability of the size and location of ground truth data in capturing the landscape spatial variability embedded in the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) hyperspectral image in an agricultural region in Anand, India. We derived simulated spectral vegetation and soil indices using Gaussian simulation from AVIRIS-NG image for two point-location datasets, (1) ground truth points from adaptive sampling and (2) points from conditional Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS). We compared values of the simulated image indices against the actual image indices (measured) through the analysis of mean absolute errors. Modeling the variogram of the measured indices with the hyperspectral image in high spatial resolution (4m), is an effective way to characterize the spatial heterogeneity at the landscape level. We used geostatistical techniques to analyze the shapes of experimental variograms in order to assess whether or not the ground truth points, when compared against the cLHS-derived points, captured the spatial structures and variability of the studied agricultural area using measured indices. In addition, we explored the capability of the variogram by running tests in different point sample sizes. The ground truth and cLHS datasets were able to derive equivalent values for field spatial variability from image indices, according to our findings. Furthermore, this research presents a methodology for selecting spectral indices and determining the best sample size for efficiently replicating spatial patterns in hyperspectral images.

TI  - Using Landsat 8 imagery for remote monitoring of total phosphorus as a water quality parameter of irrigation ponds in Taiwan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring water body quality parameters with high spatial and temporal resolutions is crucial because mitigation of pollution is usually costlier than early prevention/intervention. The existing monitoring methods for irrigation ponds in Taoyuan, Taiwan, are based on field measurements that have low spatial and temporal resolutions. In this study, using Landsat 8 satellite imagery, a multiple regression-derived relationship between the satellite band reflectance and the concentration of total phosphorus (TP) was established. The satellite imagery was atmospherically corrected with ACOLITE based on shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands. This method was used to select predictor variables in the multiple regression-derived equation based on forward selection of variables using a p value and variation inflation factor (VIF) threshold. The derived equation yielded a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.67. The near-infrared band (band 5) was found to be most significant. The Landsat 8 imagery retrieved for two of the three pond studies included only a few pixels from the ponds because parts of the pond surfaces are covered by floating photovoltaic power plants. The TP concentrations resulting from the derived equation indicate the feasibility of using satellite remote sensing methods to monitor the water quality. The derived relationships are potentially applicable to extend the availability of temporal and spatial water quality data for these irrigation ponds.

TI  - Seasonal variability in aeolian dust deposition fluxes and their mineralogical composition over the Northeastern Arabian Sea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric mineral dust is derived from arid/semi-arid region, undergoes long-range transport, and can impact surface biogeochemical processes in the pristine marine region. This study reports fluxes of mineral dust (wet and dry deposition), their clay mineralogy, and associated seasonal variability over the Northeastern Arabian Sea. Dust sources are assessed using mineral composition and their ratios as well as satellite retrievals during 2012-2015. The average wet deposition flux (293 mg m(-2) day(-1)) of mineral dust is three times higher than dry deposition flux (96 mg m(-2) day(-1)). A clear distinction is observed in the mineral composition of wet and dry deposited dust with smectite and palygorskite being dominant during the wet period and illite and chlorite being dominant during the dry period. Mineralogical composition and their ratios indicate that major dust sources to the Northeastern Arabian Sea are from northeast Africa, Arabian Peninsula, and southwest Asia. These observations are corroborated with the satellite retrievals, aerosol optical depth, and back trajectory analyses.

TI  - The superiority of the normalized difference phenology index (NDPI) for estimating grassland aboveground fresh biomass
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of grassland aboveground fresh biomass (called AGB in the study) and its spatial-temporal dynamics is indispensable for sustainable grassland management. The most common method used in estimating AGB with remotely sensed data is based on the relationship between field AGB measurements and vegetation indices (VIs); however, the existing VIs do not deliver adequate results due to the soil background and spatial, temporal and sampling size variability. In this study, the AGB estimation model with the normalized difference phenology index (NDPI) was evaluated in terms of model robustness and spatial and temporal scalability based on comparisons with the widely used ratio vegetation index (RVI), difference vegetation index (DVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), and optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI). The field measurements of AGB of the natural grassland in Inner Mongolia, China, collected in 2013, 2016, and 2017 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance products were used for analysis. The results based on training and independent validation data showed the following: (1) The R2 value between AGB and the NDPI was the highest (0.73) among all VIs, followed by soil-line-adjusted VIs, while the R2 values of the RVI and DVI were the lowest; (2) The NDPI-based model had the best robustness for different sampling sizes; (3) The NDPI-based model also had superior spatial and temporal scalability. The results from simulation experiments using the PROSAIL model also support the superiority of the NDPI in estimating AGB. The simulation analysis further reveals that the overall superiority of the NDPI originates from the fact that the NDPI overcomes the adverse impacts of the heterogeneity of the soil background and accounts for changes in the leaf water content that contribute substantially to AGB in grassland. These findings suggest that the NDPI-based AGB estimation model is advantageous for monitoring AGB in large grasslands with significant spatial-temporal heterogeneity.

TI  - A MODIS-based scalable remote sensing method to estimate sowing and harvest dates of soybean crops in Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale agriculture in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil is a major contributor to global food supplies, but its continued productivity is vulnerable to contracting wet seasons and increased exposure to extreme temperatures. Sowing dates serve as an effective adaptation strategy to these climate perturbations. By controlling the weather experienced by crops and influencing the number of successive crops that can be grown in a year, sowing dates can impact both individual crop yields and cropping intensities. Unfortunately, the spatiotemporally resolved crop phenology data necessary to understand sowing dates and their relationship to crop yield are only available over limited years and regions. To fill this data gap, we produce a 500 m rainfed soy (Glycine max) sowing and harvest date dataset for Mato Grosso from 2004 to 2014 using a novel time series analysis method for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery, adapted for implementation in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Our estimates reveal that soy sowing and harvest dates varied widely (about 2 months) from field to field, confirming the need for spatially resolved crop timing information. An interannual trend toward earlier sowing dates occurred independently of variations in wet season onset, and may be attributed to an improvement in logistic or economic constraints that previously hampered early sowing. As anticipated, double cropped fields in which two crops are grown in succession are planted earlier than single cropped fields. This difference shrank, however, as sowing of single cropped fields occurred closer to the wet season onset in more recent years. The analysis offers insights about sowing behavior in response to historical climate variations which could be extended to understand sowing response under climate change in Mato Grosso.

TI  - Active and Passive Microwave Signatures of Diurnal Soil Freeze-Thaw Transitions on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Active and passive microwave characteristics of diurnal soil freeze-thaw transitions and their relationships are crucial for developing retrieval algorithms of the soil liquid water content ( $theta_{liq}$ ) and freeze/thaw state, which, however, have been less explored. This study investigates these microwave characteristics and relationships via analysis of ground-based measurements of brightness temperature ( $T_{B}$ ) and backscattering coefficients (sigma SUPERSCRIPT ZERO) in combination with simulations performed with the Tor Vergata discrete radiative transfer model. Both an L-band (1.4 GHz) radiometer ELBARA-III and a wide-band (1-10 GHz) scatterometer are installed in a seasonally frozen Tibetan meadow ecosystem to measure diurnal variations of TB and copolarized sigma SUPERSCRIPT ZERO at both hh (sigma $_{hh}$ SUPERSCRIPT ZERO) and vv (sigma $_{vv}$ SUPERSCRIPT ZERO) polarizations. Analysis of measurements collected between December 2017 and March 2018 shows that 1) diurnal cycles are observed in both T $_{B}$ and sigma SUPERSCRIPT ZERO due to the change in surface theta liq caused by diurnal soil freeze-thaw transitions; 2) a negatively linear relationship is found between e and sigma SUPERSCRIPT ZERO regardless of frequency, polarization combinations, and observation angles; 3) slopes (beta ) of linearly fit equations between eH and sigma $_{hh}$ SUPERSCRIPT ZERO decrease with increasing observation angles of ELBARA-III, while the ones between eV and sigma $_{vv}$ SUPERSCRIPT ZERO increase with increasing observation angles; and 4) correlations between e and sigma SUPERSCRIPT ZERO increase with decreasing microwave frequency of sigma SUPERSCRIPT ZERO measurements and ELBARA-III observation angles, and magnitudes of diurnal sigma SUPERSCRIPT ZERO cycles also increase with decreasing microwave frequency. Moreover, the calibrated Tor Vergata model shows capability to reproduce both diurnal e and sigma SUPERSCRIPT ZERO variations as well as to quantify their relationships at different frequencies and observation angles.

TI  - Detection of paddy rice cropping systems in southern China with time series Landsat images and phenology-based algorithms
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern China is a major rice-producing region where mixed rice cropping systems (single cropping rice (SCR) and double-cropping rice (DCR)) are widely practiced. An accurate estimation of the spatiotemporal changes in cropping systems is important for understanding the dynamic of paddy rice system and for developing suitable agricultural policies. However, few studies focus on mapping long-term changes in cropping systems in this subtropical region. The objective of this research is 1) to improve the phenology- and pixel-based paddy rice mapping (PPPM) algorithm by simultaneously considering the phenology signatures in the rice transplanting and heading periods; 2) to better identify different rice cropping systems and analyze their changes. Based on the improved PPPM method, we generated annual maps of SCR and DCR in southern China with image collection of Landsat 5, 7, and 8 from 1999 to 2019 using the Google Earth Engine platform. The overall accuracies of cropping system results for the study regions range from 81.0% to 98.1% depending on the areas of interest created in our study area. Then, the spatiotemporal patterns of the annual SCR and DCR time series were analyzed. In 2000, the total rice area was 208,614.6 km(2), decreased sharply in 2003, and thereafter, the total increase in the paddy rice area fluctuated until 2011. From 2000 to 2019, the total rice area decreased to 171,474.3 km(2) in 2019. The results showed that relatively stable SCR mainly distributed in Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangsu provinces whereas DCR occurred in Guangdong, Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. DCR-to-SCR conversion occurred drastically in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. Rice-to-non-rice conversion was more prevalent in Hunan and Hubei provinces. Detailed spatiotemporal information over 20 years suggested that the plans for agricultural resources utilization in some specific provinces should be proposed, which is of great significance for food security in the major rice-producing area in southern China.

TI  - Delineating Urban Growth Boundary Using Remote sensing, ANN-MLP and CA model: A Case Study of Thiruvananthapuram Urban Agglomeration, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research paper investigates urban sprawl in Thiruvananthapuram Urban Agglomeration (UA) and attempts to delineate Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) for promoting urban sustenance. A 112% rise in the spatial expanse of Thiruvananthapuram UA from 256.22 km(2) in 2001 to 542.57 km(2) in 2011 might induce urban sprawl in the peripheral areas. The Landsat satellite imagery for the years 1987, 1997, 2007, and 2017 were extracted to examine the spatiotemporal urban growth pattern. Shannon's entropy index was employed to detect urban sprawl in Thiruvananthapuram UA. The UGB delineation process involved future urban growth prediction using the MOLUSCE (Modules for Land Use Change Simulations) plug-in of QGIS software. ANN-MLP (Artificial Neural Network-Multi Layer Perceptron) and CA (Cellular Automata) model was preferred in MOLUSCE to predict future urban growth for the year 2027. Thereafter, hexagons of one square kilometer were used to demarcate the Contiguous built-up Growth Boundary (CGB), and later, sub-administrative units were selected to delineate UGB. The results revealed a rise in the built-up areas from 36.04 km(2) in 1987 to 140.69 km(2) in 2017. Shannon's entropy index indicated the prevalence of urban sprawl in Thiruvananthapuram UA. The future growth prediction by 2027 exhibited a further rise in built-up areas to 173.31 km(2). The total area within CGB is 213.58 km(2), while UGB accounted for 355.59 km(2), which included 16 sub-administrative units. This study exhibited a unique methodology to delineate the urban growth boundary, which optimizes the future land requirements in developing nations.

TI  - Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis by exogenous and endogenous GDF15
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - An acute increase in the circulating concentration of glucocorticoid hormones is essential for the survival of severe somatic stresses. Circulating concentrations of GDF15, a hormone that acts in the brain to reduce food intake, are frequently elevated in stressful states. We now report that GDF15 potently activates the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in mice and rats. A blocking antibody to the GDNF-family receptor alpha-like receptor completely prevented the corticosterone response to GDF15 administration. In wild-type mice exposed to a range of stressful stimuli, circulating levels of both corticosterone and GDF15 rose acutely. In the case of Escherichia coli or lipopolysaccharide injections, the vigorous proinflammatory cytokine response elicited was sufficient to produce a near-maximal HPA response, regardless of the presence or absence of GDF15. In contrast, the activation of the HPA axis seen in wild-type mice in response to the administration of genotoxic or endoplasmic reticulum toxins, which do not provoke a marked rise in cytokines, was absent in Gdf15(-/-) mice. In conclusion, consistent with its proposed role as a sentinel hormone, endogenous GDF15 is required for the activation of the protective HPA response to toxins that do not induce a substantial cytokine response. In the context of efforts to develop GDF15 as an antiobesity therapeutic, these findings identify a biomarker of target engagement and a previously unrecognized pharmacodynamic effect, which will require monitoring in human studies.

TI  - Predicting the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon stock in Swedish forests using a group of covariates and site-specific data
T2  - SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - The status of the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock at any position in the landscape is subject to a complex interplay of soil state factors operating at different scales and regulating multiple processes resulting either in soils acting as a net sink or net source of carbon. Forest landscapes are characterized by high spatial variability, and key drivers of SOC stock might be specific for sub-areas compared to those influencing the whole landscape. Consequently, separately calibrating models for sub-areas (local models) that collectively cover a target area can result in different prediction accuracy and SOC stock drivers compared to a single model (global model) that covers the whole area. The goal of this study was therefore to (1) assess how global and local models differ in predicting the humus layer, mineral soil, and total SOC stock in Swedish forests and (2) identify the key factors for SOC stock prediction and their scale of influence.We used the Swedish National Forest Soil Inventory (NFSI) database and a digital soil mapping approach to evaluate the prediction performance using random forest models calibrated locally for the northern, central, and southern Sweden (local models) and for the whole of Sweden (global model). Models were built by considering (1) only site characteristics which are recorded on the plot during the NFSI, (2) the group of covariates (remote sensing, historical land use data, etc.) and (3) both site characteristics and group of covariates consisting mostly of remote sensing data.Local models were generally more effective for predicting SOC stock after testing on independent validation data. Using the group of covariates together with NFSI data indicated that such covariates have limited predictive strength but that site-specific covariates from the NFSI showed better explanatory strength for SOC stocks. The most important covariates that influence the humus layer, mineral soil (0-50 cm), and total SOC stock were related to the site-characteristic covariates and include the soil moisture class, vegetation type, soil type, and soil texture. This study showed that local calibration has the potential to improve prediction accuracy, which will vary depending on the type of available covariates.

TI  - Assessing biomass and primary production of microphytobenthos in depositional coastal systems using spectral information
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In depositional intertidal coastal systems, primary production is dominated by benthic microalgae (microphytobenthos) inhabiting the mudflats. This benthic productivity is supporting secondary production and supplying important services to humans including food provisioning. Increased frequencies of extreme events in weather (such as heatwaves, storm surges and cloudbursts) are expected to strongly impact the spatiotemporal dynamics of the microphytobenthos and subsequently their contribution to coastal food webs. Within north-western Europe, the years 2018 and 2019 were characterized by record-breaking summer temperatures and accompanying droughts. Field-calibrated satellite data (Sentinel 2) were used to quantify the seasonal dynamics of microphytobenthos biomass and production at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution during these years. We demonstrate that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) should be used with caution in depositional coastal intertidal systems, because it may reflect import of remains of allochthonous pelagic productivity rather than local benthic biomass. We show that the reduction in summer biomass of the benthic microalgae cannot be explained by grazing but was most probably due to the high temperatures. The fivefold increase in salinity from January to September 2018, resulting from reduced river run-off during this exceptionally dry year, cannot have been without consequences for the vitality of the microphytobenthos community and its resistance to wind stress and cloud bursts. Comparison to historical information revealed that primary productivity of microphytobenthos may vary at least fivefold due to variations in environmental conditions. Therefore, ongoing changes in environmental conditions and especially extreme events because of climate change will not only lead to changes in spatiotemporal patterns of benthic primary production but also to changes in biodiversity of life under water and ecosystem services including food supply. Satellite MPB data allows for adequate choices in selecting coastal biodiversity conservation and coastal food supply.

TI  - Estimating instantaneous sea-ice dynamics from space using the bi-static radar measurements of Earth Explorer 10 candidate Harmony
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes the observation techniques and suggests processing methods to estimate dynamical seaice parameters from data of the Earth Explorer 10 candidate Harmony. The two Harmony satellites will fly in a reconfigurable formation with Sentinel-1D. Both will be equipped with a multi-angle thermal infrared sensor and a passive radar receiver, which receives the reflected Sentinel-1D signals using two antennas. During the lifetime of the mission, two different formations will be flown. In the stereo formation, the Harmony satellites will fly approximately 300 km in front and behind Sentinel-1, which allows for the estimation of instantaneous sea-ice drift vectors. We demonstrate that the addition of instantaneous sea-ice drift estimates on top of the daily integrated values from feature tracking have benefits in terms of interpretation, sampling and resolution. The wideswath instantaneous drift observations of Harmony also help to put high-temporal-resolution instantaneous buoy observations into a spatial context. Additionally, it allows for the extraction of deformation parameters, such as shear and divergence. As a result, Harmony's data will help to improve seaice statistics and parametrizations to constrain sea-ice models. In the cross-track interferometry (XTI) mode, Harmony's satellites will fly in close formation with an XTI baseline to be able to estimate surface elevations. This will allow for improved estimates of sea-ice volume and also enables the retrieval of full, two-dimensional swell-wave spectra in seaice-covered regions without any gaps. In stereo formation, the line-of-sight diversity allows the inference of swell properties in both directions using traditional velocity bunching approaches. In XTI mode, Harmony's phase differences are only sensitive to the ground-range direction swell. To fully recover two-dimensional swell-wave spectra, a synergy between XTI height spectra and intensity spectra is required. If selected, the Harmony mission will be launched in 2028.

TI  - Temporal dynamics change of land use/land cover in Jhansi district of Uttar Pradesh over past 20 years using LANDSAT TM, ETM+ and OLI sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and monitoring land use land cover (LULC) dynamics is vital for sustainable land development, planning and management. Using advanced techniques of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS), the present study is an effort to monitor the changes in LULC patterns of Jhansi District of Uttar Pradesh for the periods 2000-2010 and 2010-2020. Satellite images from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) for 2001; Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) for 2010 and Landsat 8 (OLI) for 2020 were used to extract Land use/Land cover classes. Supervised classification using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) was applied to monitor LULC of the study area. Six major LULC classes viz; cropland, fallow/barren land, built-up area, water bodies and forest have been identified and showed that major land use in the district is crop land. The accuracy assessment of the classified map was done using 256 random points distributed all over the image. Results indicated that LULC in Jhansi district has undergone a series of changes over the past two decades. Results showed that crop land, built-up area and water bodies have increased by 27.16% (1367.26 Km(2)), 0.58% (29.4 Km(2)) and 0.3% (15.26 Km(2)), respectively while fallow/barren land and forest have decreased by 27.55% (1386.58 Km(2)), and 0.5% (25.34 Km(2)), respectively.

TI  - Identifying river ice on the Tibetan Plateau based on the relative difference in spectral bands
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing can potentially be used to monitor river ice, which is of significance for water resource utilization and hydrological research, especially on the Tibetan Plateau, over which field observations are severely limited. However, methods to monitor the river ice distribution over a large scale while overcoming snow interference have not been reported yet. To monitor river ice on the Tibetan Plateau on a large scale, we present a relative difference river ice (RDRI) identification method based on the differential spectral characteristics of river ice. The difference between the red and near-infrared (NIR) band reflectance of river ice is divided by the sum of the NIR reflectance and infrared band reflectance. The resulting values are notably different for river ice and other neighboring similar landscapes, such as snow cover. This method can overcome the interference caused by snow cover and other surrounding landscapes and enable the monitoring of river ice in different forms at different elevations on the Tibetan Plateau. The RDRI method is applied to Landsat and Sentinel-2 images. The validation results show that the mean overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were 99.76% and 0.94, respectively. The comparison of the RDRI and normalized difference snow index (NDSI) methods indicates that the accuracies of both methods for river ice monitoring are similar in the absence of any snow disturbance. The RDRI can enable more accurate remote sensing of river ice on a large scale, which can support river ice distribution research over the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Sedimentary organic carbon and nutrient distributions in an endorheic lake in semiarid area of the Mongolian Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the lack of outlets, inflowing pollutants are often deposited in an endorheic lake, posing potential pressure on the environment. With climate change, extreme weather is expected to be more frequent and will contribute to the release of carbon and nutrients buried in the lakebeds. However, the distribution of sedimentary organic carbon and nutrients and the mechanisms that control the distribution are not fully understood, despite their significance to environmental development in endorheic lakes being widely recognized. In this study, the mechanisms controlling the sedimentary organic carbon and nutrient distributions in endorheic lakes were examined based on the analysis of an endorheic lake in the semiarid area of the Mongolian Plateau. The field survey results indicate that the concentrations of sedimentary organic carbon (TOC) and nutrients (NH3-N and TP) on the lakebed have significant correlations and present spatial heterogeneities. To further study the distribution mechanisms, numerical models were established to calculate the age of the water discharged from the rivers around the lake, and satellite remote sensing data were applied to examine the external source of organic carbon and nutrients and the factors influencing their movements to the lake. Based on the distribution of the water age, the water flow and mass transport trends in Lake Hulun were determined, and the time scales of the environmental processes were compared with those of water circulation. Further analysis indicates that the water circulation in the lake favors the accumulation of sedimentary organic carbon and nutrients in the northwestern part of the lake, and the organic carbon produced in the lake is transported to this region within an ice-free period. Satellite remote sensing data indicate that the region on the northwest bank of the lake experiences a larger terrestrial slope and better vegetation coverage than that on the southeast bank, which corresponds to a higher concentration of sedimentary organic carbon and nutrients in the northwest of the lake. This suggests that the sediment quality is closely related to the environment around the endorheic lake, and the larger slope and better vegetation coverage are significant factors for the high concentration of sedimentary organic carbon and nutrients on the lakebed under the conditions of scarce precipitation and low temperature. This study provides a theoretical basis and direction for further protection and management of the ecological environment of endorheic lakes.

TI  - Estimating tree aboveground biomass using multispectral satellite-based data in Mediterranean agroforestry system using random forest algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is a key biophysical variable to assess and monitor the spatio-temporal changes of forest ecosystems. AGB should be accurately and timely estimated through remote sensing to provide valuable information to better support sustainable forest management strategies. QuickBird and WorldView2 satellites data and Random Forest (RF) regression model were used to estimate tree AGB in Mediterranean agroforestry systems. Spectral bands, vegetation indices and Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture features of 140 plots with and without vegetation mask were used as independent variables, while total of AGB per plot was used as dependent variable. A model with good performance was obtained for a complex agroforestry system, with an R-2 of 82.0% and RMSE of 10.5 t/ha (22.6%). The top 11 most important variables have 80.3% of total relative importance, with 59.6% of GLCM textural features, 12.3% of vegetation indices and 8.4% of spectral bands. The results highlight the importance of the variable GLCM texture, and the use of vegetation mask and RF regression model to collect accurate spatial information on key crown cover attributes, by excluding the spectral contribution of understory vegetation and soil characteristic, of Mediterranean agroforestry systems.

TI  - Crop Area Mapping in Southern and Central Malawi With Google Earth Engine
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa consists primarily of smallholder farms of rainfed crops. Historically, satellite data were too coarse to account for the heterogeneity in these landscapes. Sentinel-2 data have improved spectral resolution and much higher spatial resolution (10 m) than previously available satellites with global coverage, such as Landsat or MODIS, making mapping smallholder farms possible. Spectral mixture analysis was used to convert the Sentinel-2 signal into fractions of green vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, soil, and shade endmembers. Very high spatial resolution imagery in Google Earth Pro was used to identify locations of crop and natural vegetation classes, with over 20,000 reference points interpreted. The high temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 (5 days repeat) allows for classification of landcover based on the phenological signal, with natural areas having smoothly varying amounts of photosynthetic vegetation annually, while cropped areas show more abrupt changes, and also the presence of bare soil due to agricultural activity at some point during the year. We summarized the endmember values using monthly medians, extracted values for the reference data points, randomly split them into training and test data sets, and input the training data into the random forests algorithm in Google Earth Engine to map crop area. We divided southern and central Malawi into tiles, and found crop/no crop classification accuracies on the test data for each tile to be between 87 and 93%. The 10 m map of crop area was aggregated to the district level and showed an R-2 of 0.74 with ground-based statistics from the Malawi government and 0.79 with a remotely sensed product developed by the USGS.

TI  - Monitoring intertidal topography using the future SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) mission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Intertidal flats are very dynamic environments pressured by anthropogenic activities and climate change. There is an increasing need for updated intertidal topography maps for scientific and coastal management purposes. The future wide-swath altimetry mission SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) will provide valuable data for intertidal topography monitoring. SWOT will use interferometry to measure heights over water surfaces only, which will prevent the use of this method over intertidal areas. Since SWOT is expected to provide highly accurate 2D sea level measurements in coastal areas, it will be very beneficial for the waterline method. The waterline method is one of the most commonly used spaceborne methods for mapping intertidal topography. This method uses a combination between a series of satellite images acquired at different tidal stages (radar or optical) and sea level information (tide gauge records, models output, or satellite measurements). The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of SWOT in generating intertidal Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) using the waterline method (with a brief investigation regarding the interferometric capabilities of SWOT over intertidal areas). To this end, tests were made by generating intertidal DEMs from SWOT-type observables for two intertidal bays situated on the French coast: the Arcachon Bay and the Bay of Veys. SWOT-type observables were simulated using the SWOT large scale simulator developed by the French space agency (CNES - Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales). By comparing SWOT-derived DEMs to the validation DEMs (generated by the waterline method using Sentinel-1 and -2 images), SWOT showed a great potential for monitoring intertidal topographies. Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE) reached respectively 5.2 cm and 8.4 cm for the Arcachon Bay and 10.2 cm and 17.3 cm for the Bay of Veys. However, the accuracy of SWOT is dependent on SWOT s orbit. An unfavorable sampling due to tidal aliasing decreases the accuracy of the DEMs. Thus, the period during which the series of satellite images are acquired (the acquisition period) shall be chosen carefully in order to generate accurate SWOT DEMs. SWOT will be able to generate relatively accurate DEMs with period of acquisitions of 3 months. With acquisition periods that provide adequate sampling of the tidal range, SWOT will be able to detect topographic changes between consecutive DEMs. The present work was supported by the CNES in the framework of the future mission SWOT.

TI  - Estimation of soil texture using Sentinel-2 multispectral imaging data: An ensemble modeling approach
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil texture is an important compositional property where the separate estimates of sand, silt, and clay often does not add up to 100 % when predicted independently using digital soil mapping approach. An alternative is to use Remote sensing (RS) data, however, varying soil surface conditions, satellite pass day, and cloud cover on imagery often limit its estimation accuracies. Here, we examined an ensemble modeling approach to improve the estimation accuracy of soil textural fractions using Sentinel-2 (S2) data. Multispectral images (cloud free) from S2 mission for 63 different acquisition dates (between Jan. 2017 to Dec. 2020) were used as the RS data source. Spectral reflectance data over visible to near-infrared region (350-2500 nm at 1 nm interval) were also collected for each soil sample under laboratory conditions for comparison. Partial-least-square regression (PLSR), random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR) models were used to estimate sand, silt, and clay contents for both the laboratory-measured and S2 spectra. Resulting coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) values for the laboratory-measured spectra were 0.44 and 14.9 % for sand contents, 0.32 and 16.23 % for silt contents, and 0.69 and 5.5 % for clay contents, respectively. The S2 datasets collected during Apr. 13, 2019 and Nov. 24, 2019 yielded best performance statistics for sand (R-2 = 0.50, RMSE = 11.6 %) and silt (R-2 = 0.46, RMSE = 5.8 %) contents, respectively. Similarly, the dataset collected on Jan. 3, 2018 yielded best performance for the clay contents (R-2 = 0.44, RMSE = 6.9 %). Compared to S2 data of a single acquisition date, combination of S2 data from multiple acquisition dates through ensemble modeling could significantly improve the prediction accuracies for sand (R-2 = 0.62, RMSE = 9.9 %), silt (R-2 = 0.54, RMSE = 5.4 %), and clay contents (R-2 = 0.54, RMSE = 6.5 %). These developed models allowed for the estimation of textural fractions at a resolution of 30 m.

TI  - Accuracy improvements for cold-start recommendation problem using indirect relations in social networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIG DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in Internet applications have facilitated information spreading and, thanks to a wide variety of mobile devices and the burgeoning 5G networks, users easily and quickly gain access to information. Great amounts of digital information moreover have contributed to the emergence of recommender systems that help to filter information. When the rise of mobile networks has pushed forward the growth of social media networks and users get used to posting whatever they do and wherever they visit on the Web, such quick social media updates already make it difficult for users to find historical data. For this reason, this paper presents a social network-based recommender system. Our purpose is to build a user-centered recommender system to exclude the products that users are disinterested in according to user preferences and their friends' shopping experiences so as to make recommendations effective. Since there might be no corresponding reference value for new products or services, we use indirect relations between friends and "friends' friends" as well as sentinel friends to improve the recommendation accuracy. The simulation result has proven that our proposed mechanism is efficient in enhancing recommendation accuracy.

TI  - State-and-Evolution Detection Models: A Framework for Continuously Monitoring Landscape Pattern Change
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting the evolution of large-area landscape patterns using long-term remote-sensing images is helpful in supporting research on the relationship between landscape patterns and ecological processes, as well as the development of ecological process simulations and spatiotemporal interaction models. However, detection methods have generally been developed as separate applications, each with a separate type of landscape pattern change; remote-sensing images are acquired at epochal timesteps. Consequently, in practical applications, many omission changes for some types of pattern changes and inaccurate evolution time are presented in the detected map. In this article, state-and-evolution detection models (SEDMs) are promoted to obtain complete information about the evolution of landscape patterns based on yearly land cover data. In the proposed framework, we first define the major categories of landscape pattern changes to comprehensively reveal the characteristics of landscape pattern changes associated with real change cases. Next, a morphological rule-based pattern recognition approach is proposed for quantitative discrimination among these categories. This approach is then applied in annual land cover data to continuously detect landscape pattern evolution processes and evolution time. Finally, the detected evolution time in different evolution processes is applied to measure the timestep between two disparate types. The performances of the SEDMs are presented by Landsat-derived land cover evolution in Shanxi, China. The detected results are indirectly verified by the land cover conversion matrix and connect index, indicating strong robustness and generalization ability of the SEDMs.

TI  - Organic matter temporal dynamics in the river ecosystem basin using remote sensing
T2  - ONE ECOSYSTEM
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental research addresses ecosystems of various hierarchical levels. One of the ecosystem types is the river basin. The basin approach has been applied in the research. We consider the river basin as a single ecosystem of complex landscape structure. The research objective was to assess the biological processes in various landscapes within a holistic natural geosystem - a catchment area. The Klyazma River Basin (a part of the Volga River of 40 thousand km area) was the research object. It is a complex combination 2 of different landscapes, each marked by a diverse composition of geomorphological and soil-vegetation structures. According to the geomorphological structure and soil and vegetation cover, four landscape provinces and eight key sites have been identified in the studied catchment area where the ecosystem parameter have been measured. The study is based on remote sensing data and the Trends. Earth Land Degradation Monitoring. The calculation of productivity indicators (GPP, NPP) in carbon units and the land use structure analysis are based on Modis data. The soil organic carbon pool was determined by the UN FAO's data, based on Trends. Earth and QGIS 2.18. The two-factor variance analysis ANOVA has been used for the data statistic processing. The cartographic analysis of the land use structure dynamics of the entire Klyazma Basin resulted in revealing the areas where various land transitions from one category to another have been identified. They are basically associated with the agricultural land overgrowth. The forest area increased by 9% during the period from 2001 to 2017. Considerable increase in the waterlogged, wetlands areas was observed in the eastern part of the Basin, in the Volga-Klyazma Province. The landscapes react differently to changes in climatic parameters and land use. Thus, the active revegetation of farmland by forests gives the increased rate of carbon accumulation in the soil. Landscapes covered with grasses and shrubs are more productive those covered with forest. On the other hand, woody biotopes are more stable in their development over time. Statistical analysis using the two-factor variation analysis ANOVA method resulted in demonstrating that phytoproductivity dynamics of the key sites does not depend on their productivity parameters nor on the site landscape structure, but is mainly determined by a time factor. In different landscapes the biological processes, characterising the organic matter dynamics in the form of plant production, organic matter accumulation and others are shown to differ both in rate and intensity and ambiguously respond to changes in climate parameters and land use. The river basin, as a single ecosystem, showed sufficient stability of the dynamic processes. This suggests that holistic natural ecosystems, such as catchment areas, have internal compensatory mechanisms that maintain the development stability for a long time, while unplanned land use remains the main damaging factor.

TI  - Multiyear analysis of the dependency of the planting date on rainfall and soil moisture in paddy fields in Cambodia, 2003-2019
T2  - PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The dependencies of the planting date on rainfall and soil moisture in paddy fields in Cambodia were analyzed to quantify farmers' empirical knowledge regarding their decision of the planting date. Remote sensing data from multiple satellites covering the 2003-2019 period were analyzed. The planting dates in rain-fed paddies ranged from April to August, with large spatial variations and year-to-year fluctuations. In years when planting was suppressed in April and May, planting was extensively enhanced in June and August compared to normal years, and vice versa. Over the northeastern side of Tonle Sap Lake and south of Phnom Penh city, the areas planted in April and May were found to have positive correlations with rainfall and soil moisture, suggesting that wetter-than-average conditions encouraged farmers to plant earlier in the season. In contrast, this relationship was unclear on the western side of Tonle Sap Lake, where the rainfall amounts were larger throughout the year than in other areas in Cambodia. In this region, the relationship between the planting area and soil water availability was either unclear or was even slightly negative from June to August. Since more frequent dry spells have been detected after the onset of the rainy season in recent years, further studies and disseminations of potential changes in dry spells are important for the agronomic adaptation of planting dates under climate change.

TI  - Mineralogical and Chemical Characteristics of Clay Areas, Gumushane Region (NE Turkey), and Their Detection Using the Crosta Technique with Landsat 7 and 8 Images
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The clay areas in Gumushane (NE Turkey) were examined in mineralogical and geochemical terms, and by remote sensing methods. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and chemical analysis were completed on samples from 11 selected clay areas in the region. Within the scope of remote sensing, Landsat 7 and 8 satellite images of the region were processed with the Crosta technique to assess the clay areas. The Kale and Tamzi clays are contained within a Late Cretaceous turbiditic series. The clays in Canca, Refene and camlica occur in intensively hydrothermally altered volcanic rocks of the Eocene Alibaba Formation. The other clay areas are in the Liassic Senkoy Formation consisting of a volcano-sedimentary series. The clays in the Senkoy Formation are generally below the coal levels. While mainly illite and lesser kaolinite were determined in Dortkonak, Alemdar, Yukari Kov and camlica, the clays in Tahnis and Kabantasi are smectite. Tekke, Canca and Refene clays are kaolinite with smaller amounts of illite, whereas Kale and Tamzi clays are mainly chlorite with lower content of illite-smectite interlayers. Illites in Dortkonak, Alemdar, Yukari Kov and camlica are poor in iron and magnesium and formed by hydrothermal alteration of feldspars in the host rocks. Findings of the remote sensing studies using Landsat 7 and 8 datasets were compatible with the results obtained from field observations and general geological studies, and so it is concluded that the Crosta technique provided good results for exploration of clay occurrences and their determination in the region.

AB  - An accurate estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is important for carbon accounting and afforestation policy making, and the aspect factors that affect forest stand growth are important to the accuracy of AGB estimation. In this study, aspect was incorporated as a variable into three machine learning algorithms (MLAs) (support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF)), to estimate the AGB of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) planted forests in 96 field plots with four different aspects (sunny slope, semisunny slope, semi-shady slope and shady slope). The results showed that in the models incorporating aspect variables, the increase in accuracy varied from 36.72% to 41.23% for 29 validation plots based on R2. The A-RF model (RF with aspect variable), which had the highest R2 (0.8519) and lowest RMSE and rRMSE (12.552 Mg/ha and 0.175) was considered optimal for AGB estimation of black locust planted forests. The overestimation of sunny and shady slopes, and the underestimation of semi-sunny and semi-shady slopes are reduced by incorporating the aspect variable. Areas with lower AGB values mainly occur on sunny and shady slopes, and areas with higher AGB values mainly occur on semi-sunny and semi-shady slopes. Overall, our study demonstrates that the introduction of the aspect variable provided the model with a basis for the effects of different growth conditions of black locust planted forests on different aspects, which can improve the accuracy of AGB estimation.
