TI  - Decrease in the incidence of chickenpox in the Community of Madrid after universal childhood immunization. Years 2001-2015
T2  - ATENCION PRIMARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Varicella vaccine was recommended in the Community of Madrid (CM) at 15 months of age between November 2006 and December 2013. The objective was to describe the impact of vaccination on the incidence of varicella in the CM during the period 2001-2015.Design: A descriptive study of cases of varicella reported to the Sentinel Physician Network of the CM and the cases recorded in the Minimum Basic Data Set at hospital discharge was carried out. Total incidence of cases and of hospital admissions were calculated, as well as specific incidence by age and sex.Results: The incidence was 94.0% lower between 2012 and 2013 than between 2001 and 2003. Between 2014 and 2015 the incidence was 61.8% higher than between 2012 and 2013. The highest incidence was observed in children aged 0 to 4 years except for 2010-2014, which was exceeded by the incidence in children aged 5 to 9. The trend in hospital admissions was also decreasing, with the highest incidence in children aged 0 to 1 year, followed by 1-4 years.Conclusions: There has been a significant decrease in the incidence of cases and of hospital admissions by varicella in all age groups after the recommendation to vaccinate at 15 months of age, which is compatible with the effectiveness of a dose and its ability to produce immunity group. The withdrawal of this recommendation between 2014 and 2015 has led to an increase in the incidence. (C) 2017 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

AB  - Material culture in the agrarian context characterizes the worldview of the Roman province of Lusitania. This article aims to analyze the material reality of the different rural settlements recognized as villae in the ager of Olisipo - Lisbon today-. The geographic richness of the area (contrast ager-littoral), the economic variety of commercial exchanges (especially fish factories), the artistic influences of different parts of the Empire (North Africa and Italian peninsula), and idiosyncrasy of Lusitania, constitute a paradigmatic case study to define the mechanisms of action of the material culture in the area of Olisipio and its ager.

TI  - Satellite and ground atmospheric particulate matter detection over Tucuman city, Argentina, space-time distribution, climatic and seasonal variability
T2  - AIMS ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of atmospheric particles (aerosols) is of special interest due to their potential effects on human health and other applications. In this paper the climatic and seasonal effects on aerosols have been characterized in Tucuman city (26 degrees 50' S, 65 degrees 13' W, 450 m asl), Argentina, for the 2006-2013 period. The atmospheric aerosols in Tucuman city result from both stationary and mobile sources such as: industrial activity of sugar cane and alcohol distilleries, paper industry, biomass burning (mainly sugarcane waste crop and grasslands), household waste burning and transport emissions. The peak of industrial activity is seasonal, coincident with the austral winter (July-August-September), when accumulation of particles in the lower atmosphere occurs. In this region, there are no studies like the present one that evaluate, using "in situ" equipment, the temporal variation of aerosols and its causes, by applying modern analytical techniques. A continuous volumetric and isokinetic sampler of Hirst type (Burkard), was used for atmospheric particle sampling, in weekly records between 2006 and 2013. The particle concentration (number of particles per cubic meter) showed an increasing trend in the studied period. The monthly variation of: the particle concentration; the aerosol optical thickness at a wavelength of 550 nm (AOD(550)) obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors onboard Aqua (NASA) satellite, and the AOD from different aerosol tracers (black and organic carbon, sea salt, sulfates, dust) obtained from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2), were also analyzed. The temporal variation in particle concentration was explained mostly by wind direction, while the corresponding variation for AOD(550)(MODIS) was explained by temperature and seasonality (as by-product of climatic variation and anthropogenic particle emission sources). The variation in the AOD(550)(MERRA-2) data series were explained by temperature, humidity, precipitation, and seasonality, with less effect of wind speed and direction. Particle concentration, AOD(550)(MODIS), and AOD(550)(MERRA-2) were highly variable. The cross-correlation between AOD(550)(MODIS) and AOD(550)(MERRA-2) time series was significantly positive at lag zero. Other contribution was the determination of the space-time distribution of aerosols on a monthly basis considering AOD(550) MODIS (3 km x 3 km) data. The present study suggests that these variables are affected by temperature and wind dynamics driven by seasonal and high-order autoregressive non-linear processes.

AB  - The small Iron-Age hillfort of Barona (Porto do Son, A Coruna, Galicia, Spain) was inhabited during the last centuries BC and is in a singularly hostile environment on a small peninsula facing the Atlantic Ocean at the western end of the Muros-Noia estuary. The habitat is composed by a mere twenty houses defended by a stunning complex of three lines of massive walls. A large rocky acropolis with faint but clear signs of human activity hangs over the habitat. The study of the acropolis reveals the possibility that they include awareness of the surrounding landscape and relevant moments of the solar cycle. A monumental stairway adjacent to the acropolis leads towards the cliff overlooking the sea and seems aligned with the winter solstice sunset happening on the ocean beyond. Over the acropolis, the rock that dominates the area presents carved basins and slender petroglyphs related with winter and summer solstice sunrises while the eastern horizon is dominated by Mount Enxa that signals 1st May sunrise as seen from the acropolis. Finally, summer solstice sunrise seen from the acropolis coincides with a little hill some 2.5 kilometer away on which slope a panel with petroglyphs presents the only carved representation of the sun known in Galicia and the panel itself is related to some astral calendric relations. We argue that the hillfort's location seems to be a special place chosen to be a cross-road between the sky, the land, and the sea, i.e. the three elements constituting the Cosmos according to the Celtic tradition and shared by other Indo-European traditions.

TI  - Stand types discrimination comparing machine-learning algorithms in Monteverde, Canary Islands
T2  - FOREST SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of study: The main objective is to determine the best machine-learning algorithm to classify the stand types of Monteverde forests combining LiDAR, orthophotography, and Sentinel-2 data, thus providing an easy and cheap method to classify Monteverde stand types.Area of study: 1500 ha forest in Monteverde, North Tenerife, Canary Islands.Material and methods: RF, SVML, SVMR and ANN algorithms are used to classify the three Monteverde stand types. Before training the model, feature selection of LiDAR, orthophotography, and Sentinel-2 data through VSURF was carried out. Comparison of its accuracy was performed.Main results: Five LiDAR variables were found to be the most efficient for classifying each object, while only one Sentinel-2 index and one Sentinel-2 band was valuable. Additionally, standard deviation and mean of the Red orthophotography colour band, and ratio between Red and Green bands were also found to be suitable. SVML is confirmed as the most accurate algorithm (0.904, 0.041 SD) while ANN showed the lowest value of 0.891 (0.073 SD). SVMR and RF obtain 0.902 (0.060 SD) and 0.904 (0.056 SD) respectively. SVML was found to be the best method given its low standard deviation.Research highlights: The similar high accuracy values among models confirm the importance of taking into account diverse machine-learning methods for stand types classification purposes and different explanatory variables. Although differences between errors may not seem relevant at a first glance, due to the limited size of the study area with only three plus two categories, such differences could be highly important when working at large scales with more stand types.

AB  - Sentinel-2 data represent a rich source of information for the community due to the free access and to the temporal-spatial coverage assured. However, some of the spectral bands are sensed at reduced resolution due to a compromise between technological limitations and Copernicus program's objectives. For this reason in this work we present a new superresolution method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to rise the resolution of the short wave infra-red (SWIR) band from 20 to 10 meters, that is the highest resolution provided. This is accomplished by fusing the target band with the finer-resolution ones. The proposed solution compares favourably against several alternative methods according to different quality indexes. In addition we have also tested the use of the super-resolved band from an applicative perspective by detecting water basins through the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI).

AB  - Land-use has been a subject of great importance for humanity from past. Negative human effect on natural environment is increasing continuously because of rapid population growth and technological developments. Natural environment and resources will consumed and unable to use as a result of this situation. The settlement areas are expanding with the effect of population increase. Agriculture, forest and pasture areas face destruction because of unplanned enlargement of residential areas. It has become easier for human being to make changes on natural environment thanks to technological developments. This effect has been greatened particularly in the last half century. Revealing negative effects of this changing in the natural environment and land cover is one of the most important topic for human being.Catalca District, which is determined as a research are in this study, is administratively included in Istanbul Province. The study area is located between 41 degrees 5'55'' and 41 degrees 35'2'' north latitudes and 28 degrees 4'10'' and 28 degrees 34'50'' South longitudes. Total area of the study area is 1130 km(2). Black Sea from North, Silivri and Buyukcekmece districts from South, Arnavutkoy district from east, Cerkezkoy and Saray districts, which are districts of Tekirdag Province, from West are bordering the study area. In this study, the past and present land use situation of Catalca District was idendificated and change was determined. LANDSAT satellite images which are belongs to years 1987, 2000 and 2016 provided from USGS. The uncontrolled classification method was applied to these photographs through Erdas Imagine software to determine the land cover for the related land cover years.

AB  - Creation of maps of surface temperature distribution based on satellite imagery data is becoming increasingly important throughout the past decade and is relevant for a number of studies. This paper presents the values of the coefficients and expressions for calculating the brightness temperature on the SWIR sensors of Landsat-8, Sentinel-2A/B and WorldView-3, nearest to the TIR-range. Two methods for modeling the brightness temperature on SWIR sensors, which have some similarity in values with TIR-temperature data, are considered. In experiments on the test multispectral data, a spread of temperatures of up to 20 K was obtained for certain types of ground cover. In this study, the first method, based on control points for certain types of surfaces, yielded a result with a smaller spread of values (no more than 2 K for certain types of surfaces). The second method was based on the use of multispectral indices for improving the accuracy of simulation results.

CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - For Ven mu s satellite, launched August 2nd , 2017, the calibration and performance assessment activities of the commissioning phase took place in the second semester of 2017. In particular, the radiometric calibration includes fine tuning of the dynamic, identification of defective pixels, equalization of the detectors, absolute calibration, viewing parameters tuning. A special focus is made on specificities of the mission concerning level-1 radiometric calibration. As far as equalization is concerned: an unusual behavior has been observed on numerous pixels, called "radiometric spikes", on Ven mu s images. An improvement of the Ven mu s radiometric model has been implemented to remove these spikes. Absolute calibration using the moon consists in comparing the global irradiance of the Ven mu s moon image with the reference from ROLO radiometric model. Absolute calibration using simultaneous nadir observations with Sentinel-2 is also a specificity of the mission: since Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B are currently in orbit with very similar spectral bands, it is possible to use Simultaneous Nadir Observations of Ven mu s and Sentinel-2. The cross-calibration results will be presented and compared to other vicarious calibration methods. About stray-light modelling and correction: the optical stray-light level exceeds the requirements by far. Two types of stray-light are observed: local ghost and cross-talk ghost. Local stray-light model is computed as a global system MTF, whereas the estimated cross-talk contribution is subtracted from the image. The specific correction model and the in-flight results will be presented.

AB  - Temporal series maps of irrigated areas, and the corresponding irrigation water requirements based on remote sensing, is a recognized tool contributing to water governance at different scales, from water user associations to whole river basin districts. These thematic cartographies offer a first estimation of the crop irrigation requirements, and a biophysical based approach of the temporal and spatial distribution of the crop water use in the cultivated areas. This work describes the operational application of these methodologies, providing valuable information for water governance and management purposes. The basic products obtained in the whole Spanish part of the Iberian Peninsula during the period 2014-2017 were: (i) annual maps of irrigated crops based on time series of multispectral satellite imagery; and (ii) the direct remote sensing-based water accounting, by quantifying agricultural water flows (e.g. rainfall, irrigation, evapotranspiration, drainage and recharge), through a remote sensing-based soil water balance. Hence this paper provides a remote sensing based water accounting approach, which relies on dense time series of multispectral imagery acquired by the multisensor constellation arranged by Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellites, jointly with meteorological data and agronomic knowledge. Then, based on these purpose and approach, annual and monthly maps of net irrigation water requirements have been elaborated at the most practical spatial and temporal scales for water governance purposes over big areas such river basin districts. This work summarizes the methodologies used and discuss the technical and non-technical feasibility of the proposed approach.

AB  - Very-High-Resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (VHR-SAR) images are of particular interest to characterize and monitor urban areas at a global scale. While automatic urban footprint extraction from SAR images can be theoretically performed at very high spatial and temporal resolutions, in practice it requires a huge amount of processing time and memory resources for a global coverage. The paper presents a fast procedure for 1m-resolution spotlight mode scene analysis which shows limited memory requirements and robustness to one-look speckle disturbance. The proposed method adopts a multiscale approach, with a radiometrically scalable scheme, and exploits theoretic electromagnetic scattering models of buildings. Experimental results with objective assessment on spotlight Cosmo-SkyMED images will be presented and validated on reference urban classes provided by the Copernicus Urban Atlas 2012.

AB  - Sentinel-2 is an Earth Observation mission developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) in the frame of the Copernicus program of the European Commission. The mission consists on a MultiSpectral Instruments (MSI) on board a constellation of two satellites: Sentinel-2A launched in June 2015 and Sentinel-2B launched in March 2017. It covers the Earth's land surfaces and coastal waters every five days at the equator and every two days at mid-latitudes under the same viewing conditions with high spatial resolution and a wide field of view. Several projects have been launched by ESA, for instance as contribution to the R&D component of the GEOGLAM initiative and to the JECAM network activities. This paper gives an overview of Sentinel-2 mission and some examples of applications for agriculture monitoring.

To improve the resolution of 20 m bands to 10 m, existing pansharpening methods (Brovey transform [BT], intensity-hue-saturation [IHS], principal component analysis [PCA], the variational method [P + XS], and the wavelet method) required adjustment, which was achieved using higher resolution multispectral bands in the role of a panchromatic band to fuse bands at a lower spatial resolution. After preprocessing, six bands at lower resolution were divided into two groups because some image fusion methods (e.g. BT, IHS) are limited to a maximum of three input bands of a lower resolution at a time. With respect to the spectral range, the higher resolution band for the first group was synthesized from bands 4 and 8, and band 8 was selected for the second group. Given that one of the main remote sensing applications is land-cover classification, the classification accuracy of the fusion methods was assessed as well as the comparison with reference bands and pixels. The supervised classification methods were Maximum Likelihood Classifier, artificial neural networks, and object-based image analysis. The classification scheme contained five classes: water, built-up, bare soil, low vegetation, and forest. The results showed that most of the fusion methods, particularly P + XS and PCA, improved the overall classification accuracy, especially for the classes of forest, low vegetation, and bare soil and in the detection of coastlines. The least satisfying results were obtained from the wavelet method.

AB  - This article obviously is an effort to comprehend processes of socioreligious identity formation through historical trajectory as well as identity contestation in contemporary daily life of Muslim-Christian communities of Leihitu in Ambon, specifically Wakal and Hitumesing (Muslims) and Rumahtiga (Christian). Those villages acknowledge that they have mythological narrative which based their gandong relationship. This research eventually would like to depict that development strategy of the local community, in a broader and fundamental sense, is able to be applied by understanding the local community's worldview as a manifestation of historical and cultural consciousness, which is formed throughout a long and dynamic living experience. At that point, it offers a novel perspective about a cultural strategy for community development with orientation on discovering intrinsic values of local tradition as foundation to absorb and adapt social changes in accordance with existing local wisdoms that actually are their social and cultural capital. Certainly, the result of this research is only a model that offers to be tested continuously in changing sociopolitical and cultural contexts. This research ends right on the dot where other subsequent researches must move on to discover and reconstruct development models which take sides for the better future and life of the globalized-local 'glocal' communities in Indonesia.

AB  - Models that simulate the radiative budget (RB) and remote sensing (RS) observation of landscapes with physical approaches and consideration of the three-dimensional (3-D) architecture of Earth surfaces are increasingly needed to better understand the life-essential cycles and processes of our planet and to further develop RS technology. DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) is one of the most comprehensive physically based 3-D models of Earth atmosphere optical radiative transfer (RT), from ultraviolet to thermal infrared. It simulates the optical 3-D RB and signal of proximal, aerial and satellite imaging spectrometers and laser scanners, for any urban and/or natural landscapes and for any experimental and instrumental configurations. It is freely available for research and teaching activities. Here, an application is presented after a summary of its theory and recent advances: inversion of Sentinel 2 images for simulating time series of urban radiative budget Q(SW)* maps through the determination of maps of urban surface material. Results are very encouraging: satellite and in-situ Q(SW)* are very close (RMSE approximate to 15 W/m(2); i.e., 2.7% mean relative difference).

AB  - In this study, we used an artificial neural network method to estimate the fractional snow cover area (fSCA), which is fast and accurate, and that can be easily adapted to different remote sensing instruments. We tested our approach using SnowEx data from NASA's Cloud Absorption Radiometer (CAR) over Grand Mesa; one of the largest flat-topped mountains in the world, which features sufficient forested stands with a range of density and height (and a variety of other forest conditions); a spread of snow depth/ snow water equivalent conditions over sufficiently flat snow-covered terrain. The retrieved fractional snow-covered area from CAR compares reasonably with a Sentinel-2 image over the same location and demonstrates CAR's unique capability to improve the retrieval of snow properties using machine learning. The retrieved snow fraction parameter from our method is expected to minimize the error associated with the traditional binary snow detection scheme, and improve the retrieval quality of key parameters such as surface albedo.

TI  - The Drama of Infertility: Reading Isa 56:1-8 from a Krobo Perspective
T2  - HORIZONS IN BIBLICAL THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In most cultures in Ghana, both male and female infertility are believed to be a curse and a sign of an unfruitful life. The ability to procreate thus defines the identity of the person and his/her existential value in relation to others. Furthermore, childlessness becomes an overwhelming drama as it is perceived to depict an inferior state of being or a life of incompleteness. This type of social identity construction raises serious hermeneutical issues in its engagement with the Judeo-Christian message of inclusiveness. Against this backdrop, this study reads the drama surrounding infertility within the Krobo worldview from the horizon of Isa 56:1-8, using the Communicative hermeneutic approach. Our findings are that an engagement between the Krobo worldview and the Isaian text creates both tension and transformation. The tension comes about because of the contrast of views; and the transformation resides in the change of perspective. The text provides a rich and an alternative understanding of infertility: another way of being and not a curse.

AB  - The Australian Government spends well over half a billion dollars every year in programs designed to protect, enhance or measure the environment. This diverse range of programs covers a breadth of activities such as driving changes in land management practices to protect the Great Barrier Reef, undertaking surveys of agricultural productivity, and the management of millions of dollars of environmental water that is used to protect and improve critical wetlands in the Murray-Darling Basin.Earth observation (EO) data has a vital role to play in optimizing this investment and demonstrating value-for-money to taxpayers. Ubiquitous spatial coverage, decades of regular observations and paddock-scale resolution mean that EO data has a unique ability to provide insights into the effectiveness of land and water programmes and ensure that Australia is getting the maximum value from its investments.Through the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Program, Australia has pioneered the use of 'big space data' techniques to enable satellite data to be effectively and easily exploited to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Australian Government. DEA is based on the Australian Geoscience Data Cube which was developed by Geoscience Australia, CSIRO and Australia's National Computational Infrastructure. The Australian Geoscience Data Cube has now been released as the Open Data Cube.

TI  - "I would like to stay at the university ...": the St. Petersburg Period of Juri Uluots' Life
T2  - TUNA-AJALOOKULTUURI AJAKIRI
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes the years of Juri Uluots' (1890-1945) youth. Uluots was the last Prime Minister of independent Estonia before its annexation by the Soviet Union. Based on archival documents, the authors argue that the years Uluots spent in Russia (1910-1917) had a significant influence on the formation of his worldview. Upon enrolling in the Faculty of Law at the University of St. Peters-burg, Uluots devoted his life to academic research. He attended lectures given by the best law experts: professors I. A. Pokrovsky, M. I. Tugan-Baranowsky, L. I. Petrazhitsky and I. I. Kaufman. Self-education was very important for him. Uluots read books in several European languages on psychology, logic, sociology, general philosophy, and the philosophy of right. Over a certain period during his studies, he became interested in general writings on state building, the doctrine of sovereignty, forms of government and civil public law. Themes such as self-government and constitutional law methodology also attracted his attention.Uluots' excellent academic performance earned him a Russian imperial scholarship for several years (1911-1913). Nevertheless, since his high-school years, he usually had to give lessons regularly in order to earn his own living.The year 1913 marked a turning point in Uluots' university life. His future as a young academic was at stake. When he was unable to meet a deadline for his work, he burnt a significant portion of his research paper on 28 August. He was exhausted. He was almost certain that he would not be able to continue his career in St. Petersburg. In these difficult circumstances, Uluots received support from Professor of the Faculty of Law V. A. Udintsev. Uluots read a report entitled The Right to Extract Oil in Closed State Territories in his seminar. The report was very well received. Moreover, Uluots was thereafter recognised as a true researcher. Prospects for continuing his academic career in Russia were dashed by the First World War and the Revolution of 1917.After receiving his university graduation diploma in October of 1914, Uluots was called up for military service in Russia and enlisted in the militia. However, he was exempted from military service due to his poor eyesight. In the autumn of 1915, he successfully passed his state exams at the university and submitted an interesting research paper entitled The Right to Extract Oil in Russia. A Historical and Dogmatic Essay.With the support of Professor V. A. Udintsev, who continued to take care of his talented student, Uluots received permission in 1916 to remain at the university in order to become a professor at the Department of Civil Law prior to 1 January 1919. The change in the political regime in Russia, however, as well as the uncertainty regarding the continuation of his academic career forced Uluots to return to Estonia. Regardless of this turning point in his life, there is no doubt that Juri Uluots matured at the University of St. Petersburg as an academic, a lawyer, and one of the founders of Estonian Law.

TI  - Impacts on the Urban Environment: Land Cover Change Trajectories and Landscape Fragmentation in Post-War Western Area, Sierra Leone
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An influential underlying driver of human-induced landscape change is civil war and other forms of conflict that cause human displacement. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) increase environmental pressures at their destination locations while reducing them at their origins. This increased pressure presents an environment for increased land cover change (LCC) rates and landscape fragmentation. To test whether this hypothesis is correct, this research sought to understand LCC dynamics in the Western Area of Sierra Leone from 1976 to 2011, a period including pre-conflict, conflict, and post-conflict eras, using Landsat and SPOT satellite imagery. A trajectory analysis of classified images compared LCC trajectories before and during the war (1976-2000) with after the war (2003-2011). Over the 35-year period, the built-up land class rapidly increased, in parallel with an increase in urban and peri-urban agriculture. During the war, urban and peri-urban agriculture became a major livelihood activity for displaced rural residents to make the region food self-sufficient, especially when the war destabilised food production activities. The reluctance of IDPs to return to their rural homes after the war caused an increased demand for land driven by housing needs. Meanwhile, protected forest and other forest declined. A significant finding to emerge from this research is that landscape fragmentation increased in conjunction with declining forest cover while built-up areas aggregated. This has important implications for the region's flora, fauna, and human populations given that other research has shown that landscape fragmentation affects the landscape's ability to provide important ecosystem services.

TI  - Clinicopathological characteristics and treatment outcomes of occult breast cancer: a SEER population-based study
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Occult breast cancer (OBC) is a rare type of breast cancer that has not been well studied. The clinicopathological characteristics and treatment recommendations for OBC are based on a limited number of retrospective studies and thus remain controversial.Patients and methods: We identified 479 OBC patients and 115,739 non-OBC patients from 2004 to 2014 in and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes were compared between OBC and non-OBC patients. We used the propensity score 1:1 matching analysis to evaluate OBC vs non-OBC comparison using balanced groups with respect to the observed covariates. We further divided the OBC population into four groups based on different treatment strategies. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to calculate and compare the four treatment outcomes within the OBC population.Results: OBC patients were older, exhibited a more advanced stage, a higher rate of negative estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status, a higher rate of HER2-positive status, and a higher rate of >= 10 positive lymph nodes, and were less likely to undergo surgical treatment than non-OBC patients. After adjustments for clinicopathological factors, the OBC patients exhibited a significantly better survival than the non-OBC patients (P<0.001). This result was confirmed in a 1:1 matched case -control analysis. Within the four OBC treatment groups, we observed no difference in survival among the mastectomy group, the breast-conserving surgery (BCS) group, and the axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)-only group. The multivariable analysis revealed that the sentinel lymph node dissection-only group had the worst prognosis (P<0.001).Conclusion: OBC has unique clinicopathological characteristics and a favorable prognosis compared with non-OBC. BCS plus ALND and radiotherapy showed a survival benefit that was similar to that of mastectomy for OBC patients.

TI  - A Satellite-Based Model for Simulating Ecosystem Respiration in the Tibetan and Inner Mongolian Grasslands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to accurately evaluate ecosystem respiration (RE) in the alpine grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau and the temperate grasslands of the Inner Mongolian Plateau, as it serves as a sensitivity indicator of regional and global carbon cycles. Here, we combined flux measurements taken between 2003 and 2013 from 16 grassland sites across northern China and the corresponding MODIS land surface temperature (LST), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and land surface water index (LSWI) to build a satellite-based model to estimate RE at a regional scale. First, the dependencies of both spatial and temporal variations of RE on these biotic and climatic factors were examined explicitly. We found that plant productivity and moisture, but not temperature, can best explain the spatial pattern of RE in northern China's grasslands; while temperature plays a major role in regulating the temporal variability of RE in the alpine grasslands, and moisture is equally as important as temperature in the temperate grasslands. However, the moisture effect on RE and the explicit representation of spatial variation process are often lacking in most of the existing satellite-based RE models. On this basis, we developed a model by comprehensively considering moisture, temperature, and productivity effects on both temporal and spatial processes of RE, and then, we evaluated the model performance. Our results showed that the model well explained the observed RE in both the alpine (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 0.77 g C m(-2) day(-1)) and temperate grasslands (R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 0.60 g C m(-2) day(-1)). The inclusion of the LSWI as the water-limiting factor substantially improved the model performance in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, and the spatialized basal respiration rate as an indicator for spatial variation largely determined the regional pattern of RE. Finally, the model accurately reproduced the seasonal and inter-annual variations and spatial variability of RE, and it avoided overestimating RE in water-limited regions compared to the popular process-based model. These findings provide a better understanding of the biotic and climatic controls over spatiotemporal patterns of RE for two typical grasslands and a new alternative up-scaling method for large-scale RE evaluation in grassland ecosystems.

TI  - Standardization of nodal radiation therapy through changes to a breast cancer clinical pathway throughout a large, integrated cancer center network
T2  - PRACTICAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Studies demonstrate safety of omitting axillary nodal dissection for early-stage breast cancer with positive sentinel lymph node (+ SLN) biopsy, although trial designs differed in radiation therapy (RT) fields. Regional nodal irradiation was separately shown to improve outcomes in high-risk patients. This led to lack of consensus in RT volumes. Clinical pathways (CPs) standardize care where practice varies unnecessarily. We evaluated the impact of changes to a CP guiding postoperative RT in women with +SLNs on practice patterns throughout a network.Methods and materials: We implemented a CP for management of breast cancer with postoperative RT designed to promote uniform nodal treatment. The CP recommended modified tangents (MTs) including level I/II nodes for women with micrometastases (pN1mi). For women with macrometastases (pN1a), CPs recommended including level I/II LN in MT and a third supraclavicular node (SCN) LN +/- internal mammary nodes for women with adverse factors present.Results: RT fields of 233 women undergoing breast-conserving surgery with +SLN but not axillary nodal dissection were retrospectively reviewed: 25% had pN1mi disease and 75% pN1a. Of 127 women treated before CP changes, 35% with pN1mi and 22% with pN1a were treated with whole-breast irradiation alone. Following CP changes, 106 women were treated: 5% with whole-breast irradiation alone, 58% with MT, and 38% with MT + SCN field. Utilization of MT was associated with CP changes. Utilization of a third SCN field was associated with CP changes, pN stage, extracapsular extension, and total number of adverse factors.Conclusions: CPs translate published data and institutional experience into management plans that promote evidence-based care and eliminate unnecessary practice variations. Recognizing that postoperative RT treatment volumes were heterogeneous, we modified the CP based upon the latest evidence for regional nodal irradiation, after which we found increased compliance and consistency with quality guidelines, which will also aid in tracking outcomes in future investigations.

TI  - Estimating burden of influenza-associated influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection at public healthcare facilities in Romania during the 2011/12-2015/16 influenza seasons
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundInfluenza is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality, but there is limited information on reliable disease burden estimates, especially from middle-income countries in the WHO European Region.ObjectivesTo estimate the incidence of medically attended influenza-associated influenza-like illness (ILI) and hospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) presenting to public healthcare facilities in Romania.Patients/MethodsSentinel influenza surveillance data for ILI and SARI from 2011/12-2015/16, including virological data, were used to estimate influenza-associated ILI and SARI incidence/100000 and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).ResultsThe overall annual incidence of ILI and influenza-associated ILI per 100000 persons in Romania varied between 68 (95% CI: 61-76) and 318 (95% CI: 298-338) and between 23 (95% CI: 19-29) and 189 (95% CI: 149-240), respectively. The highest ILI and influenza incidence was among children aged 0-4years. We estimated that SARI incidence per 100000 persons was 6 (95% CI: 5-7) to 9 (95% CI: 8-10), of which 2 (95% CI: 1-2) to 3 (95% CI: 2-4) were due to influenza. Up to 0.3% of the Romanian population were annually reported with ILI, and 0.01% was hospitalized with SARI, of which as much as one-third could be explained by influenza.ConclusionsThis evaluation was the first study estimating influenza burden in Romania. We found that during each influenza season, a substantial number of persons in Romania suffer from influenza-related ILI or are hospitalized due to influenza-associated SARI.

AB  - The Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) is an ESA mission whose aim is to study the Jovian system; Jupiter itself, its moons (Europa, Ganymede and Callisto) and the magnetosphere. The mission profile imposes considerable radiation constraints on the spacecraft, which are uncommon in typical space programs due to the Jupiter magnetic moment which is the largest of the solar system (over 10 000 times more than the Earth). It results in a high total dose exposure at electronic parts level (factor ten with regard to typical GEO missions), high number of Single Event Effects and internal charging effects.For this challenging mission, Sodern has been selected to provide a specific version of HYDRA star tracker. HYDRA is the multiple head CMOS Active Pixel Sensor (APS) star tracker developed by Sodern and it has achieved TRL-9 after being launched successfully aboard the French Spot-6 Earth observation satellite on September 9th 2012. HYDRA is composed of two physical units, Electronic Units (EU) for communication management, power supply and attitude computation, and Optical Heads (OH) for image acquisition and video pre-processing. This architecture allows protecting the Electrical Units by the spacecraft internal shielding while the Optical Heads are outside. The configuration chosen for JUICE is two EU (one in cold redundancy) and three OH.A first analysis has been already performed in the scope of precursor activities to assess the suitability of HYDRA Star Tracker to the intense radiation environment of the JUICE mission. Since this analysis, the worst case radiation environment specified for JUICE mission has been severely degraded, by a factor 7 for proton flux and by a factor 6 for electrons flux, leading to conditions 150 times harsher than geostationary orbit worst case. This has put into question some of the previously identified adaptations of HYDRA.In this paper Sodern presents the complementary analysis performed since this specification modification. Apart from some local optimization of shielding thickness, only a few algorithms improvements are necessary to robustify HYDRA and make it suitable to this even more constraining environment.

TI  - A comprehensive land cover classification approach for the development of wildfire fuels layers
T2  - EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS IX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications IX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) information is an important component for wildfire modeling as an understanding of the underlying vegetation conditions is needed to propagate fires accurately across the region. While government entities around the globe often create their own maps of available fuels, political boundaries within a country or across international borders can create inaccuracies and mismatched labeling that changes the speed, direction, and characteristics of the modeled fire. Government-generated fuels layers can also utilize different classification schemes with the United States relying on the 13 category Anderson Fire Behavior Fuel Model or the 46 category Scott Burgan Fire Behavior Fuel Model and Canada using a 19 category Fire Behavior Prediction System. To address these differences and provide a higher resolution understanding of conditions on the ground, a methodology based on the ISODATA Unsupervised Classification method was developed and applied to 30-meter Landsat 8 imagery. The methodology was utilized to create a fuels layer for Australia in 2016 and the western provinces of Canada in 2017 and will be used in future updates to wildfire models at AIR Worldwide.

TI  - Automated burned area identification in real-time during wildfire events using WorldView imagery for the insurance industry
T2  - EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS IX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications IX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - In 2017, wildfires and bushfires caused an estimated 14 billion USD in losses worldwide with the most severe events occurring in the state of California during October and December. The October outbreak in northern California alone cost USD 10.9 billion to the insurance industry, constituting the fourth largest loss event due to a natural catastrophe in 2017. While catastrophe modeling has begun to help bridge the knowledge gap about the risk of wildfire to life and property, understanding the extent of a wildfire in near real-time allows insurance companies around the world to quantify the loss of property their clients face during an event and proactively respond. To develop this real-time analysis of affected areas and the losses associated with the event, a methodology utilizing optical multi-spectral imagery from DigitalGlobe's WorldView satellite suite is proposed for delineation of burned and unburned areas. This methodology involves utilizing either the Normalized Burn Ratio or the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, depending upon which satellite imagery is available. Full-automation of the methodology allows for rapid identification of affected areas to occur around the world based on industry request. The methodology has been tested and proven effective for the October 2017 Tubbs, Atlas, Oakmont, and Nuns fires in California, USA.

TI  - Pegmatites spectral behavior considering ASTER and Landsat 8 OLI data in Naipa and Muiane mines (Alto Ligonha, Mozambique)
T2  - EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS IX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications IX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The Naipa and Muiane mines are located on the Nampula complex, a stratigraphic tectonic subdivision of the Mozambique Belt, in the Alto Ligonha region. The pegmatites are of the Li-Cs-Ta type, intrude a chlorite phyllite and gneisses with amphibole and biotite. The mines are still active. The main objective of this work was to analyze the pegmatite's spectral behavior considering ASTER and Landsat 8 OLI data. An ASTER image from 27/05/2005, and an image Landsat OLI image from 02/02/2018 were considered. The data were radiometric calibrated and after atmospheric corrected considered the Dark Object Subtraction algorithm available in the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin accessible in QGIS software. In the field, samples were collected from lepidolite waste pile in Naipa and Muaine mines. A spectroadiometer was used in order to analyze the spectral behavior of several pegmatite's samples collected in the field in Alto Ligonha (Naipa and Muiane mines). In addition, QGIS software was also used for the spectral mapping of the hypothetical hydrothermal alterations associated with occurrences of basic metals, beryl gemstones, tourmalines, columbite-tantalites, and lithium minerals. A supervised classification algorithm was employed-Spectral Angle Mapper for the data processing, and the overall accuracy achieved was 80%. The integration of ASTER and Landsat 8 OLI data have proved very useful for pegmatite's mapping. From the results obtained, we can conclude that: (i) the combination of ASTER and Landsat 8 OLI data allows us to obtain more information about mineral composition than just one sensor, i.e., these two sensors are complementary; (ii) the alteration spots identified in the mines area are composed of clay minerals. In the future, more data and others image processing algorithms can be applied in order to identify the different Lithium minerals, as spodumene, petalite, amblygonite and lepidolite.

TI  - BISON REINTRODUCTION INFLUENCE ON THE EARTHWORMS COMPLEXES OF THE NATIONAL PARK "ORLOVSKOEY POLESYE"
T2  - Russian Journal of Ecosystem Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently in the Russian Federation in the reserves and national parks the reintroduction of the European bison- a powerful transducer that has a significant effect on vegetation and soil cover - is actively being carried out. This study is devoted to the assessment of the effect of different bison densities on earthworm complexes in the forest communities of the national park "Orlovskoye polesye", where they are the world's second largest free-living group of bisons. Analysis of the current distribution of bison on the territory of the national park "Orlovskoye polesye" was carried out on the basis of remote sensing data and density maps. Soil-zoological investigations and geobotanical descriptions were performed by standard methods. Comparison of the obtained lists of plant species with literature data of fodder species of bison shows that the feeding base of the "Orlovskoye polesye" corresponds to the trophic needs of the bisons. In forest communities the photophilous forest flora is predominate, which constitutes the bulk of the bisons' diet. It has been established that in forest communities on loamy soils the increase in the density of bison on feeding grounds positively influences the formation of a fullgrown complex of earthworms represented by four morpho-ecological groups, the largest numbers and biomass. On sandy loamy soils, regardless of the density of bison on feeding grounds, the complex of earthworms is incomplete, the numbers and biomass are low, in addition, on the soil surface the undecomposed excrement of bisons is accumulated, which indicates a deficiency in the trophic block of coprophages and detritophages.

TI  - QUESTIONING THE ANTHROPOCENE: A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE AGE OF HUMANKIND
T2  - JOURNAL OF POSTHUMAN STUDIES-PHILOSOPHY TECHNOLOGY MEDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Anthropocene denotes the Earth's entry into the age of humankind. A growing chorus of expert opinion now claims the fate of "the Earth system" lies squarely in human hands. Acknowledging the scale of human agency and its impact upon environmental processes, this article questions the largely unthought assumptions that facilitate the view that our species constitutes the determining factor regarding the planet's fate. The central premise examined here underpins the technological worldview, the perception of reality that fuels the project of mastering nature. This reading of reality posits that nature is conquerable. Its guiding assumption is that the judicious application of increasingly sophisticated forms of technological know-how can yield a world reworked in ways that have reality conform fully to our designs for it. Using Jean Baudrillard's thoughts on technology as inspiration and guide, the technological imaginary-inspired by dreams of an "integral reality"-is exposed as founded on a profound misreading of the nature of the real. An alternative reading of reality is proffered that holds that the world is not constituted in a way that permits its perfectibility. This counterinterpretation suggests that we ought to reinterpret humanism in a way that acknowledges the limits of the enterprise to remake reality in humanity's own image. Relinquishing the self-imposed demand to realize the future we wish for, it is concluded, is the surest way to regain the equilibrium we have lost with our entry into the Anthropocene.

TI  - The fate of beauty in a disenchanted age
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions related to what constitutes art, and the relationship between art and the concept "beauty," have been especially contentious for a century now, prompting many critics and practitioners to announce the end of art, and beauty as an aesthetic ideal. This article first summarises the argument in favour of such a view, as articulated by two theorists who have addressed the issue in depth- Elaine Scarry and Jean-Francois Lyotard. Questions related to the fate of art and beauty in modernity then are readdressed by examining the larger social context within which these questions arise, namely, our disenchanted or technological age. To this end, Jean Baudrillard's thoughts on art in the contemporary era are entertained as a means of formulating a coherent response to the challenge of the end of art thesis. It is argued here that this challenge can be met by relinquishing the egocentric ethos that informs the technological worldview. Scarry, Lyotard, and Baudrillard, it is argued. advance the general claim that if something akin to beauty is to be found in the world, it must arise from an embrace of what resists incorporation within the realm of the human.

AB  - Water has historically been considered a renewable resource, however in the last century a sustained degradation of its quality has been observed, both in continental and oceanic systems due to the anthropic impact. Added to this problem, a new global threat global appears, climate change, causing severe droughts or extraordinary floods in different regions of the planet. In this framework, the management of water resources and satellite monitoring represent a central point in public policies, since they allow us to anticipate and adapt to these disturbances. In this work, satellite information is use to perform an analysis of the annual evolution of the water quality of the San Roque reservoir, Cordoba, and its relationship with the occurrence of fires, rainfall and urban growth for the period 2001-2016. Water quality is evaluated from a time series of chlorophyll-a generated with MODIS-TERRA data and previously validated for the water body of study. The constructed and burned area is calculated from the classification of LANDSAT-TM / ETM + / OLI images for the basin. Accumulated precipitation is obtained from the products of NASA's TRMM mission. The temperature in the water reservoir is also analyzed, obtained from MODIS-TERRA data. Finally, correlation analysis between the mentioned variables is studied.

TI  - The futures of the University of Tehran using causal layered analysis
T2  - FORESIGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - Higher education and universities have faced unprecedented and ubiquitous changes. The University of Tehran or "UT,'' as the leading university in Iran, is not immune to these changes. The purposes of this study is to investigate the current situation and future of the UT and gain insights and possible responses to changes that suit its strengths and potential to progress in an increasingly competitive, complex environment with uncertainties. It identifies deep fundamental underpinnings of the issue and highlights them for policymakers to formulate strategies and future vision of the UT.Design/methodology/approach - Causal layered analysis (CLA) was applied as a framework and the data collected from different sources such as literature reviews, content analysis of rules, regulations and master plans of the university and coded interviews of four different groups of university stakeholders were analyzed. The current system of UT, as well as hidden beliefs, that maintains traditional perceptions about university was mapped. Next, by applying a new recursive process and reverse CLA order, new CLA layers extracted through an expert panel, the layers of CLA based on new metaphors to envision future of UT were backcasted.Findings - The results from CLA layers including litany, system, worldview and metaphor about the current statue of UT show disinterest and inertia against changes, conservative, behind the times and traditional perceptions, and indicate that the UT system is mismatched to the needs of society and stakeholders in the future. The authors articulated alternative perspectives deconstructed from other worldviews so there are new narratives that reframe the issues at hand. The results show that to survive in this fast-paced revolution and competition in higher education, UT should develop scenarios and formulate new strategies.Research limitations/implications - The authors had limited access to a wide range of stakeholders. As the UT is a very big university with so many faculties and departments, to access a pool of experts and top policymakers who were so busy and did not have time to interview inside and outside of university was very hard for the research team. The authors also had limitation to access the internal enactments and decisions of the trustee board of the UT and the financial balance sheets of the university.Originality/value - In this paper, by mixing different methods of futures studies, the authors have shown how to move forward while understanding the perspectives of stakeholders about the future of UT by a new recursive process and reverse CLA order. A supplementary phase was added to improve CLA and to validate the method and results, which were ignored in previous studies.

AB  - High resolution remote sensing data can provide worldwide images rapidly contrasted with conventional strategies for information accumulation. Therefore tiny objects like cars can be easily detected. Automatic vehicles enumeration research domain plays an important role in various applications including traffic monitoring and management. In this paper, we propose autonomous vehicle detection and classification approach in highway environment. Proposed approach consists mainly from three stages: (i) first, preprocessing operations are applied in order to eliminate noisy objects including soil, vegetation, water. (ii) Then, built-up area index is utilized to detect and delineate road networks. (iii) Finally, Multi-thresholding segmentation is implemented, resulting in vehicle detection and classification, where detected vehicles are classified into cars and trucks. Quality percentage assessment is carried over different study areas, illustrating the great efficiency of the proposed approach especially in highway environment.

AB  - Physiology is one of the remarkable branches in medical field which allows an appreciation of the anatomy as well as the functions of being; which then gives an idea on the purpose of a creation and a better understanding of the purpose of humans themselves. However, modern physiology taught in many Westernised textbooks lack the link and reflection to the worldview of Islam. As a result of this divorce between the modern physiology and the religious worldview, physiology as a subject is lacking "spiritual" connection and thus, produces students with lack of connection with the Tawhidic (Oneness) and admirableness to Allah, much to the dismay of the Islamic teaching. Thus, this paper is aimed to review the relevant scientific knowledge in endocrine physiology and relate it with the Qur'anic verses and Hadith. The roles of melatonin and cortisol that changes between day and night, the role of touch and the release of oxytocin are explained from the Islamic perspective based on the relevant Qur'anic verses and/or the Ahadith. Future research in integrating the physiology with the evidence from the Qur'an and the Ahadith should be attempted by medical and biomedical scientists alike, to further enhance and develop the concept of physiology as a subject in medical schools, not limited to the physical sciences per se, but also the spiritual and metaphysical dimensions.

AB  - Matching in high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images while being more complicated compared to optical images, is especially important due to its numerous applications. The main aim of current research is to determine improvement of SAR image matching process by deploying texture analysis using gray level's co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Three parts of the pair of TerraSAR-X images are used to implement the methodology. The results show that for some areas with low texture, the conventional image matching algorithm is not able to detect corresponding points, while using other textural features in image matching process leads to improvement in quantity of acceptable matched points.

AB  - Automatic object detection is a widely investigated problem in different fields such as military and urban surveillance. The availability of Very High Resolution (VHR) optical remotely sensed data, has motivated the design of new object detection methods that allow recognizing small objects like ships, buildings and vehicles. However, the challenge always remains in increasing the accuracy and speed of these object detection methods. This can be difficult due to the complex background. Therefore, the development of robust and flexible models that analyze remotely sensed data for vehicle detection is needed. We propose in this paper a hierarchical Bayesian model for automatic vehicle detection. Experiments performed using real data indicate the benefit that can be drawn from our approach.

TI  - A rule-based approach for crop identification using multi-temporal and multi-sensor phenological metrics
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate classification and mapping of crops is essential for supporting sustainable land management. Such maps can be created based on satellite remote sensing; however, the selection of input data and optimal classifier algorithm still needs to be addressed especially for areas where field data is scarce. We exploited the intra-annual variation of temporal signatures of remotely sensed observations and used prior knowledge of crop calendars for the development of a two-step processing chain for crop classification. First, Landsat-based time-series metrics capturing within-season phenological variation were preprocessed and analyzed using Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. The developmental stage of each crop was modeled by fitting harmonic function. The model's output was further used for the automatic generation of training samples. Second, several classification methods (support vector machines, random forest, decision fusion) were tested. As input data for crop classification, composites based on Sentinel-1 and Landsat images were used. Overall classification accuracies exceeded 80% when the seasonal composites were used. Winter cereals were the most accurately classified, while we observed misclassifications among summer crops. The proposed approach offers a potential to accurately map crops in the areas where in situ field data are scarce or unavailable.

AB  - Climate change, food insecurity and limited land and water resources strengthen the need for operational and spatially explicit information on vegetation condition and dynamics. The detection of vegetation condition as well as multiannual and seasonal changes using satellite remote sensing, however, depends on the choice of data including length and frequency of time series. Thus, this contribution focuses on the derivation of the optimal remotely sensed data for vegetation monitoring and extraction of relevant metrics. Time series of satellite data from Landsat-8, Sentinel-1/2, and MODIS were used to identify characteristics of vegetation at different spatiotemporal scales. We derived parameters, such as: maximum and amplitude based on vegetation index time series, as well as Land Surface Temperature (LST). Along with optical data, we used backscattering intensity over consecutive vegetation growing seasons. The analysis was carried out using Google Earth Engine, a cloud computing platform which allows to access various data archives and conduct data-intensive analysis. Taking advantage of this platform, we developed a web-based application named GreenLeaf. The application is computing metrics and plotting time series, based on parameters defined by the user. The derived vegetation condition parameters provide sufficient information to detect vegetation change. In addition, the images acquired from near-coincident dates provide similar information over continuous surfaces. The developed application contributes to the use of satellite data and the simplification of data access for users with limited remote sensing experience and/or restricted processing power. Aiming at providing this knowledge to stakeholders can further support decision making on multiple scales.

AB  - In this study, the performances of hyperspectral airborne and superspectral spaceborne spectral imaging to derive selected Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) were analyzed and compared in agricultural sites of the Czech Republic. The main aim was to assess the potential of superspectral Sentinel-2 satellite for the prediction and mapping of the attribute. The prediction accuracy based on airborne and spaceborne techniques in majority of the sites was adequate for SOC. Comparing the spatial distribution maps of SOC derived from the airborne and spaceborne data showed a similar trend at both platforms. The SOC maps also confirmed that in areas with a high level of SOC, Sentinel-2 was able to detect SOC even more precisely than the airborne sensors. Although a decrease in the model and map performances was obvious in the case of parameters with low contents. The findings of the current research showed that superspectral Sentinel-2 allows for the estimation and mapping of SOC. The study also emphasized the importance of the superspectral Sentinel-2 data in soil characteristics assessment with a frequent revisit-time over larger areas than it currently is with laboratory and airborne instruments. Certainly, the repeatability of the Sentinel-2 products is still a work in progress and with the Sentinel-2B, a revisit-time of five-day and the temporal frequency of cloud-free acquisitions will be further increased. Accordingly, much more data will be freely available in the near future, which will have a significant influence on the obtaining of high-quality soil data.

AB  - On 18th June, 2017 an ample amount of smoke plume had been dispersed into the atmosphere during the raging forest fire event which had taken place in Central Portugal, thereby affecting the air quality of the surrounding regions. The detection of smoke aerosols has been carried out by using the aerosol data from MODIS and OMI. The transport of air parcels containing smoke particles have been observed using NOAA HYSPLIT forward trajectory model which determines the potential sink area in the nearby region of the source area. This work is aimed to provide a comparative study of aerosol loadings derived from different passive sensors over the source and potential sink area, before and after the fire event happened in the source area.

AB  - This paper sought the possibility of philosophical counseling as a method of personality education. We often think that philosophical counseling itself includes personality education. But it is difficult to embody philosophical counseling as a method of personality education unless a clear understanding of the concept of personality and the direction of personality education is preceded. Therefore, I have discussed the problems of conventional personality education and the direction of new personality education through prior research. As a result, the conventional personality education does not understand the concept of personality from the whole point of view, and the new personality education suggests only the direction, but there is no discussion about the specific method, and since ethics counseling, which is a part of philosophical counseling, does not cover all the various aspects that constitute an individual's world view, there are limits to the direction and purpose of the new personality education.Therefore, I sought the possibility of philosophical counseling as a method of new personality education reflecting the demands of the times. Philosophical counseling centers on the interpretation of worldview, which is the main theme of philosophy. Philosophical counseling is an essential activity of philosophy that helps to critically review and redefine the world view that reflects the personality of an individual. This activity itself is the point where the goals and elements of philosophical counseling and personality education are right. Rational thinking and creative problem solving abilities required by the new personality education today are the core competencies of universities' liberal arts education. Critical thinking is based on these core competencies as an approach to philosophical counseling. The activity of philosophical counseling, which critically reviews and reestablishes its own worldview, can be appropriately applied itself as a method of personality education.

AB  - Soil water erosion is one of the challenges that the European Union should deal with in the next years, due to its significant impacts on agriculture and natural hazards.In this work, a RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation)-like model has been applied to estimate soil water erosion in a Northern Italian Alpine basin (Val Camonica) by combining meteorological forcing with topography, soil properties and land cover. In the traditional formulation, land cover classes are assigned categorized cover management factor (C-factor) value retrieved from existing literature (C-Land Cover formulation). However, Earth observation data have been proven effective in tuning the protective effect of vegetation on soil erosion dynamics. Thus, this method has been compared with two approaches (C-Satellite and C-Land Cover+Satellite) based on satellite-derived NDVI values to discretize C-factor values at a pixel scale. The C-Satellite formulation is based on an exponential law for correlating observed NDVI and C-factor values, irrespective of land cover classes. The C-Land Cover+Satellite method is based on the integration of land cover classification with NDVI maps. NDVI values have been retrieved from Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 OLI time series imaged from 2000 to 2017.Results of the application of the RUSLE-like proposed approach to estimate soil water erosion in an Italian alpine basin, have shown that integrating satellite-derived spectral information within the land-cover based C-factor estimate can generate a more reliable soil loss estimate related to seasonal and long-term land cover changes.

AB  - Multi-dwelling fires in informal settlements in South Africa are devastating for residents resulting in loss of life, homes and belongings. The aim of the IRIS-Fire project is to develop innovative methods of assessing and modelling fire risks with the goal of increasing informal settlement fire resilience. This paper outlines a new approach to mapping historic and ongoing fires in informal settlements using satellite imagery. A theoretical informal settlement fire curve for albedo is proposed based on the predicted reflectance of roof materials pre-and post-burn. Landsat OLI imagery in Google Earth Engine is used to map time series of albedo and the method is tested for a pilot site in Masiphumelele, South Africa. Results indicate that the detected albedo time series matches the theoretical informal settlement fire curve to some extent. Further research will investigate using (1) higher spatial resolution satellite data to reduce the impact of the mixed pixel effect, (2) higher temporal resolution satellite imagery such as Sentinel-2 to increase the revisit time and thus increase the number of high quality images, and (3) dark object subtraction to minimise scene noise, (4) use of statistical quality control charts to detect statistically significant change.

TI  - Evaluation of satellite retrievals of water quality parameters for Lake Victoria in East Africa
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Victoria in East Africa is a major ecosystem, whose size and importance has warranted the exploration of MODIS imagery to provide continuous and accurate water quality information. To this effect, two sea expeditions (in November 2014 and February 2015) were carried out to collect in situ lake surface temperature (LST), chlorophyll a (Chl) and Secchi disk depth (SDD) to compare with the corresponding satellite derived variables. Comparisons were made based on the following error matrices: coefficient of correlation (r). mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean absolute percent error (MAPE). In general the results showed that satellite derived LST gives a good estimate of in situ LST. Conversely, the error matrices indicated that satellite derived Chl yielded more uncertainty when compared with in situ Chl. This could be because of the fact that the MODIS Chl product algorithm was designed for oceans and may not be appropriate for inland lakes. Satellite derived SDD compared fairly well with in situ SDD. From these results it is evident that with more in situ observations and improved algorithms, MODIS can be useful to improve how water quality is monitored on Lake victoria.

TI  - Statistical analysis of contrail lifetimes from a satellite perspective
T2  - METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the lifetimes of contrails from a satellite perspective benefits from the extended coverage and close temporal monitoring. However, the initial stages of the contrail development are not observed from a satellite platform due to the sub-pixel size of the forming cloud. The final stages may be unobserved as well when the contrails get spatially diluted and when they lose contrast with their background. In this paper we apply a Weibull distribution model to describe the survival rate of contrails during their observed life-span and adjust its two defining parameters (lambda and k) to fit a dataset of over 2300 contrails. Using the Weibull distribution, it is possible to estimate the expected further lifetime of the contrails after satellite observation ceased. Depending on the actually observed lifetime, the expected extension can range from about 1 to 4 h, but the overall mean of this duration is about 1.3 h. The time elapsed between contrail formation and first satellite observation is estimated from the initial width distribution of the contrails. Under the assumption of a 5 km/h spreading rate, the average age of contrails at the time of their first satellite detection is 1.5 +/- 0.4 h. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we are able to compute the cumulative distribution of the complete (i.e. initial spreading, tracking, and after-tracking periods) lifetime of persistent contrails. This complete lifetime has a mean value of 3.7 +/- 2.8 h. The Weibull distribution (k < 1) shows that the probability to survive increases with contrail age, which corresponds to the actual decay rate of contrails in nature. Additionally, we analyse lifetime differences between daytime and nighttime contrails. We find that nighttime contrails have slightly shorter lifetimes than daytime contrails. Although this difference is statistically significant, it remains to be shown whether this has important physical consequences.

T2  - SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS IN THE 5G ERA
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Optical free-space links will shape the high-speed communications technology landscape for space missions substantially in the next years. The dramatically reduced signal spread - as compared to any radio frequency (RF) technology - provides a variety of advantages: increased power efficiency, the avoidance of interference and thus spectrum regulation issues, the inherent tap-and spoof-proofness and, most of all, the vastly increased data rates (DRs) will make this technology a 'game changer' comparable to the introduction of glass fibre instead of copper cables previously used in the global communication infrastructure.As one use case of optical space links high-speed geostationary data-relays for the repatriation of low Earth orbit (LEO) observation satellite telemetry have been tested and are currently implemented operationally by various space agencies [1-4]. Deep space missions will also boost their DRs by several orders of magnitude by sending their data to large optical receiver telescopes, NASAis currently transforming its Deep Space Network to an optical DNS, and we also see European developments in optical deep space communications [5-7]. In order to connect very high-throughput communication satellite systems to the Tbps-regime (Terabit-per-second), optical uplinks can solve the spectrum bottleneck that RF links would otherwise encounter [8]. In the LEO regime (inter-satellite, as well as optical LEO downlinks - OLEODL), distances are way shorter, allowing very high data rates while, at the same time, reducing the requirement for high system sensitivity (where complexity and thus costs generally increase with sensitivity). Instead, components and technologies that are close to commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) from terrestrial fibre communications can be used, allowing both very high throughputs and moderate-to-low system costs. Using COTS components in inter-satellite as well as downlinks is also supported by the shorter life time of LEO missions, implying less radiation exposure of these components. In the last years, several demonstrations of OLEODL have been performed by various agencies [9-15], and its commercialisation will be seen in near future.OLEODL serve for sensor data download from earth observation satellites, their link scenario is strongly asymmetric, since the data flow is mostly simplex or at least the downlink DR is orders of magnitude higher than the uplink (the later may only serve for tele-command and link protection). Therefore, the antenna gain can be distributed favourably: with small and lightweight transmitters in space and correspondingly moderately sized antennas (i.e., receiver telescope apertures) on the ground. The disturbing atmosphere only affects the lower end of the link close to the receiving ground station, which on the one hand allows for simple techniques for link stabilisation by aperture averaging but on the other hand complicates some of the advanced modulation and detection formats, since these may require sophisticated techniques like adaptive optics for coupling into single-mode fibres. Therefore, data format options for OLEODL focus mainly on rather low complex and robust direct detection (DD) techniques [16]. The following chapter introduces in its subsections:. the implementation history of space terminals and optical ground stations (OGSs) and consequences of the link scenario geometry.effects of the atmospheric transmission channel, link budget, modulation formats and link protection techniques.system and component aspects, and an outlook to ongoing and future missions and systems.

AB  - In recent, the hydrological regime of the Mekong river is changing drastically due to climate change and haphazard watershed development including dam construction. Information of hydrologic feature like streamflow of the Mekong river are required for water disaster prevention and sustainable water resources development in the river sharing countries. In this study, runoff simulations at the Kratie station of the lower Mekong river are performed using SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), a physics-based hydrologic model, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a data-driven deep learning algorithm. The SWAT model was set up based on globally-available database (topography: HydroSHED, landuse: GLCF-MODIS, soil: FAO-Soil map, rainfall: APHRODITE, etc) and then simulated daily discharge from 2003 to 2007. The LSTM was built using deep learning open-source library TensorFlow and the deep-layer neural networks of the LSTM were trained based merely on daily water level data of 10 upper stations of the Kratie during two periods: 2000~2002 and 2008~2014. Then, LSTM simulated daily discharge for 2003~2007 as in SWAT model. The simulation results show that Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of each model were calculated at 0.9(SWAT) and 0.99(LSTM), respectively. In order to simply simulate hydrological time series of ungauged large watersheds, data-driven model like the LSTM method is more applicable than the physics-based hydrological model having complexity due to various database pressure because it is able to memorize the preceding time series sequences and reflect them to prediction.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th International Conference on Forest Fire Research

AB  - The main objective of this study is to develop a web visualization tool which allows recognizing post-fire vegetation regeneration at pixel level from selected burned areas. Regeneration trajectories are based on the variations that spectral indices have (NDVI, NBR and TCW). Making use of the Earth Engine Code Editor platform (EECE) has been possible through the use of JavaScript language and other algorithms already integrated in Google Earth Engine (GEE), to generate those indices from Landsat time series (1984-present). Moreover, we implemented the graphical interface with which the user can visualize and interact with results and additional information.

TI  - Oil Spill Detection in Terma-Side-Looking Airborne Radar Images Using Image Features and Region Segmentation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents a method for oil-spill detection on Spanish coasts using aerial Side-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) images, which are captured using a Terma sensor. The proposed method uses grayscale image processing techniques to identify the dark spots that represent oil slicks on the sea. The approach is based on two steps. First, the noise regions caused by aircraft movements are detected and labeled in order to avoid the detection of false-positives. Second, a segmentation process guided by a map saliency technique is used to detect image regions that represent oil slicks. The results show that the proposed method is an improvement on the previous approaches for this task when employing SLAR images.

TI  - Comparison of aerosol models from the Ocean Color satellite sensors and AERONET-OC and their impact on reflectance spectra in coastal waters
T2  - OCEAN SENSING AND MONITORING X
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Ocean Sensing and Monitoring X
CL  - Orlando, FL
AB  - The choice of aerosol model in the atmospheric correction is critical in the process of the derivation of the water leaving radiances from the Ocean Color (OC) imagery for ocean monitoring. For the current sensors like MODIS, VIIRS and now OLCI atmospheric correction procedures include assumptions about the characteristics of atmospheric aerosols based on relative humidity and particle size distributions. At the sea level, SeaPRISM radiometric instruments which are part of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) make direct measurements of the water leaving radiances from the ocean, as well as observations of sky radiances from which aerosol parameters such as aerosol optical depth (AOD), fraction of fine and coarse aerosols and others are determined. The discrepancies between satellite and AERONET data are usually significant in coastal areas which are primarily due to the more complex atmospheres near the coast than in the open ocean. Using NASA SeaDAS software, characteristics of aerosols in atmospheric correction models for VIIRS and MODIS sensors are retrieved and compared with the ones from AERONET-OC data in terms of AOD, and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at the several AERONET-OC sites. The impact of the solar angles, scattering angles determined by the Sun-sensor geometry and wind speed on the differences in aerosols parameters are evaluated and correlated with the accuracies in the retrieval of the remote sensing reflectance spectra from ocean waters. Significant dependence of AOD on the wind speed is demonstrated which is most likely related to the modeling of the state of the ocean surface.

M3  - Article
AB  - With the Joint Commission's revelation that as much as 65%-70% of the time miscommunication has been discovered to be the root cause of many sentinel events, it may be time to examine a communication theory to support practice improvement efforts. Effective communication has been shown to decrease medical errors, improve patient satisfaction, and increase adherence to treatment plans leading to better health outcomes; yet very few studies have examined communication theories and their applicability to practice. This article will examine the Shannon-Weaver Communication Theory as one theory that may support future studies examining the teach-back communication method as a means to improving patient health literacy leading to improvements in clinical practice.

AB  - In the proposed work areas exposed to flood risk were evaluated in a particular context of karst ephemeral streams located in Puglia region (Southern Italy). The case study of Lama Balice, characterized by a natural geomorphologic structure, was tested for the application of a DTM-based approach, aimed to the rapid identification and mapping of flood risk. The inundated areas, obtained with a 2D hydraulic model, following design rainfall events characterized by different return periods, were used as reference maps for the selection of the most appropriate geomorphological descriptor exploiting the binary classifiers test. The performance of the adopted procedure was tested by validating the selected geomorphological descriptors on a different area with respect to that used for calibration, in order to estimate the discrepancy between DIM-based flood maps and those obtained by numerical simulation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The active andesitic Zhupanovsky Volcano consists of four coalesced stratovolcano cones. The historical explosive eruptions of 1940, 1957, and 2014aEuro'2016 discharged material from the Priemysh Cone. The recent Zhupanovsky eruptions were studied using satellite data supplied by the Monitoring of Active Volcanoes in Kamchatka and on the Kuril Islands information system (VolSatView), as well as based on video and visual observations of the volcano. The first eruption started on October 22 and lasted until October 24, 2013. Fumaroles situated on the Priemysh western slope were the centers that discharged gas plumes charged with some amount of ash. The next eruption started on June 6, 2014 and lasted until November 20, 2016. The explosive activity of Zhupanovsky was not uniform in 2014-2016, with the ash plumes being detected on satellite images for an approximate total duration of 112 days spread over 17 months. The most vigorous activity was observed between June and October, and in November 2014, with a bright thermal anomaly being nearly constantly seen on satellite images around Priemysh between January and April 2015 and in January-February 2016. The 2014-2016 eruption culminated in explosive events and collapse of parts of the Priemysh Cone on July 12 and 14, November 30, 2015, and on February 12 and November 20, 2016.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites observe range and azimuth geometric accuracies at the low centimeter level. The accuracy of geolocation is driven by several aspects, e. g. orbit determination, SAR image processing, or atmospheric error correction. Our paper concentrates on the Sentinel-1 mission and the compensation of the platform motion effects in the geolocation, which were found to limit the best possible geolocation capabilities of Sentinel-1. The key to advance the geolocation results is the rigorous compensation of the bistatic effect in azimuth, and the correction of the Dopplerinduced shifts in range. First results for Sentinel-1 at the Australian reflector array consisting of 40 Corner Reflector (CR) show consistent improvement in the geolocation (1) to 6 cm in range and 28 cm in azimuth for both spacecrafts when using the Interferometric Wide swath (IW) product.

AB  - Earth Observations Data Cubes (EODC) are a new paradigm revolutionizing the way users can interact with Earth Observations (EO) data. They can provide access to large spatio-temporal data in analysis ready format. Systematic and regular provision of Analysis Ready Data (ARD) can significantly reduce the burden on EO data users by minimizing the time and scientific knowledge required to access and prepare remotely-sensed data having consistent and spatially aligned calibrated surface reflectance observations. Currently, Sentinel-2 ARD are not commonly generated by the Copernicus program and consequently getting uniform and consistent Sentinel-2 ARD remains a challenging task. This paper presents an approach to generate Sentinel-2 ARD using an automated processing services chain The approach has been tested and validated to complete the Swiss Data Cube with Sentinel-2 data.

AB  - Environmental behavior substantially differs among individuals depending on their environmental attitudes, connectivity to nature beliefs, and socioeconomic profile. People who adopt an eco-friendly lifestyle and those who are unconcerned about environmental protection represent population segments with diverse characteristics. Consequently, this study aims to identify homogeneous groups based on individuals' environmental behavior. A total of 400 Greek citizens completed a self-report questionnaire. We used behavioral items adopted from previous studies to measure environmental behavior and background variables to assess the socio-demographic profile of the respondents. Additionally, we used the well-established measures of Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS) and New Ecological Paradigm Scale (NEP) to measure people's relatedness with nature and their ecological beliefs separately. Multivariate Cluster Analysis results indicated that participants can be grouped into two broad segments, named moderate eco-friends and non-environmentalists. Individual differences between the clusters were detected with respect to gender, education, connectedness to nature and ecological worldview.

TI  - A Hybrid of Optical Remote Sensing and Hydrological Modeling Improves Water Balance Estimation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Declining gauging infrastructure and fractious water politics have decreased available information about river flows globally. Remote sensing and water balance modeling are frequently cited as potential solutions, but these techniques largely rely on these same in-decline gauge data to make accurate discharge estimates. A different approach is therefore needed, and we here combine remotely sensed discharge estimates made via at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG) and the PCR-GLOBWB hydrological model to estimate discharge over the Lower Nile. Specifically, we first estimate initial discharges from 87 Landsat images and AMHG (1984-2015), and then use these flow estimates to tune the model, all without using gauge data. The resulting tuned modeled hydrograph shows a large improvement in flow magnitude: validation of the tuned monthly hydrograph against a historical gauge (1978-1984) yields an RMSE of 439 m(3)/s (40.8%). By contrast, the original simulation had an order-of-magnitude flow error. This improvement is substantial but not perfect: tuned flows have a 1-2 month wet season lag and a negative base flow bias. Accounting for this 2 month lag yields a hydrograph RMSE of 270 m(3)/s (25.7%). Thus, our results coupling physical models and remote sensing is a promising first step and proof of concept toward future modeling of ungauged flows, especially as developments in cloud computing for remote sensing make our method easily applicable to any basin. Finally, we purposefully do not offer prescriptive solutions for Nile management, and rather hope that the methods demonstrated herein can prove useful to river stakeholders in managing their own water.

TI  - Geostatistical Analysis of Mesoscale Spatial Variability and Error in SeaWiFS and MODIS/Aqua Global Ocean Color Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale (10-300 km, weeks to months) physical variability strongly modulates the structure and dynamics of planktonic marine ecosystems via both turbulent advection and environmental impacts upon biological rates. Using structure function analysis (geostatistics), we quantify the mesoscale biological signals within global 13 year SeaWiFS (1998-2010) and 8 year MODIS/Aqua (2003-2010) chlorophyll a ocean color data (Level-3, 9 km resolution). We present geographical distributions, seasonality, and interannual variability of key geostatistical parameters: unresolved variability or noise, resolved variability, and spatial range. Resolved variability is nearly identical for both instruments, indicating that geostatistical techniques isolate a robust measure of biophysical mesoscale variability largely independent of measurement platform. In contrast, unresolved variability in MODIS/Aqua is substantially lower than in SeaWiFS, especially in oligotrophic waters where previous analysis identified a problem for the SeaWiFS instrument likely due to sensor noise characteristics. Both records exhibit a statistically significant relationship between resolved mesoscale variability and the low-pass filtered chlorophyll field horizontal gradient magnitude, consistent with physical stirring acting on large-scale gradient as an important factor supporting observed mesoscale variability. Comparable horizontal length scales for variability are found from tracer-based scaling arguments and geostatistical decorrelation. Regional variations between these length scales may reflect scale dependence of biological mechanisms that also create variability directly at the mesoscale, for example, enhanced net phytoplankton growth in coastal and frontal upwelling and convective mixing regions. Global estimates of mesoscale biophysical variability provide an improved basis for evaluating higher resolution, coupled ecosystem-ocean general circulation models, and data assimilation.

T2  - WSPOLCZESNA ONKOLOGIA-CONTEMPORARY ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of the study: The goal of this work was to assess upper-limb sequelae among patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT) for breast cancer 5-6 years after the surgical procedure.Material and methods: A controlled clinical study was conducted on 128 patients who had undergone surgery 5-6 years prior. BCT + ALND (axillary lymph node dissection) was performed in 58 patients and 69 underwent BCT + SLND (sentinel lymph node dissection). Patients declared active participation in physiotherapy. The following parameters were assessed in studied subjects: range of motion in the shoulder joint, superficial sensation, upper limb circumference, skin sensation, and presence of winged scapula sign.Results: Five to six years after BCT, patients who had undergone BCT + ALND presented with significantly poorer outcomes concerning upper limb range of motion on the operated side compared to the BCT + SLND group with regard to the following features: flexion (p = 0.00004), external rotation (p = 0.0292), and internal rotation (p = 0.0448). However, no statistically significant differences were noted between compared groups with regard to upper limb circumference and sensation disturbances. Statistically significant differences between limb on the operated side (operated limb - OL) vs. contralateral limb (healthy limb - HL) were noted in the BCT + SIND group with regard to the range of motion in extension (p = 0.0004), external rotation (p = 0.0055), and internal rotation (p < 0.0001), as well as the occurrence of winged scapula sign (p < 0.0001) and sensation disturbances (p < 0.0001).Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that both procedures are not free of distant sequelae, although the BCT + ALND group is more frequently affected.

AB  - Since the Industrial Revolution, in the 21st century, the movement of goods based on capital has been enjoined by the movement of humans, creating a huge wave of migration, making the world a single “global village.” This global movement of human resources is no exception to Korea, which has been emphasizing a homogeneous culture. Amid this social trend, various policies and countermeasures are being developed by the government, local autonomous bodies and other social organizations. The Christians are also actively pursuing various studies and ministries towards immigrants.Therefore, what is primarily needed for Christians and Christian organizations is a biblical worldview of “immigrants” by understanding the biblical background and principles of immigrants, the key factor in the multi-culture.The immigrants in the Bible are poor and powerless people who are forced to leave their home country due to various difficult circumstances. The type of immigrants in the Bible is mainly comprised of marriage immigrants, labor immigrants, refugee, and religious immigrants, and God gave two great principles for these immigrants. First, by defining Israel as immigrants, He commanded them to love and treat other immigrants who have moved into their communities without any discrimination. In particular, He urged the circumcised immigrants to be treated equally with the Israelis in terms of spiritual and social. Second, if someone refuses to be circumcised and rather worship idols and follow foreign customs, the immigrants must be expelled from the Israeli community. This was to maintain the identity and purity of the Israeli community, which only serves God.Applying this biblical principle to the context of multicultural ministry, Church, Mission organizations, and Christian groups must work to immigrants holistically encompassing both social and spiritual aspects. We must be considerate and helpful to the immigrants who approach us so that they can settle as healthy citizens, and at the same time, the ultimate goal of the ministry should be their spiritual salvation.

TI  - Estimating tree canopy cover percentage in a mediterranean silvopastoral systems using Sentinel-2A imagery and the stochastic gradient boosting algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of accurate and updated spatial information of tree cover in semi-arid and arid silvopastoral systems (SPSs) is crucial to understand their spatial patterns and trends. Although remote-sensing techniques have been proved useful in estimating tree canopy cover in general, more research is required to investigate the capabilities of new high spectral and spatial resolution satellites, such as Sentinel-2A, in predicting tree canopy cover in semi-arid environments. The objective of this study was to explore the capabilities of Sentinel-2A multispectral data, in combination with a stochastic modelling technique, for mapping montado tree canopy cover percentage (CCP) at pixel level. The stochastic gradient boosting algorithm was used to predict tree CCP using Sentinel-2A spectral data, vegetation indices, and textural information as predictor variables. The results of the study showed that the combination of multispectral bands with the selected vegetation indices and grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features performs well, presenting a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 82.8% and an error prediction of 8.68%. The analysis also showed that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI), as well as homogeneity texture feature, were the most important predictor variables to undertake the complex montado tree canopy cover estimation. In addition, this study demonstrated the usefulness of narrow spectral bands provided by the Sentinel-2A sensor for accurately estimating tree CCP (e.g. Red Edge1 - B5 - for PSRI and NIR2 - B8a - for NDVI computation). The modelling procedure used here emphasizes the effectiveness of stochastic models for predicting tree canopy cover from a complex semi-arid silvopastoral system by using Sentinel-2A multispectral data.

TI  - Insights from recent gravity satellite missions in the density structure of continental margins - With focus on the passive margins of the South Atlantic
T2  - GONDWANA RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - We focus on new gravity and gravity gradient data sets from modern satellite missions GOCE, GRACE and CHAMP, and their geophysical interpretation at passive continental margins of the South Atlantic. Both sides, South Africa and South America, have been targets of hydrocarbon exploration and academic research of the German Priority Program SAMPLE (South Atlantic Margin Processes and Links with onshore Evolution). The achievable spatial resolution, driven by GOCE, is 70-80 km. Therefore, most of the geological structures, which cause a significant gravity effect (by both size and density contrast), can be resolved. However, one of the most important aspects is the evaluation of the omission error, which is not always in the focus of interpreters. It results from high-frequency signals of very rough topographic and bathymetric structures, which cannot be resolved by satellite gravimetry due to the exponential signal attenuation with altitude. The omission error is estimated from the difference of the combined gravity model EIGEN-6C4 and the satellite-only model G00005S. It can be significantly reduced by topographic reductions. Simple 2D density models and their related mathematical formulas provide insights in the magnitude of the gravity effect of masses that form a passive continental margin. They are contrasted with results from satellite-only and combined gravity models. Example geophysical interpretations are given for the western and eastern margin of the South Atlantic Ocean, where standard deviations vary from 25 to 16 mGal and 21-11 mGal, respectively. It could be demonstrated, that modern satellite gravity data provide significant added value in the geophysical gravity data processing domain and in the validation of heterogeneous terrestrial data bases. Combined models derived from high-resolution terrestrial gravity and homogeneous satellite data will lead to more detailed and better constrained lithospheric density models, and hence will improve our knowledge about structure, evolution and state of stress in the lithosphere.

AB  - The legends, which might be considered as cultural heritage, enlighten us regarding the history, values and beliefs of communities that they belong to. Until its current definition, the word of legend has been defined in various ways. Since 16th century, the word has been referred to "narratives", "lies" and "empty words" etc. The legends do not only help us in understanding the imagination and cultural memory of their community but also the worldview of that community as well. This study analyses the fates in the Legends of Cyprus as the background of Turkish Cypriot Literature and the motif of Allah in order to comprehend the socio-cultural structure, world perception and value judgment of Turkish Cypriot community. The intervention of 'Creator' and motif of Allah in the Legends of Cyprus, which are given in the book called "Cypriot Turkish Folklore Oral Culture Values, Our Legends" as the main reference within the Cyprus Literature textbook, which is covered in the Secondary Education curricula of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and that the students encounter for the first time were analyzed in this study. Within the scope of research, the most comprehensive resource was taken as a basis. The messages given in the legends were analyzed with the semantic analysis method. Therefore, the meanings and beliefs towards Allah by the Turkish Cypriot community were aimed to be identified.

AB  - In this study, the impacts of polarimetric and spatial features on the classification accuracy of full polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) RADARSAT-2 data was investigated. Since PolSAR systems have the advantage of providing day-and-night and weather-independent images could provide the geo/bio-physical and structural information about the target objects hence are an important data source for remote sensing. PolSAR data includes geophysical(roughness and moisture), geometric(rotation, shape, size) and polarimetric as well as spatial information, as these information can be considered complementary. In this study, morphological features (opening and closing) were implemented to extract spatial features. Kernel based extreme learning machines (kELM) was used for data classification. Our results demonstrated that the classification accuracy is increased by 9.2% via inclusion of polarimetric and spatial features with highest classification accuracy was obtained as 82.61%.

TI  - Integrating patient and whole-genome sequencing data to provide insights into the epidemiology of seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses
T2  - MICROBIAL GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Genetic surveillance of seasonal influenza is largely focused on sequencing of the haemagglutinin gene. Consequently, our understanding of the contribution of the remaining seven gene segments to the evolution and epidemiological dynamics of seasonal influenza is relatively limited. The increased availability of next-generation sequencing technologies allows rapid and economic whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of influenza virus. Here, 150 influenza A(H3N2) positive clinical specimens with linked epidemiological data, from the 2014/15 season in Scotland, were sequenced directly using both Sanger sequencing of the HA1 region and WGS using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequences generated by the two methods were highly correlated, and WGS provided on average >90% whole genome coverage. As reported in other European countries during 2014/15, all strains belonged to genetic group 3C, with subgroup 3C.2a predominating. Multiple inter-subgroup reassortants were identified, including three 3C.3 viruses descended from a single reassortment event, which had persisted in the population. Cases of severe acute respiratory illness were significantly clustered on phylogenies of multiple gene segments indicating potential genetic factors warranting further investigation. Severe cases were also more likely to be associated with reassortant viruses and to occur later in the season. These results suggest that WGS provides an opportunity to develop our understanding of the relationship between the influenza genome and disease severity and the epidemiological consequences of within-subtype reassortment. Therefore, increased levels of WGS, linked to clinical and epidemiological data, could improve influenza surveillance.

TI  - Estimation of instantaneous air temperature using remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid areas, the variation of air temperature can be considerable, so instantaneous air temperature (T-ai) estimation is needed in different environmental researches. In this research, two different remote sensing data are used for estimating T-ai for clear sky days in 2009 in Fars Province, Iran, including atmospheric temperature profile and land surface temperature (LST) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The T-ai from a number of surface weather sites is used to judge the best T-ai estimation. Stations' elevation, latitude, and land cover type are considered to show their effect on T-ai estimation. The estimated T-ai evaluation focuses on daily and seasonal timescales in the daytime and night time separately. Both LST and vertical temperature profile data produced relatively high coefficient of determination values and small root mean square error value for T-ai estimation, especially during the night time. Land cover and elevation vary the error values in T-ai estimation more, when LST data is used. In comparison atmospheric temperature profile indicates a smaller error in T-ai estimation in spring and summer and in urban land cover type, while using LST data presents a better result in fall and winter especially at night time.

TI  - Scenarios of land-use change in a deforestation corridor in the Brazilian Amazon: combining two scales of analysis
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Local, regional, and global processes affect deforestation and land-use changes in the Brazilian Amazon. Characteristics are: direct conversions from forest to pasture; regional processes of indirect land-use change, described by the conversion of pastures to cropland, which increases the demand for pastures elsewhere; and teleconnections, fueled by the global demands for soybeans as animal fodder. We modeled land-use changes for two scenarios Trend and Sustainable Development for a hot spot of land-use change along the BR-163 highway in Mato Grosso and Para, Brazil. We investigated the differences between a coupled modeling approach, which incorporates indirect land-use change processes, and a noncoupled land-use model. We coupled the regional-scale LandSHIFT model, defined for Mato Grosso and Para, with a subregional model, alucR, covering a selected corridor along the BR-163. The results indicated distinct land-use scenario outcomes from the coupled modeling approach and the subregional model quantification. We found the highest deforestation estimates returned from the subregional quantification of the Trend scenario. This originated from the strong local dynamics of past deforestation and land-use changes. Land-use changes exceeded the demands estimated at regional scale. We observed the lowest deforestation estimates at the subregional quantification of the Sustainable Development story line. We highlight that model coupling increased the representation of scenario outcomes at fine resolution while providing consistency across scales. However, distinct local dynamics were explicitly captured at subregional scale. The scenario result pinpoints the importance of policies to aim at the cattle ranching sector, to increase land tenure registration and enforcement of environmental laws.

CP  - 3rd Conference of the World-Association-of-Soil-and-Water-Conservation (WASWAC)
CL  - Belgrade, SERBIA
AB  - The territory of the Russian Plain can be divided into two parts in terms of agricultural activity. The northern half is taiga zone with an extremely high proportion of forested area and very limited arable fields. Southern half of the Russian Plain is located in broad-leaf forest, forest-steppe and steppe zones and it is characterized by a high proportion of arable lands which was subject to intensive cultivation from 300 -350 years ago in broad-leaf landscape zone up to about one century ago on the south-east of steppe zone. It is one of the main agricultural regions of Russia with relatively high rates of sheet, rill and gully erosion. The latest quantitative assessment of soil losses for the entire area of the Russian Plain was undertaken in the middle of 1980ies, when maps of soil losses and gully density were constructed. Modified version of USLE model and State Hydrological Institute erosion model were used to evaluate soil losses from arable lands during the warm period of the year and during snow-melting respectively. Land use transformation, climate changes and crop rotation modification during last 25-35 years lead to changes of soil erosion rates in different parts of the studied area. A complex approach is used to assess recent trends of sheet, rill and gully erosion in different landscape zones of the study area. Investigations were undertaken in 6 selected sectors (area of each sector is about 6-10 thousand km(2)), uniformly distributed over the area of the Southern half of the Russian Plain. Changes of the different parameters, including some meteorological and hydrological parameters, land use, USLE C-factor, were determined for the period 1990-2014. The contribution of each of the mention factors on erosion rate trend changes is different in the different landscape zones of the study area. It was found, that decreasing surface runoff from cultivated slope during snowmelt is the main driver of the reduction of the gully headcut retreat rate as well as sheet and rill erosion.

TI  - Youth in Former Soviet Republics in Conditions of Value Transformation of Society (Case Study of Russia and Armenia)
T2  - ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGES-FACTS TRENDS FORECAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Value orientations of the older generation (over 55 years of age) are well-established, and, as a rule, they are influenced by the worldview that developed in the Soviet time. As for young people, their life ideas relating to various manifestations of social reality are still actively forming. In this regard, the two generations have certain differences in their sets of values. It is interesting and important to study them because young people perceive their current status and opportunities as being completely natural, while for their parents much of what looks normal and routine now was completely inaccessible in the years of their youth. The article considers value orientations of young people from former Soviet countries by highlighting their similarities and differences in comparison to those of the older generation. We are particularly interested in the views on the life and mindset of young people who represent a generation oriented toward modernization changes in society. Using research data, the paper attempts to find a determining vector of spiritual development of young people. The study is based on the analysis of secondary data of sociological surveys conducted in the Russian Federation and in the Republic of Armenia. Youth and the older generation are the objects of comparison in the surveys. The study not only identifies common features in the value consciousness of two generations in Russia and Armenia, but also substantiates the nature and importance of the impact of socio-cultural factors on the vital values of young people. It is established that intergenerational differences in socio-cultural determinants affect the attitude toward personal prospects in life and family, income, education, etc. The results of the study allow us to determine the direction of changes in young people's value orientations. Trends in the cultural and spiritual development of youth in both countries reflect an intergenerational shift from the focus on economic and physical security to the increasing role of self-expression, subjective well-being and the quality of life, which ambiguously affects social well-being. In particular, the correlation analysis has established the inverse relationship between people's Internet activity and their confidence in the future. This suggests that the behavior of young people who "immerse" deeply in the Internet space is fraught with manifestations of social apathy. In conclusion, we present our own reflections on the need to intensify intercultural dialogue between former Soviet republics and participate jointly in addressing youth policy issues.

TI  - A modification of the pre-analytical phase of the indirect Coombs test for multiple myeloma patients treated with daratumumab
T2  - GEMATOLOGIYA I TRANSFUZIOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - Daratumumab, the first therapeutic monoclonal antibody that binds to CD38, is used for treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. The CD38 transmembrane protein is highly expressed on the surface of malignant myeloma cells, but also, to a lesser extent, is expressed by many other types of cells, including red blood cells (RBCs). When daratumumab binds to CD38 expressed on RBCs, this may result in positive indirect antiglobulin tests (IAT) performed to identify immunological compatibility before RBC transfusions. Anti-CD38-specific agglutination may also variably affect autocontrol, direct antiglobulin test (DAT), and eluate tests.The aim of the study was to develop a protocol for preventing CD38-specific agglutination in antiglobulin tests by treatment of RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT).Materials and methods. Between July 2016 and April 2017, 9 multiple myeloma patients undergoing daratumumab treatment were tested using routine methods in the Immunohematology Laboratory of the National Hematological Research Center in Moscow. The tests included ABO and Rh typing, extended phenotype matching, DAT, and IAT in LISS/Coombs gel cards. Tests were performed before and after treatment of RBCs with DTT.Results. No daratumumab interference was observed in ABO, Rh, Kell, MNS or Fy typing with IgM antibodies. DAT and auto control were also negative in all patients. On the other hand, all patients showed daratumumabmediated positive IAT, which was resolved by treatment of RBCs with DTT.Conclusions. Anti-CD38 antibodies interfere with serological tests. This interference can be resolved by treating RBCs with DTT. Blood banks and immunohematological laboratories should be informed that a patient is receiving treatment with anti-CD38.

TI  - Breast conservation for male breast cancer: Case report of intraoperative radiation
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Male breast cancer (MBC) comprises <1% of all breast cancers in the United States. MBC is typically treated with total mastectomy while the majority of female breast cancer is treated with breast conservation therapy combined with various forms of radiation. One method that has developed over the last two decades is the use of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) as a type of accelerated partial breast irradiation to direct the treatment field to the tumor bed. Since overall prognosis and systemic therapy recommendations for MBC are similar to breast cancer in women, we describe the first case of MBC treated with BCS and IORT. Our patient is a 62-year-old male who was found to have a right breast 1.6 cm palpable mass at the 10:00 position 1 cm radially from the nipple. Core biopsy demonstrated invasive ductal carcinoma, moderately differentiated, estrogen and progesterone receptor positive, and Her 2 Negative. The patient had a strong desire for breast conservation, and needed to minimize daily radiation treatments due to his work schedule. After discussion among our multidisciplinary tumor board, we felt this patient to be suitable for BCS and IORT given his age, favorable tumor subtype, size, and clinically early stage breast cancer. A right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy and central lumpectomy was performed. The INTRABEAM device (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Oberkochen, Germany) was utilized for radiation delivery. The patient had negative margins on his final pathology. The postoperative course was uneventful and at the 6 month follow-up visit there were no issues and he had an excellent cosmetic outcome. BCS and IORT is an option in appropriately selected male patients with favorable subtype early stage breast cancer.

TI  - Wittgenstein, Schopenhauer and the metaphysics of suicide
T2  - REVISTA DE FILOSOFIA AURORA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, I argue that the meaning of Wittgenstein's remarks on suicide should be elucidated against the background of the transcendental picture that permeates Wittgenstein's early writings. This picture is, in its essentials, Schopenhauer's metaphysics of the Will. It is part of my purpose here to argue that the question of suicide such as Wittgenstein raises it, far from being a side issue, is internally related to problems concerning the ethical integration of Will and world, and the meaning of the world. As it will be seen, Wittgenstein manages to present a highly original view on the fundamental character of ethics that combines asceticism with an affirmative attitude to the world. Suicide would undermine ethics. As such, it stands for a nihilistic worldview.

TI  - Sensitivity of clay content prediction to spectral configuration of VNIR/SWIR imaging data, from multispectral to hyperspectral scenarios
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of digital soil mapping, with the help of spectroscopic data, provides a non-destructive and cost-efficient alternative to soil property laboratory measurements. Visible, near-infrared and short wave infrared (VNIR/ SWIR, 400-2500 nm) hyperspectral imaging is one of the most promising tools for topsoil property mapping. The aim of this study was to test the sensitivity of soil property prediction results to coarsening image spectral resolution. This may offer an analysis of the potential of forthcoming hyperspectral satellite sensors, e.g., HYPerspectral X IMagery (HYPXIM) or Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), and existing multispectral sensors, e.g., SENTINEL-2 Multispectral Sensor Instrument (MSI) or LANDSAT-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), for soil properties mapping. This study used VNIR/SWIR hyperspectral airborne data acquired by the AISA-DUAL sensor (initial spectral and spatial resolutions of approximately 5 nm and 5 m, respectively) over a 300 km(2) Mediterranean rural region. Ten spectral configurations were built and divided in the following two groups: i) six spectral configurations corresponding to simulated sensors with regular spectral resolution from 5 nm to 200 nm (i.e., the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) remains constant throughout the considered spectral domain; this includes the simulation of the forthcoming HYPXIM and EnMAP hyperspectral satellites) and ii) four spectral configurations corresponding to existing multispectral sensors with irregular spectral resolution (i.e., the FWHM differs from spectral sampling interval; Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), SENTINEL-2 MSI, LANDSAT-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) and LANDSAT-8 OLI). The soil property studied in this paper is the clay content, defined as the percentage of granulometric fraction finer than 2 mu m by weight of the soil, which will be estimated using the partial least squares regression method. Our results showed that i) spectral configurations with regular spectral resolutions from 5 to 100 nm provided similar and good clay content prediction performances (R-val(2) > 0.7 and RPIQ > 3) and allowed clay mapping with correct short-scale variations, ii) the spectral configuration with a regular spectral resolution of 200 nm provided unsatisfactory clay content prediction performance (R-val(2) similar or equal to 0.01 and RPIQ similar or equal to 1.65) and iii) the ASTER sensor was the only existing multispectral sensor that provided both correct performance of clay content estimation (R-val(2) similar or equal to 0.8 and RPIQ similar or equal to 3.72) and correct clay mapping. Therefore, clay mapping by the ASTER multispectral data should be pursued while awaiting the launch of forthcoming hyperspectral satellite sensors (e.g., HYPXIM and EnMAP), which will be good candidates for future large clay mapping campaigns over bare soils.

AB  - Air pollution is one the main causes of DNA damage in living organisms. Continuous exposure to the complex mixture of gases of polluted atmospheres affects health in many ways. Sentinel organisms are good biological models to assess the genotoxic damage caused by various chemicals such as atmospheric pollutants.& para;& para;In this study the plant species Taraxacum officinale and Robinsonecio gerberifolius were exposed during 2015, in the dry and rainy seasons, for 0, 2, 4 and 6 weeks to two different atmospheres of Mexico Valley, one rural in Altzomoni atmospheric observatory (ALTZ) and other urban in the atmospheric observatory of Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera (CCA), located in Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM).& para;& para;Leaves of exposed plants were processed to analyze genotoxic damage by single-cell gel electrophoresis. To found any relation, the presence of pollutants in the atmosphere of both sites was analyzed with a Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer (CRDS) and in the leaves the presence of heavy metals with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer.& para;& para;Single-cell gel electrophoresis results showed higher damage in the leaves exposed to higher pollution in the UNAM atmospheric station in comparison to the ALTZ and controls, which was maintained in growth chambers under controlled conditions. Significant differences between rainy and dry seasons were found. Chemical analysis showed a significant increase in various heavy metals, especially in rainy season in both exposure sites. Increased DNA damage observed in both plant species at CCA station could be caused by accumulation trough six weeks. (C) 2017 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control.

AB  - This communication describes the optical processing chain to use Sentinel-3 OLCI and MODIS data as part of the ESA funded Synergy project of the Scientific Exploitation of Sentinel Missions (SEOM) component of the EO Envelope programme. One of the goals of the project is to use Data Assimilation techniques to produce land surface products combining the data from Sentinels-2 and 3. Some of the derived products are the OLCI atmospherically corrected data that can be used to generate a spectral BRDF product from OLCI and MODIS, broadband albedo and different vegetation parameters. The project also implements a series of efficiency improvements to the algorithms to speed up the processing. The demonstrator product uses one year of OLCI and MODIS data (2017).

SLN mapping increased from 2.8% in 2013 to 4.3% in 2014 (P < 0.001). Patients treated in 2014 and those at community centers were more likely to undergo SLN biopsy, while women with advanced-stage disease, sarcomas, and grade 3 tumors were less likely to undergo SLN mapping (P < 0.05). There was no association between use of SLN biopsy and use of radiation (aRR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.82-1.05).

TI  - LST retrieval algorithm adapted to the Amazon evergreen forests using MODIS data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonian tropical forests play a significant role in global water, carbon and energy cycles. Considering the importance of this biome and climate change projections, the monitoring of vegetation status of these rainforests becomes of significant importance. In this context vegetation temperature is presented as a key variable linked with plant physiology. In particular some studies showed the relationship between this variable and the CO2 absorption capacity and biomass loss of these tropical forests proving the potential use of vegetation temperature in the monitoring of the vegetation status. Nevertheless, the use of thermal remote sensing data over tropical forests still has some limitations being of special importance the atmospheric correction under very humid conditions and the possible high occurrence of cloudy pixels. In order to mitigate these limitations over the Amazon region, we present in this paper a new processing methodology to derive a LST product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The LST product was generated using a tuned split window equation and cloud information derived from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm. This LST product was validated using simulated and in situ data, and inter compared to the MODIS LST standard product (MOD11). Validation analysis shows that the new LST product reduces the RMSE by 0.6 to 1 K when compared to the MODIS standard LST product, mainly because of a reduction of the bias. We also show a preliminary intercomparison between MODIS and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) LST spatial patterns to illustrate the feasibility of VIIRS to extend forward the MODIS LST temporal series.

M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the planning, sampling, operational aspects of the field, and the sample obtained during a research conducted in a rural area, specifying and discussing the main logistical difficulties unique to these places and the solutions adopted.METHODS: We carried out a population-based, cross-sectional survey between January and June 2016, with a representative sample of the population aged 18 years or over living in the rural area of Pelotas (approximately 22,000 individuals), State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. We collected demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related information, such as alcohol consumption, cigarette consumption, depressive symptoms, quality of diet, quality of life, physical activity, satisfaction with the health unit, overweight or obesity, and sleep problems.RESULTS: In the 720 domiciles sampled, 1,697 individuals were identified and 1,519 were interviewed (89.5%). The study initially drew 24 census tracts and proposed the visit to 42 households per tract; however, we need to adjust the method, such as decreasing the number of households per census tract (from 42 to 30) and identifying housing centers in each tract. The main reasons for these changes were difficulty accessing the area, large distances between households, misconceptions in the satellite data available (which did not fit the reality), and high cost of the field work.CONCLUSIONS: The previous detailed recognition of the research environment was crucial for decision making as the maps and territory had geographical inconsistencies. The strategies and techniques used in studies for the urban area are not applicable to the rural area given the outcomes observed in Pelotas. The decisions taken, keeping the methodological rigor, were essential to ensure the timely execution of the study with the financial resources available.

TI  - Validation on MERSI/FY-3A precipitable water vapor product
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The precipitable water vapor is one of the most active gases in the atmosphere which strongly affects the climate. China's second generation polar orbit meteorological satellite FY-3A equipped with a Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) is able to detect atmospheric water vapor. In this paper, water vapor data from AERONET, radiosonde and MODIS were used to validate the accuracy of the MERSI water vapor product in the different seasons and climatic regions of East Asia. The results show that the values of MERSI water vapor product are relatively lower than that of the other instruments and its accuracy is generally lower. The mean bias (MB) was -0.8 to -12.7 mm, the root mean square error (RMSE) was 2.2-17.0 mm, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) varied from 31.8% to 44.1%. On the spatial variation, the accuracy of MERSI water vapor product in a descending order was from North China, West China, Japan-Korea, East China, to South China, while the seasonal variation of accuracy was the best for winter, followed by spring, then in autumn and the lowest in summer. It was found that the errors of MERSI water vapor product was mainly due to the low accuracy of radiation calibration of the MERSI absorption channel, along with the inaccurate look-up table of apparent reflectance and water vapor within the water vapor retrieved algorithm. In addition, the surface reflectance, the mixed pixels of image cloud, the humidity and temperature of atmospheric vertical profile and the haze were also found to have affected the accuracy of MERSI water vapor product.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of precipitable water vapour over northwest china utilizing MERSI/FY-3A products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Northwest China is considered as the arid and semi-arid temperate continental climate, where the precipitation is closely related to precipitable water vapour (PWV) content. In this paper, the Medium-Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) water vapour products were first used to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of water vapour over Northwest China, which were developed by the National Satellite Meteorological Center of China from the Chinese second-generation polar orbit Meteorological Satellite Fengyun 3A (FY-3A). In order to utilize the MERSI water vapour products, the MERSI 5min water vapour product is compared respectively with global positioning system (GPS), Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Radiosonde water vapour data in situ datasets. The results show that the water vapour values of the MERSI product are a slightly lower than referenced data, and the accuracy of MERSI product compared with GPS water vapour is the most agreeable, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 22.83%. The PWV content displays a typical spatial distribution pattern in Northwest China that it is the highest in the southeast, the second for the northwest and the lowest in the south-centre. The water vapour content over each province in a descending order is Shaanxi, Ningxia, west of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu and Qinghai. The seasonal variation of water vapour content over Northwest China appears to be lowest in winter, followed by spring, then for autumn, and highest in summer. The PWV content of each province in Northwest China shows the periodic inner-annual variation, that is, the PWV content is lowest in January, and gradually increases with time till it peaks in July, and then decreases monthly afterwards, which agrees with the quadratic polynomial model by months. The standard deviation of the water vapour content in summer is 0.533-1.027mm, while that in winter is 0.262-0.527mm.

AB  - Delta ecosystem has always captivated the interests of scientists around the world because of its variety of landforms which are subjected to periodic or abrupt changes. The prime objective of this study is to explore the potential of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) for change detection analysis in Krishna River Delta using C-band Sentinel-1 TOPSAR Interferometric Wide Swath data. The variation in delta dynamics have been analysed on a set of interferometric image pairs acquired from October 2016 to April 2017. An integrated cumulative change map was generated. Profound changes were noticeable in mangrove swamps, vernal pool and agricultural lands. This study has brought out the significance of InSAR for analysing delta dynamics.

AB  - The problem of decorrelation leading to loss of coherence has been a major source of concern to identify the various problems of erosion and deposition in delta. In this study, Permanent Scatter Interferometric SAR (PsInSAR) technique was used to identify the Permanent Scatter Candidates (PSCs) to explore its potential in identifying displacement based on coherence of various features in delta during the dry and wet periods. PSCs are coherent over interferograms acquired during different time periods. The study was conducted using Sentinel-1 C-band Interferometric Wide (IW) swath datasets acquired from 25th October 2016 to 10th June 2017 over Krishna Delta. The datasets were deramped and stitched prior to co-registering the master and slave images. Interferograms were generated, phase unwrapped and filtered after which the PSCs were identified based on Amplitude Stability index. The problem of tropospheric phase delay causing decorrelation was removed based on the difference in the phase residual of the connected PSCs. Ps coherence map was generated showing coherence as low as 0.28 to 0.38 in mangroves due to volume decorrelation and 0.5 to 0.85 in village areas. A prominent feature, vernal pool exhibited high variation in coherence (0.28 to 0.45) depending on monsoon or summer season. An integrated cumulative displacement map was generated indicating the areas where erosion and deposition has taken place and these depositional values of certain deltaic features were in conjunction with coherence.

TI  - Cosmological and phenomenological transitions into how humans conceptualize and experience time
T2  - TIME & MIND-THE JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY CONSCIOUSNESS AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cosmographies associated with Western cosmologies demonstrate transformations from classic wheels of time and chains of being to scales of nature, chronologies, and pedigrees. Pedigrees in turn are converted into linear timelines, bifurcating trees, and multidirectional networks. These diagrammatical transitions associate with changes in how time is conceptualized - as circular, linear, multilinear, multidirectional, and perhaps as non-existent. This paper focuses on delineating the phenomenologies associated with worldview turnovers. By identifying group-level dynamics, it demonstrates that time phenomenology extends individuals, and it demonstrates that paradigmatic shifts are driven by new observations, new jargon, and the invention of new quantitative methodologies and modelling techniques.

AB  - The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data set, used for the generation of the global TanDEM-X (TDX) DEM, includes multiple acquisitions with different parameters. It enables a big opportunity for scientific geoapplications, such as for land characterization, classification, and monitoring. One valuable information that can be derived from interferometric SAR data for land classification describes the presence/absence of vegetation. At X-band, volume scattering produces decorrelation, even in the presence of short vegetation. As TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X satellites are still acquiring data, the exploitation of the signatures for specific or detailed vegetation is possible. In August 2016 a ground field campaign was conducted in the Bavaria region, while dedicated TanDEM-X data takes over the same area were commanded by using different acquisition geometries and configurations. The aim of this paper is to characterize the interferometric signatures of agricultural areas from single-pass bistatic TDX acquisitions at 12 meters posting, using the on ground typification for classification purposes.

TI  - Ozone layer adaptive model from direct relationship between solar activity and total column ozone for the tropical equator-Andes-Colombian region
T2  - ATMOSFERA
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the lack of models to predict the ozone layer even after an ample range of total column ozone (TCO) measurements around the globe, a direct relationship between solar activity by means of sunspot number observations and total ozone satellite data for a tropical Andes mountains region at Bogota-Colombia, is presented. Sunspot number data and 37 years of TCO records from satellite missions Nimbus 7, Meteor 3, Earth Probe and AURA from January 1979 through August 2016, are analyzed. Ozone annual cyclic behavior, which strongly depends on the annual cyclic Sun-Earth distance variation, as well as the dynamics of the solar activity cycles allow to derive a physical-mathematical adaptive model for predicting and reconstructing daily stratospheric ozone over the city of Bogota, very close to the equator. Results suggest that the ozone layer as a natural indicator of solar activity.

The second satellite product was the surface soil moisture (SSM) of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, in which the Soil Water Index (SWI) model was applied to retrieve RZSM. Finally, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was used to retrieve SSM using visible/infrared observations and the apparent thermal inertia (ATI) algorithm. The derived SSM from the ATI was then transformed into RZSM through the SWI.The statistical results showed similar performance for the three products. However, the good results based on the MODIS ATI must be highlighted since this methodology is only based in thermal imagery.

AB  - Changes in landscape and land use can drive the emergence of zoonoses, and hence, there has been great interest in understanding how land cover change and the cascade of ecological effect associated with it are associated with emerging infectious diseases. In this chapter, we review how a spatially hierarchical approach can be used to guide research into the links between landscape properties and zoonotic diseases. Methodological advances have played a role in the revival of landscape epidemiology and we introduce the role of methodologies such as geospatial analysis and mathematical modeling. Importantly, we discuss crossscale analysis and how this would provide a richer perspective of the ecology of zoonotic diseases. Finally, we will provide an overview of how hierarchical research strategies and modeling might be generally used in analyses of infectious zoonoses originating in wildlife.

TI  - Flint Drinking Water Crisis: A First Attempt to Model Geostatistically the Space-Time Distribution of Water Lead Levels
T2  - HANDBOOK OF MATHEMATICAL GEOSCIENCES: FIFTY YEARS OF IAMG
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The drinking water contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan has attracted national attention since extreme levels of lead were recorded following a switch in water supply that resulted in water with high chloride and no corrosion inhibitor flowing through the aging Flint water distribution system. Since Flint returned to its original source of drinking water on October 16, 2015, the State has conducted eleven bi-weekly sampling rounds, resulting in the collection of 4,120 water samples at 819 "sentinel" sites. This chapter describes the first geostatistical analysis of these data and illustrates the multiple challenges associated with modeling the space-time distribution of water lead levels across the city. Issues include sampling bias and the large nugget effect and short range of spatial autocorrelation displayed by the semivariogram. Temporal trends were modeled using linear regression with service line material, house age, poverty level, and their interaction with census tracts as independent variables. Residuals were then interpolated using kriging with three types of non-separable space-time covariance models. Cross-validation demonstrated the limited benefit of accounting for secondary information in trend models and the poor quality of predictions at unsampled sites caused by substantial fluctuations over a few hundred meters. The main benefit is to fill gaps in sampled time series for which the generalized product-sum and sum-metric models outperformed the metric model that ignores the greater variation across space relative to time (zonal anisotropy). Future research should incorporate the large database assembled through voluntary sampling as close to 20,000 data, albeit collected under non-uniform conditions, are available at a much greater sampling density.

TI  - Shrub detection using disparate airborne laser scanning acquisitions over varied forest cover types
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We explore the possibility of extending the national forest inventory-based point data of understory presence using region-wide, disparate lidar data for the southeastern USA. For this, we developed a simple inferential model that helps to understand the basic underlying relationships and associations between lidar predictor metrics and forest understory shrub presence over a wide range of forest types and topographic conditions. The model (a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-based logistic regression model) had fair predictive performance (accuracy=62%, kappa=0.23). Hence, we were able to propose a set of biophysically meaningful predictor variables that represent understory (4), canopy (3), topographic conditions (1), and sensor characteristics (1). The single most important predictor variable was the understory layer canopy density, which is the ratio of lidar returns in the understory to those near the ground. Hence, we demonstrate that the interplay of several factors affects understory vegetation condition. Overall, our work highlights the potential value of using lidar to characterize understory conditions.

TI  - Spatial Analysis of Wildlife Habitat around Madihan forests of Mirzapur district, Uttar Pradesh in India, using Geospatial Technology.
T2  - Folia Forestalia Polonica Series A - Forestry
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical dry deciduous forests of Mirzapur district in Uttar Pradesh (state) in India are facing to severe threat from agricultural expansion, increased urbanisation, infrastructure development and unsustainable use of forest produce. The forests are nowadays fragmented and wildlife habitat is vanishing. Decreasing numbers of wild animal species requires using methods for preventing the loss of biodiversity. The present study concerns analysis of satellite remote sensing data of Landsat OLI (2013) in conjunction with Geographic Information System (GIS) and support of Geographic Positioning System (GPS) to identify suitable habitat for wild animals. The thematic maps regarding e.g. land use, forest cover type were prepared. The weighted overlay method was used for integration of the thematic layers for identification of potential habitat and corridors for wildlife movement. Most suitable (2.54%), moderately suitable (12.0%) and least suitable (16.20%) areas were delineated and represented in a map. Highly suitable habitat was found at Dadri and Kotwa forest; moderately suitable habitat was found in Darhi Ram forests. Least suitable areas were found in Kotwa and Patewar forests. Such data are the basis to assess the wildlife conservation measures.

AB  - An analysis of smoke haze over Europe in July 2016 caused by the wildfires in Siberia has been carried out. Surface air pollution by aerosols in Moscow region during the smoke event was also investigated. It was found that optical and microphysical characteristics of the smoke aerosol in Europe were typical for the boreal forest fires. The aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) variations at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and the bottom of the atmosphere (BOA) during the smoke haze period were analyzed. The regional mean direct radiative forcing of aerosols at the TOA and BOA on 26 July 2016 were estimated to be -25 and -45 W/m(2) respectively. Probability distribution function of ARF values at the TOA was presented.

TI  - Development and Evaluation of Push-Pull Control Strategies against <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae)
T2  - ADVANCES IN THE BIORATIONAL CONTROL OF MEDICAL AND VETERINARY PESTS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Biorational Control of Medical and Veterinary Pests Symposium / 254th ACS National Meeting
CL  - Washington, DC
AB  - The increase in insecticide-resistant mosquito populations necessitates the exploration of novel vector control intervention measures. Push-pull strategies have been successful in integrated crop pest management. Through the combinatory use of deterring and attracting stimuli, the abundance of insect pests can be changed in a given area. A push-pull strategy might also reduce human-vector contacts and augment existing mosquito control strategies, e.g. through the combination of an attractive trapping system and spatial repellent. Several volatile pyrethroids have been tested for their spatial repellent (push) potential. However, the use of insecticides conflicts with the general idea of push-pull as a non-toxic means of pest management. In addition, constant human exposure to insecticides should be avoided and further insecticide resistance in the target population needs to be prevented which necessitates the screening for effective, non-toxic spatial repellents. This chapter discusses techniques that allow for a more realistic evaluation of spatial repellents under laboratory conditions before they are tested in the (semi-)field and introduces a push-pull approach that uses the BG-Sentinel trap in combination with catnip oil (Nepeta cataria), a known spatial repellent for Aedes aegypti. Different candidate materials were evaluated in y-tube olfactometer assays and the efficacy of the most promising candidates was subsequently verified within a larger scaled room test. The novel room test included a dispensing system that created a repellent-loaded air curtain which had to be overcome by the mosquitoes in order to reach an attractive trap or human volunteer located behind. Best results were obtained with a dispensing system using conventional fans and a repellent sachet containing polymer granules with catnip oil. In these experiments, mosquito attraction to a BGS-trap was reduced by 70% in push-only set-ups. The indoor success was attributed to a homogenous and constant dispersal of active ingredients, as confirmed by quantification experiments using thermal desorption gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Successful protection of a human volunteer was achieved in push-pull experiments using catnip oil in combination with the BGS trap. In these experiments, human landing collections were reduced by 50%. In semi-field tests in Florida, comparable protective effects could not be verified and further research on suitable repellent concentrations and formulations for outdoor implementation are required.

TI  - Providing uncertainty estimates of the Sentinel-2 top-of-atmosphere measurements for radiometric validation activities
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of the Sentinel-2 mission, a Radiometric Uncertainty Tool (RUT) has been recently released to the community. This tool estimates the Sentinel-2 radiometric uncertainty associated with each pixel in the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance factor images provided by the European Space Agency (ESA). The use of such information enables users to assess the "fitness for purpose" of the data to their specific application. The work described here summarises the efforts and results of integrating the RUT for radiometric validation activities for the Sentinel-2 mission. Starting from the results provided by the RUT, the focus will be on providing a methodology to calculate the uncertainty associated with the mean TOA reflectance factor in a Region of Interest (ROI). Two different methods - one simple method directly using the RUT and a more rigorous one based on Monte Carlo method (MCM) propagation are proposed and compared. These two methods focus on the effect of the spectral, spatial and temporal correlation of the errors in different ROI pixels and the impact of correlation on the uncertainty associated with the mean TOA reflectance factor. The study has also considered the impact of uncertainty contributions not included in the first version of the RUT.

AB  - The Radiometric Uncertainty Tool (RUT) is a software tool integrated as part of the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP). The tool estimates the radiometric uncertainty associated with each pixel in the top-of-atmosphere reflectance factor images of the Sentinel-2 (S2) Level-1C products provided by the European Space Agency. The tool and the uncertainty analysis are under continuous evolution. This paper summarises the main features and improvements considered for a second version of the RUT. This second version has under-gone a set of software improvements such as: metadata associated to the uncertainty image, integration of the S2 L1C masks, and the feasibility of parallel processing. Furthermore, it includes upgrades in the uncertainty analysis as distinguishing between S2A and S2B satellites or the estimate of the uncertainty of a mean of pixels in a region-of-interest. Finally, the second version also includes an improved user guide and documentation.

TI  - Dispatches from Haiti, 2010
T2  - MEDICC REVIEW
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Haiti is a country that appears fleetingly in the English-speaking media, when stricken by disaster or more recently by epithets. Perhaps few are aware that Haiti was the first independent nation in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the world's first black republic-independence declared on January 1, 1804-in a revolution led by former slaves who defeated Napoleon's 40,000-strong colonial forces. Or that, when others abandoned the independence wars against Spain, Simon Bollvar appealed to Haitian president Alexandre Petion and with Petion's troops and material aid, went on to free slaves across Spanish-held colonies in Latin America.Over the centuries, the Haitian people have indeed been beset by disasters, both natural and man-made. But they have also stood against daunting odds and have received solidarity from their hemispheric neighbors, Cuba among the countries allied with Haiti's attempts to provide for its people.In this Retrospective, MEDICC Review reprints excerpts from a blog by Senior Editor Conner Gorry, who, during February and March 2010, was embedded in the disaster-response medical team sent from Cuba after the January 12 earthquake. The team reinforced nearly 500 Cuban health personnel already on the ground long term in 120 communities. Some 700 of the 1300 new arrivals were students or graduates of Cuba's Latin American School of Medicine from 27 countries. Haitian graduates now number 1044. The international contingent (named after Henry Reeve, a Brooklyn-born general in Cuba's own independence struggle)-became the largest medical relief effort assembled after the quake.The vivid stories here take us back to the urgency and chaos of those first weeks and months after disaster struck. But Haitian, Cuban and other Cuban-trained doctors dedicated to Haiti's recovery-its long-term health care needs and strengthened public health system-provide an example of commitment to social equity and human solidarity in the face of enormous challenges. And their work with those from other countries proves effective cross-border, cross-cultural collaboration can work.Today, there are 664 Cuban health professionals collaborating in Haiti, 175 of them doctors posted throughout the country. In 2017 alone, they carried out 2.64 million patient consults, performed 40,842 surgeries, and delivered 5788 babies (many times working with local midwives). They labor in 21 community reference hospitals built with funds from Venezuela; 31 rehabilitation centers, also built after the 2010 earthquake; 14 health centers; and 29 sentinel sites for epidemiological surveillance (mainly for cholera and vector-borne diseases). A national workshop for orthotics and prosthetics was also established to assist earthquake victims, with equipment and other resources provided by Cuba.

TI  - Upwelling nearby the Crimea Western Coast
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In connection with the problem of the seawater self-purification, the upwelling phenomenon nearby the Crimea western coast is considered in the present article. The observation data on wind and water temperature obtained at the Yevpatoria and Chernomorskoe weather stations as well as the sea surface temperature data derived by the NOAA-15/19 and MetOp-2 satellites were analyzed. 212 cases of upwelling are identified for the period from 1921 to 2011; most of them fall on July. In the majority of cases, the upwelling duration varied within 2-15 days, but in 20% of all the cases it lasted 16-30 days. On average, the duration comprised 11.8 days. The average rate of temperature variation in 75% of the cases observed did not exceed 0.1 degrees C/h. The anomalies exceeding 7 degrees C/h were observed in 18% of the cases; among them there are a few ones worthy of being noted when the temperature dropped by more than 11 degrees C (July, 1954 and 1996, and August, 2000). The available multi-year data on upwelling variability demonstrate neither expressed periodicity of the phenomenon nor long-term tendency to its decrease or increase. It is shown that the upwelling phenomenon in the Kalamitsky Bay is determined not only by the Ekman mechanism arising under the influence of the along-coastal wind, but also by the offshore wind effect resulting from the tangential wind stress.

TI  - Exploring prospective urban growth trends under different economic outlooks and land-use planning scenarios: The case of Athens
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulation modeling along with scenario analysis is a useful tool for urban planning, by providing an appraisement of different alternatives and tradeoffs and thus contributing to improved decision making. The objective of this study is to explore potential future urban dynamics in the Messoghia plain, (peri-urban Athens, Greece) under four scenarios that reflect future growth traits in the area related to different economic performance realities and alternative policies. Messoghia, a predominantly rural area, experienced significant and unregulated urban growth, during the past decades, due to the construction of the international airport in the area, the significant allocation of funds triggered by 2004 Olympics and the absence of planning controls. However, the late economic circumstances significantly affected the growth trends in the area. First, the paper looks at the periodic changes occurred during the past three decades (1980-2015) employing remote sensing techniques and Landsat data. The observed changes are then combined with 20 dynamic, biophysical, socio-economic and legislative factors, to produce transition potential maps using the Random Forests algorithm. Scenarios are projected until 2045 by implementing a spatially explicit Cellular Automata model. Under an economically optimistic scenario which means high or medium development circumstances, and given the absence of an adequate controlling mechanism, the artificial surfaces are expected to nearly double in size, by 2045. In case of a continuation of economic scarcity which can be translated in low or very low development, the artificial surfaces are expected to increase by 9% or 6% respectively, by 2045.

TI  - Identification of new base metal mineralization in Kumaon Himalaya, India, using hyperspectral remote sensing and hydrothermal alteration
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic mineral deposits are commonly associated with zones of intense hydrothermal alteration. Space borne hyperspectral remote sensing is one of the recent techniques that enable the identification of hydrothermally altered and weathered minerals. In this study, we identified hydrothermally altered and weathered minerals of a gossanised outcrop rich in base metal mineralization in parts of the Kumaon Himalaya, India using an EO-1 Hyperion (hyperspectral) satellite data. Spectral Angle Mapper classification method was used to map the different altered/weathered minerals within the study area. The method identified the occurrence of dolomite and dolomite with chlorite minerals from the Hyperion data. The finding was verified in the field and confirmed through laboratory analyses. Representative samples measured for spectral absorption characters, reflected and transmitted petrography, X-ray diffraction and ICP-MS analyses confirmed the occurrence of Ag, Cu, Fe, Pb, Zn, As, and Sb base metal rich elements in the Thalkedar limestone. Our study recommends the technique to the map base metals and hydrothermally altered minerals in the other parts of Thalkedar limestone of Kumaon Himalaya and similar region of the world. The study is an important case for formulating exploration strategies in terrenes with rugged topography and dense vegetation.

TI  - Focusing Microwaves in the Fresnel Zone With a Cavity-Backed Holographic Metasurface
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the design and experimental demonstration of a cavity-backed, holographic metasurface capable of focusing microwaves in the Fresnel zone. The circular cavity consists of two stacked plates: microwaves are injected into the bottom plate via a coaxial connector, which forms the feed layer, and are coupled to the top holographic metasurface layer via an annular ring on the periphery of the cavity. This coupling results in an inward traveling cylindrical wave in the top layer, which serves as the reference wave for the hologram. A sparse array of slots, patterned into the upper plate, constitutes the hologram that produces the focal spot. To mitigate high sidelobe levels and improve performance, a tapered design, facilitated by varying the slot size, is also introduced. The proposed designs-which have a 10-cm diameter, operate at 20 GHz, and form a focal spot at a distance of 10 cm-are validated using full-wave simulations as well as measurements of fabricated samples. The proposed focusing metasurface may find application as a compact source for Fresnel zone wireless power transfer and remote sensing schemes.

AB  - We extend our previous observations of the spring bloom in the Strait of Georgia, Canada using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images, to include both a longer time period (2000-2016) and a wider variety of seeding' bloom events. We have reported on blooms in inlets to the north of the Strait, which appear to seed the main spring bloom in a characteristic Malaspina Dragon' pattern, leading to significantly earlier spring bloom dates in some years. Here, we double the time period of those observations. We find no clear repetitions of the earlier dragon pattern, but several instances of seeding from other inlets, with varying impacts on spring bloom timing. In situ monitoring has increased in coverage in recent years in the main body of the Strait, and we have deployed a fluorometer to record blooms at one inlet location, but observations of blooms in inlets rely mostly on satellites. We discuss the spatial and temporal resolution requirements imposed by the spatial scale of inlets and the temporal scale of blooms and cloud cover. In these waters, we find chlorophyll fluorescence images more useful than the standard chlorophyll product, restricting the value of NASA's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor and suggesting increased value from ESA's Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) in the future, especially when two instruments are in orbit.

AB  - The Earth is entailing the largest landscapes about 57,268,900 square miles best suits as a habitat for diverse species. The economic growth, industrialization, human population and agriculture widely hinge on the flat land. Unfortunately, the traditional method for surveying a land, guaranteeing the ownership and maintaining the records seems burdensome matter to the officials. In the traditional way, the land surveying consists of ten stages spanning more than two weeks to register a land to the concerned offices. Eventually, many disputes arise in the ownership, land boundaries, and locality. Therefore, the problem has been resolved by using a modern technological collaboration of IoT (Internet of Things), GPS (Global Position System), and Biometrics systems. In this paper, the real samples are taken from different resources to survey precisely along with certainsecurity measures are implied with the uniqueness of the regulations pertaining to the registration ultimately running in a short span of time. The proposed technique have several advantages over the existing schemes such as enhanced security feature system, compatible with the IoT systems, and can be accesse during multiple platforms such as mobile phone, tablets, laptop, desktop, etc.

AB  - The Landsat and Modis satellites have been providing spectacular imagery of Earth's surface for over 40 years and 20 years respectively. Joining them is another recent initiative by European Space Agency (ESA) of multispectral Sentinel satellites first launched in 2016. These together provide a variety of vegetation indices, in particular, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is widely adopted to analyze vegetation patterns and crop phenological characteristics to understand and predict expected yield, pest attacks, water deficiency etc.However, a big challenge in using the data from multiple satellites to derive common integrated insight is the appropriate bias correction especially as the spatial and temporal resolutions do not match across various satellites. For instance, Landsat has 30mx30m spatial resolution (SR) and 16 days temporal resolution (TR), Modis has 250mx250m spatial resolution but 1 day temporal resolution whereas Sentinel has 10-60mx10-60m spatial resolution with close to 5 days temporal resolution. Along with varying resolutions, presence of significant cloud cover for long time periods is also a factor which affects the performance of vegetation health models based on raw data from these satellites especially in countries like India with long monsoon seasons.We propose a novel blending algorithm to bring together remote sensed data from Landsat, Modis and Sentinel satellites and derive a new enhanced High Definition Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (HD-NDVI) for daily vegetation health monitoring at the fine spatial resolution of Sentinel data. The proposed algorithm analyses past observed NDVI data from the above mentioned three satellites, corrects for anomalous sensor data due to cloud cover and sensor saturation, determines the bias between different combinations of satellite data and applies bias correction to derive the HD-NDVI. As it determines the bias from the recent past for a given region, the proposed algorithm can be scaled globally and applied across different geographic regions and seasons.In this paper we present the derived HD-NDVI from our algorithm for Burdwan region of West Bengal in India across the full crop cycle of approximately 98 farmers. We show HD-NDVI images and the latest images of all the three satellites to highlight the differences and significant gain in spatial and temporal resolution achieved by HD-NDVI. The correlation between HD-NDVI and Landsat, Sentinel and Modis satellite data for the entire crop cycle is also analyzed across the full crop cycle. HD-NDVI has the highest correlation with Sentinel and the average, maximum and minimum Pearson Correlation coefficients are 0.9611, 0.992 and 0.59 respectively. Second in terms of correlation is Landsat with average, maximum and minimum correlation coefficients of 0.898, 0.982 and 0.048 respectively. The lowest correlation is with Modis with average, maximum and minimum correlation coefficients of 0.69, 0.87 and -0.00113. The above correlation numbers indicate that HD-NDVI provides daily NDVI at the spatial resolution of Sentinel. Summarizing, HD-NDVI acts as a virtual satellite that has the best of temporal and spatial resolutions compared to the widely adopted Landsat, Sentinel and Modis satellites.

TI  - New Technologies for Sentinel Lymph Node Detection
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - The standard of care' method for sentinel node mapping is the combination technique using radioisotope and blue dye although some centres use radioisotope or blue dye alone. Radioisotope usage requires licensing, has regulatory issues around handling and disposal of waste, and logistically may be unavailable or difficult to implement in some centres or less developed country. This has led to the development of alternative methods such as superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), fluorescence techniques using indocyanine green (ICG) or fluorescein, computed tomography lymphography, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound scan (CEUS) using microbubbles. The newer techniques will potentially enable a more widespread adoption of this procedure; however, a common barrier for these techniques is the lack of standardisation and no randomised trials to evaluate their effectiveness against the current standard of care. Furthermore, many of these techniques are more costly and may become redundant in node-negative patients with small tumours if ongoing trials show that sentinel node biopsy offers no additional benefit to grey-scale axillary ultrasound. This review discusses the new techniques for sentinel node mapping that have emerged including their pros and cons. (C) 2018 S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg

TI  - Exposure to Ambient Fine Particulate Air Pollution in Utero as a Risk Factor for Child Stunting in Bangladesh
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Pregnant mothers in Bangladesh are exposed to very high and worsening levels of ambient air pollution. Maternal exposure to fine particulate matter has been associated with low birth weight at much lower levels of exposure, leading us to suspect the potentially large effects of air pollution on stunting in children in Bangladesh. We estimate the relationship between exposure to air pollution in utero and child stunting by pooling outcome data from four waves of the nationally representative Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey conducted between 2004 and 2014, and calculating children's exposure to ambient fine particulate matter in utero using high resolution satellite data. We find significant increases in the relative risk of child stunting, wasting, and underweight with higher levels of in utero exposure to air pollution, after controlling for other factors that have been found to contribute to child anthropometric failure. We estimate the relative risk of stunting in the second, third, and fourth quartiles of exposure as 1.074 (95% confidence interval: 1.014-1.138), 1.150 (95% confidence interval: 1.069-1.237, and 1.132 (95% confidence interval: 1.031-1.243), respectively. Over half of all children in Bangladesh in our sample were exposed to an annual ambient fine particulate matter level in excess of 46 mu g/m(3); these children had a relative risk of stunting over 1.13 times that of children in the lowest quartile of exposure. Reducing air pollution in Bangladesh could significantly contribute to the Sustainable Development Goal of reducing child stunting.

AB  - Sentinel-4 is an imaging UVN (UV-VIS-NIR) spectrometer, developed by Airbus Defence and Space as prime contractor under ESA contract in the frame of the joint EU/ESA COPERNICUS program. The mission objective is the operational monitoring of trace gas concentrations for atmospheric chemistry and climate applications. Stray light, which is unwanted light captured by the detectors, is one of the major contributors to such important instrument performance metrics as absolute and relative spectral and spatial radiometric accuracies. Amongst the different sources of stray light, Out-of-Band stray light can not be corrected. It is thus important to ensure its impact is limited. The main scope of this paper is to describe the stray light simulations performed in the frame of the Sentinel-4 project: the models, analysis approach and the results. Also, the technical challenges faced in building the models and performing the analysis and the solutions found to solve them are presented.

AB  - This chapter assesses the availability and usefulness of environmental, climate, population and health data in Brazil, with the aim of enabling the construction of indicators for monitoring the health-related effects of environmental and climate changes. This task was performed by means of thematic workshops held between 2009 and 2011, aiming to define the data to be made available, the data sources to be used and the integration strategies. Sentinel sites were highlighted, where some local problems relating to possible impacts of environmental and climate change were being studied. These workshops involved the participation of potential data users and producers, such as civil society members, governmental institutions and researchers. The local studies showed close correlations between climate variables and the incidence of vector-borne diseases, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases associated with exposure to smoke generated by fires, and waterborne diseases. The indicators selected provided support for academic studies and the development of technological innovations in the fields of climate and health. An integrative platform was built in order to disseminate health and climate information, original data, environmental and epidemiological indicators, news and technical publications. The Website also made it possible for these changes to be followed and debated within civil society.

TI  - Within-host Envelope Remodelling and its Impact in Bacterial Pathogen Recognition
T2  - CURRENT ISSUES IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Following colonization of host tissues, bacterial pathogens encounter new niches in which they must gain access to nutrients and cope with stresses and defence signals generated by the host. For some pathogens, the adaptation to a new 'within-host' lifestyle involves modifications of envelope components that bear molecular patterns normally recognized by the host innate immune system. These new modified patterns limit host recognition, therefore promoting immune evasion and pathogenicity. In this review, we describe how envelope components like the peptidoglycan or lipopolysaccharide can be altered within the host to impair responses triggered by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). We also discuss the few cases reported to date of chemical modifications that occur in the envelope of some intracellular bacterial pathogens when they reside inside eukaryotic cells. These envelope alterations may have evolved due to the sentinel role performed by PRRs over pathogen-specific molecular patterns. The available data indicate that only selected pathogens seem to evade recognition due to 'within-host' envelope changes, with most of them displaying such patterns also in non-host environments. Given the importance of these alterations, future studies should focus in the responsible pathogen regulators - most yet unknown - that could be targeted to prevent immune evasion.

AB  - ABSTRACT The study of minimum flows is increasingly important due to the relationship with ecosystem sustainability, the economy and its role as a sentinel of climate change. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the theoretical treatment of minimum extremes and, specifically, minimum flows. The method has two approaches: i) conventional; ii) asymptotic. In conventional analysis, the Weibull (W2) and Lognormal distributions of two parameters (LN2) were adjusted to the series of annual minimum flows and minimum averages of 7-day flows. In the asymptotic analysis approach two parent distributions, the distributions of all average daily flows, with power behavior for minimum flows, are investigated: i) Gamma; ii) LN2. The theory studied in this paper is applied to 11 gauged stations in the Iguacu river basin with 48-year data series. It was concluded that the LN2 distribution presents the best fit according to the chi 2 test. It was found that the Gamma distribution, with respect to the minimums, tends to a power function, and consequently the W2 distribution. The parameters k, b and mu X , of the normalized annual minimum flow series are well-fitted to the LN2 distribution. According to both approaches, LN2 can be recommended for studies of minimum flows in the Iguacu river basin. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

AB  - Surveillance for influenza-like illness (ICI) and laboratory-confirmed influenza m Victoria; Australia Is undertaken jointly by the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory and the Victorian Government Department of Health and Human Services from May to October each year. Surveillance data comprise notifiable laboratory-confirmed influenza and ILI reporting from from two sources - a general practice sentinel surveillance programme and a locum service.The magnitude of the 2017 influenza season was high in Victoria with widespread circulation of influenza type A(H3N2), which peaked in September. A record number M laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were notified, and the proportion of ILI cases to total consultations from both the general practice arid locum service were higher than previous years.. Notified cases of influenza A were older than influenza B cases with 25% compared to 17% aged more than 65 years, respectively. The proportion of swabs that were positive for influenza peaMd at 58%. Antigenic characterization suggested a good match between the circulatMg and vaccMe strains of influenza A(H3N2).Most of the increases observed in notified cases M laboratory-coMirrned influenza in recent yeam m Victona have been attributed to increases in testing. However, that cases of ILI also increased in Victoria in 2017 is suggestive that 2017 was a relatively severe season. The dominance of Mfluenza type A(H3N2), the extended duration of elevated activity, an a potential phylogenetic mismatch M vaccine to circulating strains are likely to have contributed to the relative severity of the 2017 season.

T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - This dataset is a weekly time-series of images from 2005-2017 that depict the probability of large fire across western US forests and woodlands. Specifically, the images depict the probability that an area on the landscape will burn in a large (i.e., 405 ha) fire following an ignition event, on the given date. Each product in the dataset is a three-band GeoTIFF image (250-m resolution) in the WGS84 geographic coordinate reference system (EPSG:4326). Names of each product correspond to the image prediction date. Band 1 values are the output of a Random Forest classification algorithm, trained on 10 independent, random samples of small and large wildfires that occurred from 2005-2014, and represent the mean predicted probability of an individual pixel burning in a large fire. Band 1 values range from 0-100 (probability scaled by 100). Band 2 values represent the standard deviation of predicted probability of an individual pixel burning in a large fire, and values also range from 0-100 (standard deviation scaled by 100). Band 3 values indicate the quality of MODIS predictor variables. Multiple MODIS products were used as predictor variables to describe the vegetation and land surface immediately preceding a fire event. Only good quality pixels were retained for model training, but all pixels were retained when creating spatial predictions. Therefore, Band 3 indicates if one of these MODIS predictors had unreliable quality, where0 = All MODIS pixels were processed and good quality and 1 = At least one MODIS pixel was not processed or had bad quality. No Data values in each image are set to 255. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

T2  - TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drawing on A Way of Being Free (1997) and A Time for New Dreams (2011) among other Okrian texts, this article is a discussion of the notion of redreaming ways of seeing through intuitive creativity. The argument is divided into three parts: the role of intuitive creativity; redreaming ways of seeing in The Landscapes Within (1981); and intuition or "the landscapes within". The deployment of John Berger's Ways of Seeing and Roland Barthes's Image, Music, Text posits an Afro-Western worldview in which the title of Okri's second novel effectively becomes a simulacrum for the lead character's psyche that supplants character per se, so that the "landscapes within"-the psyche-becomes the eponymous hero of the tale. The contention is that the complex inner workings of the mind of the artist-protagonist, Omovo, is both the signifier and the signified. This is supported by analyses of an Okri poem and extracts from the novel. I argue that, in contrast to its inter-art variants, Rene Magritte's 1935 Le faux miroir and La clef des songes, the novel invokes a neo-Platonic/Coleridgean concept of the "enlightening" eye as a correlative of Okri's notion of the inward visionary quest of the dreaming "soul" "opening towards infinity". The article concludes by briefly justifying the article's claim that, in this novel, art deals with inner reality, with "the landscapes within".

AB  - The work deals with the development and implementation of a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) platform for coastal environmental risk analysis through the integration of multisource satellite data (Sentinel-1 and 2 and COSMOSkyMed) coupled with open source coastal hydrodynamic model addressed to flooding, erosion and pollution. The processing results allow us to cope with longshore pollutant dynamics connected to bathing use, to derive the shoreline changes and back-dune vegetation mapping, rocky coast movements detection as well as coastal area changes derived through advanced images segmentation techniques, multi-band change-detection and Persistent Scattered Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar technologies (PSInSAR). The SDSS provides cyclical production and updating in phase with satellite data acquisition frequency of the coastal scenarios for flooding risk analysis. All of these issues well enable operative products to be employed in the knowledge chain for sustainable coastal area planning activities. Moreover, self-consistent applicative tools, provided with proper graphical interface developed in IDL and integrated in SDSS, lead displaying and automatic extraction of the coastline sequence from Sentinel-1 data. Thus the comparison of two or more shorelines, even if multi-sources, provides the computation of coastal erosion and aggradation as well as the areas prone to coastal flooding. Finally, some interoperable tools for morpho-hydrodynamic modelling assimilation have been developed and implemented to reproduce flooding and pollution risk scenarios as well as coastal resilience assessment at different return time.

TI  - Transformative Learning in Medical Education: Context Matters, a South Australian Longitudinal Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSFORMATIVE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This longitudinal study followed the clinical learning journey of 20 medical students over 4 years, from the beginning of their clinical immersion, through one of the three different clinical placement models: block rotation, longitudinal integrated clerkship, or community- and hospital-integrated learning, and then into Year 4 and the intern year postgraduation. This study explored how these different contexts can influence the process of transformative learning. The results identified six well-defined changes to their ways of seeing the world which participants described as insights shaped by their clinical training. These themes were self-awareness, patient centeredness, systems thinking, self-care, clinical skepticism, and understanding diversity. Further analysis explored how changes in worldview can be instrumental, communicative, and emancipatory. This study demonstrates that context matters and that longitudinal models of clinical education may facilitate emancipatory learning.

TI  - Rumor Has It: The Adoption of Unverified Information in Conflict Zones
T2  - Harvard Dataverse
M3  - Data study
C8  - 1
AB  - Rumors run rife in areas affected by political instability and conflict. Their adoption plays a key role in igniting many forms of violence, including riots, ethnic conflict, genocide, and war. While unverified at the time of transmission, some rumors are widely treated as truth, while others are dismissed as implausible or false. What factors lead individuals to embrace rumors and other forms of unverified information? This article presents a new theoretical framework for understanding individual receptivity to rumors and tests it using original survey data gathered in insurgency-affected areas of Thailand and the Philippines. We find wide variation in rumor adoption, and argue that three factors drive individuals to embrace rumors: worldview, threat perception, and prior exposure. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find no evidence that commonly cited factorsincluding education, income, age, and genderdetermine individual receptivity to rumors. We also explore the implications of belief in rumors on conflict dynamics. We find that greater receptivity to rumors correlates with the belief that ongoing conflict is intractable. This suggests that rumors can not only help spark political violence, but also impede its resolution. Our findings shed light on the complex interaction between worldview and unverified information in shaping popular beliefsand through them, political contention and competitionin conflict areas and beyond.

TI  - "<i>THROUGH THE LANGUAGE A CHILD</i>'<i>S CONSCIOUSNESS IS REVEALED</i> ...": CORRELATION BETWEEN VERBAL AND "OBJECTIVE" CODES IN CHIDREN'S WORLDVIEWS
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article characterizes the formation peculiarities of a child's language consciousness in preschool ontogeny. This period is the main one for the development of language creativity. The article develops the idea of F. Buslaev about the role of the communicative and nominative competences in mastering the "objective" (extralinguistic reality) and "verbal" (language conceptualization of the world) language codes. In the given key, the researcher analyzes the mechanisms of linguo-creative thinking, which manifests itself in children's reflection on the form and content of linguistic signs at the stage of self-mastering the language. Factors that motivate children for creativity are: the desire to compress the meaning in a single word; to follow the "law" of language symmetry; to fill in the nominative gaps; to clarify the motivation of words and phrases. Particular attention is paid to the ability of children to understand and simulate the game code (during the assimilation of the usual metaphorical analogy in the genre of the brainteaser). The analysis is in complete agreement with the statement of F. Buslaev about the prohibition of formal language training, which destroys the "original" sense of the language in a child. As a promising field, the article postulates the need for introduction of special verbal creativity trainings in the learning process.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Conference on Word, Utterance, Text - Cognitive, Pragmatic and Cultural Aspects (WUT)
CL  - Chelyabinsk State Univ, RUSSIA
AB  - The paper analyses the impact of the factor of trust on the structure of media discourse. The study is based on the texts published in the German newspaper "Die Zeit". The chosen texts reflect public, political and media agenda of the present days. In the analysis, trust is interpreted as both a cognitive and discursive phenomenon, because it influences conceptualization of knowledge about the world in the process of media text generation and perception. It also plays a significant role in the choice of particular discourse strategies and selecting ways of achieving specific cognitive and communicative aims.The notion of trust as a cognitive factor can partially explain why fake news has become so effective in the modern mass media discourse. The texts of fake news are constructed in such a way that the recipient trusts them and the media source until the content of the messages and evolving view of the situation are in compliance with the worldview already existing in the recipient's mind The explanatory force of the phenomenon under discussion can be related not only to media discourse, but to other formats of discourse as well.

AB  - Past and current EO (Earth Observation) satellite missions have gathered huge amount of data during the past decades. This offers the opportunity to retrieve significant information concerning the evolution of land cover for almost any point of interest (POI) on Earth's surface. This paper presents the evolution of land cover in the administrative area of Bucharest, Romania, over a time span of 33 years. In order to achieve this goal we use data acquired by multiple EO missions such as: Landsat 5 TM (Thematic Mapper), 7 ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus), 8 OLI/TIRS (Operational Land Imager/Thermal InfraRed Sensor) and Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi-Spectral Instrument). We compute several spectral indexes in order to obtain information regarding the surface coverage evolution for categories such as vegetation, water bodies and build up.

AB  - The Operational Landsat Imager (OLI) stray light performance was tested in 2010 in Ball's stray light test facility. After the launch of OLI in 2013, measurements of on-orbit stray light performance confirmed the excellent pre-launch results. Ball is currently building OLI-2 for launch in 2020 and stray light testing was performed on the instrument in March 2018. This paper compares these measurements to OLI stray light test results and shows how they provide high confidence that OLI-2 will also provide excellent on-orbit stray light performance. Stray light performance of the two near identical builds is quite similar. This demonstrates the consistency of the assembly process and the repeatability of the testing performed in the Ball stray light test facility.

Experiments on Sentinel-2 MS and Sentinel-1 SAR data confirm that our extended SAR-Opt-cGAN model utilizes the auxiliary SAR information to better reconstruct MS images than an equivalent model which uses the same architecture but only single-sensor MS data as input.

AB  - Non-linear effects in hyperspectral data are the result of varying illumination conditions, angular dependencies of reflection, shadows and multiple scattering of incident light. Common classification algorithms like Spectral Angular Mapper (SAM) and Adaptive Coherence Estimator (ACE) struggle to produce good results under these conditions. In this paper, we evaluate our fast Semi-supervised Invertible Manifold Alignment, introduced in [1], on multiple commonly available hyperspectral remote sensing data sets. Additionally, we test it on our new benchmark data set for multi-temporal analysis. We show that linear SAM classification on SIMA-transformed data is superior to linear classification on the original data in all cases. Also, SIMA-transformation with subsequent SAM classification produces comparable results to a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM), with the benefit of maintaining physical interpretability of the transformed data.

AB  - The Earth's surface is covered with 72% water. This fact alone emphasizes the importance of proper monitoring and regulation of maritime activities. This monitoring can be useful in an array of applications including illegal transitions, rescue operations, territory regulation among many other applications. In order to achieve the task of "Maritime Surveillance" or simply the marine object detection, we need a structured approach combined with a set of algorithms. The objective of this paper is to study an emerging open source tool-Search for Unidentified Maritime Objects (SUMO) developed for the detection of ships which work regardless of weather conditions and coverage limits. Based on the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, this paper aims to process the satellite-borne data provided by the Sentinel-1 satellite. Proposed by the Joint Research Centre, SUMO is a pixel-based algorithm which follows a structured approach in order to identify marine objects and remove false alarms. It is observed that many of the false alarms are caused due to the presence of land. These are reduced by using the buffered coastlines referred to as land masks. A local threshold is calculated using the background clutter for the generation of false alarm rate and the pixels above this threshold are identified and clustered to form targets. A reliability value is computed for the elimination of azimuth ambiguities. Also, various attributes of the detected targets are calculated in order to give an accurate description of ships and its characteristics. With the SAR data being freely available due to the open data policy of the EU's Copernicus program, it has never been more viable to employ new methods for marine object detection and this paper explores this possibility by analyzing the results obtained. Specifically, the employed data consists of Sentinel-1 fine dual-pol acquisitions over the coastal regions of India.

AB  - Research concerning agricultural drought issue mainly focuses on the methods based on long-term atmospheric data, temperature, precipitation and evaporation measurements. On the other hand, the scientific bibliography shows the possibilities of using spectral data for description the state of plants. The general availability and increasing resolution of the spectral and temporal data create a chance for monitoring and forecasting deficiencies of soil moisture based on spectral images. Paper presents the results of analysis of the moisture conditions in soil-plant environment in the lowland catchment area using the spectral data obtained from the Sentinel-2 European Space Agency satellite for period February-November 2016. These spectral data were used for the calculation the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) which provided information about moisture conditions in the soil-plant environment. Then, the values of NDVI index were compared with the data obtained from the field investigations. The analyses have showed the spatial and temporal variability of moisture conditions in the soil-plant environment determined on the background of the spectral indicators and the existence of some dependences between climatic and spectral indicators characterizing soil-plant environment.

AB  - Deep convolution neural networks (DCNN) have been successfully introduced in the field of Polarimetric SAR image classification. However, the commonly used DCNN will classify each pixel in the image and neglect the fact that neighboring pixels may have similar intensity. Besides, the fixed size input in DCNN cannot be well adopted in remote sensing image which includes a great deal of different-scale information. Thus, superpixel segmentation (SS) and the input pyramid are introduced in this paper to improve the performance of DCNN. The former will guide the DCNN to classify superpixel instead of single pixel and the latter will include different-scale information around the pixel. Experiments carried out on two scenes of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 POLSAR images demonstrate that the introduced technic can help DCNN achieve good accuracy and smooth boundary adherence with highly efficiency.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The negative impact of rapid urbanization in developing countries has led to a deterioration of urban and regional air quality. Much attention has been given to the impact of fine particulate pollution on urban public health. However, very little attention has been given to its impact on the regional ecosystem such as the agricultural ecosystem. Thus, we evaluate the direct impact of air pollution on the reduction of wheat photosynthesis by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution in the world's most heavily polluted area, the North China Plain, using remote sensing observations and ground measurements. We found the following to be true: (1) Heavy PM2.5 pollution could significantly reduce wheat photosynthesis and cause an expositional relationship between the PM2.5 concentration and wheat photosynthesis (R-2=0.9824, P<0.05); (2) Heavy PM2.5 pollution makes up 2% for the reduction in wheat photosynthesis at all wheat-plant farmlands in the North China Plain, approximately covering an area of 354,400km(2); (3) Increasing heavy PM2.5 pollution significantly reduced wheat photosynthesis by 87% in wheat-planted farmland during 1999-2011. We hope the results presented here could draw attention to the effect of PM2.5 pollution on the agricultural ecosystem and encourage further studies to evaluate the feedback of atmospheric pollution on the agricultural ecosystem using remote sensing.Abbreviation: Northern China Plain (NCP); normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); fine particulate matter (PM2.5)

AB  - Water pollution is an important problem around the world as it is closely related to human and environmental health. Field campaigns are expensive, time consuming and may provide little information. Remote sensing provides synoptic spatio-temporal views and can lead to a better understanding of lake ecology. In this work an extreme algal bloom event which occurred in a reservoir is characterized by LANDSAT8-OLI sensor and in situ sampling. Chlorophyll-a concentration and algae abundance data are measured on samples collected simultaneously with satellite pass and used to build semiempirical models. Two linear functions to calculate chlorophyll-a from satellite data are presented and compared. A linear model from band 2 (blue) and band 5 (NIR) presents the best performance with a determination coefficient equal to 0,89. In situ and satellite chlorophyll-a lead comparable trophic class assessment, hypertrophic. Both Models fail to predict chlorophyll-a concentration near river intrusion (North), where low values of reflectance are recorded.

AB  - In this study we present results of linear volume depolarization ratio profiles obtained by a depolarization lidar in operation in Natal, Brazil. The DUSTER system has 4 channels, namely: 1064, 532 sip and 355 nm. This system is calibrated with a half-wave plate using the 490 methodology. The data obtained from this system is correlated with AERONET sunphotometer data, and, when available, CALIPSO satellite data. In addition a trajectory model (HYSPLIT) is used to calculate backward trajectories to assess the origin of the dust polluted air parcels. The objective is to create a transport database of Saharan dust.

TI  - Asymptotic Behavior of the Fractional Heston Model
T2  - SIAM JOURNAL ON FINANCIAL MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We consider the fractional Heston model originally proposed by Comte, Coutin, and Renault [Ann. Finance, 8 (2012), pp. 337-378]. Inspired by recent groundbreaking work on rough volatility [E. Alas, J. Leon, and J. Vives, Finance Stoch., 11 (2007), pp. 571-589; C. Bayer, P. K. Friz, and J. Gatheral, quant. Finance, 16 (2016), pp. 887-904; M. Fukasawa, Finance Stoch., 15 (2011), pp. 635-654; J. Gatheral, T. Jaisson, and M. Rosenbaum, quant. Finance, to appear], which showed that models with volatility driven by fractional Brownian motion with short memory allow for better calibration of the volatility surface and more robust estimation of time series of historical volatility, we provide a characterization of the short- and long-maturity asymptotics of the implied volatility smile. Our analysis reveals that the short-memory property precisely provides a jump-type behavior of the smile for short maturities, thereby fixing the well-known standard inability of classical stochastic volatility models to fit the short-end of the volatility smile.

AB  - Optical and electronic cross-talk effects are present in the Terra MODIS sensor. Those effects are reviewed and the physical (engineering) characteristics that give rise to the effects are described when they are known. The potential for performance degradation also is assessed for each effect. The long-term consequence of these effects is to give rise to Terra MODIS to Aqua MODIS performance trend differences and researchers are cautioned to use care in interpretation of these trend differences as potential diurnal environmental effects.

AB  - FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Array) are an attractive technology for high-speed data processing in space missions due to their unbeatable flexibility and best performance-to-power ratio in comparison to software. However FPGAs suffer from 3 major drawbacks: (1) higher programming effort is required with respect to software; (2) hardware resources need to be allocated for each implemented function in contrast to software functions which can be executed on the same processing hardware; and (3) FPGAs are required to adopt radiation hardening techniques when deployed in a space environment. This paper presents a reconfigurable platform that demonstrates how modern FPGAs can be considered as computing resources like any other, suitable for emerging spatial applications and not subjected to the above-mentioned drawbacks. In particular, we show that large FPGAs can be split in different regions containing concurrently-running accelerators which can support the execution of a single or multiple applications. Then, in the same way as software-based multiprogrammed and multithreaded systems can dynamically create, schedule and execute threads, FPGA-based accelerators can be swapped in and out according to scheduling needs by exploiting their dynamic partial reconfiguration capability. A proof of concept cloud detection algorithm for Sentinel-2 multispectral images has been implemented and tested on our platform to validate the system's design principles and performance.

TI  - Flood hazard of major river segments, Benevento Province, Southern Italy
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - On 15 October 2015, a storm-induced flood hit the central sector of Benevento Province (southern Italy) causing two deaths and severe damage to infrastructure, buildings and local agriculture. This area has a long history of similar events and since 1924 its major river segments have been monitored with several hydrometric stations. We used data from two of these stations and a LiDAR derived high-resolution topography to develop a flood hazard map. For map computation, we first derived a flood inundation map from topography. Subsequently we estimated the probability of exceedance of each specific fluvial stage from the combination of a Generalized Extreme Value and a Gamma fits of available hydrometric data. As boundary condition, we considered a reference scenario corresponding to an estimated 500 year flood. The hazard maps provide an overview of the flood hazard in the central sector of Benevento Province and floodplains zonation in flood perspective.

TI  - Calibration and validation of the Australian fractional cover product for MODIS collection 6
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional cover of photosynthetic vegetation (F-PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (F-NPV) and bare soil (F-BS) is an important input for assessment of the productivity of global pastures and rangelands. Here we describe the updating of this product using the new Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) Collection 6 reflectance product (C6) and a major expansion of the field calibration database. Fractional cover based on the C6 input exhibited reduced bias and root mean square error compared with the Collection 5 (C5) product. The expanded calibration database with more sites in arid areas provided greater separation between reflectance values of end-members for F-NPV and F-BS. Specific site variations in F-NPV and F-BS in arid areas could be traced to small but consistent changes in blue and green band, and occasional changes in short wave infrared reflectance in C6 when compared to C5. The recalibration described here provides an Australian fractional cover product with reduced uncertainty and improves the basis for a prototype global product for use in modelling of rangeland and pasture productivity.

TI  - Analytical study of land surface temperature with NDVI and NDBI using Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS data in Florence and Naples city, Italy
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study focuses on determining the relationship of estimated land surface temperature (LST) with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) for Florence and Naples cities in Italy using Landsat 8 data. The study also classifies different land use/land cover LU-LC) types using NDVI and NDBI threshold values, iterative self-organizing data analysis technique and maximum likelihood classifier, and analyses the relationship built by LST with the built-up area and bare land. Urban thermal field variance index was applied to determine the thermal and ecological comfort level of the city. Several urban heat islands (UHIs) were extracted as the most heated zones within the city boundaries due to increasing anthropogenic activities. The difference between the mean LST of UHI and non-UHI is 3.15 degrees C and 3.31 degrees C, respectively, for Florence and Naples. LST build a strong correlation with NDVI (negative) and NDBI (positive) for both the cities as a whole, especially for the non-UHIs. But, the strength of correlation becomes much weaker within the UHIs. Moreover, most of the UHIs (85.21% in Naples and 76.62% in Florence) are developed within the built-up area or bare land and are demarcated as an ecologically stressed zone.

TI  - Missing forest cover gains in boreal forests explained
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A recent global study reported a net difference between areas of forest cover loss and of forest cover gain of about 3.6% of total forest area across the boreal biome, and of 5.6% for Canada, over a 12-yr period. Net losses of this magnitude should be of concern given the importance of this biome in global biogeochemical cycles linked to climate change. Our analysis for Canada fails to support these results and suggests that post-harvest recovery of tree cover is generally strong, while post-fire recovery of tree cover is weaker but nevertheless prevalent. We find that current large area remote sensing methodologies can fail to properly recognize post-disturbance recovery from non-forest to forest status in low-productivity boreal forests when using short time series. With climate change and human impacts intensifying around the world, it is urgently important to be able to reliably distinguish temporary forest cover loss followed by naturally slow recovery from forest decline requiring policy action. The analysis was in large part based on the new Canada Landsat Disturbance product in which fires and harvest since 1984 are mapped at 30-m resolution (https://doi.org/10.23687/add1346b-f632-4eb9-a83d-a662b38655ad).

TI  - Permutation and Grouping Methods for Sharpening Gaussian Process Approximations
T2  - TECHNOMETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vecchia's approximate likelihood for Gaussian process parameters depends on how the observations are ordered, which has been cited as a deficiency. This article takes the alternative standpoint that the ordering can be tuned to sharpen the approximations. Indeed, the first part of the article includes a systematic study of how ordering affects the accuracy of Vecchia's approximation. We demonstrate the surprising result that random orderings can give dramatically sharper approximations than default coordinate-based orderings. Additional ordering schemes are described and analyzed numerically, including orderings capable of improving on random orderings. The second contribution of this article is a new automatic method for grouping calculations of components of the approximation. The grouping methods simultaneously improve approximation accuracy and reduce computational burden. In common settings, reordering combined with grouping reduces Kullback-Leibler divergence from the target model by more than a factor of 60 compared to ungrouped approximations with default ordering. The claims are supported by theory and numerical results with comparisons to other approximations, including tapered covariances and stochastic partial differential equations. Computational details are provided, including the use of the approximations for prediction and conditional simulation. An application to space-time satellite data is presented.

AB  - Dynamics, distribution and quality of water has a direct impact on environment and its dependent human activities. Regular monitoring of these hydrological processes help in understanding water cycle and better management policy making. Recent increase in remote sensing satellites offer multiple observations with high spatial and temporal resolution, thus calling for extensive use of high end computational resources. Google Earth Engine(GEE) is an open Application Programing Interface (API), which offers free computational resources and satellite data on cloud computational platform minimising the users need for computational resources and data availability. Five year Landsat-8 imagery (2013-18) from GEE database has been used to study the surface water extent of large inland water bodies (surface area greater than 6000ha) of India. We have used a pixel based classification system to delineate water and non-water pixels. A knowledge based Decision Tree (DT) model has been employed to cluster the classes according to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) distribution. We report an anomalous departure from the 5-year trend line suggesting that the maximum decrease of water extent was found in year 2015-2016. Analysis of the decay pattern of reservoirs can provide timely inputs for better policy making and management of water resources. To understand the decay pattern, a Modified Gaussian model fit on time series of surface extent helps to determine maximum water extent, peak extent day and storage cycle of the water body.

TI  - A new approach to evaluate the MODIS annual NPP product (MOD17A3) using forest field data from Turkey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present the first evaluation of the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) annual net primary production (NPP) for Turkey's forest ecosystems using field measurements. Due to lack of country scale field measurements (i.e. flux tower for forest ecosystems), tree DBH (diameter at breast height) data set provided by Ministry of Forest and Water Affairs (MFWA) of Turkey is used to calculate NPP of Turkey's forest ecosystems. The lack of a reliable NPP data set leads the researchers to use global NPP models such as MODIS annual NPP product. The MODIS MOD17A3 product of vegetation NPP is one of the most highly used data sources for studies of global carbon cycle. However, it is still necessary to test its predictions in multiple biomes, especially for heterogeneous areas in terms of its accuracy and potential bias. Here, we studied a new approach to evaluate coarse scale NPP estimates from the MODIS NPP-MOD17A3 data product, using 2008-2013 field measurements of tree growth throughout Turkey. Three different methods were used to calculate field NPP, including standardized growth coefficients (ministry coefficients [MC]), growth coefficients from North America (Jenkins coefficients [JC]), and annual expected increment (AEI). The average NPP values for all the country is calculated as 2.06kgC m(-1)/5years (0.412kgC m(-2)year(-1)) (SD=1.15kgC m(-1)/5years) from MOD17A3, 0.90kgC m(-1)/5years (0.18kgC m(-2)year(-1)) (SD=0.57kgC m(-1)/5years) with MC, 0.63kgC m(-1)/5years (0.126kgC m(-2)year(-1)) (SD=0.37kgC m(-1)/5years) with JC and 0.58kgC m(-2)year(-1) (SD=0.29kgC m(-1)/5years) with AEI for the studied plots. We found that the MODIS NPP product has a clear relation with both the NPP estimates obtained by using MC (R-2=0.34, root mean square error (RMSE)=1.51kgC m(-1)/5years) and JC (R-2=0.32, RMSE=1.73kgC m(-1)/5years). In addition to that, the relation between MOD17A3 product and AEI-derived NPP is relatively strong (R-2=0.48, RMSE=0.26kgC m(-2)year(-1)). We discuss possible reasons for these trade-offs among different methods. This study lays out a new approach to validate coarse scale MODIS product using field data directly, including for highly heterogeneous areas.

TI  - Effect of landcover/land-use changes on water availability in and around Ruti Dam in Nyazvidzi catchment, Zimbabwe
T2  - WATER SA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to quantify the upstream land-use and landcover changes and assess their effect on Ruti Dam levels and water availability in Nyazvidzi catchment. Remote-sensing techniques, hydrologic modelling and statistical inference were applied. Spatial landcover dynamics were derived from Landsat satellite data for the years 1984, 1990, 1993, 1996, 2003, 2008, and 2013 using the maximum likelihood classification technique. Results showed that forests and shrubs decreased by 36% between 1984 and 2013 whilst cultivated areas increased by 13% over the same period. The HEC-HMS rainfall-runoff model was used to simulate steamflow for the Nyazvidzi catchment, Zimbabwe. For the calibration period (2000-2001), a satisfactory Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) model peformance of 0.71 and relative volume error (RVE) of 10% were obtained. Model validation (1995-1997) gave a NSE of 0.61 and RV E of 12%. We applied the Mann-Kendall trend test to assess for monotonic trends in runoff over the study period and the results showed that there were significant decreases in observed runoff at Station E140 (monthly time scale) and at Stations E62 and E140 (seasonal time scale). Results showed that the wet season (Nov-Feb) had higher mean water balance values with an excess runoff of 8.12 mm/month. The dry season (April-Sept) had lower mean water balance values, with the lowest at 0.04 mm/month. Strong positive relationships (r(2)) between dam levels and land-use changes were obtained as follows: bare (0.95), cultivation (0.76) and forests (0.98). The relationship between runoff generated and land-use changes was found to be relatively weaker (0.54 for forests, 0.51 for bare and 0.14 for cultivation). Findings of this study underscore the relevance of applying hydrological models, remote sensing and statistical inference in quantifying and detecting environmental changes, as well as how they affect the availability and the quality of water resources in space and time.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International-Association-of-Hydrological-Sciences Scientific Assembly
CL  - Port Elizabeth, SOUTH AFRICA
AB  - We investigate the impacts of land cover changes on the river flows of the Middle Zambezi tributary catchments in Zimbabwe. Trend analysis on rainfall and streamflow was carried out using the Mann-Kendall test at monthly and annual time steps. Rainfall analysis indicated an increasing trend which was not statistically significant (p < 0.05) for all stations. Annual streamflow time series indicated negative decreasing trends which were not statistically significant (p < 0.05) except for the rainfall months of November and December. The study deduced that the changes in rainfall did not affect hydrological catchment behaviour and changes in streamflow were thus caused by anthropogenic factors such as land cover changes. Statistical tests indicated a weak but significant correlation between rainfall and streamflow which also supports the fact that changes in streamflow are mainly driven by land cover changes. Land cover change assessments were done through supervised classification of Landsat images for the years 1989, 1998, 2008 and 2014. All catchments exhibited increases in cultivation area and decreases in forest and grassland. The semi-distributed HBV-Light model was applied for change detection modelling of the gauged Musengezi catchment. We conclude that the HBV Light model can be successfully used to simulate flows for the catchment.

TI  - Monitoring of Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Rabi Rice Fallows in South Asia Using Remote Sensing
T2  - GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGIES IN LAND RESOURCES MAPPING, MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Cereals and grain legumes are the most important part of human diet and nutrition. The expansion of grain legumes with improved productivity to cater the growing population's nutritional security is of prime importance and need of the hour. Rice fallows are best niche areas with residual moisture to grow short-duration legumes, thereby achieving intensification. Identifying suitable areas for grain legumes and cereal grains is important in this region. In this context, the goal of this study was to map fallow lands followed by rainy season (kharif) rice cultivation or post-rainy (rabi) fallows in rice-growing environments between 2005 and 2015 using temporal moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data applying spectral matching techniques. This study was conducted in South Asia where different rice ecosystems exist. MODIS 16 day normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at 250 m spatial resolution and season-wise-intensive ground survey data were used to map rice systems and the fallows thereafter (rabi fallows) in South Asia. The rice maps were validated with independent ground survey data and compared with available subnational-level statistics. Overall accuracy and kappa coefficient estimated for rice classes were 81.5% and 0.79%, respectively, with ground survey data. The derived physical rice area and irrigated areas were highly correlated with the subnational statistics with R-2 values of 94% at the district level for the years 2005-2006 and 2015-2016. Results clearly show that rice fallow areas increased from 2005 to 2015. The results show spatial distribution of rice fallows in South Asia, which are identified as target domains for sustainable intensification of short-duration grain legumes, fixing the soil nitrogen and increasing incomes of small-holder farmers.

TI  - Mapping cropland fallow areas in myanmar to scale up sustainable intensification of pulse crops in the farming system
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland fallows are the next best-bet for intensification and extensification, leading to increased food production and adding to the nutritional basket. The agronomical suitability of these lands can decide the extent of usage of these lands. Myanmar's agricultural land (over 13.8 Mha) has the potential to expand by another 50% into additional fallow areas. These areas may be used to grow short-duration pulses, which are economically important and nutritionally rich, and constitute the diets of millions of people as well as provide an important source of livestock feed throughout Asia. Intensifying rice fallows will not only improve the productivity of the land but also increase the income of the smallholder farmers. The enhanced cultivation of pulses will help improve nutritional security in Myanmar and also help conserve natural resources and reduce environmental degradation. The objectives of this study was to use remote sensing methods to identify croplands in Myanmar and cropland fallow areas in two important agro-ecological regions, delta and coastal region and the dry zone. The study used moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m, 16-day normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maximum value composite (MVC), and land surface water index (LSWI) for one 1year (1 June 2012-31 May 2013) along with seasonal field-plot level information and spectral matching techniques to derive croplands versus cropland fallows for each of the three seasons: the monsoon period between June and October; winter period between November and February; and summer period between March and May. The study showed that Myanmar had total net cropland area (TNCA) of 13.8 Mha. Cropland fallows during the monsoon season account for a meagre 2.4% of TNCA. However, in the winter season, 56.5% of TNCA (or 7.8 Mha) were classified as cropland fallows and during the summer season, 82.7% of TNCA (11.4 Mha) were cropland fallows. The producer's accuracy of the cropland fallow class varied between 92 and 98% (errors of omission of 2 to 8%) and user's accuracy varied between 82 and 92% (errors of commission of 8 to 18%) for winter and summer, respectively. Overall, the study estimated 19.2 Mha cropland fallows from the two major seasons (winter and summer). Out of this, 10.08 Mha has sufficient moisture (either from rainfall or stored soil water content) to grow short-season pulse crops. This potential with an estimated income of US$ 300 per hectare, if exploited sustainably, is estimated to bring an additional net income of about US$ 1.5 billion to Myanmar per year if at least half (5.04 Mha) of the total cropland fallows (10.08 Mha) is covered with short season pulses.

AB  - In agricultural production, generally the remote sensing techniques have begun to be used on follow-up of plant development in a widespread manner. Images taken from satellite, airplane and unmanned aerial vehicles provide facilities for the spatial follow-up of the plant's development in the field. For determination of the plant intensity and species, NDVI values is calculated as vegetation index by using images taken in the red and near infrared wavelength reflecting from the plants. In this study, it was aimed to determine the spatial and temporal change of NDVI values in Pehlivan wheat variety planted in farm of Agricultural Faculty, Uludag University during 2015-2016 production period. Landsat 8 images taken at different dates were used in the study. As a result of the plot-based evaluation, the vegetation index values in the parcel did not show a homogeneous distribution.

AB  - In recent years, the number of deaths caused by cancer diseases are quite high when compared to other diseases. Early diagnosis of cancer and its associated diseases is crucial in terms of treating the disease. With the development of imaging devices, it has become possible to image, track, and treat patients with the computer assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems. Especially with high-resolution scanners, it is possible to detect automatically the tumoral regions in tissues and organs by CAD based systems. In this study, convolutional neural networks (CNN), one of the deep learning methods, were applied to the data set consists of images for the detection of the metastasis regions in sentinel lymph nodes prepared by Radboud University Medical Center and University Medical Center Utrecht. According to the result, it was observed that the applied CNN model had 99.15% accuracy in detection of tumor regions. In addition, the classification performance of the proposed CNN model in 2000 images which were included in the training data set was 95%. When the proposed CNN model is analyzed in terms of time, it can be seen that the training phase is very slow. However, the prediction of the proposed model is very fast after the model is created.

TI  - Are patients and physicians willing to accept less-radical procedures for cervical cancer?
T2  - Journal of Gynecologic Oncology
M3  - research-article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the opinions of women who underwent surgery for cervical cancer (CC) and physicians who treat CC about the acceptability of increased oncological risk after less-radical surgery.METHODS: One hundred eighty-two women who underwent surgery for CC and 101 physicians participated in a structured survey in 3 tertiary cancer centers in Czech Republic and Turkey. Patients and physicians were asked whether they would accept any additional oncological risks, which would be attributable to the omission of parametrectomy (radical hysterectomy/trachelectomy vs. simple hysterectomy/trachelectomy) or pelvic lymph node dissection (systematic resection vs. sentinel lymph node sampling).RESULTS: Although 52.2% of patients reported morbidity related to their previous treatment, the majority of patients would not accept less-radical surgical treatment if it was associated with any increased risk of recurrence (50%-55%, no risk; 17%-24%, risk <0.1%). Physicians tended to accept a significantly higher risk than patients in the Czech Republic, but not in Turkey. Patients with higher education levels, more advanced-stage of disease, or adverse events related to previous cancer treatment, and patients who received adjuvant therapy were significantly more likely to accept an increased oncological risk.CONCLUSION: Patients, even if they suffered from morbidity related to previous CC treatment, do not want to choose between oncological safety and a better quality of life. Physicians tend to accept the higher oncological risk associated with less-radical surgical procedures, but attitudes differ regionally. Professionals should be aware of this tendency when counselling the patients before less-radical surgery.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the suitability of Landsat ETM+ and QuickBird digital number values and various vegetation indices for predicting some structural parameters of forests in western Turkey. The empirical relationships between the structural parameters such as stand volume, basal area, tree density and quadratic mean diameter, and Landsat ETM+ and QuickBird satellite images were estimated using stepwise multiple regression analysis. Results indicated weak relationships between forest structural parameters and Landsat ETM+ images. The adjusted R-2 values of the regression analysis using the spectral digital number values for stand volume, basal area, tree density and quadratic mean diameter were found to be 0.37, 0.32, 0.44 and 0.25, respectively. Based on the vegetation indices, the adjusted R-2 values of the regression analysis were attained as 0.36, 0.34, 0.28 and 0.17, respectively. However, the results demonstrated moderate relationships between the forest structural parameters and the QuickBird satellite image. The adjusted R2 values from the regression analysis using the digital number values for stand volume, basal area, tree density and quadratic mean diameter were found as 0.57, 0.45, 0.29 and 0.30, respectively. Depending on the vegetation indices, the adjusted R-2 values from the regression analysis were obtained as 0.54, 0.41, 0.41 and 0.44, respectively. When the results from Landsat ETM+ and QuickBird satellite images are compared with each other, it could be stated that the QuickBird satellite images provide better representation of structural parameters of forests.

AB  - With the wide application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in remote sensing, the magnitude of the images obtained by UAVs has increased dramatically. How to manage and utilize those massive images effectively is challenging work. In order to provide a basic platform for agricultural analysis, this study aims to develop a systematical framework for efficient storage and web-based interactive display of UAV remote sensing data. In the framework, we deal with the massive tile-data with high performance clusters based on distributed storage and then establish an effective cache mechanism. Meanwhile, Node.js is used to develop the system's backend, as its event-driven asynchronous IO model is beneficial to concurrence. Additionally, based on the rich-client technology, the application services such as dynamic combination of multi-spectral images are completed in the browser to relieve the pressure of the server. This framework is easy to migrate to the cloud platform, which shows advantages of high storage efficiency, short data query time, strong scalability, and high concurrency performance.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although Earth's surface parameters obtained from satellite data have become more and more precise, it is still difficult to guarantee temporal consistency and spatial continuity for large-scale geoscience phenomena. Developing new Earth observation platforms is a feasible way to improve the consistency and continuity of such data. As the planet's only natural satellite, the Moon has special advantages as a platform for observing Earth, including long lifetime, whole disk view, tectonic stability and unique perspective. After presenting the observation geometry constructed by using the ephemeris, this paper mainly discusses the characteristics of a lunar platform and the proper Moon-based sensors, as well as the scientific objectives of Moon-based Earth observation. Solid Earth dynamics, the energy budget of Earth, Earth's environmental elements and the Earth-space environment are four potential applications analysed in this paper.

TI  - Assessing Global Ocean Wind Energy Resources Using Multiple Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind energy, as a vital renewable energy source, also plays a significant role in reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change. It is therefore of utmost necessity to evaluate ocean wind energy resources for electricity generation and environmental management. Ocean wind distribution around the globe can be obtained from satellite observations to compensate for limited in situ measurements. However, previous studies have largely ignored uncertainties in ocean wind energy resources assessment with multiple satellite data. It is against this background that the current study compares mean wind speeds (MWS) and wind power densities (WPD) retrieved from scatterometers (QuikSCAT, ASCAT) and radiometers (WindSAT) and their different combinations with National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy measurements at heights of 10 m and 100 m (wind turbine hub height) above sea level. Our results show an improvement in the accuracy of wind resources estimation with the use of multiple satellite observations. This has implications for the acquisition of reliable data on ocean wind energy in support of management policies.

TI  - Exploring improvement of impervious surface estimation at national scale through integration of nighttime light and Proba-V data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Directly mapping impervious surface area (ISA) at national and global scales using nighttime light data is a challenge due to the complexity of land surface components and the impacts of unbalanced economic conditions. Previous research mainly used the coarse spatial resolution Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP OLS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data for ISA mapping; the improved spatial resolution and data quality in the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite's Day/Night Band (VIIRS DNB) and in Proba-V data provide a new opportunity to accurately map ISA distribution at the national scale, which has not been explored yet. This research aimed to develop a new index - modified impervious surface index (MISI) - based on VIIRS DNB and Proba-V data to improve ISA estimation and to compare the results with those from the combination of VIIRS DNB and MODIS NDVI data. Landsat data were used to develop ISA data for the typical sites for use as reference data. Regression analysis was used to establish the ISA estimation model in which the dependent variable was from the Landsat data and the independent variable was from the MISI, as well as the previously used Large-scale Impervious Surface Index (LISI). The results indicate that the major error is from the very small or very large proportion of ISA in a unit; improvement of spatial resolution through use of higher spatial resolution nighttime light data (e.g., VIIRS DNB) or NDVI (e.g., Proba-V NDVI) data is an effective approach to improve ISA estimation. Although different indices for the combination of nighttime light and NDVI data have been used, the MISI is especially valuable for reducing the estimation errors for the regions with a small or large ISA proportion.

TI  - Using VIIRS-DNB and landsat data for impervious surface area mapping in an arid/semiarid region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping impervious surface area (ISA) in arid/semiarid regions is of great importance because of the vulnerable ecological situation there. However, using remote sensing data for ISA mapping in arid/semiarid landscapes is still very difficult because of the complexities of ISA, such as bare soils, impervious surface areas, and sparse vegetation cover. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite with Day/Night Band (VIIRS-DNB) carried by the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership, focusing on earth nighttime light, provides novel ways to map urban information, but is still little used in ISA mapping. In this paper, we explore a new index based on VIIRS-DNB data called the improved impervious surface index (IISI). We use a linear regression model for fractional ISA estimation in an arid/semiarid urban region, and the IISI was used as an independent variable. Reference ISAs from selected sites were mapped from Landsat images and were used as a dependent variable in this model. The results indicate that the IISI-based model provides good estimation with coefficient of determination (R-2)of 0.70, much greater accuracy than that using normalized VIIRS-DNB data. This method is very valuable for fractional ISA mapping in an arid/semiarid region.

TI  - Survival benefits of pelvic lymphadenectomy versus pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy in patients with endometrial cancer A meta-analysis
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Despite that pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy (PPaLND) is recommended as part of accurate surgical staging by International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) in endometrial cancer, the impact of para-aortic lymphadenectomy on survival remains controversial. The aim of this work is to evaluate the survival benefits or risks in endometrial cancer patients who underwent surgical staging with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy using meta-analysis.Methods: Literature search was undertaken using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant articles published between January 1, 1990, and January 1, 2017, without language restriction. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS); progression-free survival (PFS)/recurrence-free survival (RFS)/disease-free survival (DFS)/disease-related survival (DRS) was also analyzed. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted to investigate the source of heterogeneity. Quality assessments were performed by Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS). Publication bias was evaluated by using Begg and Egger tests. The hazard ratio (HR) was pooled with random-effects or fixed-effects model as appropriate.Results: Eight studies with a total of 2793 patients were included. OS was significantly longer in PPaLND group than in pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLND) group for patients with endometrial cancer [HR 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.84, P < .001, I-2 = 12.2%]. Subgroup analysis by recurrence risk explored the same association in patients at intermediate- or high-risk (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.39-0.69, P < .001, I-2 = 41.4%), but not for low-risk patients (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.21-1.08, P = .077, I-2 = 0). PPaLND with systematic resection of all para-aortic nodes up to renal vein also improved PFS/RFS/DFS/DRS, compared with PLND (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.37-0.72, P < .001, I-2 = 0). No publication bias was observed among included studies.Conclusion: PPaLND is associated with favorable survival outcomes in endometrial cancer patients with intermediate- or high-risk of recurrence compared with PLND, particularly with regards to OS. PPaLND with systematic resection of all para-aortic nodes up to renal vein also improve PFS compared with PLND. Further large-scale randomized clinical trials are required to validate our findings.

AB  - Generating rice variety distribution maps with remote sensing image time series provides meaningful information for intelligent management of rice farms and precise budgeting of irrigation water. However, as different rice varieties share highly similar spectral/temporal patterns, distinguishing one variety from another is highly challenging. In this study, a deep convolutional neural network (deep CNN) is constructed in both spectral and time domains. The purpose is to learn the fine features of each rice variety in terms of its spectral reflectance characteristics and growing phenology, which is a new attempt aiming for agriculture intelligence. An experiment was conducted at a major rice planting area in southwest New South Wales, Australia, during the 2016-17 rice growing season. Based on a ground reference map of rice variety distribution, more than one million labelled samples were collected. Five rice varieties currently grown in the study area are investigated and they are Reiziq, Sherpa, Topaz, YRM 70, and Langi. A time series of multi-temporal remote sensing images recorded by the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on-board the Sentinel-2A satellite was used as inputs. These images covered the entire rice growing season from November 2016 to May 2017. Experimental results showed that a good overall accuracy of 92.87 % was achieved with the proposed approach, outperforming a standard support vector machine classifier that produced an accuracy of 57.49 %. The Sherpa variety showed the highest producer's accuracy (98.46 %), while the highest user's accuracy was observed for the Reiziq variety (97.93 %). The results obtained with the proposed deep CNN learning provide the prospect of applying remote sensing image time series for rice variety mapping in an operational context in future.

TI  - Genetic algorithm-tuned adaptive pruning SVDD method for HRRP-based radar target recognition
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel machine learning method named adaptive pruning support vector data description (APSVDD) is developed to classify the FFT-magnitude feature of complex high-resolution range profile (HRRP), motivated by the problem of radar automatic target recognition (RATR). The APSVDD method not only inherits the advantage of least square support vector machine (LSSVM) model, which owns low computational complexity with linear equality constraints so that it is convenient to prune the boundary of SVDD dynamically and rapidly, but also overcomes the shortcoming of ability to deal with outliers in SVDD so that it can enclose targets and exclude outliers simultaneously. Genetic algorithm (GA) tunes the pruning direction of 'shear' dynamically, reducing the empirical risk. And fuzzy membership contributes to decision of classes for multiclass fuzzy areas. Besides, similar to the LSSVM, the distribution information within classes is found by least square method and applied for adjusting the pruning depth of 'shear' in APSVDD. Hence, there will be a remarkable improvement in recognition accuracy and generalization performance. Numerical experiments based on two publicly UCI datasets and remotely sensed data of four aircrafts can demonstrate the feasibility, repeatability and superiority of the proposed method. The APSVDD is ideal for HRRP-based radar target recognition.

TI  - A new index for mapping the "blue steel tile' roof dominated industrial zone from Landsat imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrialization is criticized for posing environmental concerns despite its contribution to local economic growth and modern urbanization. Accurately mapping industrial zones is a necessity for the strategic planning of modern industrialization. Unfortunately, industrial zones mapping by remotely sensed imagery over large areas remains methodologically challenging, as the spectral and texture features of industrial zones resemble those of other man-made surfaces. To fill the gap, this paper presents the first attempt at industrial zones mapping through identifying the blue steel tile'-roofed buildings (BSTBs). Specifically, we develop a BSTB index (BSTBI) for extracting the BSTBs in Landsat images. The new index combines the BSTB feature of V-shaped valley' over visible-near infrared reflection (NIR) span and the most separable band of Landsat sensors (shortwave infrared-2 band). Through the experiments conducted in Linyi city, China, the new index is demonstrated a good performance in detecting BSTBs with an overall accuracy larger than 85% and Kappa coefficient over 0.75 under the support of atmospherically corrected Landsat data.

T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the fundamental steps toward malaria control is the use of antimalarial drugs. The success of antimalarial treatment can be affected by the presence of drug-resistant populations of Plasmodium falciparum. To assess resistance, we used molecular methods to examine 351 P. falciparum isolates collected from 4 sentinel sites in Mozambique for K13, pfmdr1, pfcrt, and pfdhps polymorphisms and for plasmepsin2 (pfpm2) and pfmdr1 copy numbers. We found multiple copies of pfpm2 in 1.1% of isolates. All isolates carried K13 wild-type alleles (3D7-like), except 4 novel polymorphisms (Leu619Leu, Phe656Ile, Val666Val, Gly690Gly). Prevalence of isolates with pfcrt mutant (K76T) allele was low (2.3%). Prevalence of isolates with pfdhps mutant alleles (A437G and K540E) was > 80%, indicating persistence of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine resistance; however, markers of artemisinin were absent, and markers of piperaquine resistance were low. Piperaquine resistance isolates may spread in Mozambique as dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine drug pressure increases.

TI  - An index for discrimination of mangroves from non-mangroves using LANDSAT 8 OLI imagery
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last few decades several vegetation indices were used to map Mangrove forest using satellite images. Difficulty still persists in discrimination of mangroves from non-mangrove vegetation, especially in areas where mangrove species are mixed with other vegetation types.In the present study we have attempted to develop an improved index, which utilizes the information from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) of Bhitarkanika mangrove forest of Odisha, India. These indices are negatively correlated (r = -0.988; p<0.01). Further, the NDWI values were subtracted from the NDVI values at the pixel level. As the outputs are negatively related, subtraction increases the upper and lower range of the overall output, also increasing the distinct values of two classes with near-similar spectral signatures. Same algorithm was applied on mangroves of Sundarbans (r = -0.987) and Andaman (r = -0.989).A comparison between four established indices [NDVI, NDWI, Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Simple Ratio (SR)] and the newly developed index namely Combined Mangrove Recognition Index (CMRI) were performed. Accuracy assessment using Kappa statistics, revealing that CMRI produces better accuracy (73.43%) compared to other indices, followed by NDVI (56.29%) and SR (48.79%). (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Everlasting controversy between religious and atheist worldviews is breaking out again at the current post-secular stage of Russian society. The contest of religious and atheist values is tightly connected with present-day political, social and cultural contradictions and conflicts. Which are the possible position and role of science here that mainly determines the image of the present-day world?The author suggests one of the possible variants of analyzing relations, interactions and heuristic opportunities of religion, atheism and science as forms of social consciousness. Whether science is close to atheism by its nature and is it really opposing to religion as it is often viewed? What are the grounds of scientific and atheist worldviews being made close? Whether science can be not only an ally of atheism but organic continuation of religious ideas as well? How do scientific and anti-scientific social and cultural orientations correlate with religious and atheist worldviews? Whether atheism can be characterized as a more rational worldview compared to religious one? How can religious irrationalism be quite rational whereas atheistic rationalism akin, at first view, to science appears to be a fundamental logic contradiction?The presented article attempts to look at these matters from a new angle, to find possible answers and make clearer complicated problems of interaction of religion, atheism and science in humanity's spiritual culture.

TI  - Canopy temperatures distribution over soybean crop fields using satellite data in the Amazon biome frontier
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the studied time window, between 2003 and 2010, there was an important increase of land use conversion into new soybean areas (first-time-use) in Mato Grosso state (MT) in Brazil. Uncertainties of future scenario of Brazilian agriculture and increase in the frequency of extreme events, such as the occurrence of high temperatures, is highly likely to produce yield loss on summer crops. The MT is the largest producer of soybeans and accounted for 28.2% of the national production in 2013. The objective of this study was to investigated specific characterization of land surface temperature distribution over the soybean crop fields canopies (canopy-LST) due to massive land use conversion into new soybean areas and its impacts on yield. Satellite imagery data from Aqua and Terra/MODIS sensors (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) were compared to official agricultural statistics covering eight densely cultivated regions in the studied period. Results show that within the period from flowering to grain filling canopy-LST exhibits a non-negligible relation to yield. It is expected an additional loss of 4.9% on soybean yield for each 1 degrees C of canopy-LST above the obtained optimal level of canopy-LST with 28.4 degrees C, associated to the higher yield averages. The difference between overall average of canopy-LST and air temperature was found 4.2 degrees C.

TI  - Poor Richard Revised: Benjamin Franklin and the Ritual Economy of Copyright in Colonial America
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Benjamin Franklin was the most prolific and profitable author in colonial America. Work on the history of intellectual property has increasingly identified Franklin as a central figure, particularly in the philosophical development of American copyright law. His understanding and use of what we now think of as intellectual property are potentially illustrative of its emerging theorization in the eighteenth century. Evidence of this can be found in his thoughts and actions regarding copyright and patent specifically, as well as related issues such as the attribution and development of ideas. Adapted from economic anthropology, the theory of ritual economy provides a framework through which to consider how Franklin's worldview materialized in everyday economic practices, including interactions with proto-intellectual property issues.

AB  - A methodology for deriving land-surface energy fluxes estimated with the use of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 observations is validated in a savannah landscape in central Spain. The fluxes are derived at two spatial resolution: fine (20 m) and coarse (around 1 km). At both resolutions the thermal observations from Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on Sentinel-3 and optical observations from Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2 are used within a Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) modelling scheme. For the fine resolution estimates, the thermal observations acquired by SLSTR at around 1 km resolution are sharpened using high-resolution (20 m) optical observations taken by MSI and a machine learning algorithm. The results indicate that it is possible to derive fluxes with similar accuracy at both spatial scales, while obtaining more detailed separation of fluxes originating from individual landscape features at the fine scale.

A 15 band data stack consisting of PALSAR L-band dual-polarised radar, Landsat optical data, as well as six variance texture measures extracted from the PALSAR images, was used in this study. Spectral signatures were obtained for each class for the divergence examination. The band having the highest separability was the Landsat visible red band followed by the two largest window PALSAR texture measures. The best three band combination included three very different data types, Landsat visible red, near infrared and the PALSAR HH variance texture from a 17 x 17 pixel window. There was no need based upon the divergence values to use more than five bands for classification.

AB  - Maori are the indigenous people of New Zealand, and kaupapa Maori research (KMR) methodology refers to a Maori way of doi ng research. We illustrate how this approach can enhance indigenous research. KMR methodology grew out of a history of Maori being 'researched' by non-Maori, largely for the self-interest of the researcher. An important approach of KMR is it encourages Maori researchers to engage indigenous communities/stakeholders to ground and embed the research being undertaken. Consequently, a study's research question might be driven by stakeholders, while still handing the research task to the researcher. Another focus of KMR is embracing Te Ao Maori (the Maori worldview). Using this KMR methodology, ten Maori stakeholders were engaged as they sought insights into Maori employee careers. Thematic analysis drew two Te Ao Maori factors potentially influencing career satisfaction: (1) whanau support, which referred to support from family and extended family, and (2) kaiarahi, which is when someone serves as a role model. This was then explored quantitatively on a sample of 414 Maori employees, across a broad range of occupations in New Zealand organisations. Findings showed whanau support and role model were significantly related to work-life balance, cultural wellbeing and career satisfaction. A two mediator model was supported (with bootstrapping), with whanau support influence being fully mediated by work-life balance, and role model partially mediated by cultural wellbeing. Both mediators predicted career satisfaction. The model accounts for a solid amount of variance (38%). The findings support the new additions towards understanding Maori career satisfaction.

She offers a skeptical worldview, in which humor plays the key role. This essay discusses her worldview critically. Her view of epistemology is limited, like her view of skepticism. In both cases, the Socratic practice of skeptical investigation of truth claims in dialogical encounters is ignored. Her project is seen as one of the contemporary attempts to restore philosopher’s lost key role in society.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 26th IAG General Assembly of the International-Union-of-Geodesy-and-Geophysics (IUGG) on Earth and Environmental Sciences for Future Generations
CL  - Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC
AB  - The Nakagawa lowland is located in the central part of the Kanto Plain; the largest plain in Japan. During the 1960s, major land subsidence occurred, exceeding 10 cm/year, as a result of over pumping of shallow and deep groundwaters in this area. In recent times, following the regulation of pumping by national and local governments, the amount of land subsidence in this area has decreased sharply. However, in the Nakagawa lowland, subsidence exceeding 1 cm/year is still ongoing in some areas, and is more pronounced during dry years in which the amount of groundwater use increases. In this study, we examined the local characteristics of land subsidence through persistent scatterer interferometry using ALOS/PALSAR data obtained from April 2006 to April 2011. On the basis of this analysis, we confirmed that subsidence was concentrated along the western margin of an incised buried valley, in which average displacement rates exceed 10 mm/year. The characteristics of this subsidence zone are suggestive of a geological structure that is buried beneath the alluvial plains, which is affected by groundwater pumping that targets the basal gravel layers of buried valley-fills. In addition, we detected a patched zone of around 0.3 km(2) in the study area, in which average displacement rates exceed 15 mm/year. We estimated that this zone was formed by consolidation settlement of soft ground as a result of residential landfill.

TI  - FROM PROMETHEUS TO KHALIFA ... HUMAN BEHAVIOUR OF THE EAST AND WEST
T2  - BILIMNAME
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to assess human behaviors, based on the information about the first human on Eastern and Western civilizations. This study, which is carried out without entering the theories of conflict between civilizations, basically emphasizes on the difference of the human conceptions of both civilizations. Since Western civilization originated in ancient Greece, Western type human prototype was discussed in terms of the information's given in Greek mythology. Prometheus myth was discussed in the context of mainly human but with handling side variants of God and women. As a human prototype of Eastern civilization, information's provided by Islam/Qur'an in the creation of human have been evaluated. The information given by both civilizations to human beings is seen to shape our present world in terms of God, human, universe, women, science, power etc.As Prometheus legend was evaluated in terms of the Western human prototype, firstly a brief myth/mythology description was made in this study. It is difficult to make a common definition about the myth that everybody will accept; but it is possible to say that mythology shapes the present world. Prometheus is a legend that continues its vitality in various fields from literature to sports and is interpreted in different forms. Prometheus is a titan, who take side of Zeus in war against Zeus and immortality was given to him because of this. This titan is the one who created the first human, shaped him like God, equipped him with various qualities and have taken the part of human always against cruel God. This was same also in the case of sacrifice, which should be shared fairly among the Gods and human. Prometheus deceived Zeus with his cunning and made sure that the nice parts of the meat were kept in the human. Zeus, who is angry about this event, has taken fire from people. Prometheus opposed this order of Zeus and brought fire to human. The worth of this event was punishment of Prometheus with chain and eaten of his liver every day by an eagle, and human was punished with Pandora. Pandora is the first woman who is ornamented by Goddess and a crate/box was given to her as a wedding gift. With the loss of her curiosity Pandora opened the box that she shouldn't, and all the evils spread to the earth. Human, who had not met with disaster until that time, has faced all evil with Pandora. This myth implies the connection between God and human, the steal of fire/knowledge, the spread of all the disasters on the earth with a woman's hand and reveals the human concept of the West. Revolt/rebellion against the Church/God, lifting the creative idea, seeing the means of dominion of knowledge and counting all the ways for it, loading the similarity/paradox of sin between Prometheus and Jesus, the value of the woman over the centuries and the striking resemblance of the image of Pandora-Eve.The information given by the Qur'an on the creation of human has been evaluated as the human imagination of the East. As expressed in various patterns of Qur'an, human is created from soil. The status of the human, who comes to the stage of existence with the soul blowing, was exalted by teaching Adam all names by God. Adam and Eve has done a crime that causes them to be removed from heaven; but this error has not turned into an accusative one in the Qur'an; common expression patterns are used. In addition, the expression of the human dignity because of this error was not used to mold. The two most important concepts that stand out in the human conception of the East are the servant and the khalifa. These two words, as evidenced by the connotations of the name, are totally religious-oriented, and the human being is the most important feature in the East. The servant and the khalifa expresses a lot in a world which is full of Prometheus and trying to break off ties with religion. These words not only determine the position of man in the universe, but also with the message they gave it tells us that human must never forget that there is a Creator and he/she has sense of responsibility for his actions. Before all things, human is a creature that is created by Allah. While he knows nothing, and his raw materials are so simple (soil/mud/slime/semen etc.), he became extraordinary with the given variety of limbs/talents, he was equipped with the authority and the universe has been subservient to him. However, the essential to these people is not to forget the fact that he doesn't own them, they are just the blessing of the Supreme Creator/Allah. Therefore, he must not rely on the special features that are found in him and heavenly self-mutuality to unnecessary pride as God.In light of this information's, it is possible to see how the worldview of these two civilizations is separated from each other. While the West is in an anthropocentric understanding, the East has a theocentric understanding and this difference is most determinant in the issues of God, human, women, universe, morality, power etc. Of course, there will be differences between a conscious awareness of ontological difference and a conscious awareness of an understanding of God as a competitor of people. There is a profound gap between the expectation of a savior who rescued man from eternal slavery with an understanding rebellion to God's and to undertake the responsibility of one's actions and give him freedom to provide space for action on earth. As a matter of fact, the reflections of the understanding of religion, which describes man and woman as a whole, is quite different with understanding of the man's suffered and punished with the woman's hand. With a God imagination that does not give people fire/knowledge and a Creator who teaches names to Adam, represents the opposite polarities, and the day-to-day repercussions are quite different when this is considered in the context of science ethics. As a result, these differences, in fact, emerged from the meanings of the sacred burden. While the West become human with violating the sacred, the East became human with the grace of God. While the human prototype of the West is a man who can rival with the Gods, who can fight, deceive, and ignore them, the human prototype of East is in aware of its servitude and it's the khalifa, the honor of all creatures. Therefore, while the West is struggling with all kinds of metaphysical values, the East is acting with the responsibilities given to him. After all, the mission of both is different; one of Prometheus, the other of the Khalifa ...

TI  - Role of Indocyanine Green in Fluorescence Imaging with Near-Infrared Light to Identify Sentinel Lymph Nodes, Lymphatic Vessels and Pathways Prior to Surgery - A Critical Evaluation of Options
T2  - GEBURTSHILFE UND FRAUENHEILKUNDE
M3  - Review
AB  - Modern surgical strategies aim to reduce trauma by using functional imaging to improve surgical outcomes. This reviews considers and evaluates the importance of the fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG) to visualize lymph nodes, lymphatic pathways and vessels and tissue borders in an interdisciplinary setting. The work is based on a selective search of the literature in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar and the authors own clinical experience. Because of its simple, radiation-free and uncomplicated application, ICG has become an important clinical indicator in recent years. In oncologic surgery ICG is used extensively to identify sentinel lymph nodes with promising results. In some studies, the detection rates with ICG have been better than the rates obtained with established procedures. When ICG is used for visualization and the quantification of tissue perfusion, it can lead to fewer cases of anastomotic insufficiency or transplant necrosis. The use of ICG for the imaging of organ borders, flap plasty borders and postoperative vascularization has also been scientifically evaluated. Combining the easily applied ICG dye with technical options for intraoperative and interventional visualization has the potential to create new functional imaging procedures which, in future, could expand or even replace existing established surgical techniques, particularly the techniques used for sentinel lymph node and anastomosis imaging.

TI  - A study on the drivers of canopy reflectance variability in a boreal forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The degree of which the observable canopy bidirectional reflectance factors (BRF) express plant trait variation at leaf and canopy scales is the fundamental physical basis underlying the use of optical remote sensing data for discriminating tree species and estimating forest biophysical variables. In this study, we quantified the relative contribution of variations in leaf optical properties (LOP), canopy structural properties, and understory reflectance, to canopy BRF variability in a boreal forest, at the spatial and spectral resolutions of Sentinel-2 (S2) Multi-Spectral Instrument. Our approach was based on physically-based forest reflectance model and global sensitivity analysis (SA) parameterized entirely with field measurements. Results showed LOP had dominant contribution to canopy BRF in shortwave infrared (SWIR) in multispecies forest areas, while canopy gap fraction in sensor's view direction (i.e. nadir) was consistently found as the main driver of canopy BRF in red. This implies the satellite-measured BRF in red is the most robust predictor of effective canopy cover (ECC), while BRF in SWIR are optimal for tree species classification based on interspecific differences in mean leaf traits.

AB  - Ecosystem productivity, biome distribution, and forest carbon stocks are likely to be changed by the climate change. These ecosystems changes can be identified using Satellite based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In this study, global inventory modeling and mapping studies (GIMMS) NDVI data acquired by the advanced very highresolution radiometer (AVHRR) was used for analyzing the trend over Turkey for the period 1982-2015. The acquired data has bi-monthly nature, and the maximum value of composite method was used for finding monthly NVDI. The obtained NDVI was then clipped to the study area, and then the trend was estimated using Annual aggregated time series (AAT) and seasonal adjusted time series (SAT) methods. In AAT method the annual averages were calculated and then the trend was estimated. In SAT, the seasonal component removed from the time series and the seasonal adjusted time series used for estimating the trend. The gradient latitudinal and longitudinal trend was also implemented to investigate the spatial trend. The gradient was calculated as the trend of the blocks of a specific latitude of longitude over the whole Turkey to have better interpretation of the spatial trend from south to north and east to west. The results showed that throughout Turkey the NDVI has an increasing and decreasing trend, but the increasing trend is dominant as 89.9% and 79.1% of the total area using AAT and SAT respectively are significant increasing trend. One the other hand, only 0.45% and 0.36% of the total area has significant decreasing trend using AAT and SAT respectively and the rest of the area has no significant trend. The seasonal adjusted method showed most of the no trend areas is distributed through the eastern part and the far western part of Turkey. The Annual aggregated trend showed similar pattern with largest no trend area centered in the far eastern part of Turkey. The gradient analysis showed decreasing in the magnitude of the positive NDVI trend when moving from the west to the east, and no specific pattern in the south north direction.

TI  - Relationships between the three components of air temperature and remotely sensed land surface temperature of agricultural areas in Morocco
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, correlations to derive minimum (T-min), mean (T-mean), and maximum (T-max) air temperatures from land surface temperature (T-s) in Morocco are studied. Land surface temperature was derived from 349 decadal cloud-free images acquired by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer sensor, onboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's satellites. T-s was first compared with T-min, T-mean, and T-max, at the level of nine meteorological stations between 1995 and 2012. This first step showed the existence of good linear correlations between T-s and air temperatures. The coefficient of determination, R-2, varied between 0.59 and 0.79 for T(s)versus T-min, between 0.60 and 0.76 for T(s)versus T-max, and between 0.67 and 0.79 for T(s)versus T-mean. The root mean square error (RMSE) varied between 2.4 degrees C and 3.9 degrees C for T(s)versus T-min, between 2.5 degrees C and 4.6 degrees C for T(s)versus T-max, and between 2.2 degrees C and 3.8 degrees C for T(s)versus T-mean. The mean absolute error (MAE) varied between 2 degrees C and 3.1 degrees C for T(s)versus T-min, between 1.9 degrees C and 3.6 degrees C for T(s)versus T-max, and between 1.8 degrees C and 3 degrees C for T(s)versus T-mean. Second, T-s was compared with T-min, T-max, and T-mean gridded at the level of agricultural areas of 46 provinces in Morocco. For 42 provinces, the mean value of R-2 was 0.71 for both T(min)versus T-s and T(max)versus T-s, and 0.76 for T(mean)versus T-s. The mean values of the RMSE and the MAE were 3.1 degrees C and 2.4 degrees C for T(s)versus T-min, 3.6 degrees C and 2.8 degrees C for T(max)versus T-s, and 3 degrees C and 2.3 degrees C for T(mean)versus T-s, respectively. Finally, the accuracy of the regression models between air and surface temperatures was tested using a k-fold cross-validation method that showed high stability of these models. The relationships obtained in this work could be very useful for further monitoring and modelling agriculture and meteorological parameters.

AB  - The study was conducted in three land cover conditions (secondary peat forest, shrub land, and palm plantation) that were burned in the Siak District, Riau Province, Indonesia year 2015. Measurement and calculation carbon emission from soil and vegetation of peatland should be done accurately to be implemented on climate change mitigation or greenhouse gases mitigation. The objective of the study was to estimate the carbon emission caused peatland fires in the Siak District, Riau Province, Indonesia year 2015. Estimated carbon emissions were performed using visual method and digital method. The visual method was a method that uses on-screen digitization assisted by hotspot data, the presence of smoke, and fire suppression data. The digital method was a method that uses the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) index. The estimated carbon emissions were calculated using the equation that was developed from IPCC 2006 in Verified Carbon Standard 2015. The results showed that the estimation of carbon emissions from fires from above the peat soil surface were higher than the carbon emissions from the peat soil. Carbon emissions above the peat soil surface of 1376.51 ton C/ha were obtained by visual method while 3984.33 ton C/ha were obtained by digital method. Peatland carbon emissions of 6.6 x 10(-4) ton C/ha were obtained by visual method, whereas 2.84 x 10(-3) ton C/ha was obtained by digital method. Visual method and digital method using remote sensing must be combined and developed in order to carbon emission values will be more accurate.

T2  - KSU TARIM VE DOGA DERGISI-KSU JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The multidimensional drought is primarily a meteorological origin. But human activities are also main concern for this scenario, especially in case of irrigation methods when agricultural crops require high amount of water in areas with low rainfall and high temperature. Beacause of this incresing water demand, primarily the groundwater level starts to decrease and hence agricultural drought occures. The Kavar depression in Iran which is the subject of this study also faces problems such as water shortage and the wrong selection of agricultural crop production. In order to determine the facts, the land use changes of the corresponding study area has been taken into account from 1975 to 2017. Different version of Landsat satellite images including Landsat 4, 5 and 8 have been processed by remote sensing techniquesto revealing the temporal variation of the area where the crop was produced by irrigation. However, based on the available rainfall and temperature data, water shortage has been calculated by using Thornthwaite Method. On the other hand, for nonparametric Mann-Kendall test correlation analyses, evaporation data has been used along with other climate data. In addition, water demand per hectare has also been collected for spcific crop of Kavar depression. As a continuation of the analysis based on the natural and artificial elements, finally the relation between the total water demand of irrigated agriculture field and the water potential of depression from 1975 has been found.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The main aim of the study was to assess land use land cover change detection (LULCC) from 1990 to 2016 in case of Gibe Sheleko National Park (GSNP), Southwestern Ethiopia.Methodology / approach. Multi-temporal Landsat images and topographic map were acquired in 2016. Field observation using GPS was carried out to generate the ground truth points for image classification and accuracy assessment from December 2016 to June 2017. A total 200 GPS points were purposively collected. The data were analysis by using ERDAS IMGINE 2010 and ArcGIS 10.3.1 software. Supervised classification was carried out to identify the overall land use land cover class.Results. Forest land was rapidly declined with average of 478.5 ha/year for the last 27 years. This revealed that over 66.8 % of forest was diminished from 1990 to 2016 due to anthropogenic factors in the study area. Bush & shrub land was upraised from 12600 ha (31.5 %) to 20600 ha (51.5 %) from 1990 to 2016. Grazing land and bare land was also showed an increment of 3500 ha and 2240 ha with average increment of 134.6 ha/year and 86.5 ha/year respectively from 1990 to 2016. This indicated as most forest land was changed in to bush & shrub land due to human induced factors. Hence, it brings negative effects on the wildlife conservation and socio-economic development.Originality / scientific novelty. This study is orginal research finding by employ above indicated methedology and stated the last 27 years land use land cover change of Gibe Sheleko National Park for fist time. It also discovered that the rate of land use land cover change in the study area for the past 27 years.Practical value / implications. The main results of the study of land cover change can be used to ensure planning to be sustainable and integrated management of the natural resources. Participatory management practice should be implemented in the study area to regenerate the changed land use type.

AB  - The Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2) will fly aboard the Landsat 9 spacecraft and leverages the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) design currently flying on Landsat 8. TIRS-2 will provide similar science data as TIRS, but is not a build to-print rebuild due to changes in requirements and improvements in absolute accuracy. The heritage TIRS design has been modified to reduce influence of stray light and to add redundancy for higher reliability over a longer mission life. The TIRS-2 development context differs from the TIRS scenario, adding to the changes. The TIRS-2 team has also learned some lessons along the way.

AB  - The improved spatio-temporal resolution of the C-band Sentinel 1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mission has increased the number of possibilities in soil moisture retrieval studies. In this paper, an ensemble learning method (Random Forest) was applied on a group of data acquired on a farm scale in New Zealand's hill country. A statistical model was fitted to predict volumetric soil moisture (theta(v), %) from radar data, the degree of vegetation coverage represented by NDVI and a number of landscape parameters. The model performance demonstrated that the algorithm was able to capture the non-linear relationship between the ground-based and remotely sensed variables..v predictions using a time series of radar images reached an average accuracy of 3% for RMSE and 0.86 for R-2. An extended version of the proposed method has the potential to be a basis of more accurate water balance simulations, applied in the hydrologically complex pastoral hill country.

AB  - today's sensors are like eyes in the sky, thanks to the growth of satellite remote sensing technologies. Therefore, we see a steady evolution of the usage of different types of sensor, from airborne and satellites platforms which are generating large quantities of remote sensing image for divers applications such as; smart city, disaster management, military intelligence and others. As a result, the rate of growth in the amount of data by satellite is increasing dramatically. The velocity has exceeded 1TB per day and it will certainly increase in the future. However, it becomes crucial for these huge volume data to be stored. So, how to store and manage it efficiently becomes a real challenge because traditional ways have intensive issues; they are expensive and difficult to extend. Therefore, we need some scalable and parallel models for remote sensing data storage and processing. In this paper, we describe a scalable and distributed architecture for massive remote sensing data storage based on three No SQL databases (Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, MongoBD). Also, a Hadoop-based framework is proposed to manage the big remote sensing data in a distributed and parallel manner.

TI  - Assessing WorldView-2 Satellite Imagery Accuracy for Bathymetry Mapping in Pahawang Island, Lampung, Indonesia

AB  - Bathymetry is one of a vital marine geospatial data which is required in many hydrographic analysis. The extent of remote sensing gives a possibility of advancement even onto bathymetry modeling. The visible electromagnetic spectrum gives different reflectance intensity in various sea depth due to attenuation processes. This peculiar spectral responses is then used as the basis of bathymetry modeling using satellite imagery. This paper's goal is to test the WorldView-2 ability for bathymetry mapping in Pahawang Island, Lampung, Indonesia. The WorldView-2 Image of Pahawang Island is corrected into top of atmospheric (ToA) reflectance. It is then being analyzed using bivariate statistic (linear, exponential, and polynomial regression) along with the tide-corrected sea depth data which is acquired from field survey using GPSMAP 840xs single beam in a sampling framework. We then perform a standard error method to determine the most effective result of bathymetry model by its accuracy value.

TI  - Performance analysis of LAPAN-A3 data acquisition using X-band receiver at Rancabungur ground station

AB  - As an experimental remote sensing microsatellite, LAPAN-A3/IPB satellite mission produces at least 10 GB payload data daily, mainly comes from multispectral imager payload with the addition of digital matrix imager, Automatic Identification System (AIS) and scientific earth magnetometer. To improve the satellite data reception capability, LAPAN had already installed dual X-band and S-band receiver on Rancabungur ground station. This research aims to analyze the performance of LAPAN-A3 payload data reception by using X-band receiver from Rancabungur ground station. The assessment consists of determining daily payload data transmission capability and realtime multispectral image acquisition performance, as well as distortion occurs on the received data caused by signal interferences. Based on the first four months of the X-band receiver operation, it is found that the receiver has similar data reception performance compare to the X-band receiver on Kongsberg ground station currently leased for LAPAN-A3 operation, i.e. receiving about 7 GB payload data in high elevation satellite pass. The X-band receiver could also receive realtime multispectral image acquisition when the satellite passes western part of Indonesia in the morning, producing up to 10 GB of multispectral image in single satellite pass. However, the data reception performance often degraded by signal interferences from ground station neighborhood, both quantitative and qualitatively. Based on these performances, a better LAPAN-A3 satellite mission planning can be developed and systematic interferences detection can be done based on the received data. This allows LAPAN-A3 satellite to produce more payload data with better quality.

TI  - Modeling plant composition as community continua in a forest landscape with LiDAR and hyperspectral remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In light of the need to operationalize the mapping of forest composition at landscape scales, this study uses multi-scale nested vegetation sampling in conjunction with LiDAR-hyperspectral remotely sensed data from the G-LiHT airborne sensor to map vascular plant compositional turnover in a compositionally and structurally complex North Carolina Piedmont forest. Reflecting a shift in emphasis from remotely sensing individual crowns to detecting aggregate optical-structural properties of forest stands, predictive maps reflect the composition of entire vascular plant communities, inclusive of those species smaller than the resolution of the remotely sensed imagery, intertwined with proximate taxa, or otherwise obscured from optical sensors by dense upper canopies. Stand-scale vascular plant composition is modeled as community continua: where discrete community-unit classes at different compositional resolutions provide interpretable context for continuous gradient maps that depict n-dimensional compositional complexity as a single, consistent RGB color combination. In total, derived remotely sensed predictors explain 71%, 54%, and 48% of the variation in the first three components of vascular plant composition, respectively. Among all remotely sensed environmental gradients, topography derived from LiDAR ground returns, forest structure estimated from LiDAR all returns, and morphological-biochemical traits determined from hyperspectral imagery each significantly correspond to the three primary axes of floristic composition in the study site. Results confirm the complementarity of LiDAR and hyperspectral sensors for modeling the environmental gradients constraining landscape turnover in vascular plant composition and hold promise for predictive mapping applications spanning local land management to global ecosystem modeling.

TI  - Characterizing multi-decadal, annual land cover change dynamics in Houston, TX based on automated classification of Landsat imagery
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - In 2017, Hurricane Harvey caused substantial loss of life and property in the swiftly urbanizing region of Houston, TX. Now in its wake, researchers are tasked with investigating how to plan for and mitigate the impact of similar events in the future, despite expectations of increased storm intensity and frequency as well as accelerating urbanization trends. Critical to this task is the development of automated workflows for producing accurate and consistent land cover maps of sufficiently fine spatio-temporal resolution over large areas and long timespans. In this study, we developed an innovative automated classification algorithm that overcomes some of the traditional trade-offs between fine spatio-temporal resolution and extent - to produce a multi-scene, 30m annual land cover time series characterizing 21years of land cover dynamics in the 35,000km2 Greater Houston area. The ensemble algorithm takes advantage of the synergistic value of employing all acceptable Landsat imagery in a given year, using aggregate votes from the posterior predictive distributions of multiple image composites to mitigate against misclassifications in any one image, and fill gaps due to missing and contaminated data, such as those from clouds and cloud shadows. The procedure is fully automated, combining adaptive signature generalization and spatio-temporal stabilization for consistency across sensors and scenes. The land cover time series is validated using independent, multi-temporal fine-resolution imagery, achieving crisp overall accuracies between 78-86% and fuzzy overall accuracies between 91-94%. Validated maps and corresponding areal cover estimates corroborate what census and economic data from the Greater Houston area likewise indicate: rapid growth from 1997-2017, demonstrated by the conversion of 2,040 km2 (400km2) to developed land cover, 14% of which resulted from the conversion of wetlands. Beyond its implications for urbanization trends in Greater Houston, this study demonstrates the potential for automated approaches to quantifying large extent, fine resolution land cover change, as well as the added value of temporally-dense time series for characterizing higher-order spatio-temporal dynamics of land cover, including periodicity, abrupt transitions, and time lags from underlying demographic and socio-economic trends.

M3  - research-article
AB  - I examine the concept of “xing shi(形勢),” roughly translated as “tactical disposition and energy,” elaborated mainly in The Art of War by Sun Tzu. We use the concept of xing shi quite often in the political world as well as in everyday life, though not established as an academic jargon. We may find rich meaning for politics and political science in xing shi as a strategic concept and a worldview.First, the strategic concept of xing shi can be understood as (1) a xing shi-centered way of thinking and (2) a strategic way of constructing and using xing shi. A xing shi-centered way of thinking includes (1) situation-centered thinking, (2) adaptation of strategies to varying situations, and (3) taking or constructing favorable xing shi prior to enemies or rivals. The essence of strategic way of constructing and using xing shi can be found in the strategies of “weak points and strong(虛實)” and “maneuvering(奇正).” Second, it is much needed to develop xing shi into an analytical concept, difficult though.It is difficult since the concept xing shi is relational and dynamic. Yet, I suggest Sun Tzu’s “five elements(五事)” which he emphasized in calcaulating the cahnces of winning, as the basic standard of evaluating xing shi. The five elements are: mission(道), climate(天), ground (地), leadership(將), and method(法). Understood this way, xing shi has many aspects similar to Gramsci’s concept of hegemony and the “actor-network” theory.

TI  - THE MEASURE OF ALL GODS: RELIGIOUS PARADIGMS OF THE ANTIQUITY AS ANTHROPOLOGICAL INVARIANTS
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of the article is the reconstruction of ancient Greek and ancient Roman models of religiosity as anthropological invariants that determine the patterns of thinking and being of subsequent eras. Theoretical basis. The author applied the statement of Protagoras that "Man is the measure of all things" to the reconstruction of the religious sphere of culture. I proceed from the fact that each historical community has a set of inherent ideas about the principles of reality, which found unique "universes of meanings". The historical space acquires anthropological properties that determine the specific mythology of the respective societies, as well as their spiritual successors. In particular, the religious models of ancient Greece and ancient Rome had a huge influence on formation of the worldview of the Christian civilization of the West. Originality. Multiplicity of the Olympic mythology contributed to the diversity of the expression forms of the Greek genius, which manifested itself in different fields of cultural activity, not reducible to political, philosophical or religious unity. The poverty of Roman mythology was compensated by a clear awareness of the unity of the community, which for all historical vicissitudes had always remained an unchanging ideal, and which was conceived as a reflection of the unity of the heavens. These two approaches to the divine predetermined the formation of two interacting, but conceptually different anthropological paradigms of Antiquity. Conclusions. Western concepts of divinity are invariants of two basic theological concepts - "Greek" (naturalism and paganism) and "Roman" (transcendentalism and henotheism). These are ideal types, so these two tendencies can co-exist in one society. The Roman trend continued to be realized by the anti-Roman religion, which took Roman forms and Roman name. Iconoclasm was a Byzantine version of the Reformation, promoted by the Isaurian emperors and failed due to the strong Hellenistic naturalistic lobby. Modern "Romans" are trying to get rid of the last elements of religious naturalism, and modern "Greeks" are trying to preserve the Hellenic elements in Christianity. Patterns can be transformed, but the observational view will still be able to identify their lineage. The developed model allows a deeper understanding of the culture of both ancient societies, as well as the outlook of Western man.

AB  - Data likelihood of fire detection is the probability of the observed detection outcome given the state of the fire spread model. We derive fire detection likelihood of satellite data as a function of the fire arrival time on the model grid. The data likelihood is constructed by a combination of the burn model, the logistic regression of the active fires detections, and the Gaussian distribution of the geolocation error. The use of the data likelihood is then demonstrated by an estimation of the ignition point of a wildland fire by the maximization of the likelihood of MODIS and VIIRS data over multiple possible ignition points.

AB  - Meltwater from snow that falls in the Catskill/Delaware watershed in the Catskill Mountains in south-central New York contributes to reservoirs that supply drinking water to approximately nine million people in and near New York City (NYC). Using the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) 4-km snow maps from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Ice Center, we identified and tracked 28 lake-effect (LE) storms that deposited snow in the Catskills (2004-2017). These storms, which generally originated from Lake Ontario, but sometimes from Lake Erie, represent an underestimate of the number of LE storms that contribute snowfall to the Catskills snowpack because snowstorms are not visible on IMS maps when they travel over already-snow-covered terrain. Using satellite, meteorological (including NEXRAD and National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Program), and reanalysis data, we identified conditions that contributed to the LE snowstorms and mapped snow-cover extent (SCE) following the storms. We show that LE snow makes an important contribution to the Catskills snowpack because of the frequency of events, even though the total amount of each event may, on average, be small. The IMS 4-km maps tend to overestimate SCE compared to MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Landsat snow maps. Climate change could impact LE storms and the distribution of rain versus snow in the Catskills, which may affect future reservoir operations in the NYC Water Supply System and winter recreation in the Catskills.

AB  - FireBIRD is a satellite constellation consisting of two small satellites, TET-1 and BIROS, specifically designed for high temperature events (HTE) and high temperature anomaly detection. This satellite mission of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), which is based on the heritage of the BIRD satellite, aims in detection and characterization of wild fires using thermal camera systems with one band in the mid wave (MWIR) and one band in the longwave-infrared (LWIR). In combination with a red band from the visible spectra, the bi-spectral method [1] is adapted for fire detection and analysis. Standard products contain information about fire size, fire radiative power and fire temperatures. With a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 170m, the spatial resolution is rather high compared to MODIS or Sentinel-3. Additionally, the high agility of the satellites allows image acquisitions on several consecutive days, useful to monitor the development of active fires. Ongoing improvements focus on a more accurate assessment of the background temperatures next to detected fires to improve the reliable results obtained so far.

AB  - Small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are a relatively new tool for collecting remote sensing data at dense spatial and temporal resolutions. This study aimed to develop a spectral measurement platform for deployment on a UAS for quantifying and delineating moisture zones within an agricultural landscape. A series of portable spectrometers covering ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths were instrumented using a Raspberry Pi embedded computer that was programmed to interface with the UAS autopilot for autonomous data acquisition. A second set of identical spectrometers were fitted with calibrated irradiance lenses to capture ambient light during data acquisition. Data were collected during the 2017 Great American Eclipse while observing a reflectance target to determine the ability to compensate for ambient light conditions. A calibration routine was developed that scaled raw reflectance data by sensor integration time and ambient light energy. The resulting calibrated reflectance exhibited a consistent spectral profile and average intensity across a wide range of ambient light conditions. Results indicated the potential for mitigating the effect of ambient light when passively measuring reflectance on a portable spectral measurement system. Future work will use multiple reflectance targets to test the ability to classify targets based on spectral signatures under a wide range of ambient light conditions.

AB  - This chapter examines the major global remotely sensed mangrove databases that have become accessible since the year 2000. By doing so, we summarize the significant methodological differences between each product and provide a best estimate of post-2000 mangrove cover at the global level. We then review remotely sensed mangrove area findings in-depth for all nations in the Western Hemisphere and Oceania with mangrove holdings in the top 20 nations globally and then summarize the findings for all nations in the Western Hemisphere and Oceania with mangrove holding in the top fifty nations globally. In addition to reporting the mangrove area quantified by each national remotely sensed database, we assess the temporal domain, the spatial resolution, the instruments used, the techniques applied, the validation performed, and the error statistics reported for each national mangrove estimate. We then compare the national remotely sensed mangrove area estimates provided with each other and with the global estimates for each nation and then arrive at a post-2000 best estimate of mangrove cover for each country. Next, we review the common remote sensing techniques and instruments used to map and monitor mangrove forests throughout this chapter. Finally, we assess the future requirements of the mangrove community considering what the remote sensing community can realistically deliver. We find that national remote sensing estimates of mangrove forest area align well with the global remotely sensed measures of mangrove forest area and can, in general, be used with confidence to manage and monitor mangrove forests.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 21st International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)
CL  - Cambridge, ENGLAND
AB  - This paper presents a Credal algorithm to perform land cover classification from a pair of optical and radar remote sensing images. SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) /optical multispectral information fusion is investigated in this study for making the joint classification. The approach consists of two main steps: 1) relevant features extraction applied to each sensor in order to model the sources of information and 2) a Kohonen map-based estimation of Basic Belief Assignments (BBA) dedicated to heterogeneous data. This framework deals with co-registered images and is able to handle complete optical data as well as optical data affected by missing value due to the presence of clouds and shadows during observation. A pair of SPOT-5 and RADARSAT-2 real images is used in the evaluation, and the proposed experiment in a farming area shows very promising results in terms of classification accuracy and missing optical data reconstruction when some data are hidden by clouds.

AB  - Shallow groundwater has a decisive impact on land surface temperature (LST) and soil moisture (SM). In the present paper relationship between shallow groundwater, SM and LST was studied. For this purpose, the groundwater level and soil moisture were measured in 59 and 39 locations respectively in the southwest of Iran, during June 2016, Simultaneous with the overpass of a Landsat 8 satellite from the study site. After necessary image processing the LST was retrieved from the Landsat image using the split window algorithm. Then relationship between retrieved LST and different field observation were studied. Results show that there is a significant relationship between the groundwater depth and SM with LST. These results indicate that shallow groundwater depth and soil moisture content could be estimated and mapped using the retrieved LST from the satellite imagery.

AB  - Researchers have found that the mixed pixels exist in complex geological conditions often lead to distortion of altered minerals' spectral curves, and the accuracy of altered mineral extract from remote sensing data was reduced. Fortunately, the nonlinear analysis is a feasible solution. In this paper, by analyzing the nonlinear characteristics of the geological anomalies, the Fractal Dimension Change Point Method (FDCPM) will be used to extract the altered minerals' threshold from multispectral image. The realization theory and access mechanism of the model are elaborated by an experiment with ASTER data in Xinjinchang and Laojinchang gold deposits. The results show that the findings produced by FDCPM are agreed with well with a mounting body of evidence from different perspectives. The extracting accuracy over 86% show that FDCPM is an effective extracting method for remote sensing alteration anomalies, and it could be used as an useful tool for mineral exploration in similar areas in Beishan mineralization belt in northwest China.

AB  - Were Western missionaries to Korea really orientalists? This article aims to shed a critical light on conventional interpretations on missionary practice and perception of the missionaries who have often accused of being “orientalists” and to highlight a new mode of missionary epistemology based on God’s incarnation beyond Orientalism. It has been widely argued that Western missionaries in late nineteenth and early twentieth century represented Korea and Koreans as inferior, savage, and heretical in terms of inherent ideologies of social evolutionary worldview, ethnocentrism, and western Christian superiority. However, this paper attempts to find out a hidden epistemology which enabled a few of the missionaries to contextualize and acculturate themselves into Korean culture with deep sympathy and to maintain a cooperative mission relationship with Koreans in an incarnational way. It particularly tries to trace some vestiges of American missionary Elisabeth J. Shepping (1880-1934) and to illuminate the characteristics of incarnational missions shown in her Korean life, such as identification with Korean conditions and life of sufferings, equal and cooperative partnership with Koreans, preferential concerns on the marginalized, and self-emptying (kenosis) attitudes toward them. This paper then relates Shepping’s mission and perception to a discourse on imperial mission and post-orientalism and interrogates what Christ’s way in mission means in perceiving Koreans as missional others. This discussion reconsiders traditional dualistic positions between missionaries and Koreans as well appeared in Us/Them nature of the framework of Orientalism. It seeks a more inclusive understanding of missional others and new relationships which leads to embrace one another in divine hospitality of incarnation.

AB  - This study documents the experience of an Asian woman faculty in the rural Mountain West as it relates to difficulties teaching predominantly White preservice teachers about the importance of diversity and social justice to prepare them adequately with skills and materials for their P-12 classrooms in a rapidly changing world. The current challenge has its origins in US history (the macro-level) and continues into the present (the micro-level) beyond the preservice teachers to include college of education colleagues and administrators, and community members. Using nexus analysis to reveal this larger picture, the hope is to develop actions to keep the problem from persisting into the future. This study is geography-specific in that not all rural areas are predominantly White, nor do they all share the same worldview. The results suggest that rural university communities remain predominantly White in their demographic makeup and crucial actors often hold fast to Whiteness and White ignorance. This is problematic - the need to transform and change is urgent in rural teacher education programs.

TI  - Monitoring rubber plantation distribution on Hainan Island using Landsat OLI imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rubber expansion has been widely explored at various scales due to its increasing environmental and socio-economic impact and the global demand for natural rubber products. However, accurate and up-to-date maps and large-scale monitoring of rubber plantation spatial distribution are not yet available. In this article, we developed a simple algorithm for rapidly and accurately mapping rubber plantations on Hainan Island, China, by combining survey samples and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data from 2014 in order to understand their spatial distribution. The results showed that rubber plantations are distinguishable from other land-cover types by band value changes, vegetation index changes, and phenological phase changes (defoliation and foliation) and can be accurately extracted from multi-temporal Landsat images using a decision tree method and Google Earth Engine. This method results in a high overall classification accuracy of 92.17% with a corresponding of 84.33%. Rubber plantations are concentrated in the northwest of Hainan Island and gradually decrease to the south and east. Most plantations are found in the 50-500-m elevation range, with few found outside this range. We believe that the proposed approach will have significant implications for mapping and monitoring rubber spatial distribution at regional scales.

AB  - Based on the Environmental Mitigation Satellite (HJ-1) data, this paper has carried on the remote sensing monitoring to change of the surrounding vegetation and water area of the Qingtu Lake since 2009. The result shows that the average area of water has increased by 3.59 square kilometres annually since the reappearance of the waters with the Qingtu Lake in 2010. The area of Qingtu Lake and surrounding vegetation cover has presented an average increase of 1.09 square kilometres per year. Since 2010, the precipitation of the Qingtu Lake and its surrounding area in Minqin county have a significant increase in the trend, the average increase rate of 6.0 mm/year. Compared to 2010 years ago, the average precipitation increased 36.4 mm. And it shows that the change of the Qingtu Lake underlying surface has a positive feedback effect to local heavy rainfall according to the comparative analysis of the precipitation observation in the surrounding weather station.

TI  - Wetland changes of China's largest freshwater lake and their linkage with the Three Gorges Dam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has led to significant inundation shrinkage and water level decrease in China's largest freshwater lake, Poyang Lake. However, little is known about the influence on the lake's wetland landscapes. Here, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations and a phenology-based decision tree approach, we present the spatial and temporal changes of the major wetland cover types from 2000 to 2014. Over the 15-year period, both total coverage of vegetation (Carex spp., Triarrhena lutarioriparia L. - Phragmites, sparse grass, and Zizania latifolia communities) and the area of each community (excluding floating aquatic macrophytes community or FAM) showed significantly increasing trends, with vegetation expanded towards the lake center. In contrast, the areas of water and mudflat have decreased significantly since the TGD impoundment, and they were mainly replaced by prominently expanded vegetated areas. The transition maps during 2000-2014 show that the vegetation community transitions occurred mainly from hydrophilic cover types to those adapted to dryer conditions. Despite the significant changes in wetland cover types, the most preferable water depth for each cover type remained stable before and after the TGD. In conclusion, the vegetation compositions are primarily controlled by water depth, indicating that the recent wetland changes can be directly linked to the TGD-induced hydrological regime-shift. These results provide a critical reference for local authorities to assess the potential influence of the newly proposed dam in this lake and to optimize its. future operations with respect to modulating water levels.

AB  - Cascadia Subduction Zone is a subduction zone elongated about 1000 km length. The remnants of Farallon plate subduct the North American plate and form this subduction area. One of Farallon plate remnants, i. e. Juan de Fuca plate, subducts dominantly the North American plate. We focused on the observation of three states, i. e. Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming. This research aims to determine the direction, the shape, and the initial coordinates of subduction in our study area. We obtained free air corrected gravity data from TOPEX. Then we visualized data to get contour map and found that Cascadia Subduction Zone has direction from west to east that can be proofed by increasing of gravity anomaly. The gravity anomaly ranges from -140 mGals until 320 mGals. We applied upward continuation and got the result that the subduction is elongated from north to south. Initial coordinate detail of subduction shown by SVD result. The subduction starts from coordinate 46.811 degrees Northern Hemisphere and Longitude of 123.436 degrees into 41.260 degrees Northern Hemisphere and longitude of - 123.204 degrees. This coordinate appropriate with the result of magnetotelluric research that shows a high resistivity. We can conclude that from gravity satellite data, we can visualize the contour map then take several steps to get details information of subduction.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Honolulu, HI
AB  - The CERES project utilizes geostationary-derived broadband measurements to infer the regional diurnal flux in between CERES instantaneous measurements to estimate the daily-averaged flux. The geostationary (GEO) imager radiances must be calibrated to the same reference to ensure spatial and temporal consistency of cloud properties and fluxes across the contiguous GEO domains. In order to place all of the GEO visible imagers on the same radiometric scale, the CERES project inter-calibrates the GEO imagers with Aqua-MODIS using multiple independent approaches. The primary inter-calibration approach relies on coincident, ray-matched GEO and MODIS radiance pairs over all-sky tropical ocean scenes (ATO). Another ray-matching approach was recently developed to take advantage of the visible spectral uniformity and near-Lambertian reflectance of deep convective clouds (DCC). The success of the DCC ray-matching (DCC-RM) approach has been demonstrated by comparing the calibration with the ATO ray-matching (ATORM) approach for the 0.65-mu m GEO and MODIS bands.Now that many of the recently launched GEO imagers have multiple reflective solar band channels, the DCC-RM algorithm is being modified to inter-calibrate those channels as well, especially for the SWIR bands. The spectral uniformity of the DCC over the SWIR bands is not uniform, given that the ice particle absorption is a function of wavelength. New Spectral Band Adjustment Factor (SBAF) strategies will need to be developed. DCC-RM is also well-suited to inter-calibrate historical near-broadband visible GEO imagers. DCC are spectrally flat across the visible spectrum, which reduces the SBAF uncertainty between two ray-matched sensors. Applying the DCC-RM technique on historical GEO imagers is challenging due to the coarser pixel and temporal resolution of the ISCCP B1U formatted dataset.The ATO-RM and DCC-RM calibration methods were applied to multiple visible bands on Himawari-8 using MODIS as the calibration reference. The Aqua-MODIS and Himawari-8 calibration difference was less than 0.4% for wavelengths less than 1 mu m and for the Terra-MODIS 0.65-mu m channel. Other channel combinations would need further examination to obtain consistent ATO and DCC gain results. The ATO-RM and DCC-RM calibration methods were also applied to GOES-8 in the ISCCP B1U format with NOAA-14 AVHRR as the calibration reference. The GOES-8 ATO and DCC calibration gain difference was within 0.15%. The agreement between ATO and DCC gains provides confidence in both methods.

TI  - Correcting MODIS aerosol optical depth products using a ridge regression model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is an important metric for the concentration of aerosols in the atmosphere. Dark target (DT) algorithm is a widely used physical model to retrieve AOD over land from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. However, due to the limitation of surface dark-target' in some regions and over certain surface types, it does not work very well. In this paper, we propose two hybrid frameworks based on ridge regression (RR) to improve the retrieval accuracy. They are serial and parallel approaches. In both frameworks, the DT algorithm is used as a baseline to derive an initial result, and the bias between the derived AOD and the ground-truth is corrected by the RR model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we apply them on 3093 collocated MODIS and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations, covering 10 stations at all available time in China. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed methods can improve retrieval performance compared to the corresponding DT algorithm and the RR model.

AB  - Malaria is epidemiologically a specific local infectious disease and can be studied spatially by taking into account the characteristics of malaria vector habitat. Padang Cermin Sub-District, District of Pesawaran, Lampung Province is one of the endemic areas of malaria which is geographically a coastal area dominated by water-flooded land use. That area supports the breeding and living place of Anopheles sp mosquitoes. The objectives of this study were mapping the malaria disease susceptibility area in Padang Cermin sub-district by using Landsat 8 imagery, identified the influence of physical environmental factors on the spread of malaria disease, and analyzed the spread of malaria disease based on environmental factors. The research method used scoring and overlay spatial analysis of spatial parameters supporting the breeding of malaria vector. Some parameters that can be extracted through Landsat 8 imagery for identification of malaria susceptibility, i.e. land use, soil texture, vegetation density with overall mapping accuracy of vegetation density, land use, and soil texture are 83.2%, 88.7%, and 83.7%, while other parameters resulted from spatial analysis of non-remote sensing data, i.e. temperature, rainfall, slope, altitude, and distance to river. These parameters are environmental factors that influence the spread of malaria disease. The results of the identification of malaria susceptibility showed that the areas with high levels of susceptibility are Sidodadi, Sukajaya Lempasing, Gebang, Padang Cermin, Hanau Berak, Way Urang, Tambangan, Hanura, Banjaran and Sanggi Village. This study showed that areas which are located on the coast are prone to malaria disease.

AB  - The water-food-energy nexus intimately binds food and energy production to water use. The largest fraction of today's water use is through food and energy production in agriculture. Water use in agriculture, however, is predominantly wasteful and not sustainable, due to over exploitation of scarce water resources on one hand and through inefficient use of water on the other. So far, no global monitoring system for efficiency and sustainability of agricultural water use exists. Both quantities thus are largely unknown especially on a global level. This leads to the limitation that efficiency and sustainability of water use cannot yet be incorporated in control mechanisms for virtual water flows in global food trade. New observational capacities (e.g. the COPERNICUS sensors) and model approaches can now be applied to bridge the gap between local and global scales by quantifying and investigating water flows in detail. This paper presents the outline, basic concept and first results of the ViWA-Initiative, where operational Earth Observation, physically-based growth modelling and economic trade modelling are combined to provide a continuous monitoring system for global virtual water flows in the agricultural commodity chain.

TI  - Potential risk posed by the importation of ticks into the UK on animals: records from the Tick Surveillance Scheme
T2  - VETERINARY RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to monitor important tick vectors in the UK, Public Health England's Tick Surveillance Scheme (TSS) receives specimens from across the country for identification. In recent years, an increasing number of these specimens have been removed from animals with a recent history of travel outside the UK. This paper presents all data collated by the TSS on ticks entering the country on recently travelled or imported animals since surveillance commenced in 2005. Ten different tick species representing six different genera were identified, entering the UK from 15 different countries. Key themes appear to be emerging from the last 10 years of data, including canine travel from Cyprus and Spain being associated with Rhipicephalus sanguineus importation, and canine travel from France being associated with the importation of multiple tick species and canine illness. In addition, more unusual importation routes have been uncovered, such as the importation of Hyalomma lusitanicum on a dog. Some companion animal owners may not be fully aware of the risks associated with ticks, and may not seek advice from a veterinarian before travel or importing a pet. Promoting awareness of ticks and tickborne disease risk during and after travel or animal importation is needed and veterinarians play an importation role in disseminating this information to their clients.

AB  - Rugged terrain complicates the BRDF modeling mainly by the modulation of sun-target-sensor geometry and shadowing effects. An improved kernel-driven BRDF model coupled with topography (KDCT) is put forward by combining the RTLSR model used in the algorithm for MODIS bidirectional reflectance anisotropies of land surface (AMBRALS) and the anisotropic reflectance model for rugged terrain (dESM). The improved model was compared with the original RTLSR model by using the simulated data based on the radiosity approach and the MODIS reflectance data. The validation results revealed that the improved KDCT model outperforms the RTLSR model without topographic consideration and can significantly improve the ability of the kernel-driven model to process the multi-angular reflectance measurements over rugged terrain.

AB  - This paper exposes new method of remote sensed imagery change detection based on the framework of Dempster-Shafer. The method is established on multi-temporal conflict analysis and interpretation,where it was used as a new index of change. In consequence, a pre-change card was produced from the multi-temporal conflict card between the two bi-temporal images and which was deduced from the empty-set mass. It is the proof that the Dempster-Shafer Theory can be applied in a new way for change detection where the conflict imperfection allows mining reliable and not trivial information about change. The effectiveness of the conflict for multi-temporal change mapping was demonstrated using bi-temporal Landsat imagery.

AB  - In this paper, we present a new method for automatic mass function estimation and focal elements selection as a fundamental step to apply the Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). The idea is to use the centroids and membership distributions obtained by applying the Fuzzy-C-Means algorithm (FCM) to define the mass function. The proposed method allows finding composite focal elements that represent the highest uncertainty and ambiguity. Experiments were conduced on multi-spectral and multi-temporal images for the purpose of change detection by integrating the proposed method of mass function estimation in a process of post-classification by DST. The proposed system of change detection is characterised by a multi-level of imperfection handling where the ambiguity is modelled firstly by FCM, then the uncertainty and the imprecision are handled in the step of mass function estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by applying it to find transformed region within two landsat images where we obtained high rates of classifications.

AB  - The distributed system based on agent entities is a system that is subjected to failures because of the complexity that characterizes the structure of each entity and to the various interactions between the different agents. Although, there are some approaches that deal with fault failure, there is still a need of models that objectively address the area of fault tolerance, especially when the existing approaches cover fault tolerance using traditional methods; these methods are based on the underlying operating system and communication. In this paper, we propose a model based on the sentinel approach to deal with conflict between agents, and integrates fault tolerance directly into the language representing the behavior of the agent. The model proposes three operating modes to better specify the behavior of the agents: normal mode, temporal tolerance mode and degraded mode. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Java Sea is one of the monsoon wind path blowing over Indonesia Seas. Belitung Island is located in the center of the monsoon path in the Java Sea. Although the topography Belitung Island relatively flat, the existence of mountainous with 200-300m height in the center of the Island may form the island wake during the strong wind event. Island wake phenomena in Belitung Island was investigated by using MODIS SST Lv3. From 2003 to 2016 period of observation, 245 cases of SST wake were found with the distribution for each season are 39, 35, 135 and 36 cases for NW monsoon, Transition I, SE monsoon and Transition II, respectively. The direction of SST wake depends on the direction of the surface wind. During NW monsoon and Transition I, the direction of SST wake is southeastwardly while during SE monsoon and Transition II is northwestwardly. The high Chl-a concentration outside the SST wake patch indicates that the occurrence of SST wake in the seas of Belitung Island may influence biological productivity in that area.

TI  - Sunglint correction of the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI)-SENTINEL-2 imagery over inland and sea waters from SWIR bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of inland and sea waters depends on the quality of the retrieval of the water-leaving radiance from the top-of-atmosphere measurements. The water-leaving radiance can be difficult to observe due to the reflection of direct sunlight on the air-water interface (sunglint) in the direction of the satellite field of view. The viewing geometry of Sentinel-2 satellite (European Space Agency) makes it vulnerable to sunglint contamination. In this paper, an original method is proposed to correct Sentinel-2-like imagery for sunglint contamination. The sunglint contribution is first estimated from the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) part of the spectrum and then extrapolated toward the near-infrared and visible bands. The spectral variation of the sunglint signal is thus revisited for a wide spectral range (from 350 to 2500 nm). The bidirectional reflectance distribution function related to the sunglint is shown to vary by > 28% from the SWIR to the blue bands of Sentinel-2. The application of the proposed algorithm on actual Sentinel-2 data demonstrates that sunglint patterns are satisfactorily removed over the entire images whatever the altitude of the observed target. Comparison with in situ data of water-leaving radiances (AERONET-OC) showed that our proposed algorithm significantly improves the correlation between satellite and in situ data by 55% (i.e., from R-2 = 0.56 to R-2 = 0.87). In addition, the discrepancies between satellite and in situ measurements are reduced by 60%. It is also shown that the aerosol data provided by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) can be safely used within the proposed algorithm to correct the Sentinel-2-like satellite data for both sunglint and atmospheric radiances. Improvements of the proposed method potentially rely on simultaneous retrievals of the aerosol optical properties. The proposed method is applicable to any satellite sensor which is able to measure in SWIR spectral bands over aquatic environments.

TI  - A cross-cultural exploration of 'wild' in wilderness therapy: Canada, Norway and Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVENTURE EDUCATION AND OUTDOOR LEARNING
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper addresses pluralistic understandings of wilderness in the context of wilderness therapy (WT). The term wilderness perpetuates a modern worldview of place that beyond civilisation' exists an environment defined by risk, fear and an unpredictable nature. WT utilises outdoor travel and living practices during therapeutic intervention and health promotion although empirical justification for its use of wilderness for therapy is not yet established. This paper provides three cultural perspectives on wild places in relation to WT. These national perspectives are informed by local practices, historical and societal understandings of wilderness and supported by related literature from Canada, Norway and Australia. The authors (1) illustrate a number of contemporary western assumptions about wilderness enshrined in the WT and outdoor adventure literature, (2) cautiously propose core purposes for using wild places for therapy and (3) encourage further development of WT practice and research within national, regional and even across organisational contexts.

T2  - AFKAR-JURNAL AKIDAH & PEMIKIRAN ISLAM-JOURNAL OF AQIDAH & ISLAMIC THOUGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the early 20th century the Muslim world, in particular, faced a great intellectual challenge which originated in the Western civilisation, i.e., the rise of Muslim intellectuals who adopted and promoted the secular-liberal ideas and values in the midst of Muslim societies. The decline of the Islamic civilisation followed by the colonialisation of Muslim countries, and the inferiority complex which accompanied it, had fostered this uncritical attitude towards Western thought and ideas. Some of these ideas are indeed good, benefecial and therefore acceptable throughout the world, however, some are harmful and destructive to the religion of Islam and the Muslim identity. This study attempts to explore and analyse the history and the complexities of liberalism as a philosophy and ideology, and to examine it from an Islamic point of view. It responds to the confusions and allegations raised by the protagonists of liberalism among Muslims. In order to grasp the correct understanding of liberalism and its implications upon Islamic faith and identity, a critical and analytical study is conducted to examine the ideas propagated by the thinkers and ideologues of liberalism. This study also explicates the views of Muslim scholars on these ideas and the proper attitude that Muslims must adopt to successfully face this intellectual challenge.

TI  - Axillary Web Syndrome in Breast Cancer: A Prevalent But Under-Recognized Postoperative Complication
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - The purpose of this review is to define axillary web syndrome (AWS) and describe its diagnosis and management. The following databases were searched through July 2017: PubMed, EMBASE (OvidSP), Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Search terms included 'axillary web syndrome', 'axillary cording', and 'lymphatic cording'. 49 articles were identified; 8 did not relate to breast cancer, and 3 were not in English. Of the remaining articles, the majority were case reports, case series, or descriptive reviews. 2 systematic reviews were located as well as 1 randomized trial, 6 prospective cohort studies, and 2 retrospective cohort studies. Although a common sequela after axillary surgery for breast cancer staging, AWS has been poorly described in the medical literature as to the underlying pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management. Interventions range from patient education and simple reassurance that the syndrome will resolve spontaneously to active physical or manual therapies to maintain upper extremity range-of-motion, especially adequate motion for undergoing radiation therapy. Oncologists, breast surgeons, family physicians, and oncology nurse practitioners that work with patients with breast cancer should educate them about this prevalent complication and inform them preoperatively about what to anticipate.

T2  - INLAND WATERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite data on chlorophyll alpha (Chl-alpha,mu g L-1) and cyanobacteria (Cyan, %) content in Hartbeespoort Dam (HBPD) and 6"control" reservoirs between 2002 and 2012 were compared to assess potential effects of a bioremediation project (HMaM) implemented on HBPD in 2008, Planktonic autotrophs showed clear but inconsistent seasonal periodicity in all 7 reservoirs. Neither average (+/- 95% confidence interval) values of Chl-alpha(172.1 +/- 33.3 vs. 189.0 +/- 40.3 mu g L-1) nor Cyan (45.1%+/- 8.6 vs. 45.0% +/- 9.0) differed significantly (p <= 0.05) in HBPD before and after HMaM, but differed (higher and/or lower) in 3 control systems. Across 3 timespans (overall, before 2008, and after 2008), Mann-Kendall tests for Chl-alpha and Cyan revealed mixed trends between and within reservoirs with similarly mixed trends in monthly anomaly values (ChlAnom and CyanAnom) that offset confounding effects of interannual variability. Chl-alpha and ChlAnom, however, declined consistently in all reservoirs after 2008, significantly so for Chl-alpha in HBPD and 2 controls, and for ChlAnom in HBPD and 5 controls. Although Cyan and CyanAnom trends varied, both were significantly negative in HBPD after 2008. Directionally concordant anomaly trends were provided by parallel 50th quantile regression analysis. Comparable declines in Chl-alpha and ChlAnom across all reservoirs preclude causal interpretation of the declines in HBPD as direct consequential effects of HMaM intervention alone, giving whole-lake support to published empirical evidence contesting the suitability of biomanipulation for eutrophic reservoir management in the region.

AB  - LAPAN A2 is the second-generation Indonesian micro satellite which designed and developed in Indonesia. This satellite was launched in September 2015 in India as piggy-back. Orbit of this satellite is circular and near equatorial with altitude approximately 650 km. This satellite carries digital payloads such as digital space camera, Automatic Identification System (AIS) for vessel traffic, and upgrade S-Band transmitter 3 Mbps. The digital payloads of LAPAN-A2 satellite data is downloaded in Rancabungur Ground Station, which is equipped with 11 meters antenna using S-Band frequency. The data generated from the satellite is in raw format. For ensuring this missions, it needs some hardware for receiving digital payload data of LAPAN-A2 satellite. This paper describes result of design, implementation and test from the hardware for receiving digital payload data of LAPAN-A2 Satellite. The hardware uses Morph-IC FPGA using software Quartus and microcontroller ATMega128 embedded using Basic compiler-AVR, then the design and layout of printed circuit board uses Eagle Software. From the result of the hardware functionality test of hardware payload data receiver system, the hardware is capable to pass the signal from transmitter S-band around 3Mbps and forwarded to PC by using communication serial with speed 6Mbps, and is able to download digital payload of LAPAN-A2 satellite either digital space camera or AIS data. The amount of received data depends on the height of elevation and attitude of the satellite.

TI  - A simple sea fog prediction approach using GOCI observations and sea surface winds
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we have proposed a method of sea fog prediction using model sea surface wind (SSW) data and hourly optical satellite data with 500 m spatial resolution. Three sea fog cases in the Yellow Sea were selected from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) images, and their shifts were determined from the fog cluster centroid displacements at successive hours. The 4 km resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model SSW were used to predict sea fog shifts. The sea fog prediction results were verified using validation indices like probability of detection (POD), false alarm ratio (FAR), and critical success index (CSI). The predictions started with high initial skill scores (POD = 0.76, FAR = 0.18, and CSI = 0.66), and showed values 0.59, 0.30, and 0.46 for POD, FAR, and CSI, respectively for predictions after two hours. After three hours their values still remained close to the medians though decreased, but afterwards decreased considerably for POD and CSI. Thus the method is found suitable for short-term prediction of sea fog. Additionally, trajectory sensitivities were compared between 20 and 4 km resolution WRF which, in general, resulted in less errors for 4 km WRF model SSW.

TI  - Analyzing Land Cover Change and Urban Growth Trajectories of the Mega-Urban Region of Dhaka Using Remotely Sensed Data and an Ensemble Classifier
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on, and human interpretation of, urban land cover using satellite-derived sensor imagery is critical given the intricate nature and niches of socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental factors occurring at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Detailed knowledge of urban land and their changing pattern over time periods associated with ecological risk is, however, required for the best use of critical land and its environmental resources. Interest in this topic has increased recently, driven by a surge in the use of open-source computing software, satellite-derived imagery, and improved classification algorithms. Using the machine learning algorithm Random Forest, combined with multi-date Landsat imagery, we classified eight periods of land cover maps with up-to-date spatial and temporal information of urban land between the period of 1972 and 2015 for the mega-urban region of greater Dhaka in Bangladesh. Random Foresta non-parametric ensemble classifier-has shown a quantum increase in satellite-derived image classification accuracy due to its outperformance over traditional approaches, e.g., Maximum Likelihood. Employing Random Forest as an image classification approach for this study with independent cross-validation techniques, we obtained high classification accuracy, user and producer accuracy. Our overall classification accuracy ranges were between 85% and 97% with kappa values between 0.81 and 0.94. The area statistics derived from the thematic land cover map show that the built-up area in the 43-year study period expanded quickly, from 35 km(2) in 1972 to 378 km(2) in 2015, with a net increase rate of approximately 980% and an average annual growth rate of 6%. This growth rate, however, was higher in peripheral areas, with a 2903% increase and an annual expansion rate of 8%, compared to a 460% increase with an annual growth rate of 4% in the core city area (Dhaka City Corporation). This huge urban expansion took place in the north, northwest, and southwest regions of Dhaka, transforming areas that were previously agricultural land, vegetation cover, wetland, and water bodies. The main factors driving the city towards northern corridors include flood-free higher land, the availability of a transportation network, and the agglomeration of manufacturing-based employment centers. The resulting thematic map and spatial information produced from this study therefore serve to facilitate a detailed understanding of urban growth dynamics and land cover change patterns in the mega-urban region of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

TI  - BSVerticalOzone database
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - An updated and improved version of a global, vertically resolved, monthly mean zonal mean ozone database has been calculated - hereafter referred to as the BSVertOzone database, the BSVertOzone database. Like its predecessor, it combines measurements from several satellite-based instruments and ozone profile measurements from the global ozonesonde network. Monthly mean zonal mean ozone concentrations in mixing ratio and number density are provided in 5 latitude zones, spanning 70 altitude levels (1 to 70km), or 70 pressure 5 levels that are approximately 1km apart (878.4hPa to 0.046hPa). Different data sets or "Tiers" are provided: "Tier 0" is based only on the available measurements and therefore does not completely cover the whole globe or the full vertical range uniformly; the "Tier 0.5" monthly mean zonal means are calculated from a filled version of the Tier 0 database where missing monthly mean zonal mean values are estimated from correlations at level 20 against a total column ozone database and then at levels above and below on correlations with lower and upper levels respectively. The Tier 10 0.5 database includes the full range of measurement variability and is created as an intermediate step for the calculation of the "Tier 1" data where a least squares regression model is used to attribute variability to various known forcing factors for ozone. Regression model fit coefficients are expanded in Fourier series and Legendre polynomials (to account for seasonality and latitudinal structure, respectively). Four different combinations of contributions from selected regression model basis functions result in four different "Tier 1" data set that can be used for comparisons with chemistry-climate model simulations that do not 15 exhibit the same unforced variability as reality (unless they are nudged towards reanalyses). Compared to previous versions of the database, this update includes additional satellite data sources and ozonesonde measurements to extend the database period to 2016. Additional improvements over the previous version of the database include: (i) Adjustments of measurements to account for biases and drifts between different data sources (using a chemistry-transport model simulation as a transfer standard), (ii) a more objective way to determine the optimum number of Fourier and Legendre expansions for the basis 20 function fit coefficients, and (iii) the derivation of methodological and measurement uncertainties on each database value are traced through all data modification steps. Comparisons with the ozone database from SWOOSH (Stratospheric Water and OzOne Satellite Homogenized data set) show excellent agreements in many regions of the globe, and minor differences caused by different bias adjustment procedures for the two databases. However, compared to SWOOSH, BSVertOzone additionally covers the troposphere. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Faith-based development of World Vision Tanzania
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines how faith is intertwined in conceptions of development in the work of World Vision Tanzania, a faith-based organisation focusing on child welfare. Issues that are explored include the question how an apparently common faith setting constitutes and provides a source of social meanings and values for the assessment of human development as well as secular development concepts such as human agency and empowerment. The analysis shows how World Vision staff assign different values to Christian and non-Christian development when assessing the potential and achievements of the beneficiaries in terms of secular concepts. It is argued that a faith-based worldview in this context provides the foundation for the specific set of values and social meanings, which are examined in this article, and a source for these more generally when value judgements and assessments of agency, empowerment, freedom, and, ultimately, well-being are made. It is further suggested that, by employing ideas of freedom, agency, and empowerment and investing them with Christian meaning, World Vision is able to generate a portrait of itself and its beneficiaries that is positioned in a hierarchy of values where Christian ideals and secular development fuse and become paramount.

AB  - Learning near-optimal behaviour from an expert's demonstrations typically relies on the assumption that the learner knows the features that the true reward function depends on. In this paper, we study the problem of learning from demonstrations in the setting where this is not the case, i.e., where there is a mismatch between the worldviews of the learner and the expert. We introduce a natural quantity, the teaching risk, which measures the potential suboptimality of policies that look optimal to the learner in this setting. We show that bounds on the teaching risk guarantee that the learner is able to find a near-optimal policy using standard algorithms based on inverse reinforcement learning. Based on these findings, we suggest a teaching scheme in which the expert can decrease the teaching risk by updating the learner's worldview, and thus ultimately enable her to find a near-optimal policy.

AB  - The Public-Private-Partnership between ESA and Airbus Defense and Space (Germany) has created the European Data Relay System (EDRS), which is operational since 2016.The joint teams are running the Phase B of the globalisation of the European Data Relay System (EDRS) with an addition to the programme called EDRS Global (former GlobeNet).EDRS Global is planning to increase the capacity of EDRS by adding a geostationary data relay payload, called EDRS-D, over the Asia-Pacific region - in cooperation with Airbus DS partner JSAT (Japan). The heart of the system will be multiple laser terminals, based on TESATs upgraded design, featuring also a dual wavelength capability (1064 nm and 1550 nm) to serve more customers at the same time. The 1550 nm capabilities will be implemented in a cooperation between Airbus and TESAT (Germany), and NEC (Japan).The evolution of the service will also aim for security sensitive user missions, including RPAS missions. The Laser Communication Technology on-board EDRS-D will be the starting point for the world's first global laser based network in space, providing Global Secure Quasi-Real-Time-Services at Gigabit per second speed back to Europe by connecting its EDRS GEO nodes (EDRS-A/-C and EDRS-D) over 80,000 km distance by the means of optical communication.The paper will provide details of the project and information about the latest status.

AB  - The relatively recent availability of operational products from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 missions gives widespread opportunities to combine data collected from different sensors in order to provide products of a higher processing level. Nonetheless, the availability of these products may be affected by multiple factors, such as cloud occlusions, band saturation, geolocation errors or even misaligned detectors. All these anomalies affecting remote sensing data may eventually limit the accessibility to fused products because some of the required information may become partially unavailable for specific areas of interest. In this scenario, the work presented here aims at analyzing the effectiveness of several state-of-the-art regression models in order to restore Sentinel-3 products with partial anomalies from Sentinel-2 integral data. In particular this work investigates three regression methods, two linear-regression method and a non-linear artificial neural networks based method. Obtained results prove that the nonlinear approach and linear RIDGE method are able to carry out a good estimation of S3 from S2 data.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the presented study, the Sentinel-2 vegetation indices (VIs) were evaluated in context of estimating defoliation of Scots pine stands in western Poland. Regression and classification models were built based on reference data from 50 field plots and Sentinel-2 satellite images from three acquisition dates. Three machine-learning (ML) methods were tested: k-nearest neighbors (kNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). Regression models predicted stands defoliation with moderate accuracy. R-2 values for regression models amounted to 0.53, 0.57, 0.57 for kNN, RF and SVM, accordingly. Analogically, the following values of normalized root mean squared error were obtained: 12.2%, 11.9% and 11.6%. Overall accuracies for two-class classification models were 78%, 75%, 78% for kNN, RF and SVM methods. The Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index VIs were found to be most robust defoliation predictors regardless of the ML method. We conclude that Sentinel-2 satellite images provide useful information about forest defoliation and may contribute to forest monitoring systems.

TI  - Meteorological factors affecting seroconversion of Akabane disease in sentinel calves in the subtropical Okinawa Islands of Japan
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Akabane virus, the pathogen-causing Akabane disease, is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) transmitted by the Culicoides biting midge. A nationwide serological surveillance program for bovine arboviral diseases, including Akabane disease, has been established in Japan to monitor the circulation of arboviruses by targeting sentinel calves. Okinawa, which is located in the southwestern-most region of Japan, is a high-risk area for incursion of arboviruses. The aim of the present study was to identify the meteorological factors related to farm-level seroconversion of Akabane virus by analyzing the serological surveillance data for sentinel calves collected in Okinawa between 2007 and 2015. Rainfall in winter, spring, and autumn was positively associated with seroconversion. Adequate rainfall seems to keep the soil in a suitably moist state for growth and survival of biting midges. Maximum temperature in winter was also positively associated with seroconversion in sentinel calves. The warmer temperatures in winter may provide conditions suitable for shortening the larval development cycle and increase production of adult midges. Our findings indicate that meteorological factors such as temperature and rainfall may be important factors that produce circumstances conducive to effective transmission of the virus between vectors and the host. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the circulation of arboviruses and offer suggestions for developing better surveillance and measures to prevent arboviral disease.

TI  - Unintended effects of measuring implicit processes: The case of death-thought accessibility in mortality salience studies
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - According to terror management theory, mortality salience (MS) increases distal worldview and self-esteem defensiveness by arousing unconscious death-thought accessibility (DTA). Although numerous studies support this theoretical process model, no research to date has ever found that DTA mediates the effect of MS in a single study, using the measurement-of-mediation approach. In this paper, we argue that the lack of evidence for this effect is due to methodological issues associated with the measurement of DTA. Specifically, measuring DTA primes death-thoughts and thereby disrupts the psychological processes that are typically initiated by MS. We provide evidence for this theorizing in three studies. Study 1 shows that merely administering a DTA task (vs. a neutral non-death-related task) increases distal self-esteem enhancement following a delay period (cf., a typical MS effect). Study 2 is a preregistered replication of Study 1, and found parallel effects, but only among participants who did not speed through the study. Study 3 demonstrates that whereas MS increases self-enhancement after a delay when DTA is not measured, administering a DTA task following MS eliminates this effect. Implications for understanding the implicit processes initiated in response to MS are discussed, and methodological recommendations for conducting empirically sound MS studies are suggested.

AB  - Estimation of aboveground forest biomass is critical for regional carbon policies and sustainable forest management. Both passive optical remote sensing and active microwave remote sensing can play an important role in the monitoring of forest biomass. In this study, the recently launched Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument satellite and Sentinel-1 SAR satellite systems were evaluated and integrated to investigate the relative strengths of each sensor for mapping aboveground forest biomass at a regional scale. The Australian state of Victoria, with its wide range of forest vegetation was chosen as the study area to demonstrate the scalability and transferability of the approach. In this study aboveground forest biomass (AGB) was defined as the tons of carbon per hectare for the aboveground components (stem, branches, leaves) of all live large trees greater than 10 cm in diameter at breast height (DBHOB). Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data were fused within a machine learning framework using a boosted regression tree model and high-quality ground survey data. Multi criteria evaluations showed the use of the two independent and fundamentally different Sentinel satellite systems were able to provide robust estimates (R2 of 0.62, RVISE of 32.2 t.C.ha') of aboveground forest biomass, with each sensor compensating for the weakness (cloud perturbations and spectral saturation for Sentinel 2, and sensitivity to ground moisture for Sentinel 1) of each other. As archives for Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 continue to grow, mapping aboveground forest biomass and dynamics at moderate resolution over large regions should become increasingly feasible.

TI  - Monitoring Victoria's public forests: implementation of the Victorian Forest Monitoring Program
T2  - SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A new strategic inventory across all publicly managed forests has been installed in Victoria. For the preceding two decades, Victoria's forest inventory has been compiled from various data sources from across the state, an approach that doesn't allow information about the nature and rate of changes to the resource to be estimated, or for projections or forecasts to be made. To address these limitations, the Victorian Forest Monitoring Program (VFMP) was established, to monitor Victoria's progress in meeting a commitment towards sustainable forest management, and to satisfy requirements for state and national reporting. The purpose of the new program is to 'assess and monitor the extent, state and sustainable development of Victoria's public forests in a timely and accurate manner.' The VFMP consists of a plot-based system of permanent observational units located on a state-wide grid. A combination of ground-based and aerial photo plots and remotely sensed data are used to capture a set of basic attributes that are used to derive indicators of sustainability. To meet the monitoring needs a remeasurement framework has been developed to guide the change estimation procedures. The program was designed and implemented between 2009 and 2015 and used to generate data and information for the most recent Victoria's State of the Forest Report. The first annual change estimate is due to be completed in 2017. A summary of implementation and proposed maintenance is presented and discussed in this paper.

TI  - Weakening sensitivity of global vegetation to long-term droughts
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts have dramatic direct and indirect impacts on vegetation and terrestrial ecosystem stability, including decreases in growth and subsequent decreases in CO2 absorption. Although much research has been carried out on the response of vegetation to droughts, it remains unclear whether biomes are becoming more resistant or more vulnerable to drought. In this study, we used the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI, a multiscalar drought index) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, an indicator of vegetation growth) to detect the sensitivity of vegetation growth to droughts across 12-24 month timescales and to detect the change in this sensitivity over recent decades. We found that vegetation growth was most sensitive to 17-18 month droughts in water-limited regions, implying pronounce legacy effects from water conditions in previous years. In addition, we detected reduced coupling between drought and vegetation growth, probably caused by release moisture stress in water limited areas. Meanwhile, we observed a shortening of drought timescale to which vegetation most sensitively responded from an average of 18.1 to 17.2 months, suggesting the weakening of the drought legacy effect on vegetation growth. Results of this study contribute to the overall understanding of the resistance and resilience of ecosystems to drought conditions.

AB  - In the past decades, land cover change detection (LCCD) has been dramatically developed, since it provides corroborative support for policy decision, regulatory actions, and subsequent urban-rural activities. Satellite remote sensing image is the major source of LCCD since it is able to revisit the Earth's surface regularly and provide time series images for monitoring and space-time analysis. However, there is always a trade-off between spatial scale and temporal scale, i.e., finer spatial resolution image generally has a lower revisit frequency, leading to an observation omission; while higher revisit frequency image usually has a lower spatial resolution, resulting in a deficiency in detecting finer scale change information. In this paper, a spatial-temporal sub-pixel mapping (SSM) algorithm is proposed on the premise that one pair of fine spatial resolution image with low frequency revisit period and coarse spatial resolution with high frequently revisit period are available, and SSM is taken to restore the coarse image to a finer scale thematic map which can be then compared to the fine image, realizing a frequency and detailed LCCD. SSM is an extension of traditional mono-temporal sub-pixel mapping (SPM) algorithm, and is improved by incorporating temporally fine distribution patterns for a more appropriate restoration of coarse image. A study case for urban expansion LCCD were carried out to verify the ability of the proposed algorithm to handle change detection based on one pair of china-made Gaofen-2 image (GF-2) and Landsat-8 image, the result demonstrate that the proposed SSM algorithm outperform the other traditional SPM, achieving both fine temporal resolution and spatial resolution LCCD for further applications.

AB  - Crop classification can accurately estimate crop area, structure, and spatial distribution, as well as provide important input parameters for crop yield models. The crop yield information is an important basis for the country to formulate food policies and economic plans, so the study of crop classification is of great significance. Traditional optical remote sensing is susceptible to sunlight and clouds, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can be used all-time and all-weather. Compared to single-polarization SAR, full-polarization SAR has more abundant information. In this paper, C-band GF-3(GaoFen-3) satellite data and multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data were used as data sources. Changchun City in northeastern China is selected as the experimental area and the scattering characteristics of typical crops in this area are analyzed. Firstly, the GF-3 and multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data were preprocessed. Then, polarization decomposition of GF-3 data was performed to obtain three polarization characteristics: scattering angle, entropy and anisotropy (H/alpha/A). The Supports vector machine (SVM) algorithm was implemented as the classifier. Polarization characteristics, multi-source and multi-temporal SAR were used for classification features. The overall accuracy reached 91.9537%, nearly 10% higher than using full-polarization information alone, and the kappa coefficient was 0.8827. It shows that multi-source and multi-temporal SAR has obvious advantages in crop identification.

AB  - This paper aim to present a new approach for Digital Building Model (DBM) construction with the use of GaoFen IV high resolution satellite images and LiDAR data. Our method combines smart data management and data visualization techniques to improve storage and display efficiency of high volume point-cloud data. It then develops a fast-construction-method based on the fusion of intensive matching of DSM/DEM and Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) library, in which a normal vector region growing algorithm based point cloud clustering method is used to construct different levels of Bezier surfaces, and to extract building roof footprints. It recognizes the special features of point cloud segmentation and Bezier surface crossing, and apply these features to develop parameter-based model building technique for complicated models, where split-and-merge algorithm is used for transforming building roof footprints into 3D building structural models. In addition, our method utilizes advanced remote sensing and virtual reality technologies to create customized 3D environments, enabling users to freely construct 3D models directly on satellite images, and to automatically generate surface textures. Our method shows significant improvement on model accuracy and construction efficiency compare to traditional techniques.

AB  - Soil moisture is an important parameter to be monitored in agricultural activities. Estimation on soil moisture is as important as understanding the process of hydrology and ecology. Nowadays, how to acquire extensive soil moisture information has became the key to this problem due to insufficient performance of water models. Remote sensing technology is able to obtain essential soil moisture information on a large scale quickly and efficiently. In order to integrate high coverage of microwave data with higher spatial resolution of optical/infrared satellite data, a downscaling algorithm is evaluated for the improvement of soil moisture at temporal and spatial resolution using AMSR-E/AMSR-2 (The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - EOS/2) and MODIS (The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The turbulent energy fluxes which link passive microwave derived soil moisture with several factors (eg: NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), LST (L and Surface Temperature), albedo) at high resolution through evapotranspiration. Based on "universal triangle method", NDVI, albedo, and LST from MODIS are used to downscale AMSR-E/AMSR-2 daily soil moisture from 25km to 1km in this study.With linear relationships between microwave soil moisture and several parameters (NDVI, LST, albedo), specific downscaling parameters of satellite images for same date which represents unique relations between soil moisture and energy flux was calculated through multivariate linear model between soil moisture at coarse resolution and several parameters(NDVI, LST, albedo). Downscaled soil moisture was obtained by calculation with downscaling parameters and NDVI, LST and albedo at higher spatial resolution.Because of discrepancy of different spatio-temporal scale between satellite date and in situ point data used in validation, we used a algorithm to rescale downscaled result to remove systematic differences. The scatter plot and linear fit of 10 years downscaled soil moisture and measured soil moisture in 10 cm depth from different agro-meteorological station in Inner Mongolia is plotted and analyzed. The performance of this algorithm is assessed by comparing the obtained daily downscaling results at 1 km with in situ soil moisture point measurement (10 cm depth) from agro-meteorological station in Inner Mongolia. The result showed that scatter plot and linear fit of 10 years downscaled soil moisture and station observation of 10 cm depth soil moisture with its bias and RMSE of -0.094 and 0.092. Results showed that downscaled soil moisture at 1km enable to represent value and variability of soil moisture content at a large scale and perform better than satellite data from single source because of higher coverage and spatial-temporal resolution.

TI  - Performance of the NPP-VIIRS and Aqua-MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth Products over the Yangtze River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) environmental data record aerosol product (VIIRS_EDR) and the Aqua-moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MYD04) collection 6 (C6) aerosol optical depth (AOD) products are validated against the Cimel sun-photometer (CE318) AOD measurements during different air quality conditions over the Yangtze river basin (YRB) from 2 May 2012 to 31 December 2016. For VIIRS_EDR, the AOD observations are obtained from the scientific data set (SDS) "aerosol optical depth at 550 nm" at 6 km resolution, and for Aqua-MODIS, the AOD observations are obtained from the SDS "image optical depth land and ocean" at 3 km (DT3K) and 10 km (DT10K) resolutions, "deep blue aerosol optical depth 550 land" at 10 km resolution (DB10K), and "AOD 550 dark target deep blue combined" at 10 km resolution (DTB10K). Results show that the high-quality (QF = 3) DTB10K performs the best against the CE318 AOD observations, along with a higher R (0.85) and more retrievals within the expected error (EE) +/- (0.05 + 15%) (55%). Besides, there is a 10% overestimation, but the positive bias does not exhibit obvious seasonal variations. Similarly, the DT3K and DT10K products overestimate AOD retrievals by 23% and 15%, respectively, all over the year, but the positive biases become larger in spring and summer. For the DB10K AOD retrievals, there is an overestimation (underestimation) in autumn and winter (spring and summer). Compared to the Aqua-MODIS AOD products, the VIIRS_EDR AOD retrievals are less correlated (R = 0.73) and only 44% of the retrievals fall within EE. Meanwhile, the VIIRS_EDR shows larger bias than the Aqua-MODIS C6 retrievals, and tends to overestimate AOD retrievals in summer and underestimate in winter. Additionally, there is an underestimation for the VIIRS_EDR AOD retrievals over the regions during high aerosol loadings. These indicate that the VIIRS_EDR retrieval algorithm needs to be improved in further applications over the YRB.

TI  - Using wavelet analysis of hyperspectral remote-sensing data to estimate canopy chlorophyll content of winter wheat under stripe rust stress
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll content can be used as an indicator to monitor crop diseases. In this article, an experiment on winter wheat stressed by stripe rust was carried out. The canopy reflectance spectra were collected when visible symptoms of stripe rust in wheat leaves were seen, and canopy chlorophyll content was measured simultaneously in laboratory. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was applied to process the smoothed spectral and derivative spectral data of winter wheat, and the wavelet coefficient features obtained by CWT were regarded as the independent variable to establish estimation models of chlorophyll content. The hyperspectral vegetation indices were also regarded as the independent variable to build estimation models. Then, two types of models above-mentioned were compared to ascertain which type of model is better. The cross-validation method was used to determine the model accuracies. The results indicated that the estimation model of chlorophyll content, which is a multivariate linear model constructed using wavelet coefficient features extracted by Mexican Hat wavelet function processing the smoothed spectrum (WSMH1 and WSMH2), is the best model. It has the highest estimation accuracy with modelled coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.905, validated R-2 of 0.913, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.288mg fg(-1). The univariate linear model built by wavelet coefficient feature of WSMH1 is secondary and the modelled R-2 is 0.797, validated R-2 is 0.795, and RMSE is 0.397mg fg(-1). Both estimation models are better than those of all hyperspectral vegetation indices. The research shows that the feature information of canopy chlorophyll content of winter wheat can be captured by wavelet coefficient features which are extracted by the method of CWT processing canopy reflectance spectrum data. Therefore, it could provide theoretical support on detecting diseases of crop by remote sensing quantitatively estimating chlorophyll content.

AB  - The city's local climate zone (LCZ) was considered to be a powerful tool for urban climate mapping. But for cities in different countries and regions, the LCZ division methods and results were different, thus targeted researches should be performed. In the current work, a LCZ mapping method was proposed, which is convenient in operation and city planning oriented. In this proposed method, the local climate zoning types were adjusted firstly, according to the characteristics of Chinese city, that more tall buildings and high density. Then the classification method proposed by WUDAPT based on remote sensing data was performed on Xi'an city, as an example, for LCZ mapping. Combined with the city road network, a reasonable expression of the dividing results was provided, to adapt to the characteristics in city planning that land parcels are usually recognized as the basic unit. The proposed method was validated against the actual land use and construction data that surveyed in Xi'an, with results indicating the feasibility of the proposed method for urban LCZ mapping in China.

AB  - Surface albedo is one of the essential climate variables. There is an increasing need for albedo data to be available for use in applications that require a medium to fine spatial resolution. In our earlier study, the direct estimation approach, previously used with coarser resolution data, was refined and applied to the Landsat data archive, including MSS, TM, ETM+, and OLI. Extensive validations made against ground measurements showed that the albedo estimation algorithm could achieve low root-mean-squared-errors (RMSEs) not more than 0.031 over both snow-free and snow-covered surfaces. In this study, the algorithm was used with Landsat data to map the surface albedo changes in the ablation zone over west Greenland since 1980s, where massive melting events occurred during the past few decades. As a case study, an analysis of surface albedo change over Greenland combining four satellite albedo datasets, namely MODIS, GLASS, CLARA, and Landsat was conducted to better understand the magnitude and timing of albedo changes in the ablation zone.

TI  - Evaluating land surface albedo estimation from Landsat MSS, TM, ETM plus , and OLI data based on the unified direct estimation approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is widely used in climate and environment applications as an important parameter for controlling the surface energy budget. There is an increasing need for albedo data to be available for use in applications that require a fine spatial resolution and for validating coarse-resolution datasets; however, such products with long-term global coverage are not available thus far. Existing algorithms for Landsat albedo estimation all require surface reflectance from explicit and reliable atmospheric correction, which may sometimes be unavailable or carry uncertainties due to saturated visible bands or a lack of dense vegetation. In addition, most of the existing algorithms require concurrent clear-sky observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) correction, which limited the data availability for Landsat albedo estimation. To overcome these problems, in this study, we adopt the direct estimation approach previously used with coarser resolution data, such as MODIS and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and apply it to multiple Landsat data obtained by Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), and Operational Land Imager (OLI). By incorporating Landsat spectral response functions and a database of bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) into radiative transfer simulations, a unified algorithm is developed to estimate surface albedo directly from the Landsat top-of-atmospheric reflectance data obtained by MSS, TM, ETM +, and OLI with few ancillary inputs. To overcome the saturation problems in the visible bands of TM and ETM + over very bright surfaces, a refined approach is employed by using only non-saturated bands. The validation results against ground measurements over various land cover types and climate regions show that our algorithm is effective for both snow-free and snow-covered surfaces and can achieve root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of not more than 0.034. In addition, we show the high potential of the earlier MSS data for producing consistent surface albedo estimations based on inter-comparison with TM-based results with RMSEs of 0.011-0.017 and R-2 of 0.858-0.963. This long-term, 30-m resolution surface albedo estimation can date back to the early 1980s, which allows for improved understanding of long-term climate change and land cover change effects.

TI  - Quantifying the main urban area expansion of Guangzhou using Landsat imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article takes the main urban area of Guangzhou as the study area. Twelve land-use maps were interpreted from Landsat Thematic Mapper images using feature enhancement technology and Naive Bayes-based weight vector AdaBoost (WV AdaBoost). The study shows that since 1987, with heavily cultivated land being lost and vegetation cover shrinking, the urban area has doubled in size. The effects of human activities on the landscape have become increasingly apparent and complicated. It also finds that the expansion pattern has been transformed from one in which the city's main urban area engulfed the surrounding residential area to one in which surrounding towns expanded, driven by the development of the main urban area. By analysing the relationship between the social economy, population, and land-use change, we show that the forces driving expansion of the urban area have differed in different periods. The principal driving forces are national policymaking and adjustment, the aggregation and diffusion of population and economic development. Multitemporal land-use maps allow long-term dynamic monitoring of urban land cover in Guangzhou and provide important details of urban expansion and changes in land use. We employed intervals of 2 and 3 years, and our results provide good supporting data for studies of urban extension trends and reasonable urban planning.

AB  - The target decomposition of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data was widely used to study the electromagnetic scattering properties of rice paddies. Many studies used eigenvectors-based decomposition like Cloude-Pottier decomposition to monitor rice growth but the potential of model-based decomposition like Freeman-Durden decomposition for rice phenology monitoring was not fully explored. Therefore, a rice phenology inversion method was presented in this paper using Freeman-Durden decomposition parameters acquired from multi-temporal, quad-polarization RADARSAT-2 data over rice fields in Meishan, China. A decision tree approach was employed for the retrieval algorithm. Results show that joint use of logarithmic power scattered by the surface scattering component and double-bounce scattering component of the covariance matrix provides a good performance and obtains a total accuracy of 89.7% when four phenological stages (i.e., transplanting, vegetative, reproductive, and maturation) are considered. Most of the errors occurred in the vegetative and reproductive stages. The corresponding errors were both 16.7%.

TI  - Mapping forest change using stacked generalization: An ensemble approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The ever-increasing volume and accessibility of remote sensing data has spawned many alternative approaches for mapping important environmental features and processes. For example, there are several viable but highly varied strategies for using time series of Landsat imagery to detect changes in forest cover. Performance among algorithms varies across complex natural systems, and it is reasonable to ask if aggregating the strengths of an ensemble of classifiers might result in increased overall accuracy. Relatively simple rules have been used in the past to aggregate classifications among remotely sensed maps (e.g. using majority predictions), and in other fields, empirical models have been used to create situationally specific algorithm weights. The latter process, called "stacked generalization" (or "stacking"), typically uses a parametric model for the fusion of algorithm outputs. We tested the performance of several leading forest disturbance detection algorithms against ensembles of the outputs of those same algorithms based upon stacking using both parametric and Random Forests-based fusion rules. Stacking using a Random Forests model cut omission and commission error rates in half in many cases in relation to individual change detection algorithms, and cut error rates by one quarter compared to more conventional parametric stacking. Stacking also offers two auxiliary benefits: alignment of outputs to the precise definitions built into a particular set of empirical calibration data; and, outputs which may be adjusted such that map class totals match independent estimates of change in each year. In general, ensemble predictions improve when new inputs are added that are both informative and uncorrelated with existing ensemble components. As increased use of cloud-based computing makes ensemble mapping methods more accessible, the most useful new algorithms may be those that specialize in providing spectral, temporal, or thematic information not already available through members of existing ensembles.

TI  - Administration of low-dose combination anti-CTLA4, anti-CD137, and anti-OX40 into murine tumor or proximal to the tumor draining lymph node induces systemic tumor regression
T2  - CANCER IMMUNOLOGY IMMUNOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The delivery of immunomodulators directly into the tumor potentially harnesses the existing antigen, tumor-specific infiltrating lymphocytes, and antigen presenting cells. This can confer specificity and generate a potent systemic anti-tumor immune response with lower doses and less toxicity compared to systemic administration, in effect an in situ vaccine. Here, we test this concept using the novel combination of immunomodulators anti-CTLA4, -CD137, and -OX40. The triple combination administered intratumorally at low doses to one tumor of a dual tumor mouse model had dramatic local and systemic anti-tumor efficacy in lymphoma (A20) and solid tumor (MC38) models, consistent with an abscopal effect. The minimal effective dose was 10 mu g each. The effect was dependent on CD8 T-cells. Intratumoral administration resulted in superior local and distant tumor control compared to systemic routes, supporting the in situ vaccine concept. In a single tumor A20 model, injection close to the tDLN resulted in similar efficacy as intratumoral and significantly better than targeting a non-tDLN, supporting the role of the tDLN as a viable immunotherapy target in addition to the tumor itself. Distribution studies confirmed expected concentration of antibodies in tumor and tDLN, in keeping with the anti-tumor results. Overall intratumoral or peri-tDLN administration of the novel combination of anti-CTLA4, anti-CD137, and anti-OX40, all agents in the clinic or clinical trials, demonstrates potent systemic anti-tumor effects. This immunotherapeutic combination is promising for future clinical development via both these safe and highly efficacious routes of administration.

TI  - Flexural Strength Prediction of Welded Flange Plate Connections Based on Slenderness Ratios of Beam Elements Using ANN
T2  - ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was aimed to investigate the strength and ductility of welded flange plate (WFP) connections. Using the FE method, 52 WFP connections with different beam overall depths and beam flanges/web slenderness ratios were analyzed. Fragility curves indicated that, for a WFP connection which is designed based on the seismic codes, its strength is of more concern than its ductility. In addition, limiting the width-to-thickness ratios of the beam flanges and web plates to 0.3 root E/f(y) and 2.45 root E/f(y), respectively, may not always lead to the achievement of adequate connections strength and ductility. Proposed theoretical formulas and artificial neural network- (ANN-) based models developed in this study were able to adequately predict the connection strength.

AB  - A continuously growing world population increases steadily the demand of foods. This results in strong changes that occur on agricultural sites. Remote sensing data provides an excellent opportunity to monitor these changes which is a crucial base to asses the impact of these changes on the climate or the natural resources. In the presented study, we tested the performance of a new crop classification method for a stack of Sentinel 1 (S1) and Sentinel 2 (S2) images taken within one growing season. We proved, that the new PSP method performs better for S1 images revealing an overall accuracy (OA) of 75% compared to 60% for the Random Forest classifier (RF). The PSP method outperformed also for the fused dataset of S1 and S2 images (72% OA for PSP, 62% for RF). The results illustrate the benefits for crop classifications provided by PSP and give crucial insights for the advantages and limits of S1 and S2 data fusion.

TI  - CONSTRUCTAL LAW, AND THE ALBEDO AND GLOBAL WARMING CONUNDRUM
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROMANIAN ACADEMY SERIES A-MATHEMATICS PHYSICS TECHNICAL SCIENCES INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the current debate on global warming is under analysis whether the albedo will increase with temperature, and may thus constitute a negative feedback mechanism by increasing the amount of solar radiation reflected into space. This issue is analyzed in this paper in the light of the Constructal Law. In fact, by maximizing the overall conductivity of the processes that lead to the thermalization of the solar energy absorbed on Earth and its subsequent radiation into space at the global average temperature, it is possible to conclude that the albedo should increase with the global temperature, thus constituting a negative feedback mechanism that will help to restrain the increase of global temperature. Additionally, the value found for the rate of variation of the albedo with global surface temperature is very close to the values published in the literature, which were obtained both through satellite data and ground-based observations. Although they result from a preliminary analysis, these results are encouraging towards the implementation of the Constructal Law in the analysis of the climate system.

TI  - Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in Preventing Laboratory Confirmed Influenza in 2014-2015 Season in Turkey: A Test-Negative Case Control Study
T2  - BALKAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Influenza has an important public health impact worldwide with its considerable annual morbidity among persons with or without risk factors and its serious complications among persons in high-risk groups. The seasonal influenza vaccine is essential for preventing the burden of influenza in a population. Since the vaccine is reformulated each season according to the virus serotypes in circulation, its effectiveness can vary from season to season. Vaccine effectiveness is defined as the relative risk reduction in vaccinated individuals in observational studies.Aims: To calculate influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza in the Turkish population for the first time using the national sentinel surveillance data in the 2014-2015 influenza season.Study Design: Test-negative case-control study.Methods: We compared vaccination odds of influenza positive cases to influenza negative controls in the national influenza surveillance in Turkey to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness.Results: The influenza vaccine effectiveness against influenza A (H1N1) (68.4%, 95% CI: -2.9 to 90.3) and B (44.6%, 95% CI: -27.9 to 66.6) were moderate, and the influenza vaccine effectiveness against influenza A (H3N2) (75.0%, 95% CI: -86.1 to 96.7) was relatively high; all had low precision given the low vaccination coverage. Overall, the influenza vaccination coverage rate was 4.2% (95% CI: 3.5 to 5.0), which is not sufficient to control the burden of influenza.Conclusion: In Turkey, national surveillance for influenza should be strengthened and utilised annually for the assessment of influenza vaccine effectiveness with more precision. Annual influenza vaccine effectiveness in Turkey should continue to be monitored as part of the national sentinel influenza surveillance.

AB  - In this paper, we address the challenge of land use and land cover classification using Sentinel-2 satellite images. The key contributions are as follows. We present a novel dataset based on Sentinel-2 satellite images covering 13 different spectral bands and consisting of 10 classes with in total 27,000 labeled images. We evaluate state-of-the-art deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on this novel dataset with its different spectral bands. We also evaluate deep CNNs on existing remote sensing datasets and compare the obtained results. With the proposed novel dataset, we achieved an overall classification accuracy of 98.57%. The classification system resulting from the proposed research opens a gate towards various Earth observation applications. We demonstrate how the classification system can assist in improving geographical maps.

TI  - Utility of the clivo-axial angle in assessing brainstem deformity: pilot study and literature review
T2  - NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - There is growing recognition of the kyphotic clivo-axial angle (CXA) as an index of risk of brainstem deformity and craniocervical instability. This review of literature and prospective pilot study is the first to address the potential correlation between correction of the pathological CXA and postoperative clinical outcome. The CXA is a useful sentinel to alert the radiologist and surgeon to the possibility of brainstem deformity or instability. Ten adult subjects with ventral brainstem compression, radiographically manifest as a kyphotic CXA, underwent correction of deformity (normalization of the CXA) prior to fusion and occipito-cervical stabilization. The subjects were assessed preoperatively and at one, three, six, and twelve months after surgery, using established clinical metrics: the visual analog pain scale (VAS), American Spinal InjuryAssociation Impairment Scale (ASIA), Oswestry Neck Disability Index, SF 36, and Karnofsky Index. Parametric and non-parametric statistical tests were performed to correlate clinical outcome with CXA. No major complications were observed. Two patients showed pedicle screws adjacent to but not deforming the vertebral artery on post-operative CT scan. All clinical metrics showed statistically significant improvement. Mean CXA was normalized from 135.8A degrees to 163.7A degrees. Correction of abnormal CXA correlated with statistically significant clinical improvement in this cohort of patients. The study supports the thesis that the CXA maybe an important metric for predicting the risk of brainstem and upper spinal cord deformation. Further study is feasible and warranted.

AB  - Vegetation is an important determining factor in the climatic conditions of a given location. Thus, the objective of this research is to verify the existing spatial correlation between the vegetation and the surface temperature found in the urban areas of Francisco Beltrao and Pato Branco (Brazil). The LANDSAT 8 satellite, through its OLI and TIRS sensors, enables the mapping of land use and surface temperature on the same scale. The urban area of Francisco Beltrao presented a total of 4,551 ha, 1,041 ha of urban land, 2,584 ha of forest vegetation and 926 ha of undergrowth. Pato Branco has a total urban area of 6,204 ha, with 3,167 ha of urban land, 1,466 ha of forest vegetation and 1,571 ha of undergrowth. As for the surface temperature recorded, the two urban areas studied had a thermal variation between 19 degrees C and 35 degrees C, with forest areas varying from 19 degrees C to 29 degrees C and the majority of urban land between 24 degrees C to 35 degrees C. The Pearson correlation for both variables in their spatial distribution presented an approximate value of 0.75, considered a strong correlation.

AB  - The Sentinel-3 SYNERGY (SYN) processing branch has been designed as a combination of the acquisition of the two optical instruments, the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR), with the main objective to provide surface vegetation products similar to those obtained from the VEGETATION instrument on SPOT. Synergistic and collocated measurements from both OLCI and SLSTR are ingested in an aerosol retrieval module. Then for each 300m pixel, Aerosol optical thickness data and Surface directional reflectances are retrieved and outputted in S3 SYNERGY L2 products.A description of the whole processing chain from OLCl/SLSTR Ll products to SYN L2 ones will be provided followed by a detailed description of the SYN L2 products. Quality assessment of these products, performed by the S3 MPC consortium and using in situ comparisons with AERONET data and with PROBA-V data will be discussed. Finally, a third section will be dedicated to the development of a future global aerosol products and the possible evolutions of this SYNERGY processing branch.More details about the whole S3 algorithms and products can be found in the Sentinel 3 Handbook [1]

AB  - During the pre-modern era, the monarch in East Asia was called the son of heaven. The concept of the son of heaven existed in the China and nomadic world for a long time. From the records of the Three Kingdoms, it is confirmed that Korean nationals also used the concept. Goryeo also recognized the monarch as the the son of heaven in accordance with the traditional worldview of the Three Kingdoms period, and called it the Great King. The Great King(大王) of Goryeo was one of the equivalent power of the East Asian world, along with the Emperor(皇帝) of the China and the Khan of the Nomadic World.Goryeo belonging to the culture of Chinese word, borrowed the term referring to its own monarch from the China, and in the process, it was also referred to as the Emperor, which is equivalent to the Great king.The fact that the Great King of Goryeo was an equal authority in international relations at the time. so the method of understanding the Goryeo era will be revived from the understanding of international relations on the countries established by the China and the Nomadic world, It means there is a need to see other aspect.

AB  - As the satellite data gradually increases, the processing time of the algorithm for remote sensing also increases. It is now essential to make efforts to improve the processing performance in various accelerators such as Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). However, it is very difficult to use programming models that make programs to run on accelerators. Especially for scientists, easy programming and performance are often more important than providing many optimization functions and directives. To meet these requirements, we developed the accelerated code generator based on Open Computing Language (OpenCL) for processing ocean color remote sensing data. We easily applied our generator to atmospheric correction program for GOCI data as a case study and the program's performance achieved about 29.2x that is as good as the hand-written OpenCL program. We look forward to many scientists that want to find a tool mentioned above taking advantage of our generator.

AB  - Grasslands are of great ecological importance in Western Europe, mainly because they harbor a wide variety of (endangered) fauna and flora. However, not all grasslands are equally valuable. All grasslands in Flanders can be assigned to one of six 'restoration phases' of increasing ecological value. In this paper, we assessed how well these different phases can be distinguished from an intra-seasonal time series of Sentinel 2 satellite images. We found that the phases at the low and high extremes are very distinctive in the spectro-temporal domain of our Sentinel 2 acquisitions. The intermediate phases however are more similar spectrally, making them more difficult to discern. Most phases can however be separated at minimum one acquisition date. This is an encouraging result as we aim at developing a monitoring system for grassland restoration at the parcel scale.

TI  - Evaluating the role of evapotranspiration remote sensing data in improving hydrological modeling predictability
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - C As the global demands for the use of freshwater resources continues to rise, it has become increasingly important to insure the sustainability of this resources. This is accomplished through the use of management strategies that often utilize monitoring and the use of hydrological models. However, monitoring at large scales is not feasible and therefore model applications are becoming challenging, especially when spatially distributed datasets, such as evapotranspiration, are needed to understand the model performances. Due to these limitations, most of the hydrological models are only calibrated for data obtained from site/point observations, such as streamflow. Therefore, the main focus of this paper is to examine whether the incorporation of remotely sensed and spatially distributed datasets can improve the overall performance of the model. In this study, actual evapotranspiration (ETa) data was obtained from the two different sets of satellite based remote sensing data. One dataset estimates ETa based on the Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model while the other one estimates ETa based on the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model. The hydrological model used in this study is the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which was calibrated against spatially distributed ETa and single point stream flow records for the Honeyoey Creek-Pine Creek Watershed, located in Michigan, USA. Two different techniques, multi-variable and genetic algorithm, were used to calibrate the SWAT model. Using the aforementioned datasets, the performance of the hydrological model in estimating ETa was improved using both calibration techniques by achieving Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values >0.5 (0.73-0.85), percent bias (PBIAS) values within +/- 25% (+/- 21.73%), and root mean squared error - observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) values <0.7 (0.39-0.52). However, the genetic algorithm technique was more effective with the ETa calibration while significantly reducing the model performance for estimating the streamflow (NSE: 0.32-0.52, PBIAS: +/- 32.73%, and RSR: 0.63-0.82). Meanwhile, using the multi-variable technique, the model performance for estimating the streamflow was maintained with a high level of accuracy (NSE: 0.59-0.61, PBIAS: 13.70%, and RSR: 0.63-0.64) while the evapotranspiration estimations were improved. Results from this assessment shows that incorporation of remotely sensed and spatially distributed data can improve the hydrological model performance if it is coupled with a right calibration technique.

TI  - Disturbance-Informed Annual Land Cover Classification Maps of Canada's Forested Ecosystems for a 29-Year Landsat Time Series
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification of large geographic areas over multiple decades at an annual time step is now possible based upon free and open access to the Landsat data archive. Annual gap-free, best-available-pixel, surface reflectance, image composites and annual forest change maps have been generated for Canada for the years 1984 to 2012. Using these data, we demonstrate the Virtual Land Cover Engine (VLCE), a framework for change-informed annual land cover mapping, over the 650million ha forested ecosystems of Canada, to produce a 29-year data cube of land cover. Post-processing aimed to reduce spurious class transitions is undertaken integrating change information, land cover transition likelihoods, and year-on-year class membership likelihoods. Validation was assessed for a single year (2005) using independent data for an overall accuracy of 70.3% (+/- 2.5%). Key results are the detailed capture of trends in land cover, illustration of land cover links to disturbance processes, and insights related to the general stability of land cover over time with stand replacing disturbance followed by regeneration of forests. The portable mapping framework and resultant data products offer an integrated, long baseline, disturbance-informed and detailed depiction of land cover to meet science and program related information needs.

TI  - Another Worldview Is Possible: Grassroots Social Movements and the 'Great Work'
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF RELIGION NATURE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Observers such as Thomas Berry and David Korten have proposed that the contemporary 'Great Work' is to tell new stories, embodied in practical new politics and economics, to navigate the deep cultural and institutional transformations necessary for human communities to survive and flourish. Herein I argue that grassroots movements of excluded and impoverished people from around the globe are critical agents of this contemporary Great Work. Examining the cosmological, spiritual, and ethical concerns that emerged in the 2005 World Social Forum, I demonstrate that grassroots social movements are engaged in epistemic struggle over the meanings of development and globalization. They are telling alternative stories of human betterment, rooted in an alternative and emergent worldview. Movements are bringing forth notions of radical complexity, transformative and transforming religion and spiritualities, participatory and deliberative democracy in all spheres of life, and the understanding of the living Earth as sacred and as an ecumenical reference for the sacred.

TI  - EFFECTS OF SOIL SURFACE ROUGHNESS ON SOIL PROCESSES AND REMOTE SENSING DATA INTERPRETATION AND ITS MEASURING TECHNIQUES - A REVIEW
T2  - Polish Journal of Soil Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface roughness is a very important physical feature of soil, affecting various soil processes and accuracy of remote sensing data interpretation. Thus, there is a need to describe it quantitatively. The main aim of the paper was to show needs and benefits of collecting quantitative information about soil surface roughness which is the most relevant parameter used as an index to predict water and wind erosion. Surface roughness can reduce soil erosion and soil losses even by up to 31%. Thereby, it increases the development of fauna and flora and improves the structure of soil and its biological quality. In the first section of the paper there are presented definitions of soil roughness proposed by different authors. The next section explains how various factors influence soil surface roughness. Then, the categorization of soil surface roughness discussed in literature is presented. The next part of the paper includes information about a role of soil roughness in agricultural, soil science and a hydrology research. Moreover, soil surface roughness plays an important role in a remote sensing of soils. The knowledge of quantitative soil surface roughness allows more accurate interpretation of the soil properties from remote sensing data, because this soil feature can decrease soil spectra even over 70% and makes their analysis difficult. In addition, deepening knowledge about soil roughness will allow more precise conclusions about the amount of reflected shortwave solar radiation indirectly shaping the Earth's climate. In the final section, the techniques for measuring and indices for describing soil roughness are shown. However, the authors prefer a photogrammetry technique for collecting these data, because it is quick and easy to use, ensuring high resolution and accuracy of data (about 1 mm) and the image processing is currently simplified as software to process is absolutely affordable.

TI  - An investigation of drought prediction using various remote-sensing vegetation indices for different time spans
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Iran is a country in a dry part of the world and extensively suffers from drought. Drought is a natural and repeatable phenomenon definable at specified time and area. In addition, social and economic issues can be affected by drought. Information such as intensity, duration, and spatial coverage of drought can help decision makers to reduce the vulnerability of the drought-affected areas, therefore lessen the risks associated with drought episodes. Lack of long-term meteorological data for many parts of the country is one of the most important problems for drought monitoring in Iran. One of the useful ways for gathering information about soil and vegetation conditions is using satellite-based imagery. In this study, remotely sensed image data were applied in order to forecast and model the drought. To this end, SPI (standardized precipitation index) drought indicator was used to represent the drought and its intensity in different time spans (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months). Some vegetation indices (VIs) including normalized difference vegetation index, temperature condition index, vegetation condition index, and normalized difference vegetation index deviation were extracted using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer sensor imagery. These indices were plugged into the model to calculate the SPI. A unique Support Vector Machine classifier improved for all types of the SPI by applying various remotely sensed VIs. The best vegetation index for each kind of SPI was determined. In this framework, meteorological stations were clustered based on their land cover extracted from satellite-based indices before insertion to the model.

TI  - Effect of classifier selection, reference sample size, reference class distribution and scene heterogeneity in per-pixel classification accuracy using 26 Landsat sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A major issue in land cover mapping is classifier selection. Here we investigated classifier performance under different sample sizes, reference class distribution, and scene complexities. Twenty six 10 km x 10 km blocks with complete reference information across the continental US are used. Per-pixel classification took place using six spectral bands from Landsat imagery. The tested classifiers included Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Bootstrap-aggregation ensemble of decision trees (BagTE), artificial neural network up to 2 hidden layers, and deep neural network (DNN) up to 3 hidden layers. For the entire block, our accuracy assessment indicated that all classifiers, with the exception of NB (a Maximum Likelihood variant), performed similarly. However, when we concentrated on edge pixels (pixels at the border of adjacent land cover classes), it was clear that the SVM and KNN offer considerable accuracy advantages, especially for larger reference datasets. Because of their relatively low execution times SVM and KNN would be recommended for classifications using Landsat's spectral inputs and Anderson's 11-level classification scheme. However, both SVM and KNN demonstrated substantial accuracy degradation during the parameter grid search. For this reason, an exhaustive parameter optimization process is suggested. While the ANN and DNN neural network variants did not perform as well, their performance may have been restricted by the lack of rich contextual information in our simple six band per-pixel input space. The effect of class distribution in the training dataset was also evident on the calculated accuracy metric. Gradual accuracy degradation as edge pixel presence increased was also observed. Future work could focus on data-rich classification problems such as change detection using Landsat stacks or expand in high spectral or spatial resolution sensors.

AB  - Global warming is a factor that has widened over the last period of time, so monitoring ground temperature is needed to take measures to prevent this phenomenon. In the hope of preserving life on earth and bring balance in our life, as we use to have it, it is up to our civic duty to share the essentials of the scientific research done, for the doctoral thesis and came with some ideas and suggestion, to help our community to reach our goal. The objective of the study will describe a methodology used for estimating the terrestrial surface temperature by means of the geographic information systems technology, using the two Landsat thermal bands, acquired by the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) installed on the Landsat 8 satellite platform. A case study on the administrative area of Cristuru Secuiesc, located in the South-West part of Harghita County, will be approached in the paper. The primary data base consists of thermal bands (band 10 and band 11) and multispectral bands (2, 3, 4, 5) from the Landsat 8 mission, taken with OLI (Operational Land Imager) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) sensors. To carry out the study, the NDVI index will be calculated using the multispectral bands, while the thermal bands will be converted to several physical quantities in order to obtain the desired result. The paper describes the process of collecting data and processing it, to obtain valuable information on the surface temperature experienced by a computer, without the need for field measurements.

AB  - Spark is a computational platform for modelling wildfire behavior, developed for research, risk assessment and operational use. The platform has been designed for flexibility, allowing users to define wildfire models, process weather streams and spatial data, and visualize and analyze the resulting simulations. The core fire propagation solver is a raster-based level set method that calculates the progression of a fire perimeter over given terrain layers and allows the creation, merging and interaction of any number of individual fire perimeters. Propagation in different fuel types is implemented using text-based scripts that define the fire behavior and rate-of-spread, rather than having pre-determined models built into the system. This gives the system flexibility to implement any available fire behavior models. The system is currently being used to research and implement many aspects of fire behavior including the development of new rate-of-spread models, integration with meteorological and remote sensing data and the modelling of firebrand dynamics and fire-atmosphere interaction. The system is freely available to researchers, practitioners and managers in the wildfire community.

T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Funafuti Atoll, Tuvalu is located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, which has experienced some of the highest rates of global sea-level rise over the past 60 years. Atoll islands are low-lying accumulations of reef-derived sediment that provide the only habitable land in Tuvalu, and are considered vulnerable to the myriad possible impacts of climate change, especially sea-level rise. This study examines the shoreline change of twenty-eight islands in Funafuti Atoll between 2005 and 2015 using 0.65 m QuickBird, 0.46 m WorldView-2, and 0.31 m WorldView-3 imagery using an image segmentation and decision tree classification. Shoreline change estimates are compared to previous study that used a visual interpretation approach. The feasibility of estimating island area with Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data is explored using CLASlite software. Results indicate a 0.13% (0.35 ha) decrease in net island area over the study time period, with 13 islands decreasing in area and 15 islands increasing in area. Substantial decreases in island area occurred on the islands of Fuagea, Tefala and Vasafua, which coincides with the timing of Cyclone Pam in March, 2015. Comparison between the WorldView-2 shoreline maps and those created from Landstat-8 indicate that the estimates tend to be in higher agreement for islands that have an area > 0.5 ha, a compact shape, and no built structures. Ten islands had > 90% agreement, with percent disagreements ranging from 2.78 to 100%. The methods and results of this study speak to the potential of automated EoV shoreline monitoring through segmentation and classification tree approach, which would reduce down data processing and analysis time. With the growing constellation of high and medium spatial resolution satellite-based sensors and the development of semi or fully automated image processing technology, it is now possible to remotely assess the short and medium-term shoreline dynamics on dynamic atolls. Landsat estimates were reasonably matched to those derived from fine resolution imagery, with some caveats about island size and shape.

AB  - The extensive and freely available archive of Landsat satellite data is used throughout the world to assess forest changes over large areas and long time periods (30-40 years). But analyzing Landsat data in time-series is not free of challenges (e.g. data processing and storage capabilities, dealing with cloud cover and other data gaps, and accounting for changes in illumination conditions due to atmospheric effects, sun angle and vegetation phenology). In this research, we present a method used to create annual seamless cloud-free mosaics for the entire state of Victoria, Australia (19 Landsat tiles), for a 30 year period. These mosaics were created by first constructing yearly Best Available Pixel (BAP) composites from over 3000 individual scenes. Then, forested areas were analyzed in time-series to determine breakpoints (e.g. a disturbance event such as fire). Following this, the breakpoints were used to fit a piece-wise linear regression model through each pixel's temporal trajectory. In this way, data gaps and other radiometric anomalies were removed. These gap-free composites can be used by a variety of stakeholders for land management, statutory reporting and decision making activities. This ensures state-wide consistency, and offers significant savings in processing and storage requirements.

In this case, the premise of an walking prayer can be that it is not just a prayer for the people living in the land but also a battle against territorial spirits of that area. This hypothesis is made by asserting that there is a particular spirit that captures a particular area and that it must bind its spiritual activity through prayer. In particular, if a mission field is an area where are prohibited direct methods of missionary work or it could pose a hazard, the prayer ministry through walking prayer is the most appropriate mission strategy. What is needed to do this strategically is a spiritual mapping that depicts the location of other religious facilities in the vicinity. With the map, a spiritual war is carried out with the premise that the region can be bound spiritually while praying for a place where prayers should be concentrated.Although there is a strength of spiritual warfare through the power of the Holy Spirit and prayer as a strategy to overcome the limits of direct missions, there is also a problem. It is the problem of missiological syncretism and the danger to see missions only as power encounters. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the background of claiming the territorial spirits and the biblical validity of it. In this paper, the author will examine the hypothesis of the territorial spirits through Peter Wagner's book, and make a theological criticism on it. Based on this analysis, this paper has a purpose to present a balanced understanding of spiritual warfare in missions.

AB  - This study examined two poems from Kokinshu written by Tsurayuki and Narihira. In his book 『Korai Huteisho』 and Uta-awase, Shunzei assessed Tsurayuki’s 「Musubu Teno~(むすぶ手の～)」 and Narihira’s 「Tsukiya Aranu~(月やあらぬ～)」, as the best poems by emphasizing importance of Keiki and a using of series of words. Tsurayuki and Narihira have different styles, therefore they tried to describe different worldview of poetry. In spite of the difference in their styles, they have common ground which makes their works would be selected as the best poems in Kokinshu. Through this point, the researcher examined and researched the common ground of two writers. As a result of research, three characteristicsusing a series of words seeking Shunzei’s aesthetic ideal, a series of contents which is derived from the series of words, and a plentiful reflection of Keiki as entire backgroundwere acknowledged.

TI  - Mapping of Rice Varieties and Sowing Date Using X-Band SAR Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is a major staple food for nearly half of the world's population and has a considerable contribution to the global agricultural economy. While spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have proved to have great potential to provide rice cultivation area, few studies have been performed to provide practical information that meets the user requirements. In rice growing regions where the inter-field crop calendar is not uniform such as in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, knowledge of the start of season on a field basis, along with the planted rice varieties, is very important for correct field management (timing of irrigation, fertilization, chemical treatment, harvest), and for market assessment of the rice production. The objective of this study is to develop methods using SAR data to retrieve in addition to the rice grown area, the sowing date, and the distinction between long and short cycle varieties. This study makes use of X-band SAR data from COSMO-SkyMed acquired from 19 August to 23 November 2013 covering the Chau Thanh and Thoai Son districts in An Giang province, Viet Nam, characterized by a complex cropping pattern. The SAR data have been analyzed as a function of rice parameters, and the temporal and polarization behaviors of the radar backscatter of different rice varieties have been interpreted physically. New backscatter indicators for the detection of rice paddy area, the estimation of the sowing date, and the mapping of the short cycle and long cycle rice varieties have been developed and assessed. Good accuracy has been found with 92% in rice grown area, 96% on rice long or short cycle, and a root mean square error of 4.3 days in sowing date. The results have been discussed regarding the generality of the methods with respect to the rice cultural practices and the SAR data characteristics.

TI  - Multitemporal LiDAR improves estimates of fire severity in forested landscapes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat-based fire severity maps have limited ecological resolution, which can hinder assessments of change to specific resources. Therefore, we evaluated the use of pre- and post-fire LiDAR, and combined LiDAR with Landsat-based relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) estimates, to increase the accuracy and resolution of basal area mortality estimation. We vertically segmented point clouds and performed model selection on spectral and spatial pre- and post-fire LiDAR metrics and their absolute differences. Our best multitemporal LiDAR model included change in mean intensity values 2-10 m above ground, the sum of proportion of canopy reflection above 10 m, and differences in maximum height. This model significantly reduced root-mean-squared error (RMSE), root-mean-squared prediction error (RMSPE), and bias when compared with models using only RcINBR. Our top combined model integrated RdNBR with LiDAR return proportions <2 m above ground, pre-fire 95% heights and pre-fire return proportions <2 m above ground. This model also significantly reduced RMSE, RMSPE, and bias relative to RdNBR. Our results confirm that three-dimensional spectral and spatial information from multitemporal LiDAR can isolate disturbance effects on specific ecological resources with higher accuracy and ecological resolution than Landsat-based estimates, offering a new frontier in landscape-scale estimates of fire effects.

TI  - Molecular basis of the Duffy blood group system
T2  - BLOOD TRANSFUSION
M3  - Review
AB  - ACKR1, located on chromosome 1q23.2, is the gene that encodes a glycoprotein expressing the Duffy blood group antigens. This gene is transcribed in two mRNA variants yielding two isoforms, encoding proteins with 338 and 336 amino acids. This review provides a general overview of the Duffy blood group to characterise and elucidate the genetic basis of this system. The Fy(a) and Fy(b) antigens are encoded by co-dominant FY*A (FY*01) and FY*B (FY*02) alleles, which differ by c.125G>A (rs12075), defining the Fy(a+b-), Fy(a-b+) and Fy(a+b+) phenotypes. The Fy(a-b-) phenotype that occurs in Africans provides an explanation for the apparent absence of Plasmodium vivax in this region: this phenotype arises from homozygosity for the FY*B allele carrying a point mutation c.1-67T>C (rs2814778), which prevents Fy(b) antigen expression only in red blood cells. The same mutation has also been found on the FY*A allele, but it is very rare. The Fy(a-b-) phenotype in Europeans and Asians arises from mutations in the coding region of the FY*A or FY*B allele, preventing Duffy antigen expression on any cell in the body and thus are true Duffy null phenotypes. According to the International Society for Blood Transfusion, ten alleles are associated with the null expression of the Fy antigens. Furthermore, different allelic forms of FY*B modify Fy(b) antigen expression, which may result in very weak or equivocal serology results. The mostly common found variants, c.265C>T (rs34599082) and c.298G>A (rs13962) - previously defined in combination only with the FY*B allele - have already been observed in the FY*A allele. Thus, six alleles have been recognised and associated with weak expression of the Fy antigens. Considering the importance of the Duffy blood group system in clinical medicine, additional studies via molecular biology approaches must be performed to resolve and clarify the discrepant results that are present in the erythrocyte phenotyping.

TI  - A Novel Color Fluorescence Navigation System for Intraoperative Transcutaneous Lymphatic Mapping and Resection of Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer: Comparison with the Combination of Gamma Probe Scanning and Visible Dye Methods
T2  - ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of a novel imaging system (HyperEye Medical System [HEMS]; Mizuho Corp., Tokyo, Japan) that uses the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence of indocyanine green to analyze sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies for the staging of breast cancer. Methods: This study enrolled 91 patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer that was clinically node negative with a tumor size < 3 cm. We compared SLN identification rates between HEMS and conventional methods (gamma probe scanning using a colloidal radioisotope [RI] and a blue dye method) by analyzing the relationships of lymphatic to axillary lesions and SLNs. Results: The identification rate of SLNs was 100% using HEMS, 97.8% using the RI method, and 95.6% using the blue dye method. Two types of lymphatic pathway (LP) were detected in 39 patients (42.9%) and also clearly identified using HEMS-captured color and NIR fluorescence. The incidence of two or more SLNs was significantly higher in patients with a two-route LP to the axilla group than in those with only one route (p < 0.001; 43.6 vs. 9.6%). Conclusions: The HEMS NIR fluorescence color imaging method is a promising potential modality for higher-level identification of SLNs than a standard combination of the RI and blue dye methods.

AB  - Much management analysis and advice is based upon the assumption that people act in a rational manner. Ernst Beier, University of Utah, proposed a theory in his book People Reading that explains why irrationality is a key component of much human behavior. This article focuses on two Beier principles with implications for management. The first principle explores the conflict between what people rationally want and their subconscious desires. A second principle states that people try to influence others to support their worldview. This article gives management examples of these two principles and concludes with an analysis of how they undermine performance appraisal.

T2  - RESILIENCE-INTERNATIONAL POLICIES PRACTICES AND DISCOURSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The global diffusion and reification of resilience - as the innate acceptance of vulnerability and suffering - has become an increasingly common feature in global development and humanitarian discourses. The advocacy of Disaster Risk Reduction represents a central technique of this global ontology of resilience that aims to influence the individual, the society and the state. This article explores how this global worldview of resilience is received by local rationalities of resilience in the Caribbean. This is achieved by examining Caribbean art as a re-presentational form of identity that shapes distinct ontological understandings of insecurity and vulnerability, which subsequently affects the possibilities of subjectivisation which lead towards local creative resistance or a global consent of suffering.

AB  - With the ever increasing amount of meteorological data available, from satellites in particular, it becomes more and more important to use as large fraction of this data as practically possible for operational weather forecasts. Two applications are shown where more data are used in ensemble data assimilation and forecasting by distributing satellite data among different ensemble members. For the Ensemble of Data Assimilations (EDA), a version of the perturbed observations ensemble Kalman filter, the ensemble mean error can in theory be reduced by replacing observation perturbations by distributing different subsets of observations to different members, but in practice this is complicated by observation error correlations and the need to maintain the same level of spread in the ensemble as before. For the ensemble forecasts, it is shown that the initial conditions can be improved by re-centring EDA perturbations on multiple equally good analyses that use different subsets of observations instead of re-centring all EDA perturbations on a single one of those analyses. It is shown how the ensemble mean error decreases for decreased error correlation between analyses. We estimate that in practice only 5-6 analysis are needed to obtain 80% of the root mean square error reduction that would be achieved with infinite number of analyses.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to field a critical response to Kog and Yaman (2016) specifically; and more widely, to strengthen debate on contractor selection (CS) research.Design/methodology/approach Critical narrative and opinion based on personal worldview, experiential knowledge and future insight/vision.Findings It is argued that enduring CS research has become somewhat stagnated. It has over-emphasised selection process models vis-a-vis the reliability and currency of their processing components, and has inadequately focused on achieving real-life impact.Research limitations/implications The principal implication is to engender constructive debate in the field and encourage a change of direction in CS research. The limitation is that this response reflects a personal view and so will be open to challenge.Practical implications Potential to encourage increased practicability, accessibility and generalisability of CS research products, leading to their increased real-life take-up and improved impact on practice.Social implications For society, the optimal implications would be improved project outcomes; healthier stakeholders' financial interests; and an enhanced constructed environment.Originality/value The content is entirely original insofar as it comprises a personal viewpoint.

AB  - This paper is aimed at introducing a model for atmospheric correction and cirrus clouds removal from MSI images, based on the 6S model. Two images with cirrus occurrence were processed and visually compared with the image with no correction. Ground reflectance of three targets in one image was obtained from bands with cirrus removal and without the removal. Besides, a comparison was carried out with an OLI image collected four days apart and with no cirrus occurrence. The results show that the corrected bands were sharper than the non-corrected ones. Bands with cirrus removal had fewer differences to the OLI corresponding bands than the ones that had only atmospheric correction without cirrus removal. Corrected surface reflectance from the model yielded values which were more consistent for the analyzed targets. It is concluded that the presented model is suitable for atmospheric correction and cirrus removal from MSI of Sentinel 2A images.

AB  - The ecological risk assessment is vital to rational use of land resources, and environmental management. In this study, the ecological risk of land use change, including the spatial and temporal distribution, in Beijing, China from 2001-2013, was analysed using geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS). Spatial autocorrelation analysis and elastic response analysis of ecological risk was conducted. Results showed that the distribution of ecological risk in Beijing was closely related to local land use patterns. The ecological risk in northwest area of Beijing was relatively lower, whereas that in the southeast was higher. The global spatial autocorrelation coefficient (Moran I) of Beijing in 2001, 2007, and 2013 were 0.74, 0.58, and 0.72, respectively. Local spatial autocorrelation indicated that the region with the highest ecological risk and elastic response was distributed in the southeast area of Beijing. Hot spot analysis showed a high degree of consistency in the hotspots of ecological risk in 2001-2013, but the difference between cold spots is significant. In 2001, 2007, and 2013, the elastic response of ecological risk of land use change presented spatial and temporal differentiations. This study provides a preliminary data support for rational land use and sustainable urban development.

AB  - Mapping of sea ice in the Arctic region is essential for environmental monitoring and ship navigation. Synthetic Aperture Radar can be used to observe sea ice at high spatial and temporal resolutions over an extended range at high latitudes. The sea ice discrimination method based on Support Vector Machine was applied to 226 scenes of Sentinel-1 acquired in Extra Wide Swath Mode with dual-polarization (HH & HV) from 1 July 2016 to 31 August 2016 along the Northern Sea Route from the Kara Sea to the Chukchi Sea. The discriminated sea ice results were evaluated using both manually classified ice maps and Multisensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent (MASIE). It is revealed that the proposed method based on the backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)), incidence angle, air temperature, and wind speed improves the sea ice and water discrimination, showing matching rates of approximately 93.4% for manual classification and 82.8% for MASIE. It is concluded that the method could be considered for an operational use to discriminate summer sea ice from open water in the Northern Sea Route.

TI  - Haze removal for new generation optical sensors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Haze and cloud contamination is a common problem in optical remote-sensing imagery, as it can lead to the inaccurate estimation of physical properties of the surface derived from remote sensing and reduced accuracy of land cover classification and change detection. Haze optimized transform (HOT) is a methodology applicable to radiometric compensation of additive haze effects in visible bands that exhibits a spatially complex distribution over an image. The generic approach of HOT allows for the use of older satellite imaging sensors that include at least two visible bands (e.g. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) sensors). This study proposes modifications to extend HOT applicability to new sensors. The improvements and extended functionality adapt the method to the higher radiometric resolution specifications of newer generation sensors and use percentile-based minimum in the correction procedure to avoid causing fake minimum. Alternative filters are also evaluated to smooth raw HOT output and the cloud mask is generated as an additional output. A Landsat 8 scene of Los Angeles is used to demonstrate the improved methodology. The methodology is applicable to sensors such as QuickBird, Worldview 2/3. More than 20 additional scenes were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology.

TI  - AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE RELATION BETWEEN PALSAR-2 BACKSCATTER AND FOREST STAND VOLUME

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - This study was conducted to improve normalized backscattering coefficients of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for topographic effects reduction. The SAR data in the study is ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 with 6-m resolution for Kwangneung experimental forest (KEF) that was acquired on April 7, 2015. We analyzed the relationship between backscattering coefficients and forest stand volume based on the 6th national forest inventory (NFI) data.The following topographic correction method was used for accurate forest stand volume estimation.The potential for improving the accuracy of the stand volume estimation at the test site located at the KEF on the basis of PALSAR-2 data should be evaluated using the digital elevation model (DEM)-adjusted topographic normalized backscattering coefficients. In this context, two backscattering coefficients are of particular importance, namely the backscatters on flat terrain gamma degrees and on the tilted terrain gamma(s)degrees.In this study, the relation between gamma degrees and the forest stand volume that is derived using a 5-m DEM is compared to that between gamma degrees and the stand volume derived using a 30-m ASTER GDEM. Similarly, based on DEM resolution, the comparison of forest stand volume was conducted on basis of gamma(s)degrees.The coefficient of determination R-2 for PALSAR-2 gamma degrees using the 30-m ASTER GDEM is observed to be smaller than that for PALSAR-2 gamma degrees based on the 5-m DEM by 0.038.Additionally, the coefficient of determination R-2 for PALSAR-2 gamma degrees is always observed to be lower than PALSAR-2 gamma(s)degrees. Therefore, it is inferred through comparison based on the observed standard deviation to the change in forest stand volume that gamma(s)degrees depicts higher sensitivity. Owing to an improvement in the spatial resolution, the accurate estimation of forest biomass that is derived from such a relation requires a 6-m DEM which is equivalent to the resolution of PALSAR-2.

AB  - In Wittgenstein’s internal and external relations used in his early philosophy, the later can be regarded as the same concept as ‘different’ of Nagarjuna. In fact, external relation is a common world view as a relationship between things considered independent, and therefore there is no reason to differ from the Eastern and Western philosophical traditions. However, in the case of the internal relation, Wittgenstein’s early philosophy distinguishes it from ‘one’ of Nagarjuna due to his atomistic ontology. Nevertheless, the fact that internal relations fall into the definition of circularity, and that it is a necessary relation between formal concepts, is the same as that of Nagarjuna’s ‘one’ i.e. ’the relations between the parts when one is divided.According to Nagarjuna’ argumentations in his Mulamadhyamakakarika, the core doctrine of buddhistic philosophy, i.e. dependent origination(pratityasamutpada) is the act of constructing a boundary by dividing a whole into parts, and this act is contradictory due to the overlap of the two relations ‘one’ and ‘different’, Emptiness(Sunyata) means that there is no substance at these boundaries and our language is deeply involved in the act of creating boundaries On the other hand, Wittgenstein himself dismissed his atomistic worldview in later philosophy. Now the language or world does not have a logical form given uniquely, but its internal structure can change according to the aspect and purpose of language game. Furthermore, the language or the world may be in a state in which there is no relation internally, that is, not divided. In this respect, it would also be meaningful to study Wittgenstein’s internal and external relations, and the two relations ‘one’ and ‘different’ in Nagarjuna’s work side by side.

AB  - This study examines the ideological demands and linguistic situations of the early 1920s that surrounded the event of the publication of Onoeeu Mudo(Dance of Agony), the very first collection of modern poetry translated by Kim Eok, in order to reevaluate the significance of his works in a sense of invention of possibilities in modernizing Joseon under Japanese colonialism. In spite of the limitations of narrow content of the translation that has been critically analyzed, it is important to look at the compositional possibility of modern self and modern poetic language that Kim Eok opened through his poetic writing between translation and creative writing, in a sense of the emergence of a literary ‘worldview.’ What is noteworthy here is the matter of ecriture, the continual events of invention of ‘modern-Korean-poetic-language.’ To reveal the significance of inventional performance of poetic ecriture, I will look at what the existential and ontological demands on the ‘modern worldview’ were in the early 1920s first, in a comparison with the tendency of the 1910s. Then I’d like to examine how the initial works of Kim Eok generated the scope for ‘worldview’ in modernizing Joseon under colonial conditions analyzing how the ‘language of translation’ held its own sense of ‘world.’  In the process of inventing ‘writing’ in a multi-lingual situation, while crossing the boundaries between languages, Kim Eok had to constantly find himself in the linguistic reality that did not allow him to imagine langauge of Joseon as a ‘pure’ and ‘unadulterated’ written language. His language of translation was engraved with traces of the difficulties between realization of incompleteness of language and desire for completeness. These traces are also found in various ‘poetic-ecriture’ of other poets in the 1920s. Therefore, following the vestiges of ecriture in Onoeeu Mudo(Dance of Agony), the very first collection of poetic ecriture, would be an important starting point for examining how the ‘literary worldview’ and‘lyricism’ were imagined and constructed based on, or void of, a sense of linguistic completeness in colonial Joseon.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Science has become a major source of knowledge. Yet, if we take it to be the only authority on understanding the world, the legitimate trust in the results of scientific research can easily turn into a quasi-religious belief. Pragmatic humanism defies such a scientism and the implied reductionist worldview. It rather pleads for a naturalism that acknowledges the primacy of human experience and therefore understands science as one way of inquiry among others. Since science is a human activity, it is not a disinterested quest for truth. Hence, the way science is practiced and organized comes into focus. Pragmatic humanism advocates a pluralization of science and underlines its relevance for democracy.

AB  - Pragmatic humanism holds a critical attitude toward historic religions, yet it is not anti-religious per se. It aims at a humanist and naturalist reform of religious traditions. Furthermore, the question as to how a humanist stance relates to religious traditions and other systems of belief is crucial for its self-understanding. Is it just a method of criticizing religions, or rather a religion on its own?

AB  - Sentinel-1 represents a major step forward in enabling us to monitor the Earth's hazardous tectonic and volcanic zones. Here, we present the latest progress from the Centre for the Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics (COMET), where we provide deformation results to the community for volcanoes and the tectonic belts.For the estimation of seismic hazard, we require relative accuracy on the order of 1 mm/yr between points 100 km apart. This requires mass processing of long time series of radar acquisitions. As of January 2018, we are producing interferograms systematically for the entire Alpine-Himalayan belt (similar to 9000 x 2000 km) and the majority of subaerial volcanoes. Currently we make interferograms and coherence products available to the community, but we plan to also provide average deformation rates and displacement time series, in the future. The results are made available through a dedicated COMET portal, and we are in the process of linking them to the ESA G-TEP and EPOS.COMET also responds routinely to significant continental earthquakes, larger than similar to Mw 6.0. The short repeat interval of Sentinel-1, together with the rapid availability of the data, allows us to do this within a few days for most earthquakes. For example, after the Mw 7.8 Kaikoura earthquake we supplied a processed interferogram to the community just 5 hours and 37 minutes after the Sentinel-1 acquisition.In this paper we provide an overview of some of the latest results for tectonics and volcanism and discuss how the accuracy of these products will improve as the number of data products acquired by Sentinel-1 increases.

AB  - This paper attempts to provide an understanding of the potential application of Sentinel-2 imagery for the monitoring and detection of disease symptoms caused by Xylella fastidiosa (XI) in olive trees. A time series data of 188 Sentinel-2a images collected over the last two years was used to analyse the temporal trends in areas with Xf infected olive trees in Puglia, Southern Italy. The robustness of different physiological and structural hyperspectral indices was evaluated as an early indicator of Xf symptoms. Three validation sites for Sentinel-2a products were hence established over olive orchards in the Xf-infected zone in two different years (2016 and 2017) and overflown with a hyperspectral sensor to acquire high spatial resolution images (50 cm). Disease incidence and severity levels were recorded for more than 3300 olive trees in 18 orchards. Results demonstrate the capability of temporal Sentinel-2a was able to detect and discriminate between high and medium Xf incidence, reaching the maximum differences during the summer season. Among all the vegetation indices evaluated from Sentinel-2 imagery, OSAVI showed superior performance for detecting Xf incidence trends and OSAVI(1510) for detecting changes in Xf severity levels.

M3  - Article
AB  - Three modern cosmological models are considered in the article: the Standard Cosmological Model, the theory "Evolving Matter" and the Mental Universe, which, according to the authors, clearly demonstrate the change of the worldview paradigm in modern society: a rational worldview gives way to an irrational world view, or a new form of idealism. In the article, the authors answer the question: how the change of cosmological paradigms affects the educational research. As a result of the study, the authors come to the conclusion that under the influence of the modern hypothesis of the Intelligent Matter and the Mental Universe rethinking of the subject and object of the educational research takes place. The subject of the educational research is the neural structure of the brain and the peculiarities of impact on it in ontogenesis, and the object of the educational research becomes the involvement of a neural structure in cosmic processes and the features of its development under the influence of the cosmos.

TI  - Early Loss of Optic Cup with Increased Intracranial Pressure
T2  - NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A 54-year-old woman developed increased intracranial pressure due to chronic dural venous sinus thrombosis in the absence of significant comorbidity. In the years preceding diagnosis, the patient underwent routine diabetic retinopathy screening; however, gradual loss of optic cup and disc swelling was only retrospectively noted after marked papilloedema was evident at an optometry visit. The patient made a full recovery once the diagnosis was established. This case is novel in the literature as routine photographs, taken for diabetic retinopathy screening, demonstrate the natural history of papilloedema before medical intervention. Interestingly, these images show that a traditionally "late" sign of papilloedema - loss of cup - can be the sentinel abnormality. This finding may have significant clinical implications and reinforces the need for clinicians to compare investigation results with historical patient data.

AB  - Estimation of forest aboveground biomass is crucial for carbon accounting and forest management. In this paper we present the estimation of forest above ground biomass derived from a combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data using the Random Forest Regression approach The research was conducted over a temperate forest in Poland, where the forest biomass is ranging from 1 to 300 t/ha. The results revealed a saturation effect around 200 t/ha. The biomass model tends to overestimate small values of aboveground biomass and underestimate larger values of biomass (greater than 250 t/ha). The overall RMSE value is equal to 60 t/ha, however it varies for biomass ranges. The independent validation performed at the forest stand level showed the best agreement for biomass ranging for 100-200 t/ha. This research was conducted as part of the ESA funded DUE GlobBiomass project.

AB  - Various factors have been cited for forest dieback including global warming and dryness, overgrazing damage by wild animals, forest fires, and damage by insects. In this study, we apply a tree measurement (TM) survey to examine living and dead (dieback) trees, as well as obtain a Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) measurement. Extraction of fallen and dieback tree pixels using time series Landsat satellite data, including an analysis of microgeomorphology characteristics (slope and solar radiation) of dieback trees using 30 m Terra/ASTER DEM data were employed. Results show a majority of dieback trees in places with a large amount of insolation with a small slope, with DBH of white birch trees largest on slopes with altitudes of 1,550 m to 1,700 m.

AB  - In this study, a cross-calibration approach was applied to combine RADARSAT-2 and RapidEye sensors for biomass monitoring over corn fields. First, RapidEye and RADARSAT-2 sensors were compared in terms of biomass estimation. Then the estimated biomass from RADARSAT-2 was cross-calibrated with respect to the biomass estimated from RapidEye. Combination of the optical and cross-calibrated Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) derived biomass was proposed to have higher temporal resolution biomass maps. Vegetation indices including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), red-edge triangular vegetation index (RTVI), simple ratio (SR) and red-edge simple ratio (SRre) were used for modeling of biomass estimation from RapidEye. Water Cloud Model (WCM)was also used for biomass estimation from RADARSAT-2. Data collected during SMAP Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12) field campaign was used for validation. The results demonstrate that the accuracies of biomass estimations from RapidEye and RADARSAT-2 are close. For RapidEye, the highest accuracies derived from RTVI index with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.92 and Root Mean Square of (RMSE) of 118.18 gr/m(2). The R values derived from RADARSAT-2 is 0.83 and its RMSE is 171.93 gr/m(2). After cross-calibration of the biomass derived from RADARSAT-2 versus those derived from RapidEye, the RMSE of estimates dropped by 18.86 gr/m(2).

AB  - Objective: This study aims to explore the application value and detection rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in accurate detecting of lymph node metastasis in patients with gastric cancer.Patients and Methods: A total of 24 patients with Stage I, II or III gastric cancer, from 2015 to 2017, were admitted to our department and underwent D2-gastrectomy plus lymphadenectomy. All 236 nodes were sectioned and stained with immunohistochemical staining (IHC). Lymph node micro-metastasis was defined as evidencing to be positively stained or via the IHC process.Results: The results indicated that gastric cancer stage 1 was significantly correlated with higher lymphatic metastasis.Conclusions: Given the very low frequency of malignant non-sentinel lymph nodes was detected in stage 1, it could be logic and safe to merely dissected sentinel nodes without extended lymph node dissection while operation.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The main aim of this study is to generate groundwater spring potential maps for the Ningtiaota area (China) using three statistical models namely statistical index (SI), index of entropy (IOE) and certainty factors (CF) models. Firstly, 66 spring locations were identified by field surveys, out of which, 46 (70%) spring locations were randomly selected for training the models and the rest 20 (30%) spring locations were used for validation. Secondly, 12 spring influencing factors, namely slope angle, slope aspect, altitude, profile curvature, plan curvature, sediment transport index, stream power index, topographic wetness index, distance to roads, distance to streams, lithology and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were derived from the spatial database. Subsequently, using the mentioned factors and the three models, groundwater spring potential values were calculated and the results were plotted in ArcGIS 10.0. Finally, the area under the curve was used to validate groundwater spring potential maps. The results showed that the IOE model, with the highest success rate of 0.9126 and the highest prediction rate of 0.9051, showed the preferable performance in this study. The results of this study may be helpful for planners and engineers in groundwater resource management and other similar watersheds.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - China's grasslands play a significant role in the carbon cycle. Accurately evaluating carbon use efficiency (CUE) of grassland ecosystems is of great importance. Therefore, we adopted moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer documents to explore dynamics and controls of CUE across grasslands of China from 2001 to 2010. Results demonstrated that CUE presented an increasing trend (0 to 0.0067 year(-1)) in the most studies regions except for desert steppe (-0.0046 to 0 year(-1)). At spatial scale, the precipitation, temperature, and aridity index significantly regulated the dynamics of CUE in alpine grasslands. Furthermore, the different mechanisms are explored at the transect scale, and CUE revealed the positive correlation with aridity index (R-2 = 0.92, P<0.0001) and precipitation (R-2 = 0.88, P<0.0001), but a negative correlation with temperature (R-2 = 0.92, P<0.0001) in alpine grasslands. However, in temperate grasslands, CUE exposed the negative correlation with aridity index (R-2 = 0.40, P<0.0001) and precipitation (R-2 = 0.54, P<0.0001), but a positive correlation with temperature (R-2 = 0.56, P<0.0001). Moreover, precipitation was decreasing with the increased temperature in the alpine grasslands (R-2 = 0.85, P<0.0001) and temperature of grasslands (R-2 = 0.19, P<0.0001). In conclusion, CUE had a slight increased trend across grasslands in China, with higher precipitation, aridity index, and lower temperature promoting CUE in the alpine region - nevertheless restraining the CUE variations in grassland temperature. The better heat and water conditions in temperate grasslands than in alpine grasslands resulted in higher CUE in temperate grasslands.

TI  - A hybrid training approach for leaf area index estimation via Cubist and random forests machine-learning
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With an increasing volume and dimensionality of Earth observation data, enhanced integration of machine-learning methodologies is needed to effectively analyze and utilize these information rich data sets. In machine-learning, a training dataset is required to establish explicit associations between a suite of explanatory 'predictor' variables and the target property. The specifics of this learning process can significantly influence model validity and portability, with a higher generalization level expected with an increasing number of observable conditions being reflected in the training dataset. Here we propose a hybrid training approach for leaf area index (LAI) estimation, which harnesses synergistic attributes of scattered in-situ measurements and systematically distributed physically based model inversion results to enhance the information content and spatial representativeness of the training data. To do this, a complimentary training dataset of independent LAI was derived from a regularized model inversion of RapidEye surface reflectances and subsequently used to guide the development of LAI regression models via Cubist and random forests (RF) decision tree methods. The application of the hybrid training approach to a broad set of Landsat 8 vegetation index (VI) predictor variables resulted in significantly improved LAI prediction accuracies and spatial consistencies, relative to results relying on in-situ measurements alone for model training. In comparing the prediction capacity and portability of the two machine-learning algorithms, a pair of relatively simple multi-variate regression models established by Cubist performed best, with an overall relative mean absolute deviation (rMAD) of similar to 11%, determined based on a stringent scene-specific cross-validation approach. In comparison, the portability of RF regression models was less effective (i.e., an overall rMAD of similar to 15%), which was attributed partly to model saturation at high LAI in association with inherent extrapolation and transferability limitations. Explanatory VIs formed from bands in the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared domains (e.g., NDWI) were associated with the highest predictive ability, whereas Cubist models relying entirely on VIs based on NIR and red band combinations (e.g., NDVI) were associated with comparatively high uncertainties (i.e., rMAD similar to 21%). The most transferable and best performing models were based on combinations of several predictor variables, which included both NDWI- and NDVI-like variables. In this process, prior screening of input VIs based on an assessment of variable relevance served as an effective mechanism for optimizing prediction accuracies from both Cubist and RF. While this study demonstrated benefit in combining data mining operations with physically based constraints via a hybrid training approach, the concept of transferability and portability warrants further investigations in order to realize the full potential of emerging machine-learning techniques for regression purposes.

TI  - Identifying Forest Impacted by Development in the Commonwealth of Virginia through the Use of Landsat and Known Change Indicators
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the effectiveness of using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from 1326 different Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper images in finding low density development within the Commonwealth of Virginia's forests. Individual NDVI images were stacked by year for the years 1995-2011 and the yearly maximum for each pixel was extracted, resulting in a 17-year image stack of all yearly maxima (a 98.7% data reduction). Using location data from housing starts and well permits, known previously forested housing starts were isolated from all other forest disturbance types. Samples from development disturbances and other forest disturbances, as well as from undisturbed forest, were used to derive vegetation index thresholds enabling separation of disturbed forest from undisturbed forest. Disturbances, once identified, could be separated into Development Disturbances and Non-Development Disturbances using a classification tree and only two variables from the Disturbance Detection and Diagnostics (D-3) algorithm: the maximum NDVI in the available recovery period and the slope between the NDVI value at the time of the disturbance and the maximum NDVI in the available recovery period. Low density development disturbances of previous forest land cover had an F-measure, combining precision and recall into a single class-specific accuracy ( = 1), of 0.663. We compared our results to the NLCD 2001-2011 land cover changes from any forest (classes 41, 42, 43, and 90) to any developed (classes 21, 22, 23, and 24), resulting in an F-measure of 0.00 for the same validation points. Landsat time series stacks thus show promise for identifying even the small changes associated with low density development that have been historically overlooked/underestimated by prior mapping efforts. However, further research is needed to ensure that (1) the approach will work in other forest biomes and (2) enabling detection of these important, but spatially and spectrally subtle, disturbances still ensures accurate detection of other forest disturbances.

TI  - Long-lasting floods buffer the thermal regime of the Pampas
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of large water masses influences the thermal regime of nearby land shaping the local climate of coastal areas by the ocean or large continental lakes. Large surface water bodies have an ephemeral nature in the vast sedimentary plains of the Pampas (Argentina) where non-flooded periods alternate with flooding cycles covering up to one third of the landscape for several months. Based on temperature records from 17 sites located 1 to 700 km away from the Atlantic coast and MODIS land surface temperature data, we explore the effects of floods on diurnal and seasonal thermal ranges as well as temperature extremes. In non-flooded periods, there is a linear increase of mean diurnal thermal range (DTR) from the coast towards the interior of the region (DTR increasing from 10 to 16 K, 0.79 K/100 km, r (2) = 0.81). This relationship weakens during flood episodes when the DTR of flood-prone inland locations shows a decline of 2 to 4 K, depending on surface water coverage in the surrounding area. DTR even approaches typical coastal values 500 km away from the ocean in the most flooded location that we studied during the three flooding cycles recorded in the study period. Frosts-free periods, a key driver of the phenology of both natural and cultivated ecosystems, are extended by up to 55 days during floods, most likely as a result of enhanced ground heat storage across the landscape (similar to 2.7 fold change in day-night heat transfer) combined with other effects on the surface energy balance such as greater night evaporation rates. The reduced thermal range and longer frost-free periods affect plant growth development and may offer an opportunity for longer crop growing periods, which may not only contribute to partially compensating for regional production losses caused by floods, but also open avenues for flood mitigation through higher plant evapotranspirative water losses.

TI  - Evaluation of Accuracy and Practical Applicability of Methods for Measuring Leaf Reflectance and Transmittance Spectra
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf reflectance and transmittance spectra are urgently needed in interpretation of remote sensing data and modeling energy budgets of vegetation. The measurement methods should be fast to operate and preferably portable to enable quick collection of spectral databases and in situ measurements. At the same time, the collected spectra must be comparable across measurement campaigns. We compared three different methods for acquiring leaf reflectance and transmittance spectra. These were a single integrating sphere (ASD RTS-3ZC), a small double integrating sphere (Ocean Optics SpectroClip-TR), and a leaf clip (PP Systems UNI501 Mini Leaf Clip). With all methods, an ASD FieldSpec 4 spectrometer was used to measure white paper and tree leaves. Single and double integrating spheres showed comparable within-method variability in the measurements. Variability with leaf clip was slightly higher. The systematic difference in mean reflectance spectra between single and double integrating spheres was only minor (average relative difference of 1%), whereas a large difference (14%) was observed in transmittance. Reflectance measured with leaf clip was on average 14% higher compared to single integrating sphere. The differences between methods influenced also spectral vegetation indices calculated from the spectra, particularly those that were designed to track small changes in spectra. Measurements with double integrating sphere were four, and with leaf clip six times as fast as with single integrating sphere, if slightly reduced signal level (integration time reduced from optimum) was allowed for the double integrating sphere. Thus, these methods are fast alternatives to a conventional single integrating sphere. However, because the differences between methods depended on the measured target and wavelength, care must be taken when comparing the leaf spectra acquired with different methods.

TI  - Comparing L- and C-band synthetic aperture radar estimates of sea ice motion over different ice regimes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating sea ice motion from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery at C-band is the most reliable approach because of its high spatial resolution and ever increasing temporal resolution given the multiple current and upcoming SAR platforms. However, there is still uncertainty in SAR derived sea ice motion depending on the ice type and its thermodynamic state. There have been suggestions (mostly theoretical) that use of L-band SAR and its inherent longer wavelength (15-30 cm) and subsequent increased penetration capability could be beneficial for estimating sea ice motion, especially during the melt season. Here, we estimate and analyze sea ice motion for 9 pairs of C- and L-band SAR imagery from RADARSAT-2, PALSAR-1 and PALSAR-2 located in the Canadian Arctic over a variety of sea ice types at different thermodynamic states. Results show that the increased signal penetration of L-band SAR into multi-year ice (MYI) during the melt season facilitates the detection of more motion vectors with stronger cross-correlation coefficients compared to C-band SAR. Over newly formed ice and dry first-year ice, the reduced sensitivity to surface scattering and richer texture from L-band SAR imagery facilitates the detection of more motion vectors with stronger cross-correlation coefficients compared to C-band SAR. Over dry MYI, L-band provided stronger cross-correlation coefficients but C-band detected more motion vectors with a more representative spatial distribution. With Arctic sea ice continuing shift from a multi-year to first-year dominated icescape, coupled with an increasing melt season length, L-band SAR's ability to provide improved sea ice motion estimates during both the melt and freeze-up time periods could prove even more useful in the coming decades.

AB  - The sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar image analysis technology is conducted to measure river width in a multitemporal change in this study. With the field surveying work, two Sentinel-1A images taken on March 14 and May 24, 2018, have been obtained. Next the SNAP data processing software can be used to produce backscattering coefficient, and the values can be converted into intensity image. Low intensity features related with water body will be helpful for river width measurement. Moreover, an UAS flight also arranged on May 24 to take 525 photos with a DJI Phantom 4 Pro UAS under flying altitude of 120 meters. The Agisoft Photoscan Professional software used to produce an ortho-mosaic image in a spatial resolution of 3.39 cm for the comparison of geometrical differences in river width measurement. According to the comparison results with manual measurement, the derived difference of river width is 1.2 meters at the Zhongtou bridge in the Wuxi river.

TI  - Improvement of the multi-temporal InSAR method using reliable arc solutions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) technique, a deformation map is obtained through the integration of arc solutions. The reliability of the arc solutions directly influences the accuracy of the final deformation results. In this study, the influence of phase ambiguity on the arc solutions is analysed, and two indicators are proposed to identify the arcs with phase ambiguity. Precise variance-covariance estimation is implemented using the high-quality arcs, which are selected using four proposed indicators. The lambda method is used to perform phase unwrapping, and the low-quality arcs are removed according to the conditions of the indicators. In addition, the network is reconstructed based on a network search strategy to link as many coherent points as possible. Our improved MT-InSAR method is tested by processing 35 repeat COSMO-SkyMed (COnstellation of small Satellites for the Mediterranean basin Observation) SAR images covering Shanghai.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3-D) deformation fields associated with the 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaikoura earthquake in New Zealand are retrieved from SAR data acquired by ALOS-2 descending and Sentinel-1 ascending orbits based on the Pixel OffsetTracking technique In particular, a recently proposed method SM-VCE (Strain Model and Variance Component Estimation) is exploited to integrate the heterogeneous InSAR observations. The core idea of this method is exploiting the spatial correlation of the homogeneous points' deformations based on strain model, and determine the exact weights for the heterogeneous InSAR measurements by employing variance component estimation algorithm. The results reveal that the presented SM-VCE method is capable for the retrieval of complete and accurate 3-D deformation fields with respect to this event, which are highly consistent with the GNSS observations. In addition, accuracies of the used heterogeneous InSAR observations as well as the estimated 3-D deformations are quantitatively provided by the presented SM-VCE method.

AB  - Local climate zone (LCZ) is a categorical scheme describing the morphology of urban area, which is a valuable not only for the original purpose of temperature study, but also for other urban oriented studies like population density estimation and economical development monitoring. Standard LCZ production works only on individual cities using merely optical data, mostly LandSat-8 data. Our goal is to develop a framework that 1) can potentially work on a large number of cities, i.e., training on number of cities and testing on number of other cities; 2) exploits Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. In this paper, we investigated the potential of Sentinel-1 Dual-Pol data on producing LCZ maps in general. It shows the Sentinel-1 data could improve the classification accuracy of several LCZ classes. Joint use of LandSat-8 data, Open Street Map (OSM) data and Sentinel-1 data provide 62.05% overall accuracy, which is higher than 51.20% achieved by using only LandSat-8 and OSM data.

AB  - Aiming at the distribution of forest aboveground biomass in regional scale, a method of estimating forest aboveground biomass based on the optical image texture and airborne LiDAR metrics was proposed in the Daxing' an Mountains forest ecosystem station, and the influence of different feature factors was analyzed on the estimation accuracy. Firstly, the texture features of different bands of Landsat 8 OLI were extracted. Secondly, the airborne LiDAR point cloud was filtered to extract the ground points. The point cloud was normalized by ground points, and LiDAR metrics were extracted. Finally, the forest aboveground biomass was estimated by the extracted remote sensing feature factor by support vector regression, and the accuracy of the results was verified by in-situ data. The modeling accuracy of different bands and window sizes were quite different. The model accuracy was highest in blue band with the 7x7 window size, R<sup>2</sup> of 0.73, and RMSE of 22.32 t/ha. The model accuracy of the LiDAR metrics was normal distribution, and the highest accuracy of variable H50 was with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.75 and RMSE of 19.24 t/ha. Compared with the single variable, the model accuracy of the fusion optical image texture and the airborne LiDAR metrics was improved, and the estimated RMSE of coniferous and mixed forest were 19.63 and 20.40 t/ha, respectively.

TI  - REMOTE SENSING-BASED EXTRACTION OF SUMMER SNOWLINE AND ANALYSIS OF ITS VARIATION CHARACTERISTICS IN XINJIANG, CHINA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As a zero-balance line, lying between snow-covered and snow-free land areas, the snowline reflects the melting and retreating of snow and ice, which also mirrors the basic situation of climate and environment on mountain plateaus and in polar regions where there is a lack of ground meteorological stations. Thus, it is important to accurately extract and assess the distribution characteristics of the snow-line from hydrological, climatological, and geological aspects. This study extracted summer snowline data from the Xinjiang region in China using the snow cover duration ratio (SCDR) method with MODIS daily snow cover products (MOD10A1 and MYD10A1), IMS and Landsat data, and temperature and precipitation observations from 2001-2015. The variation and distribution characteristics of the summer snowline elevation were analyzed comparatively for the Xinjiang region and its different subareas. The results showed that snowline elevation data extracted using the SCDR method passed the accuracy test and therefore, it was considered suitable for the Xinjiang region. During 2001-2015, the average snowline elevation remained at about 3950 m within a 250-m range of fluctuation. However, linear trend analysis revealed an annual increasing trend of average snowline elevation with a tendency rate of 160.38 m/decade. The minimum snowline elevation exhibited a fluctuating upward trend, whereas the maximum snowline elevation showed a slight downward trend. Comparative analysis of snowline elevation in different areas of the Xinjiang region revealed a fluctuating upward trend in the Kunlun, Tianshan, and Altai Mountains The Altai Mountains showed the most stable variation of snowline elevation, followed by the Kunlun Mountains and then the Tianshan Mountains Spatially, the distribution of snowline elevation in the Xinjiang region was characterized by a decline from south to north with longitudinal zonation.

TI  - Urban landscape monitoring based on high-resolution spaceborne TerraSAR-X data: a case study of Nanjing City, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the performance of high-resolution spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for urban landscape monitoring has attracted increased interest, in particular for regions where rainy weather prevails throughout of year. In this study, the phase component of SAR data was exploited for landscape monitoring in the western area of Nanjing city, China. Twenty-six scenes of TerraSAR-X single-look complex (SLC) interferometric images were acquired for the period of May 2013 to February 2015 and applied for urban change detection as well as surface subsidence monitoring by means of interferometric SAR (InSAR) technologies. Firstly, a small baseline strategy in conjunction with a fast statistically homogeneous pixel selection (FaSHPS) approach were applied for the coherence imagery generation and for the coherent change detection, resulting in a correct probability of better than 90%. Second, the surface deformation was derived with millimetre accuracy using an enhanced multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) tool by synergistically analyzing the amplitudes and phases of the SAR acquisitions. This study indicates that high-resolution SAR data have the potential for urban landscape monitoring by taking advantage of the interferometric performance and the all-day and all-weather imaging capability.

AB  - Multi-source remote sensing data is rarely used for the comprehensive assessment of land ecologic environment quality. In this study, a digital environmental model was proposed with the inversion algorithm of land and environmental factors based on the multi-source remote sensing data, and a comprehensive index (Ecoindex) was applied to reconstruct and predict the land environment quality of the Dongting Lake Area to assess the effect of human activities on the environment. The main finding was that with the decrease of Grade. and Grade. quality had a decreasing tendency in the lake area, mostly in suburbs and wetlands. Atmospheric water vapour, land use intensity, surface temperature, vegetation coverage, and soil water content were the main driving factors. The cause of degradation was the interference of multi-factor combinations, which led to positive and negative environmental agglomeration effects. Positive agglomeration, such as increased rainfall and vegetation coverage and reduced land use intensity, could increase environmental quality, while negative agglomeration resulted in the opposite. Therefore, reasonable ecological restoration measures should be beneficial to limit the negative effects and decreasing tendency, improve the land ecological environment quality and provide references for macroscopic planning by the government.

AB  - Based on the origin data of Landsat TM images in 1980, 1995, 2000, 2006, 2012, this paper recurred to geoscience information spectrogram theory and utlized RS / GIS technologies, land use dynamic degree, land use transition matrixes and CA-Markov model to analyze the land use pattern change in Shiyang River Basin in the past 33 years, which was for the sake of discussing the spatial-temporal evolution rules and driving mechanism of land use in Shiyang River Basin. The results showed that: (1) There were apparent changes in the land use of Shiyang River Basin form 1980 to 2013. (2) in the past 33 years, the dynamic degrees of forest land, urban and rural resident construction land had relative large increase degree on the whole. (3) The main transition direction of land use types were arable land to grass land, grass land to unused land and unused land to arable land and forest land. (4) The CA-Markov model forecasting results indicated that there was no obvious change in land use construction in 2020. (5) The change of land use/cover brought desertification, mountainous runoff variation, the loss of water environment, vegetation coverage, water and soil, and a series of ecological environment problems.

AB  - Discrimination of ship's bow is a great application for marine surveillance in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image. The real ship contour is approximately elliptical and the bow's curvature is significantly larger than the stern's curvature. The increasing resolution of SAR image makes ship target appear to be more structured and shaped which makes discrimination of ship's bow possibly in SAR image. In this paper, we advance a method for discrimination of ship's bow which includes two important parts. The first part, we use the gradient vector flow (GVF) snake model with elliptical constraint (EC) to get a more realistic ship contour for curve fitting. The second part, we use the least squares quadratic polynomial curve fitting to fit the two ends of the contour along the ship's main shaft. The bigger absolute value of second order polynomial fitting coefficients, the more curved the rigid curve. The more curved end is identified as the ship's bow. Experiments performed on detected small-size ship slices which also called regions of interest (ROI).These ROI slices which come from RADARSAT-2 data and one ROI slice contains only one ship target. Experiment results illustrate the effective performance of proposed method on discrimination for the ship's bow in SAR image.

AB  - Unbalanced development may cause problems like inequality of living conditions and the lack of sustainability. Studies based on statistical data can hardly reveal the detailed characteristics of unbalanced development due to the limitation of statistical units, while the application of remote sensing data provides an effective solution. In this study, based on the DMSP/OLS nighttime light data, the development characteristics in China during 2000-2012 were analyzed from the perspectives of development level and speed. Meanwhile, development mechanism in different urbanization types was discussed to explore the trend of unbalanced development. The results reveal the severe unbalanced development pattern in China. It also indicates that the development gap between different regions will be widened, and the unbalanced development situation will be more notable in the near future.

AB  - Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DIn-SAR), also known as Persistent Scatters Interferometry (PSI), has proved its unprecedented advantages of monitoring ground deformation on large scale with centimeter to millimeter precision in the last two decades. However, the reliability and accuracy are often contaminated with atmospheric artefacts caused by spatial and temporal variations of the atmosphere. Recent studies revealed atmospheric artefacts can be compensated with empirical models, GPS zenith path delay and numerical weather prediction models. In this paper, an improved methodology is proposed based on atmospheric reanalysis data to estimate atmospheric artefacts. With our approach, the realistic line of sight (LOS) path along satellite location and monitored points is considered, rather than the zenith path delay. The effectiveness of our method is validated over Tenerife island, Spain by using Sentinel1 datasets.

TI  - SPATIAL-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF PATTERN CHANGES AND PREDICTION IN PENANG ISLAND, MALAYSIA USING LULC AND CA-MARKOV MODEL
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Penang Island has witnessed rapid urban development and economic growth in recent years. With the ambitious vision to become a developed country by 2020, planners and policy-makers need to know the most likely direction of future urban development without compromising on the forest landscape. In this study, remotely sensed data combined with cellular automata models were used to predict the land use land cover change in Penang Island, Malaysia. Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov models were applied in 1990 and 2006 to predict the land cover in 2016. Land use land cover maps for the study area were derived from 1990, 2006, and 2016 Landsat Images (MSS, TM, and OLI). The accuracy of models is above 80%. A Markov model was applied in 2006 and 2016 to predict the land cover in 2042. The results indicate that the built-up area had expanded more in the east towards the north and south, and also towards the centre of the island and moving upwards to the north. The models suggest limiting urban development in the centre of the island to protect forest landscapes. This study serves as guidelines for other studies which attempt to project land use land cover change in forest landscape while experiencing similar land use changes.

TI  - The influence of land-use/land-cover changes on land surface temperature: a case study of Kuala Lumpur metropolitan city
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates the impact of land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes on land surface temperature (LST) in the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan city using multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite data. The spectral radiance model was used to extract the LST from Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 5 TM. The analysis on LULC changes revealed a phenomenal increase in the urban (high built-up area) areas arid a decrease in the forest land area. The distribution of average changes in LST shows that urban (high built-up area) areas recorded the highest increase in temperature followed by urban (low built-up area) areas, grass land area, forest land area and waterbodies. The LST and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) were computed based on changes in LULC which indicates that a strong correlation value was observed between LST and NDVI for urban (high and low built-up areas) areas, grass land area and forest land area. This study demonstrated that an increase in non-evaporating surfaces and a decrease in the vegetation area have increased the surface temperature and modified the temperature of the study area. Remote-sensing techniques were found to be efficient, especially in reducing the time for analysis of urban expansion, and are useful tools to evaluate the impact of urbanisation on LST.

TI  - ON THE EXTRACTION OF TRAINING IMAGERY FROM VERY LARGE REMOTE SENSING DATASETS FOR DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL SEGMENATATION NETWORKS

AB  - In this work, we investigate strategies for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform recognition on remote sensing imagery. In particular we consider the particular problem of semantic segmentation in which the goal is to obtain a dense pixel-wise labeling of the input imagery. Remote sensing imagery is usually stored in the form of very large images, called "tiles", which are too big to be segmented directly using most CNNs and their associated hardware. Therefore smaller sub-images, called "patches", must be extracted from the available tiles. A popular strategy in the literature is to randomly sample patches from the tiles. However, in this work we demonstrate experimentally that extracting patches randomly from a uniform, non-overlapping spatial grid, leads to more accurate models. Our findings suggest the performance improvements are the result of reducing redundancy within the training dataset. We also find that sampling mini-batches of patches (for stochastic gradient descent) using constraints that maximizes the diversity of images within each batch leads to more accurate models. For example, in this work we constrained patches to come from varying tiles, or cities. These simple strategies contributed to our winning entry (in terms of overall performance) in the first year of the INRIA Building Labeling Challenge.

AB  - Rain-use efficiency (RUE) acts as a typical indicator of ecosystem function. Land surface phenology (LSP) assesses the vegetation activity during the growing season at the ecosystem level. The Songnen Plain (SNP) is located in semi-humid to semi-arid transition ecological fragile zone in Northeast China. RUE in growing season (May-September) was calculated using time series GIMMS NDVI3g images and precipitation data for the period of 1983-2012. The phenology metrics including the start (SOS) and end (EOS) dates of growing season for each year was extracted. Spatial trends of RUE and LSP were examined by applying a linear regression model with time. The correlation analysis was used to analyze the effects of RUE on LSP. The results showed that RUE increased slightly with an undulating trend. Spatially, the highest positive slopes indicating increased trend of RUE were observed in northern and eastern forest. The advanced in SOS was mainly distributed in northern forest areas. 12.2% of the landscape experienced highly increase trend in EOS with a rate of 0.38 days per year. The length of growing season (LOS) was prolonged in 14.2% of the total land. EOS dates in the southern salinized grassland and cropland were mainly negatively correlated with RUE. The results of the significance test show that 2.95% of the pixels were significantly and positively correlated with RUE, indicating that an increase in the RUE would delay the EOS. Increasing RUE promoted the extension of the LOS, particularly in the forest areas.

TI  - Multi-feature Combined for Building Shadow detection in GF-2 Images

AB  - GaoFen-2 (GF-2) is a new high resolution remote sensing satellite launched by China. The fine spatial resolution of GF-2 makes it suitable for urban studies. However, the frequent occurrence of urban shadows in GF-2 images brings about great difficulties to the practical applications. Therefore, accurate shadow detection is a necessary step before applications of GF-2 data. In this paper, we propose a novel technique which combines spectral, spatial and morphological attribute profiles (MAPs) features for mapping building shadows of GF-2 images. In this new algorithm, the spectral features come from the original spectral bands, and the spatial features are derived from the texture analysis based on local binary patterns (LBP), and the MAPs are calculated based on the first principle component (FPC). Then, these features are integrated to derive a shadow classification map using a random forest (RF) classifier. Finally, in order to remove salt-and-pepper noise of the classification results, we use the majority voting strategy to improve initial shadow results by objects obtained from the multi-resolution segmentation (MRS). A main contribution of our newly developed algorithm is that it can effectively detect bright shadows, dark shadows and vegetation shadows simultaneously, and can remarkably suppress the spectral-similar objects including water bodies and low-albedo objects. Our experimental results show that this new technique exhibits very good performance in extracting building shadows under complex urban conditions, with relatively high precision: E-O% of 4.51, E-C% of 3.24 and E-T% of 7.75. This study provides an effective algorithm for shadow detection of GF-2 images.

AB  - Accurate detection of topographic shadows is of great importance, since topographic shadowing is an inevitable hamper for the interpretation of remotely sensed images covered mountainous areas. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for effective and efficient topographic shadow detection for the images obtained from Sentinel-2A multispectral imager (MSI) by combining both the spectral and spatial information. In this method, four feature indices were firstly extracted from the original Sentinel-2A spectral bands to capture the essential spectral characteristics. Specifically, we constructed a topographic shadow index (TSI) to enhance topographic shadows, focusing on the spectral signatures of shadows in Sentinel-2A MSI imagery. To further enhance the difference between shadows and other objects, the TSI is combined with the first component of the principal component analysis (FPC), the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and the normalized water index (NDWI), representing topographic shadows, rocks, vegetation and water, respectively. Finally, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used by operating directly on indices input due to its remarkable classification performance, which exploits the spatial contextual information and spectral features for effective topographic extraction. Our experiments with one Sentinel-2A image show that the proposed approach has led to satisfactory performances, with few errors in shadow maps and insignificant confusion with spectral-similar land covers.

CL  - Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Single photon satellite laser altimeter is based on Geiger model, which has the characteristics of small spot, high repetition rate etc. In this paper, for the slope terrain, the distance of error's formula and numerical calculation are carried out. Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the experiment of different terrain measurements. The experimental results show that ranging accuracy is not affected by the spot size under the condition of the flat terrain, But the inclined terrain can influence the ranging error dramatically, when the satellite pointing angle is 0.001 degrees and the terrain slope is about 12 degrees, the ranging error can reach to 0.5m. While the accuracy can't meet the requirement when the slope is more than 70 degrees. Monte Carlo simulation results show that single photon laser altimeter satellite with high repetition rate can improve the ranging accuracy under the condition of complex terrain. In order to ensure repeated observation of the same point for 25 times, according to the parameters of ICESat-2, we deduce the quantitative relation between the footprint size, footprint, and the frequency repetition. The related conclusions can provide reference for the design and demonstration of the domestic single photon laser altimetry satellite.

TI  - Rapid retrieval strategy for massive remote sensing metadata based on GeoHash coding
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of Earth observation technology, satellite data centres have accumulated large amounts of remote sensing data from different spaceborne and airborne sensors. The efficient management and quick retrieval of multisource, massive and heterogeneous remote sensing data in the Big Data age have become increasingly important. In this paper, a spatio-temporal organization model based on GeoHash coding is proposed. First, based on the ISO standard, the heterogeneous remote sensing metadata can be converted into a unified format, and the differences in the multisource remote sensing metadata are screened. Then, the GeoHash algorithm is used to encode and convert the latitude and longitude coordinates of the remote sensing metadata to reduce the remote sensing metadata dimensions under space retrieval conditions. Finally, by building an HBase key value model based on GeoHash, a primary key is used to realize the rapid retrieval of massive remote sensing metadata through the simulation of 1500 million remote sensing metadata retrieval experiments; by comparing with the traditional multi-conditional filtering retrievals, the results show that a spatio-temporal organization strategy for remote sensing metadata based on GeoHash coding can effectively improve the efficiency of remote sensing data retrievals.

The proposed approach is validated through the time/space co location of scatterometer winds and precipitation data that are used as reliable source of wind field information. Experimental results show that the K-distribution is suitable to model sea surface speckle and that the latter is informative, i. e., it can be considered as a proxy of sea surface wind speed.

The behavior of these two polarimetric features vs wind speed is analyzed. Low-to-moderate and high wind speed regimes are considered. The study is focused on three subsets characterized by different incident angle ranges. The study shows that in all cases the two polarimetric features are sensitive to wind speed and better behave with respect to S-vv.

AB  - The marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) roll plays an important role in the turbulent exchange of momentum, sensible heat, and moisture throughout the boundary layer of tropical cyclones. Hence, rolls are believed to be closely related to storm development and intensification. In this study, based on the RADARSAT-2 dataset including various tropical cyclone (TC) intensities, the roll characteristics are retrieved from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images via fast Fourier transform (FFT). We investigate the roll wavelengths at variance of TC intensities and found that the roll wavelengths are related to the distance with respect to TC center and TC intensities. This study is promising to bring roll-induced effects into hurricane forecasting model.

M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid growth of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, how to exploit Sentinel-1 imagery and achieve effective and robust marine surveillance are crucial problems. In this paper, we present the OpenSARShip, a dataset dedicated to Sentinel-1 ship interpretation. The OpenSARShip, providing 11 346 SAR ship chips integrated with automatic identification system messages, owes five essential properties: specificality, large scale, diversity, reliability, and public availability. These properties make sure that the OpenSARShip achieves its objectives. The first is to provide researchers a benchmark dataset to develop applicable and adaptive ship interpretation algorithms and push the performance ceilings of data analysis. The other is to provide a dataset for performing application-oriented quality assessment for Sentinel-1 imagery, which can boost their applications in a targeting way. The construction and the organization of the OpenSARShip are discussed, which show the inside of the dataset and ensure the essential properties. The elaborate geometric and scattering analyses, the benchmark for classification, and the imagery applicability assessment by using the OpenSARShip all demonstrate the applicability and potential of the dataset.

TI  - Trends and clinicopathological predictors of axillary evaluation in ductal carcinoma in situ patients treated with breast-conserving therapy
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the trends of axillary lymph node evaluation in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) patients treated with breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and to identify the clinicopathological predictors of axillary evaluation. DCIS patients treated with BCT in 2006-2015 at our institute were retrospectively included in the analysis. Patients were categorized into three groups: sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and non-evaluation. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors that predicted axillary evaluation. A total of 315 patients were identified, among whom 135 underwent SLNB, and 15 underwent ALND. The proportion of patients who underwent axillary evaluation increased from 33.0% in 2006-2010 to 53.8% in 2011-2015 (P < 0.001), however, no patients had lymph node metastasis based on final pathology. In multivariate analysis, high-grade tumor favored axillary evaluation (OR = 4.376, 95% CI:1.410-13.586, P = 0.011); while excision biopsy favored no axillary evaluation compared with other biopsy methods (OR = 0.418, 95% CI: 0.192-0.909, P = 0.028). Subgroup analysis of patients treated in 2011-2015 revealed that high-grade tumor (OR = 5.898, 95% CI: 1.626-21.390, P = 0.007) and palpable breast lump (OR = 2.497, 95% CI: 1.037-6.011, P = 0.041) were independent predictors of axillary lymph node evaluation. Despite the significant decrease in ALND and a concerning overuse of SLNB, we identified no axillary lymph node metastasis, which justified omitting axillary evaluation in these patients. High-grade tumor, palpable lump, and biopsy method were independent predictors of axillary evaluations. Excision biopsy of suspicious DCIS lesions may potentially preclude the invasive component of the disease and help to avoid axillary surgery

AB  - Drought is one of the most common natural disasters in the world. The frequent occurrence and long-term persistence of drought will result in huge losses in industrial and agricultural production. Understanding and quantification of the time and spatial dynamic patterns of drought, including the occurrence, duration and intensity, are the primary goals of the agriculture drought monitoring and yield forecasting in the agricultural region in Northeast China. Fundamentally, drought monitors rely on satellite-gauge precipitation data and temperature, yet is also depends on underground water storage, evapotranspiration and runoff. Since 2002, NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission provide a revolutionary approach to view the water stored in soil, track the movement of water and retrieve the total water storage (TWS) via weight. And the TWS change can provide the regional information of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and surface and subsurface runoff. In this study, the GRACE TWS anomaly will be revealed to Northeast China to characterize more objective identification of drought for 157 months climatology (from April 2002 to December 2016). Comparing with the drought incidents from 2002 to 2016 in the Northeast China, the result shows that the trends of GRACE TWS with months can depict the temporal and spatial characteristic of drought in the study area. According to the negative GRACE terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA), which can represent storage deficits, we find that severe drought happened in western part of the study area in 2003, and southern part of the study area in 2007 and 2011. The April-May average GRACE TWS noted the spring drought occurred in most part of study area in 2003, 2009, 2011 and 2012. The significant decreases of TWS from May 2007 to June 2008 reveled by GRACE TWS lead to a serious drought conditions. The fivemonth averages of GRACE TWS from June to October were computed in each year, and deficit during 2014 lead to an agricultural drought and crop production loss in Liaoning and Jilin provinces. However, GRACE TWS changes show no oneto- one relationship with precipitation, as the precipitation is not the primary source of TWS changes. The present result demonstrates that GRACE TWS as referenced data is capable of identify and mapping drought in the Northeast China. It will help better understand the cause of drought, and observe the occurrence, trends and spatiotemporal characteristics of drought. It would be valuable for regional water management.

AB  - Land use reflects the interrelation between the physically built environment and the activity patterns of people. It is indispensable information for decision-makes, but up-to-date and accurate land use information is often absent. Unlike approaches that make use of remote sensing data, in this work, we are interested in a novel data source, tweets, and explore its potential for land use classification in urban areas. Specifically, we propose a general framework for classifying settlement land-use types by extracting location, time, quantity and text features of twitter data. To do so, we apply latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and long short-term memory (LSTM) and then combines those features with spatial-temporal feature using Fused SVM and a two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification. For the case of classifying individual tweets by the land-use classes relevant in this study - residential, non-residential and mixed usage -, we reach overall accuracy (OA), average accuracy (AA), and Kappa coefficient with 72.35%, 73.76%, and 58.43%, respectively. As for the case of classifying block settlement types, we reach 61.90%, 63.33%, and 42.84%, respectively.

TI  - PERCEIVED PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT BENEFITS FROM BACKPACKING. A CROSS-CULTURAL COMPARISON
T2  - TOURISM CULTURE & COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to examine the cross-cultural differences of perceived backpacker personal development between Chinese and Western backpackers. Backpacker personal development has been found to be an effective form of personal development in addition to the formal education system. Although the literature shows backpacking is a culturally driven travel phenomenon, little research has been done to examine the cross-cultural differences in association to backpacking. Comparing 230 Chinese backpackers with 246 Western backpackers traveling in China, the study found that Western backpackers rated four out of the five backpacker personal development dimensions consistently higher than their Chinese counterparts. These dimensions are capability, skill, worldview, and self-consciousness. However, the two cultural groups did not differ in emotion as a backpacker personal development dimension. The differences can be explained by stages of industry development of backpacking in and outside China, Chinese social and economic development, in addition to the cultural determination. The study demonstrated that Chinese backpackers are a culturally different traveler market, comparing to Western backpackers. The special features and culturally informed characteristics of Chinese backpacking will not only enrich the worldwide backpacking travel phenomena, but also enhance the general knowledge of tourism from a cross-cultural perspective. This study contributes to the literature by advancing the understanding of tourist learning and personal development through backpacking experiences. Based on the study findings it is recommended that governments and industry organizations should designate supportive policies and favorable industry protocols to encourage young generations to seek personal development through backpacking.

AB  - Landsat data are widely used in various earth observations, but the clouds interfere with the applications of the images. This paper proposes a weighted variational gradient-based fusion method (WVGBF) for high-fidelity thin cloud removal of Landsat images, which is an improvement of the variational gradient-based fusion (VGBF) method. The VGBF method integrates the gradient information from the reference band into visible bands of cloudy image to enable spatial details and remove thin clouds. The VGBF method utilizes the same gradient constraints to the entire image, which causes the color distortion in cloudless areas. In our method, a weight coefficient is introduced into the gradient approximation term to ensure the fidelity of image. The distribution of weight coefficient is related to the cloud thickness map. The map is built on Independence Component Analysis (ICA) by using multi-temporal Landsat images. Quantitatively, we use R value to evaluate the fidelity in the cloudless regions and metric Q to evaluate the clarity in the cloud areas. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method has the better ability to remove thin cloud and achieve high fidelity.

TI  - A near real-time flood-mapping approach by integrating social media and post-event satellite imagery
T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid flood mapping is critical for timely damage assessment and post-event recovery support. Remote sensing provides spatially explicit information for the mapping process, but its real-time imagery is often not available due to bad weather conditions during the event. Using the 2015 South Carolina Flood in downtown Columbia as a case study, this article proposes a novel approach to retrieve near real-time flood probability map by integrating the post-event remote sensing data with the real-time volunteered geographic information (VGI). Relying on each VGI point, an inverse distance weighted height filter was introduced to build a probability index distribution (PID) layer from the high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data. For each PID layer, a Gaussian kernel was developed to extract its moisture weight from the normalized difference water index (NDWI) of an EO-1 Advanced Land Imager (ALI) image. Finally, a normalized flood probability map was produced by chaining the moisture weighted PIDs in a Python environment. Results indicate that, by adding the wetness information from post-event satellite observations, the proposed model could provide near real-time flood probability distribution with real-time social media, which is of great importance for emergency responders to quickly identify areas in need of immediate attention.

AB  - Recent advances in sensor technologies have led to the significant growth of remote sensing data in terms of its volume, velocity, and variety. Remote sensing data are recognized as the big data, which pose the urgent need for new technologies to integrate and manage heterogeneous remote sensing big data. In this paper, a scalable, efficient, distributed data management system is proposed for heterogeneous remote sensing big data integration and management across the distributed environment. In the system, the remote sensing data are stored as NetCDF files. Meanwhile, the corresponding remote sensing metadata are standardized according to the ISO 19115-2: 2009 based metadata template. In this way, a unified view of heterogeneous remote sensing data is formed. Two organization models are designed to store massive remote sensing data and its metadata in HDFS and HBase, respectively. Besides, an Elasticsearch-based secondary index is built for HBase to provide users with query ability of metadata contents.

AB  - Crop phenology is of great importance to crop growth monitoring, crop classification and yield prediction. Obtaining accurate phenological information is still difficult due to the complexity of cropping systems. A variety of methods have been utilized in retrieving crop phenology from remotely sensed time-series vegetation index data, among which the so-called threshold method is the mostly used. However, currently the thresholds are set empirically and a validation of the obtained phenological information is often lacking. This paper attempted to investigate the optimal thresholds for retrieving the Start of Season (SOS) and the End of Season (EOS) of different crops from MODIS EVI time-series data by using the dynamic threshold method. The crop growth and development dataset from National Meteorological Information Center of China were used to select analysis samples. The recorded green-up dates or three-leaf dates were used as reference SOS, and the recorded maturity dates were used as reference EOS. Four indicators, Bias, Biassign, Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) and Correlation Coefficient(R) were used to assess the accuracy of the retrieved phenology. Results show that: (1) the often used 20% threshold is not optimum in retrieving crop SOS and EOS. (2) Optimum thresholds are 24% and 48% for retrieving SOS and EOS, respectively. (3) Accuracy assessment results indicate that it is better to set different thresholds in retrieving crop SOS and EOS.

TI  - Angular difference feature extraction for urban scene classification using ZY-3 multi-angle high-resolution satellite imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne multi-angle images with a high-resolution are capable of simultaneously providing spatial details and three-dimensional (3D) information to support detailed and accurate classification of complex urban scenes. In recent years, satellite-derived digital surface models (DSMs) have been increasingly utilized to provide height information to complement spectral properties for urban classification. However, in such a way, the multi-angle information is not effectively exploited, which is mainly due to the errors and difficulties of the multi-view image matching and the inaccuracy of the generated DSM over complex and dense urban scenes. Therefore, it is still a challenging task to effectively exploit the available angular information from high-resolution multi-angle images. In this paper, we investigate the potential for classifying urban scenes based on local angular properties characterized from high resolution ZY-3 multi-view images. Specifically, three categories of angular difference features (ADFs) are proposed to describe the angular information at three levels (i.e., pixel, feature, and label levels): (1) ADF-pixel: the angular information is directly extrapolated by pixel comparison between the multi-angle images; (2) ADF-feature: the angular differences are described in the feature domains by comparing the differences between the multi-angle spatial features (e.g., morphological attribute profiles (APs)). (3) ADF-label: label-level angular features are proposed based on a group of urban primitives (e.g., buildings and shadows), in order to describe the specific angular information related to the types of primitive classes. In addition, we utilize spatial-contextual information to refine the multi-level ADF features using superpixel segmentation, for the purpose of alleviating the effects of salt-and-pepper noise and representing the main angular characteristics within a local area. The experiments on ZY-3 multi-angle images confirm that the proposed ADF features can effectively improve the accuracy of urban scene classification, with a significant increase in overall accuracy (3.8-11.7%) compared to using the spectral bands alone. Furthermore, the results indicated the superiority of the proposed ADFs in distinguishing between the spectrally similar and complex man-made classes, including roads and various types of buildings (e.g., high buildings, urban villages, and residential apartments).

AB  - Remote sensing data has grown explosively in the past decade. However, remote sensing application systems evolve slowly due to the challenges on big imagery data storage and processing. The cost of accessing current remote sensing images is still very high. The learning curve of using remote sensing images and image processing tools is still steep. The response to emergencies is not fast enough. The development of big data and cloud computing technologies in recent years has brought new opportunities and challenges for remote sensing application. The remote sensing business model based on web and cloud computing environment is a clear trend. This paper gives a brief overview on the challenges faced during building big imagery analytics system for remote sensing, and proposes a cloud computing solution for big imagery data analytics. Experimental results of cloud computing with space, traditional film, and UAV images are also presented in this paper. It is a full stack solution based on ArcGIS platform for remote sensing imagery storage, management, processing and application, which can be an ideal platform for the next generation remote sensing application business model.

TI  - Improving MODIS snow products with a HMRF-based spatio-temporal modeling technique in the Upper Rio Grande Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal snow cover and its melt dominate regional climate and hydrology in many mountainous regions in the world. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products have been widely used for regional hydrological modeling. However, data gaps in snow products due to frequent clouds remain a serious problem, particularly for daily products. This paper presents a spatio-temporal modeling technique for filling up data gaps in daily snow cover estimates, based on time series of Terra/Aqua MODIS images. The spatio-temporal modeling technique integrates MODIS spectral information, spatial and temporal contextual information, and environmental association within a Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) framework. The performance of our new technique is quantitatively evaluated by comparing our snow cover estimates with in situ observations at 33 SNOTEL stations as well as to original MODIS snow cover products over the Upper Rio Grande Basin during 2006-2008 snow seasons. Mainly due to cloud obscuration, there are as high as 32% data gaps in original Terra/Aqua combined MODIS snow products. Our HMRF technique reduced cloud-cover related data gaps to < 1% and achieved a snow -mapping accuracy of 88.0% for the gap-filled areas. For the areas not covered by clouds, our HMRF-based technique also improved the snow cover estimate accuracy of original MODIS snow products by 3.5%, from 85.1% to 88.6%. When spatio-temporal contextual information and environmental association information are progressively incorporated within the HMRF framework, the overall snow mapping accuracies are improved and omission errors are reduced. Particularly, our HMRF-based technique increased the snow product accuracy by 4.2% during whole transition periods, and by 6.2% in March during snow melt. The snow mapping accuracies were significantly improved over evergreen forests and mixed forests.

AB  - An extremely intense rainstorm occurred on 20 May 2016. It had been the heaviest rainfall event recorded in Xinyi, Guangdong Province, China, since 1960. The black body temperature (TBB) output of FY-2B satellite images, weather radar, and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data were used to investigate the characteristics of a mesoscale convective system (MCS) associated with the rainstorm. Heavy rainstorms formed under the influence of an eastward migration of a low trough at 500 hPa, typical of warm area heavy rain. In front of the 500 hPa trough, there was strong coupling of high and low jet streams, high convective effective bit energy, strong middle and low water vapor convergence and high ground dew point temperature, creating a favorable environment for the formation and development of MCSs. The convective region of the linear convective cloud developed into an organized MCS, and Xinyi's heavy rainfall occurred during the MCS lifecycle from formation to maturity to extinction. Five MCSs, with radar echo intensities of 40-55 dBz, created a 'train effect', which was the main driver of the heavy rainstorm. The strong echoes observed above 40 dBz were below 0 degrees C, and the strongest echo center was near 2 km. The convective precipitation system had a low mass center and high precipitation efficiency. The echo top (with intensity >= 10 dBz) was as high as 19 km, and there was a deep ice phase growth belt above -10 degrees C, which contributed to the heavy rainfall, which peaked at 132.8 mm in one hour.

AB  - In the recent decades, remote sensing data are rapidly growing in size and variety. In the traditional remote sensing analysis workflows, Earth science data users have to download raw data files to local workstations before processing them for science discoveries. The data transfer often costs a lot of time and slows down the analysis workflows. In most cases, results of remote sensing data analysis models are usually much smaller than raw data to be processed. Therefore, "on-demand processing", which tries to upload data analysis models and execute them "near" data, can reduce the costs of data transfer and significantly accelerate the execution of remote sensing analysis workflows. In this paper, a framework, which enables on-demand remote sensing data analysis, is proposed. The evaluation on a prototype system shows that on-demand processing framework obviously accelerates the execution of analysis models by reducing data transfers, especially for those analysis workflows which transfer data through low bandwidth Internet

TI  - A Cross Sectional Study of the Association between Sanitation Type and Fecal Contamination of the Household Environment in Rural Bangladesh
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - We conducted a cross sectional study to assess 1) the association between access to basic sanitation and fecal contamination of sentinel toy balls and 2) if other sanitation factors such as shared use and cleanliness are associated with fecal contamination of sentinel toy balls. We assessed sanitation facilities in 454 households with a child aged 6-24 months in rural Bangladesh. We defined "basic" sanitation as access to improved sanitation facilities (pit latrine with a slab or better) not shared with other households. In each household, an identical toy ball was given to the target child. After 24 hours, the balls were rinsed to enumerate fecal coliforms as an indicator of household fecal contamination. Households with basic sanitation had lower fecal coliform contamination than households with no access to basic sanitation (adjusted difference in means: -0.31 log(10) colony forming units [CFU]/toy ball; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.61, -0.01). Shared sanitation facilities of otherwise improved type were more likely to have visible feces on the latrine slab compared with private facilities. Among households with access to improved sanitation, households with no visible feces on the latrine slab had less toy ball contamination than households with visible feces on the latrine slab (adjusted difference in means: -0.38 log(10) CFU/toy ball; 95% CI: -0.77, 0.02). Access to basic sanitation may prevent fecal contamination of the household environment. An Improved sanitation facility used by an individual household may be better in preventing household fecal contamination compared with improved facilities shared with other households.

AB  - Precise digital classification for Landsat 8 data of remote sensing images require pre-processing steps. The preprocessing consist of conversion from digital numbers (DN) to top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, cloud and cloud shadow masking, topographic correction and image normalization. In general, pre-processing steps were implemented to National scale (Indonesia) excluding topographic correction. The topographic correction algorithm is required to avoid reflectance bias from terrain effects due to shading. The highest mountains in Indonesia were selected as window areas, considering the reflectance bias is produced due to terrain effects. The results showed that algorithm is able to solve overcorrection problems and will be implemented into LAPAN's system of image pre-processing for National scale. This research is a collaboration between Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) with National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) under Forests2020 Programme, in order to produce Landsat 8 data with the minimal cloud over Indonesia annually and then to automatically digital classification for forest monitoring. The automated system of preprocessing was developed with Perl and Python programming languages.

TI  - Multi-data approach for crop classification using multitemporal, dual-polarimetric TerraSAR-X data, and official geodata
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop distribution information is essential for tackling some challenges associated with providing food for a growing global population. This information has been successfully compiled using the Multi-Data Approach (MDA). However, the current implementation of the approach is based on optical remote sensing, which fails to deliver the relevant information under cloudy conditions. We therefore extend the MDA by using Land Use/Land Cover classifications derived from six multitemporal and dual-polarimetric TerraSAR-X stripmap images, which do not require cloud-free conditions. These classifications were then combined with auxiliary, official geodata (ATKIS and Physical Blocks (PB)) data to lower misclassification and provide an enhanced LULC map that includes further information about the annual crop classification. These final classifications showed an overall accuracy (OA) of 75% for seven crop-classes (maize, sugar beet, barley, wheat, rye, rapeseed, and potato). For potatoes, however, classification does not appear to be as consistently accurate, as could be shown from repeated comparisons with variations of training and validation fields. When the rye, wheat, and barley classes were merged into a winter cereals class, the resultant five crop-class classifications had a high OA of about 90%.

AB  - Local recurrence after an autologous breast reconstruction is uncommon. We describe 2 patients with local recurrence 3 and 9 years, respectively, after mastectomy with DIEAP (deep inferior epigastric artery perforator) flap breast reconstruction. Patients generally present with a palpable mass, pain, or other visible abnormalities. Various imaging techniques are helpful, always completed by biopsy to characterize the tumour. A repeated sentinel node procedure can be useful in staging. The treatment of the local recurrence needs to be determined in a multidisciplinary team consultation.

AB  - The 2016 Republican Party platform is unabashed in its rejection of environmental principles and its embrace of extractive labor. Its 'Natural Resources' section reads: '[w]e are the party of America's growers, producers, farmers, ranchers, foresters, miners, commercial fishermen, and all those who bring from the earth the crops, minerals, energy, and the bounties of our seas.' What is interesting about this statement is its selective view of productive labor. Not all who bring from the earth are equally valued within the American conservative worldview. What accounts for the outsized role of white male workers in the discourses of American conservatives?

AB  - We characterize the agreement and disagreement of four publically available burned products (Fire CCI, Copernicus Burnt Area, MODIS MCD45A1, and MODIS MCD64A1) at a finer spatial and temporal scale than previous assessments using a grid of three-dimensional cells defined both in space and in time. Our analysis, conducted using seven years of data (2005-2011), shows that estimates of burned area vary greatly between products in terms of total area burned, the location of burning, and the timing of the burning. We use regional and monthly units for analysis to provide insight into the variation between products that can be lost when considering products yearly and/or globally. Comparison with independent, contemporaneous MODIS active fire observations provides one indication of which products most reasonably capture the burning regime. Our results have implications for the use of global burned area products in fire ecology, management and emissions applications. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Land Subsidence in Chiayi, Taiwan, from Compaction Well, Leveling and ALOS/PALSAR: Aquaculture-Induced Relative Sea Level Rise
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chiayi County is located in the largest alluvial plain of Taiwan with extensive aquaculture and rice farming sustained by water extracted from groundwater wells. Chiayi is a typical aquaculture area affected by land subsidence, yet such lands worldwide combine to provide nearly 90% of global aquaculture products, greatly reducing oceanic overfishing problems. This study uses precision leveling, multi-layer compaction monitoring well (MLCW) and spaceborne SAR interferometry (InSAR) to examine the cause and effect of land subsidence in Chiayi associated with groundwater extractions and changes. Heights at benchmarks in a leveling network are measured annually and soil compactions at 24-26 layers up to 300-m depths at 7 MLCWs are collected at one-month intervals. Over 2007-2011, 15 ALOS/PALSAR images are processed by the method of TCPInSAR to produce subsidence rates. All sensors show that land subsidence occur in most parts of Chiayi, with rates reaching 4.5 cm/year around its coast, a result of groundwater pumping from shallow to deep aquifers. MLCWs detect mm-accuracy seasonal soil compactions coinciding with groundwater level fluctuations and causing dynamic compactions. Compactions near Taiwan High Speed Rail may reduce the strength of the rail's supporting columns to degrade its safety. The SAR images yield subsidence rates consistent with those from leveling and compaction wells after corrections for systematic errors by the leveling result. Subsidence in Chiayi's coastal area leads to relative sea level rises at rates up to 15 times larger than the global eustatic sea level rising rate, a risk typical for world's aquaculture-rich regions. At the fish pond-covered Budai Township, InSAR identifies subsidence spots not detected by leveling, providing crucial geo-information for a sustainable land management for aquaculture industry.

CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - Meaningful study and quantification of climatic trends requires decades of observational data. Within satellite remote sensing this motivates the generation fundamental climate data records (FCDRs) -datasets containing the combined observations from a series of missions of a given sensor, to span the required duration for study. Ensuring the radiometric stability of such series is vital for such applications. To this end a consistent in-flight retrospective recalibration of all the sensors in such a series is required, called harmonisation. Presented here is a methodology for achieving this by analysing match-ups between sensors in the series and applicable sensors with modern, well-calibrated reference sensors, fitting new calibration parameters for each sensor in the series. Such a problem is not tractable in the most optimal, metrologically rigorous manner by existing solvers, due to the possibly complex error and geophysical correlation structures and high data volume (potentially >10(8) match-ups). Discussed are a palette of novel optimisation algorithms developed to overcome this, which investigate alternative approaches to handling the full problem. Preliminary results are shown for one these approaches, Fast EIV (Errors in Variables), for the recalibration of the AVHRR sensor series.

T2  - BREAST CANCER-TARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, worldwide, and 1,400 deaths per day are attributed to it. The success of national screening programs has seen breast cancers being diagnosed at an earlier stage. With conservative surgery to the breast demonstrating equivalent long-term outcomes, the last 10 years have seen a growing interest in the safety of less invasive management for the axilla in breast cancer patients. One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is a validated, reliable, and efficient tool in identifying micro-and macro-metastases intraoperatively. It is the most widely used intraoperative analysis tool within the United Kingdom, and is employed by over 320 units across Europe and Asia. Recent evidence from the AMAROS, IBCSG 23-01, and ACOSOG Z0011 trials has changed surgical practice in managing the axilla of patients with breast cancer. We propose a clinical algorithm demonstrating the role of OSNA as an intraoperative analysis tool in today's management of breast cancer as well as prospects for the future use of OSNA.

AB  - Over the past half century, countries of Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam - have witnessed increases in commercialized agriculture with rapid expansions of boom crop plantations. We used MODIS EVI and SWIR time-series from 2001-2014 to classify tree cover changes across MSEA and performed a supervised change detection using an upscaling approach by deriving samples from existing Landsat classifications. We used the random forest classifier and distinguished 24 classes (16 representlng boom-crops) with an accuracy of 82.2%. Boom-crops occupy about 18% of the landscape (8% of which is rubber). Since 2003 74,960 km(2) of rubber have been planted; 70% of rubber is planted on former forest land, and 30% on low vegetation area (mainly former croplands). Timing, patterns of change, and deforestation rates, however, differ among the MSEA countries and the high spatial and temporal detail of our classification allowed us to quantify dynamics and discuss political and socio-economic drivers of change.

TI  - Down the Rathole? Public Support for US Foreign Aid
T2  - Harvard Dataverse
M3  - Data study
C8  - 1
AB  - Americans think the US foreign aid budget is far too generous. Can information change those views? We identified ten prominent arguments about aid in public discussion, five positive and five negative. In a survey experiment, we exposed respondents to one of those arguments with five associated facts. Most of the arguments in favor of aid made respondents more supportive, while most of the arguments against aid made them less supportive. Arguments that focused either positively or negatively on economic development in recipient countries or advancing US interests made little difference. In contrast, arguments about the domestic costs of foreign aid or those that invoked moral considerations like recipient need or corruption had fairly large effects on attitudes. The most successful argument, on the low cost of aid, reduced aid opposition from 67 to 28 percent. When respondents saw both pro and con arguments together, however, arguments generally lost their efficacy. The only exception was the argument about the low cost of aid, which altered opinions in some wayseven when countered with anti-aid arguments. Our results are somewhat surprising given the conventional wisdom that people are motivated reasoners who reject new information that does not conform to their worldview.

AB  - Background. Optimal neck lymphadenectomy in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and microscopic lymph node metastasis needs to be defined in order to aid surgeons in their decision about the best way to proceed in these cases. Methods. Patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and lymphadenectomy at levels Ha to VI were divided into two groups: Group 1(G1) with macroscopic metastasis detected before surgery and Group 2 (G2) with microscopic metastasis detected in sentinel node during surgery. Odds ratio (OR) was computed for age, sex, tumor size, multicentricity, capsular invasion, vascular/lymphatic permeation, and nodes with metastasis. Results. Primary tumor size was (G1 versus G2, respectively) 3.8 cm versus 1.98 cm (P<0.001); only lymphatic permeation was correlated to an increase in metastasis in lymph nodes 65.4% versus 25% (OR=5.6, p<0.001); metastatic frequency by region was IIa 18.5% versus 1.5%, III 24.3% versus 9.9%, IV 17.4% versus 18.1%, and VI 25.9% versus 71,2%. Metastasis to level V was found only in G1. Conclusion. Selective lymphadenectomy at levels III, IV, and VI is optimal for PTC patients without preoperative evidence of lymph node disease, but who present with lymph node microscopic metastasis in an intraoperative assessment.

AB  - Sentinel-1's SARs operate since April 2014 (S1-A) and April 2016 (S1-B) and routinely acquire images over coastal and open waters. Compared to its predecessor ENVISAT/ASAR, Sentinel-1 SAR offers several improvements such as a better Wave Mode imagette coverage, more systematic dual-polarizations, a new TOPSAR acquisition mode over coastal regions and improved Doppler estimator allowing higher resolution Doppler grid. Based on these additional capabilities, many algorithmic and use case scenario improvements have been tested and validated to provide a more complete ocean state view and first direct assessment of extreme events. Instrument level issues like the accuracy of the satellite restituted attitude could also be highlighted.

TI  - Scaling Properties of Arctic Sea Ice Deformation in a High-Resolution Viscous-Plastic Sea Ice Model and in Satellite Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice models with the traditional viscous-plastic (VP) rheology and very small horizontal grid spacing can resolve leads and deformation rates localized along Linear Kinematic Features (LKF). In a 1 km pan-Arctic sea ice-ocean simulation, the small-scale sea ice deformations are evaluated with a scaling analysis in relation to satellite observations of the Envisat Geophysical Processor System (EGPS) in the Central Arctic. A new coupled scaling analysis for data on Eulerian grids is used to determine the spatial and temporal scaling and the coupling between temporal and spatial scales. The spatial scaling of the modeled sea ice deformation implies multifractality. It is also coupled to temporal scales and varies realistically by region and season. The agreement of the spatial scaling with satellite observations challenges previous results with VP models at coarser resolution, which did not reproduce the observed scaling. The temporal scaling analysis shows that the VP model, as configured in this 1 km simulation, does not fully resolve the intermittency of sea ice deformation that is observed in satellite data.

AB  - Satellite data have attracted attention on research such as natural disaster and climate changes because satellite data is very advantageous for observing a wide range of variability. However, there are still limited spatial and temporal resolutions in satellite data. To overcome these limitations, fusion of various sensors and combination of primary products are used. In this study, surface temperature data of 500 m spatial resolution was produced by fusion of GOCI and MI data of COMS. Also these LST are used with NDVI for estimating TVDI. Soil moisture condition of the Korean peninsula was evaluated by these TVDI and it was compared with SSMI derived from ASCAT surface soil moisture data. As a result, COMS TVDI and ASCAT SSMI showed similar spatial distribution and suggested the possibility of observing the soil moisture using COMS. Therefore, the TVDI estimations can be used as a basis for estimating the high resolution soil moisture, and the application of the COMS can be expanded for various studies.

AB  - Efforts for the retrieval of soil moisture data using satellites are continuing, but there is a lack of reference data that can represent the characteristics of a watershed. In this study, weighted average in situ soil moisture was estimated and the calibrated CRNP soil moisture was validated through comparison with rainfall events. The weighted average in situ soil moisture adequately represented that of all stations. The corrected neutron intensity was less affected by air pressure and humidity than the raw data, and the standard deviation decreased from 96.22 cph to 76.25 cph. Additional correction for the mountainous terrain will be possible if data are accumulated, and the CRNP soil moisture can be used as reference data for soil moisture retrieval using satellite data and as basic data for national water management.

AB  - Ziyuan and Qisong represent the two most influential Buddhist schools in North Song. This paper discusses their philosophical tendencies at the time of reviewing their understanding of Zhongyong. Ziyuan insists that the Zhongyong of Confucianism is the same as the Nagarjuna’s concept madhyama-pratipad and that it should not stick to either emptiness or existence. Therefore, he argues we must learn both Buddhism, the study of emptiness and Confucianism, the study of existence. Qisong presents his thought system as the term of Zhongyong, believing that Zhongyong encompasses both the inner and social aspects. This view was more advanced than Ziyuan's view of limiting Zhongyong to the inner side. The understanding of the two monks is that, as Confucianism embraces the ideological elements of Taoism and Buddhism, Buddhism in the early Song dynasty also showed that it also adopted Confucian elements. This view suggests that the interchanges between Buddhism and Confucianism during the Early Song period were multi-layer and bilateral.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This study criticized ethical issues raised by genome editing technology (CRISPR-Cas9) from a Christian ethical point of view. First, the problems of genome editing technology was analyzed, and based on this analysis, the limitations and contradictions of those who would like to advocate and actively use genetic editing technology was criticized and rebutted from a Christian theological point of view.In the light of Christian reason, life is given as a gift of grace from the Creator. Human desire to manipulate and strengthen the power of the child through genome editing technology is derived from misunderstanding the position of human being in creation, and we can see that it is arrogant domination and control stemming from mistaking human role and God's role. Therefore, what is required of Christians today is a thorough reflection on human dominance in eugenic efforts to design and manipulate genes. It is a well-known fact that human life today is seriously underestimated. This social phenomenon is the result of an abandon of anthropocentrism and at the same time a backbone of utilitarian thinking. In other words, the tendency of reducing the absolute value of life to liberal values is remarkable because of the strong influence of the historical tendency. Man is the only one that can not be replaced by anyone. Thus, even in an 'insignificant' human embryo, the dignity of the Christian worldview is not neglected. The science and technology of the past dominate human ability and talent, and by attempting to redesign the human nature, it seems like only a strengthened human being is a righteous person, but the human being under God's creation order enjoys the gift of grace as a gift, and it is an entity that is composed of the responsibilities entrusted to each other in cooperation with the creatures. Thus, enhanced human-oriented gene editing techniques do not gain legitimacy from a Christian ethical point of view.

M3  - research-article
AB  - In general, socialization is the result of implicit and unconscious instructions over a period of time, and training is the result of explicit and repetitive instructions for a specific purpose within a relatively short period. In this paper, however, we argue that socialization and training are not fixed or clear-cut notions that should be applied to humans and animals separately. Instead, training as a sub-category of socialization comes into play in both humans' and dogs' socialization processes whenever needed. This argument is supported through a comparison of two rehabilitation TV shows in two different cultures. Both of them focus on rehabilitating subjects with behavioral problems and employ experts who have relevant knowledge and experiences. By finding out the sources of the problems and coming up with solutions, the experts play a significant role. the parents and dogs' owners, as well as the subject themselves, are also seen as having to go through some changes. In this paper, the applicability of both socialization and training to humans and dogs is discussed and a comparison of the two TV shows reveal the mutual influences of socialization and training. Even though the two shows differ in subjects, narration styles, relationships between guests and experts, and the frequencies of interactions between them, they show considerable similarities in many respects. The findings show that dogs are socialized into humans‘ world by acquiring rules and norms through sharing or communication with humans, just as children are socialized by obtaining sociocultural knowledge, values, beliefs, and a worldview. Thus, the two notions can be applied to both humans and animals, and socialization can be defined as an ongoing process that requires some training.

AB  - We are constantly hearing about the seriousness of food shortages in North Korea through various media reports. Recently, the severity of the problem has increased, and international organizations and relief organizations have become increasingly concerned. Due to the shortage of food and firewood, residents illegally cut trees in the mountains and, as a result, North Korea has become the third fastest-growing area of forest degradation in Asia. However, since North Korea cannot directly measure the extent of forest degradation, remote sensing techniques using satellite imagery have to be applied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the characteristics of forest change in North Korea, in order to understand the severity of the forest degradation problem. For this purpose, Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI TIRS satellite images were acquired and classified. As a result, it was found that the forests have turned into wilderness in the Nampo City and Pyongyang municipalities, while the wasteland has changed into forests in the north of Yanggangdo. In addition, the total forested area of the whole region decreased by 4,166.22 km2, the residential area decreased by 2,017.03 km2, and the amount of agricultural land increased by 6,625.74 km2, which is similar to the amount of forested area lost, although the difference in the overall area of the forests between 2017 and 2006 was small.

AB  - Picture book texts can affect readers by not only providing the joy of reading, but by projecting the artist's beliefs and vision of life. The worldview approach to texts requires multidisciplinary and integrative research that goes beyond aesthetic and ideological approaches revealing how the text answers fundamental questions about the world and life. The purpose of this study was to present an example of a worldview approach to picture books by criticizing John Klassen 's <Hats Trilogy>, which won the Caldecott Medal in 2013 and several picture book awards. For this study, Vanhouser (2009) 's hermeneutic realism and 'thick description' were used as the premise of interpretation. Moreover, and the theoretical system and methodology in the field of theology, hermeneutics, literary criticism, picture book aesthetics and reading education were used. Through 'elementary reading', 'inspectional reading', and 'analytical reading' about the <Hats Trilogy>, the following questions were answered: 1) what is this world? 2) what are human beings? and 3) what should human beings do? As a result, a 'nihilism' worldview projected by the trilogy was discussed. The significance of this study is in the concrete discussion and practice of the worldview approach to picture book criticism. Furthermore, this study suggests that it is necessary to reflect the nature and vision of picture books for young readers.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to critically analyze and reflect on A National University of Education’s overseas student teaching program to seek for reinforcing program contents and provide implications for other institutions where they are going to develop and operate overseas student teaching program in the future. To pursue it, a researcher analyzed 8 peer-reviewed journals as outcomes of operating overseas student teaching programs at ANUE. Suggestion for the improvement of overseas student teaching programs is as following: First, a overseas student teaching program is diversify student participants and countries and regions for placements. Second, it should prepare a ways to reduce psychological burden of student teachers for National Teacher Selection Examination Third, it should also provide student teachers with the diverse education, helping student teachers familiar with ways of good communication, school culture, and educational system and cultivating necessary competences and capacities for cooperating teachers to sustain quality of student teaching at overseas. Fourth, based on confidence and respect for student teachers’ own culture, a overseas student teaching program needs to build an organic relationship between student teachers and cooperating teachers for understanding different cultures. Fifth, it encourages student teachers to discover the diverse values regarding overseas student teaching through active participation and communication and increase multicultural understanding and worldview based on observing life styles, culture, and living. Sixth, a overseas student teaching program provides student teachers enough time and opportunities to reflect on their own experiences and keep consistency with student learning, mentoring, and student teaching experiences in accordance with its original intent to design this program. Last and not least, it should carefully consider advance preparation procedures and processes for the program success.

AB  - The aim of this study consists in testing the effectiveness of satellite data in order to monitoring shoreline and sedimentary features changes, especially the rapidly changing of Gulf of Tunis coast. The study area is located in the Gulf of Tunis western bay (Southern Mediterranean Sea) which is characterized by sandy beaches of Ghar Melah and Raoued (Medjerda Delta area). The aerial photographs and satellite imageries were used for mapping the evolution of shoreline. Diachronic data (satellite imagery, aerial photography and topographic maps) were used to monitor and to quantify, the evolution of the coastal areas. These thematic data were digitally overlaid and vectorised for highlighting the shoreline changes between 1936 and 2016, in order to map the rate of erosion and accretion along the shoreline. Results show that the accretion and degradation are related to the Medjerda: change of outlet in 1973 and impoundment of the Sidi Salem dam in 1982. We found that the general trend of the coastal geomorphic processes can be monitored with satellite imageries (such as Sentinel A2, Spots 4 and 5), due to its repetitive coverage along the time and their high quality concerning the spectral contrast between land and sea areas. Improved satellite imageries with high resolution should be a valuable tool for complementing traditional methods for mapping and assessing the sedimentary structures (such as shoreline, delta, marine bars), and monitoring especially the lowlands coastal areas (slightly eroded).

AB  - This work introduces two feature fusion techniques that exploit previously developed algorithms for urban extent extraction from multispectral and SAR spaceborne data, adapting them to the joint use of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data sets. The approaches aim at exploiting the finer spatial and spectral resolution of multispectral S2 data as well as the double bounce backscatter effect that is common to all built-up areas in SAR S1 data. To this aim, we introduce first a simplified and less computational demanding version of the Urban Extractor (UEXT) algorithm, recently introduced for urban extent extraction from S1 data, and improve its results by two different ways of selecting the seed pixels involved in UEXT by means of the urban extent maps extracted from S2 using the normalized difference spectral vector (NDSV), whose application for national and regional extraction of human settlements have already proved as very effective. Experimental results for Rio de Janeiro and Beijing show the improvements obtained by considering one of the two proposed techniques, and explains while the other one fails in achieving similar results.

AB  - Reliable and timely mapping of crop growth conditions and of their water resources is considered a prioritary application in light of the abrupt climate changes. With this view, the paper presents a novel approach that makes use of dense C-Band time-series for the timely estimation of crop growth stages and for the detection of changes in crop water conditions, especially related to precipitation and irrigation events. Aided by vegetation indexes extracted from Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery, the proposed Sentinel-1 centered method exploits both temporal patterns of crop growth and spatial patterns of water anomalies to enhance its classification robustness.

TI  - Atmospheric correction for hyperspectral ocean color retrieval with application to the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The classical multi-spectral Atmospheric Correction (AC) algorithm is inadequate for the new generation of spaceborne hyperspectral sensors such as NASA's first hyperspectral Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) onboard the anticipated Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite mission. The AC process must estimate and remove the atmospheric path radiance contribution due to the Rayleigh scattering by air molecules and scattering by aerosols from the measured top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance, compensate for the absorption by atmospheric gases, and correct for reflection and refraction of the air-sea interface. In this work, we present and evaluate an improved AC for hyperspectral sensors developed within NASA's SeaWiFS Data Analysis System software package (SeaDAS). The improvement is based on combining the classical AC approach of multi-spectral capabilities to correct for the atmospheric path radiance, extended to hyperspectral, with a gas correction algorithm to compensate for absorbing gases in the atmosphere, including water vapor. The SeaDAS-hyperspectral version is capable of operationally processing the AC of any hyperspectral airborne or spaceborne sensor. The new algorithm development was evaluated and assessed using the Hyperspectral Imager for Coastal Ocean (HICO) scenes collected at the Marine Optical BuoY (MOBY) site, and other SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS) and AERosol Robotic NETwork-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) coastal sites. A hyperspectral vicarious calibration was applied to HICO, showing the validity and consistency of HICO's ocean color products. The hyperspectral AC capability is currently available in SeaDAS to the scientific community at hreps://oceancolongsfc.nasa.govi.

AB  - With the free Sentinel-2 (S2) data of the Copernicus programme, new opportunities arise for the mining community that can ease its environmental and social challenges through improved monitoring. At the moment, most users worldwide need to process S2 data to achieve surface reflectance. There are recent powerful open-source developments in atmospheric correction algorithms of S2 data such as iCOR and Sen2Cor along with MAJA that publically shares its executable files. Open pit mining in tropical sites are not the typical conditions that semi-empirical models are designed or validated for. This work aims at assessing the discrepancy in the results of the three approaches for an area rich with laterite mining activities in central New Caledonia. Cloud retrieval is compared along with aerosol optical thickness and water vapor content estimation. Finally, consistency in surface reflectance is investigated per season, and correlations among the output of the approaches are quantified. The authors recommend to the developers of the various methods to include mining sites for validation because their highly appreciated work is import to the end-users of the raw materials community.

TI  - Estimating fractional cover of plant functional types in African savannah from harmonic analysis of MODIS time-series data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessments of tree/grass fractional cover in savannahs using remote sensing are challenging due to the heterogeneous mixture of the two plant functional types. Time-series decomposition models can be used to characterize vegetation phenology from satellite data, but have rarely been used for attributing phenological signal components to different plant functional types. Here, tree/grass dynamics are assessed in savannah ecosystems using time-series decomposition of 14years of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index data acquired from 2002 to 2015. The decomposition method uses harmonic analysis and tests the individual harmonic terms for statistical significance. Field data of fractional cover of trees and grasses were collected for 28 plots in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Matching MODIS pixels were analysed for their tree/grass phenological signals. Tree/grass annual and interannual variability were then assessed based on the harmonic models. In most harmonic cycles, grass-dominated sites had higher amplitudes than tree-dominated sites, while the tree green-up started earlier than grasses, before the start of the wet season. While changes in tree phenology are gradual, grasses present higher variability over time. Tree cover showed a significant correlation with the amplitude (r (correlation coefficient)=-0.59, p=0.001) and phase of the first harmonic term (r=-0.73, p=0.0001) and the number of cycles of the second harmonic term (r=0. 56, p=0.002). Grass cover was also significantly correlated with the amplitude (r=0. 51, p=0.005) and phase of the first harmonic term (r=0.55, p=0.002) and the number of cycles of the second harmonic term (r=-0.52, p=0.005). The positive correlation of grass cover with phase and negative correlation with number of cycles is indicating a late greening period and higher variability, respectively. Tree cover estimated from the phase of the strongest harmonic term showed a positive correlation with field-measured tree cover (R-2 (coefficient of determination)=0.55, p<0.01, slope=0.93, root mean square error=13.26%). The estimated tree cover also had a strong correlation with the woody cover map (r=0.78, p<0.01) produced by Bucini. The results show that MODIS time-series data can be used to estimate the fractional tree cover in heterogeneous savannahs from the phase of the plant functional type's phenological behaviour. This study shows that harmonic analysis is able to discriminate between fractional cover by trees and grasses in savannahs. The quantitative analysis of tree/grass phenology from satellite time-series data enables a better understanding of the dynamics of the tree/grass competition and coexistence.

AB  - Abstract: The objective of this work was to evaluate the applicability of time series of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (Modis), in the mapping of irrigated areas in the Northeastern region of Brazil. Annual time series from 2006 to 2015 were classified with the iterative self-organizing data analysis technique (Isodata) algorithm, generating a binary map of irrigated and nonirrigated areas for each year. In the Sertao region, the classification showed an average kappa coefficient of 0.66, underestimating the irrigated area by 7.6%, compared with data of the 2006 agricultural census. In regions more humid than the Sertao, such as Agreste and Zona da Mata Nordestina, the methodology showed limitations to distinguish irrigated areas from natural vegetation, presenting average kappa coefficients of 0.26 and 0.00, respectively. The EVI time series from Modis are applicable for the mapping of irrigated areas in the Sertao of the Northeastern region of Brazil. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

T2  - WESTERN PACIFIC SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The burden of influenza in Cambodia is not well known, but it would be useful for understanding the impact of seasonal epidemics and pandemics and to design appropriate policies for influenza prevention and control. The severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance system in Cambodia was used to estimate the national burden of SARI hospitalizations in Cambodia.Methods: We estimated age-specific influenza-associated SARI hospitalization rates in three sentinel sites in Svay Rieng, Siem Reap and Kampong Cham provinces. We used influenza-associated SARI surveillance data for one year to estimate the numerator and hospital admission surveys to estimate the population denominator for each site. A national influenza-associated SARI hospitalization rate was calculated using the pooled influenza-associated SARI hospitalizations for all sites as a numerator and the pooled catchment population of all sites as denominator. National influenza-associated SARI case counts were estimated by applying hospitalization rates to the national population.Results: The national annual rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations per 100 000 population was highest for the two youngest age groups at 323 for <1 year and 196 for 1-4 years. We estimated 7547 influenza-associated hospitalizations for Cambodia with almost half of these represented by children younger than 5 years.Discussion: We present national estimates of influenza-associated SARI hospitalization rates for Cambodia based on sentinel surveillance data from three sites. The results of this study indicate that the highest burden of severe influenza infection is borne by the younger age groups. These findings can be used to guide future strategies to reduce influenza morbidity.

AB  - Pansharpening process aims at fusing low-spatial/high-spectral resolutions multispectral/hyperspectral (MS/AS) remote sensing data with high-spatial resolution and without spectral diversity panchromatic (PAN) ones.This paper explores different data preparation possibilities, learning strategies and architectures, used in the convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches, for improving the performance of the pansharpening process of remote sensing MS/HS data.Also, in this paper, the super resolution CNN (SRCNN) architecture is adapted by adding a normalization step in the training phase of the CNN-based pansharpening process. Then, training datasets are prepared for fitting the generalization need.Experiments based on multi-source datasets are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed SRCNN-based pansharpening architecture. The preliminary results are promising since they show that the proposed approach is competitive with some literature methods.

TI  - Contrasting aerosol optical and radiative properties between dust and urban haze episodes in megacities of Pakistan
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite and ground based remote sensors provide vital information about aerosol optical and radiative properties. Analysis of aerosol optical and radiative properties during heavy aerosol loading events in Pakistan are limited and, therefore, require in-depth examination. This work examines aerosol properties and radiative forcing during Dust Episodes (DE) and Haze Episodes (HE) between 2010 and 2014 over mega cities of Pakistan (Karachi and Lahore). Episodes having the daily averaged values of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) exceeding 1 were selected. DE were associated with high AOD and low Angstrom Exponent (AE) over Karachi and Lahore while high AOD and high AE values were associated with HE over Lahore. Aerosol volume size distributions (AVSD) exhibited a bimodal lognormal distribution with a noticeable coarse mode peak at a radius of 2.24 gm during DE, whereas a fine mode peak was prominent at a radius 0.25 mu m during HE. The results reveal distinct differences between HE and DE for spectral profiles of several parameters including Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), ASYmmetry parameter (ASY), and the real and imaginary components of refractive index (RRI and IRI). The AOD-AE correlation revealed that dust was the dominant aerosol type during DE and that biomass burning and urban/industrial aerosol types were pronounced during HE. Aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) was estimated using the Santa Barbra DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model. Calculations revealed a negative ARF at the Top Of the Atmosphere (ARF(TOA)) and at the Bottom Of the Atmosphere (ARF(BOA)), with positive ARF within the Atmosphere (ARF(ATM)) during both DE and HE over Karachi and Lahore. Furthermore, estimations of ARFATM by SBDART were shown to be in good agreement with values derived from AERONET data for DE and HE over Karachi and Lahore.

TI  - Identifying potential habitat distribution of the neon flying squid (<i>Ommastrephes bartramii</i>) off the eastern coast of Japan in winter
T2  - FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat suitability index (HSI) models were applied to identify the potential habitat distribution of the neon flying squid (Ommastrephes bartramii) off the eastern coast of Japan during winter. We used an ocean reanalysis product, a satellite-derived dataset, and commercial fisheries data during 2003-2008 to develop the HSI models, and illustrated the characteristics of the ocean environments at the fishing ground of the neon flying squid, focusing on a typical fishing ground formation event in 2006. The estimated HSI fields of the neon flying squid using three-dimensional (3D) ocean environmental parameters showed a clear relationship between the squid habitat and the edge of a warm core ring south of the Oyashio water; this is considered a key characteristic of fishing ground formation, as noted in Sugimoto and Tameishi (Deep-Sea Research, 39, 1992 and S183). This result suggests that mixing of the warm and nutrient-poor Kuroshio water and the cold and nutrient-rich Oyashio water at the edge of the ring could provide favorable conditions for the foraging of the neon flying squid. The warm water condition in the subsurface layers could be a further advantage to the formation of a stable fishing ground for the neon flying squid. Comparison of the Akaike Information Criteria among a satellite-data-based model, a reanalysis-based model using the same parameters as the satellite-based model, and a reanalysis-based model using 3D ocean environmental parameters, showed an apparent improvement in the performance of the reanalysis-based model using the 3D parameters, reproducing realistic features of the squid fishing ground during the winter of 2006.

AB  - This paper presents an unsupervised flood monitoring approach developed by DARES TECHNOLOGY using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) space-borne images in order to improve disaster management and coordinate response activities in front of flood crisis events. The methodology developed combines SAR pre-processing, histogram thresholding in blocks with bi-modal behavior and unsupervised segmentation approaches. The use of interferometric parameters, such as the coherence is also employed to refine results. The challenge of this detection approach is working towards an unsupervised approach, i.e., training data is no required and, therefore, information or ground-truth about the class statistics within the area of interest are not necessary. The methodology proposed will be validated over the floods occurred in Mumbai city on August 29, 2017 produced by heavy rain events. 4 Sentinel-1 SAR images will be employed for this purpose.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Tropical and Coastal Region Eco Development (ICTCRED)
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - The appearance frequencies of whale sharks in Teluk Cenderawasih National Park (TCNP) is unique because they appear throughout the year and are not related to any seasons. WWF Indonesia's monitoring results from 2011 untill now showed the appearance of whale sharks is closely related to the presence of fisherman liftnet and anchovies. This study focuses on oceanographic factors in fishing ground areas such as chlorophyll-a and satellite imagery data including chlorophyll-a, Sea surface Temperature (SST) over the last four years resulting in AQUA MODIS level 2 recording with 1km resolution in 2013-2016. The catch of anchovies and chlorophyll-a values showed a fairly good correlation during the west monsoon, 0.305, in addition the relationship between the anchovies with SST has a good correlation value starting in the transition period 1 towards the east monsoon. Based on these data, oceanographic factor conditions in TCNP provide a good opportunity for anchovies that live in warm waters to grow and reproduce. This also influences the appearance of whale sharks closely related to the presence of the anchovies where a positive correlation value is found between the catch of anchovies and whale sharks during the west monsoon and east monsoon in sequence 0,912 and 0.819. Chlorophyll-a and SST have a significant effect on fish catch of anchovies and the appearance frequencies of whale sharks even it were not in all seasons.

TI  - A Comparison of Simulated and Field-Derived Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Canopy Height Values from Four Forest Complexes in the Southeastern USA
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetative leaf area is a critical input to models that simulate human and ecosystem exposure to atmospheric pollutants. Leaf area index (LAI) can be measured in the field or numerically simulated, but all contain some inherent uncertainty that is passed to the exposure assessments that use them. LAI estimates for minimally managed or natural forest stands can be particularly difficult to develop as a result of interspecies competition, age and spatial distribution. Satellite-based LAI estimates hold promise for retrospective analyses, but we must continue to rely on numerical models for alternative management analysis. Our objective for this study is to calculate and validate LAI estimates generated from the USDA Environmental Policy Impact Climate (EPIC) model (a widely used, field-scale, biogeochemical model) on four forest complexes spanning three physiographic provinces in Virginia and North Carolina. Measurements of forest composition (species and number), LAI, tree diameter, basal area, and canopy height were recorded at each site during the 2002 field season. Calibrated EPIC results show stand-level temporally resolved LAI estimates with R-2 values ranging from 0.69 to 0.96, and stand maximum height estimates within 20% of observation. This relatively high level of performance is attributable to EPIC's approach to the characterization of forest stand biogeochemical budgets, stand history, interspecies competition and species-specific response to local weather conditions. We close by illustrating the extension of this site-level approach to scales that could support regional air quality model simulations.

TI  - How Not to Do African Epistemology
T2  - SYNTHESIS PHILOSOPHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - African epistemology is a discourse of culture philosophy; and culture philosophy, in turn, is a discourse of a peoples conception and perception of reality. To this extent, it reflects on the conceptualisation of a people's lived-world. In this vein, the content, method and tools for analysis of culture philosophy are lamely inclusive of materials that are indicative of a people's worldview (what is here referred to as "culture specifics) that are the markers of the identity of a culture. In doing culture philosophy say, African epistemology, therefore, it is the "culture specifics" that marks a particular philosophical reflection as belonging to the discourse of African epistemology. In explicating what it considers to be the method of doing African epistemology, the paper first articulates the nature, character and method of culture philosophy, and then engages a number of published works on African epistemology, with the intent of appraising the method(s) usually deployed to examine the subject-matter of African epistemology (as evident from engaging selected published works on African epistemology). Having engaged selected published works on African epistemology vis-a-vis the analysis of the nature, character and method of culture philosophy, the paper draws attention to the fractures between the method(s) deployed in the analysis of African epistemology. on the one hone( and the requirements of the method for doing African epistemology as culture philosophy, on the other. The paper concludes with a proposal of a method for doing African epistemology, which may he made to bear on African philosophy in general.

AB  - The Bulgarian coastal zone is exposed to wide variety of natural hazards, where their complex impact may cause negative social and economic consequences and environmental changes. To improve the understanding of such dangerous and destructive processes, a new knowledge and techniques are required. Satellite imagery is critical to deliver a clear picture on the extent of devastation after any disaster that is happening on Bulgarian territory. In recent years, with becoming operational, Copernicus data and products become as well freely available to the scientific community and end users. To address the national needs and priorities, set out in the National Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction 2017-2030, this paper provides a systematic analysis of the Copernicus data for the purposes of compiling different cartographic products and maps for monitoring of equatorial and adjacent terrestrial ecosystems. A comparative review of optical and radar satellite images comprising the data archive since the beginning of 90th and data from Copernicus initiative till now covering the western Black Sea area is presented. The data analysis will contribute to develop wide-range monitoring of the potential endangered areas, detection of slow surface movements and delineation of destructive natural hazard events. We complimented the analysis with tracking time changes of the coastal area for the last three decades for the test risk region of northern Bulgarian coast. This region is undergone on the recent vertical crustal movements, active landslide processes, and coastal abrasion; it is one of the regions in Bulgaria with a high seismic risk. The importance of Sentinel data for monitoring in Bulgaria is discussed, taking into account that the Bulgarian National program for disasters preparedness and risk mitigation is harmonized with the EU policy of natural hazard risk mitigation.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Religious Education between Radicalism and Tolerance
CL  - Univ Vienna, Bucharest, ROMANIA
AB  - The aim of this chapter is to offer a viable perspective for religious educators in developing learners' competency "in living together" in an increasingly diverse world. The topicality of developing students'competency "in living together" is undermined by evidence of hostility toward different religious positions that is in line with strong tendencies toward xenophobia and ethnocentrism, "us-them" mentality, and arrogance in the world. I believe that worldview education serves as a viable perspective to respond to the diverse spiritual, religious, and non-religious needs of the contemporary learner. Learning to live within the context of religious diversity is an important component of cultural diversity that educators are taking seriously in their pedagogies. In an increasingly diverse world, people do not fit within boundaries having distinct labels. Instead, we experience a dynamic process of interpretation, reinterpretation, and reconstruction of religious meanings by individuals in ever changing historical and social circumstances (Ilisko, 2009, p. 43). Therefore, schools need to ask how they can be inclusive in their responses to such a diversity of worldviews and how they can respond to the needs of students representing various worldviews. The collapse of moral authorities also necessitates a reevaluation of dominant models for and approaches to teaching religion in public schools. Acknowledging the plurality of worldviews, this approach can enrich students understanding and prevent indoctrination into a particular view. Educating students in variety of worldviews enables them to develop a moral vision that affirms each human being's dignity and promotes equality and justice, to deepen their own view, and to embrace the diversity around them.

AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare aggressive skin cancer with the mortality rate of 33%.MCC was first described by Toker in 1972 as a trabecular cell carcinoma and is classified as aneuroendocrine tumor similar to small cell lung carcinoma and melanoma. The pathogenesisof MCC remains largely unknown. However, ultraviolet radiation and immunosuppression arelikely to play a significant pathogenic role. The primary skin lesion is usually asymptomaticand it typically presents as a red or purple dome-shaped nodule. The management of MCC iscontroversial, however, local wide excision followed by radiotherapy is accepted as the primarytreatment modality. The regional draining nodal basin is the most common site for recurrence.Therefore, sentinel lymph node biopsy is recommended in all cases, except for the clinicallynode-negative cases. We herein report two cases of MCC on the left cheek with differentclinical manifestations.

AB  - Scientism is a kind of religious belief that science is the only way to enlighten the real truth in all of things in the world as well as the natural phenomena. This ideology of scientism, which puts the reductive materialism as a philosophical foundation, becomes a serious menace to the present christianity. For all that, the balanced theological analysis and criticism about scientism in the domestic conservative theology is still very poor. Therefore, this article aims to analyze various issues that scientism can threaten the christian faith. Based on this analysis, scientism is illuminated and criticized from a reformed theological standpoint. For this purpose, I have analyzed the research of Dr. Hyung-Nong Park who is a gigantic tree of the reformed theology in Korea. According to this analysis, the modern scientism will cause the serious confusion to the christian worldview through its atheistic worldview which can not be compatible with christian theism. Scientism decreases the universal and affirmative influence of christianity to the human beings. In addition, scientism can give a deleterious effect to whole humans as impairing the universal dignity of the human beings guaranteed by the christianity. Briefly, in viewpoint of the reformed theology based on the view of science of Dr. Hyung-Nong Park, scientism can be incompatible with the christian worldview and is further in conflict with the universal value of the human beings.

TI  - Anomaly detection using morphology-based collaborative representation in hyperspectral imagery
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A nonparametric anomaly detection method is proposed in this paper which does not consider any probability density function for data, and so can work well for real hyperspectral image containing complicated and non-normal background. Since the predominant part of an image is composed by background pixels and because of similarity of neighboring pixels in a local region, each background pixel can be approximated from its surrounding samples. To this end, the collaborative representation with a simple and closed form solution is used. To more benefit from the spatial information of hyperspectral image, the morphological filters are applied for extraction of contextual features and a decision fusion rule is used to utilize the spatial information of all principal components of data. The experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed detector compared to several state-of-the-art anomalous target detection methods. The area under ROC curve (AUC) values achieved by the proposed detector are 95.53, 96.34 and 99.72 for San Diego hyperspectral image, Indian hyperspectral image and the WorldView-2 multispectral image, respectively.

AB  - Land-use classification from multiple data sources is an important problem in remote sensing. Data fusion algorithms like Semi-Supervised Manifold Alignment (SSMA) and Manifold Alignment with Schroedinger Eigenmaps (SEMA) use spectral and/or spatial features from multispectral, multimodal imagery to project each data source into a common latent space in which classification can be performed. However, in order for these algorithms to be well-posed, they require an expert user to either directly identify pairwise dissimilarities in the data or to identify class labels for a subset of points from which pairwise dissimilarities can be derived. In this paper, we propose a related data fusion technique, which we refer to as Semi-Supervised Normalized Embeddings (SSNE). SSNE is defined by modifying the SSMA/SEMA objective functions to incorporate an extra normalization term that enables a latent space to be well-defined even when no pairwise-dissimilarities are provided. Using publicly available data from the 2017 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest, we show that SSNE enables similar land-use classification performance to SSMA/SEMA in scenarios where pairwise dissimilarities are available, but that unlike SSMA/SEMA, it also enables land-use classification in other scenarios.

TI  - Fractional cover mapping of spruce and pine at 1 ha resolution combining very high and medium spatial resolution satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increases in extreme weather events associated with climate change have the potential to put currently healthy forests at risk. One option to minimize this risk is the application of forest management measures aimed at generating species mixtures predicted to be more resilient to these threats. In order to apply such measures appropriately, forest managers need up-to-date, accurate and consistent forest maps at relatively fine spatial resolutions. Cost efficiency is a major factor when creating such maps. Taking European spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) as an example, this paper describes an innovative approach for mapping two tree species using a combination of commercial very high resolution WorldView-2 (WV2) images and Landsat time series data. As a first step, this study used a supervised object-based classification of WV2 images covering relatively small test sites distributed across the region of interest. Using these classification maps as training data, wall-to-wall mapping of fractional coverages of spruce and pine was achieved using multi-temporal Landsat data and Random Forests (RF) regression. The method was applied for the entire state of Bavaria (Germany), which comprises a total forested area of approximately 26,000 km(2). As applied here, this two-step approach yields consistent and accurate maps of fractional tree cover estimates with a spatial resolution of 1 ha. Independent validation of the fractional cover estimates using 3780 reference samples collected through visual interpretation of orthophotos produced root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 11% (for spruce) and 14% (for pine) with almost no bias, and R-2 values of 0.74 and 0.79 for spruce and pine, respectively. The majority of the validation samples (75% (spruce) and 84% (pine)) were modeled within the assumed uncertainty of +/- 15% of the reference sample. Accuracies were significantly better compared to those achieved using a single-step classification of Landsat time series data at the pixel level (30 m), because the two-step approach better captures regional variation in the spectral signatures of target classes. Moreover, the increased number of available reference cells mitigates the impact of occasional errors in the reference data set. This two-step approach has great potential for cost-effective operational mapping of dominant forest types over large areas.

AB  - An innovative method for radiometric calibration of SAR images affected by induced-topography distortions is proposed. The analytical formulation underlying the proposed method is rigorously obtained by using the fundamental concepts of the differential geometry of the surface. It encompasses a suitable 3D geometric description based on a trajectory-centric cylindrical coordinate system, a convenient parametrization of the illuminated terrain surface, and an inverse mapping approach. The practical effectiveness of the GICAL method is successfully demonstrated by using COSMO-SkyMed SAR data.

AB  - A close interconnection between man and nature is the point of departure. The focus is on the close relationship with all kind of animals. Some strong examples of violence towards animals are presented. The violence is a direct result of methods applied by big scale farm-industries, supported by economists' recommendations of profit maximization. The cure might consist of multiple remedies - a change in worldview from mechanistic to organic - a profound shift in mindset from a distanced and abstract view on other species to being in nature in a more unmediated and unreflective way. Instead of extensive abstract thinking about nature, we as human beings should be more fully aware that we are nature and need nature in order to fulfillment of our potential. Consequently, we should pay high respect to other animals and grant them intrinsic value. In the conclusion, it will be suggested that a more non-violent and frugal attitude to nature will be steps in the right direction. Munch's painting Scream is used to illustrate the immense pain and suffering that are inflicted upon nature, not the least animals, in the modern industrialized society.

CP  - Conference on Observatory Operations - Strategies, Processes, and Systems VII
CL  - Austin, TX
AB  - Remotely operated astronomical radio telescope facilities that are spread over a large geographical area demand a new kind of protection from severe weather phenomena such as wind gusts and lightning. Both of these factors pose a unique danger to dish shaped antennas which many radio telescopes are based on. Structural damage can be incurred by severe wind gusts if a dish antenna is not stowed into its minimum wind profile position, and lightning protection might not be at its optimal configuration if the dish is not stowed. Traditionally, anemometers have provided wind information to base stow decisions on. In the case of thunderstorms capable of triggering microburst events however, anemometers do not provide timely enough warning, and their spot measurements are too localised to provide safety for distributed antenna networks.We discuss our implementation of a near real-time satellite data based severe storm warning system built for the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), the methods used to diagnose convective developments, and we will show on a number of examples how well such a satellite based system can work, despite the system inherent time lag. We conclude by discussing future developments and improvements that can be made to the system for deployment with extremely large projects such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) currently being planned and built in South Africa and Australia that will require monitoring of an area orders of magnitude larger even than we are monitoring today.Using data products derived from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) deployed on the Japanese Meteorological Agency's (JMA) Himawari 8 satellite, we can obtain information on convective developments in the troposphere that are likely to result in dangerous wind gusts. This data is taken in 10 minute intervals and generally available no later than 8 minutes after the observation time, thus providing near real-time information on the weather situation. One additional challenge is the large area covered by the radio interferometers we are operating. In the case of the Australian Square Kilometre Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope in remote West Australia's Murchison Radio Observatory (MRO), the landmass covers dozens of square kilometers featuring 36 dish antennas of 12m diameter each.

AB  - Open mining activities in Sumedang Regency has been operated since 1984 impacted to degradation of environment due to large area of ex-mining. Therefore, identification of ex-mining area which generally been used for sand mining is crucial and important to detect and monitor recent environmental degradation impacted from the ex-mining activities. In this research, identification ex-sand mining area using optical and SAR data in Sumedang Regency will be discussed. We use Landsat 5 TM acquisition date August 01, 2009 and Landsat 8 OLI acquired on June 24, 2016 to identify location of sand mining area, processed using Tasselled Cap Trasformation (TCT), while the landform deformation approached using ALOS PALSAR in 2009 and ALOS PALSAR 2 in 2016 processed using SAR interferometry (InSAR) method. The results show that TCT and InSAR method can can be used to identify the areas of ex-sand mining clearly. In 2016 the total area of ex-mining were 352.92 Ha. The land deformation show that during 7 years period since 2009 has impacted to the deformation at 7 meters.

AB  - Land cover mapping using high resolution image time series faces the issue dealing with high volumes of data which can threaten the ability of supervised classifiers to learn pertinent decision boundaries. Although dimensionality reduction approaches have been applied to hyperspectral imagery for a long time, their use with dense time series has not yet been explored. We study the usefulness of dimensionality reduction as a pre-processing step for high resolution optical image time series supervised classification for land cover mapping. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Autoencoders and Kohonen's Self Organising Map are compared over 3 dimensionality reduction approaches : global, per date and per band. Applying PCA to each date of the time series yields the best results in terms of classification accuracy.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports fruitful utilization of satellite-based MODIS optical data on sea-surface Chl-a concentration determination and mapping over Upper Gulf of Thailand (UGoT) region during 2010-2012 period. To fulfil this task, the optimal algorithm for extraction of the constituent through the applied MODIS reflectance data was identified first based on their effectiveness in determination of reference Chl-a data. The preferred Chl-a concentration maps were then generated through the identified algorithm along with their associated trophic state maps established regarding the modified OECD criteria. In the first step, the OC3M algorithm was selected (out of five initial candidates) as it provided the most satisfied output (with R-2 of 0.60) and used to make Chl-a density maps for the area. These obtained maps indicated that the concerned critical areas which are potentially vulnerable to red-tide occurrence (i.e., those in eutrophic/hyper-eutrophic states with high amount of Chl-a mixture) were frequently assembled over shallow water close to shore and main surrounding river mouths in the north, especially that of the Tha Chin River. However, patterns and strength of their distribution over the area were remarkably dynamic all year round with relatively low activity evidenced in dry season and more pronounced situation seen in monsoon season. In this regard, notable drop in total amount of the critical areas during wet season of 2011 was attributed to the influence of mega-flooding over central Thailand at that time.

AB  - Damming rivers have an impact on the marine natural resources because it can affect the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles in a watershed. Changes influx of nutrients from upstream to downstream can affect fertility of the waters around the mouth of the river and surrounding areas. This paper discusses the differences and similarities of the spatial pattern of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration in the waters areas around mouth of Cimanuk River before and after the functioning of Jatigede Reservoir in in Sumedang District. Spatial data of chlorophyll-a concentration in the study area were obtained from the processing and analysis of Landsat 8 multi temporal data and validation of data is done through water sampling and laboratory testing. This research area was divided into 3 segments, western Cimanuk Estuary region, the waters between the two estuaries, and eastern Cimanuk Estuary region. The results showed that after the functioning of the Jatigede Dam, the distribution of chl-a with a concentration 0.5 - 1 mg/m(3) which tend to decrease. The watershed discharge factor significantly affects the distribution of chl-a concentration in the water nearby to land.

TI  - Evaluating the Implementation of Home-Based Videoconferencing for Providing Mental Health Services
T2  - PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has recently implemented video-to-home (V2H) telehealth as part of a strategy to improve access to mental health treatment. Implementation research of this modality is needed, given that V2H telehealth transforms the traditional face-to-face delivery of mental health services. To address this need, V2H implementation was evaluated by examining barriers and facilitators that were associated with level of staff V2H experience and factors that differentiated facilities with various levels of V2H performance.Methods: Semistructured interviews with VHA personnel (N=33) from three facilities were conducted. The facilities were selected by overall number of mental health V2H visits during fiscal year (FY) 2015 as well as by growth in number of visits from FY 2014 through FY 2015. Factors influencing implementation were identified through qualitative analyses that contrasted responses by groups of participants with three different levels of V2H experience (no experience, limited experience, most experience) as well as three facilities that differed in V2H productivity (high visit count, high visit growth, and low visit count and low visit growth).Results: Providers seemed to encounter different barriers and facilitators depending on their level of experience with V2H. Site-level analyses illustrated the importance of logistical support, especially for providers who are newly adopting the technology. Other factors that differentiated the facilities were also identified and described.Conclusions: Key factors related to implementation of V2H telehealth pertained to provider buy-in and logistical support. Facility-level strategies that address these factors may enhance provider progression from nonuse to sustained use.

TI  - The Maoxian landslide as seen from space: detecting precursors of failure with Sentinel-1 data
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Post-event Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) analysis on a stack of 45 C-band SAR images acquired by the ESA Sentinel-1 satellites from 9 October 2014 to 19 June 2017 allowed the identification of a clear precursory deformation signal for the Maoxian landslide (Mao County, Sichuan Province, China). The landslide occurred in the early morning of 24 June 2017 and killed more than 100 people in the village of Xinmo. Sentinel-1 images have been processed through an advanced multi-interferogram analysis capable of maximising the density of measurement points, generating ground deformation maps and displacement time series for an area of 460 km(2) straddling the Minjiang River and the Songping Gully. InSAR data clearly show the precursors of the slope failure in the source area of the Maoxian landslide, with a maximum displacement rate detected of 27 mm/year along the line of sight of the satellite. Deformation time series of measurement points identified within the main scarp of the landslide exhibit an acceleration starting from April 2017. A detailed time series analysis leads to the classification of different deformation behaviours. The Fukuzono method for forecasting the time of failure appear to be applicable to the displacement data exhibiting progressive acceleration. Results suggest that satellite radar data, systematically acquired over large areas with short revisiting time, could be used not only as a tool for mapping unstable areas, but also for landslide monitoring, at least for some typologies of sliding phenomena.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 14th International Conference on Emerging Technologies (ICET)
CL  - Islamabad, PAKISTAN
AB  - Recent field surveys have reported the presence of corals in many places in the Pakistan coastal ocean; Astola Island especially has been a subject of interest with regards to corals and overall marine biodiversity, and has in fact recently been declared Pakistan's first Marine Protected Area. This study presents an analysis of coral reefs identification and their spatial distribution through optical satellite remote sensing in the surrounding area of Astola Island. Besides remote sensing data, the study considers sea survey data collected by divers in recent years. A benthic map of ocean ecosystem habitats is generated, through processing of Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) imagery. The satellite data was selected at low tide time to get maximum sunlight penetration in shallow water. Water-column correction was used to generate the depth invariant index on multiple band-pairs. Water column corrected depth-invariant index bands were then segmented and classified through object-based classification. The results from the remote sensing data processing over Astola Island show good agreement with the field survey data, with nearly all the field survey points of coral reefs falling within the coral reefs class. Use of remote sensing imagery such as Landsat 8, and application of the water column correction method can allow for regular monitoring and management of coral reefs and other benthic ecosystems in the coastal ocean of Pakistan and coastal Arabian Sea.

AB  - Matured trees contain high concentration of chlorophyll that encourages the process of photosynthesis. This process produces oxygen as a by-product and releases it into the atmosphere and helps in lowering the ambient temperature. This study attempts to analyse the effect of green area on air surface temperature of the Kuala Lumpur city. The air surface temperatures of two different dates which are, in March 2006 and March 2016 were simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The green area in the city was extracted using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from two Landsat satellite images. The relationship between the air surface temperature and the green area were analysed using linear regression models. From the study, it was found that, the green area was significantly affecting the distribution of air temperature within the city. A strong negative correlation was identified through this study which indicated that higher NDVI values tend to have lower air surface temperature distribution within the focus study area. It was also found that, different urban setting in mixed built-up and vegetated areas resulted in different distributions of air surface temperature. Future studies should focus on analysing the air surface temperature within the area of mixed built-up and vegetated area.

AB  - Forest fires are considered an Essential Climate Variable in Global Warming researches, due to the greenhouse gases (GHG) they emit. To identify the spatial and temporal distribution of emissions is necessary to design mitigation actions. However, uncertainties exist when calculating the parameters involved into its estimation, such as the burning efficiency; define as the biomass burned on particular area (Seiler y Crutzen, 1980). This work proposes a method to estimate burning efficiency using Earth Observation Data, field data and Random Forest algorithm, that gives us specific information over each burned area and enhance the emission estimation of GHG. The results show the relation between burning efficiency and spatial differences of fuel and meteorological conditions.

AB  - We summarize the development and evaluation of new type of phospholipid polymers as a solubilizer for poorly water-soluble compounds. That is, a water-soluble and amphiphilic poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine-random-n-butyl methacrylate) contains 30mol% hydrophilic 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine units and its weight-averaged molecular weight is around 5.0x10(4). When the polymer is dissolved in an aqueous medium, a large portion of hydrophobic n-butyl methacrylate units assemble, forming polymer aggregates. To avoid severe biological reactions caused by conventional solubilizers, the phospholipid polymer can be applied for the solubilization of poorly water-soluble bioactive compounds. The polarity inside these polymer aggregate is the same as that of ethanol and n-butanol. Therefore, bioactive compounds, whose solubility is poor in water but good in these alcohols, can be entrapped in the polymer aggregate. The phospholipid polymer can penetrate the cell membrane by molecular diffusion, carrying inside the cell the bioactive compound, without exhibiting significant cytotoxicity. Several animal experiments have revealed that the pharmacological performance of various bioactive compound/phospholipid polymer complexes is excellent. Furthermore, functionalization of the polymer aggregate with biomolecules, such as antibodies and oligonucleotides, can be done, leading to selective capturing of the target molecules. These examples clearly indicate that water-soluble and amphiphilic phospholipid polymer is a candidate for preparing safer formulations and more effective pharmaceutical treatment with several bioactive compounds.

TI  - The Semiotic Codes of Artistic Conventionality in Philosophic Fiction by Colin Wilson
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the series of novels that represent Colin Wilson's most notable achievements in philosophic visionary fiction as included in his follow-up book "Spider World". The systematic approach to the subject-matter enables the author to reproduce a unified genre model of the novels in question and to correlate with its epic perspective the starting assumptions and the proposed aims of the research. Within the given system of epistemological coordinates of the epic novel, the narrative text and the semiotic metatext are identified and differentiated by the topical features relating them, correspondingly, to the primary or secondary paradigms of artistic conventionality. The dichotomous division of textual substructures opens an access to the intermediate space of mutual semantic connotations. Within this intertextual space, the aesthetic forms of the worldview manifest exceptional dependence on the factual contents of the narrated story, while their semiotic codes reflect the continuous changes of ideological concepts along the story line. The linear analysis of the structural and functional relations between different levels of the novel architectonics leads to the conclusion that the discourse of semiotic codes of artistic conventionality is constituted by the strictly ordered sequence of ideographic symbols of mythos, phenomenological images of reality, and conceptual image-ideas, which reveal the value of things in their significance for human condition.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SELVA ANDINA RESEARCH SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is a technique used for the acquisition of information (in this case the situation of the forests) by means of spatial images obtained by satellite (distant sensors). Later, different techniques of digital and visual processing are used in the satellite images (multispectral type Landsat), to determine the changes in the vegetal cover of the soil for the periods of 1989-2005 and 2005-2014. The study area is the sub-basin of the Coroico River, which.The methodology of spatial remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems was used to generate deforestation maps and subsequent quantification of this information, which was done through the use of the ArcGIS and ERDAS programs. The digital processing of the images was done to identify areas or areas where none existed, or the vegetation cover was very scarce in the soils for the years 1989, 2005 and 2014. The results obtained were: a progressive decrease of the forested areas, being more severe in the period 1989-2005 in contrast to the period 2005-2014.With the results obtained, it is concluded that the loss of the forest is mainly due to inadequate production techniques (agriculture), which leads to the migration and habilitation of new agricultural areas in areas where previously they were forest. This process that is increasing over time occurs at altitudes ranging from 574 to 1605 meters above sea level in the sub-basin, the deforested area has increased 3 times more from 602.05 to 1705.05 ha with a deforestation rate of 59.38 ha Annual forest losses during the period from 1989 to 2005 in relation to the period from 2005 to 2014 that reaches 16.99 ha. Based on the linear data trend, these forest areas will continue to increase in the coming years. (c) 2018. Journal of the Selva Andina Research Society. Bolivia. All rights reserved.

AB  - Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) is an advanced technique to map ground surface displacements of an area over a period. The technique can measure deformation with a millimeter-level accuracy. It overcomes the limitations of Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) such as geometric, temporal decorrelation and atmospheric variations between master and slave images. In our study, Sentinel-1A Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode descending pass images from May 2016 to December 2017 (23 images) are used to identify the stable targets called persistent scatterers (PS) over Bengaluru city. Twenty-two differential interferograms are generated after topographic phase removal using the SRTM 30 m DEM. The main objective of this study is to analyze urban subsidence in Bengaluru city in India using the multi-temporal interferometric technique such as PSI. The pixels with Amplitude Stability Index >= 0.8 are selected as initial PS candidates (PSC). Later, the PSCs having temporal coherence > 0.5 are selected for the time series analysis. The number of PSCs that are identified after final selection are reduced from 59590 to 54474 for VV polarization data and 15611 to 15596 for VH polarization data. It is interesting to note that a very less number of PSC are identified in cross-polarized images (VH). A high number of PSC have identified in co-polarized (VV) images as the vertically oriented urban targets produce a double bounce, which results in a strong return towards the sensor. The velocity maps obtained using VV and VH polarizations show displacement in the range of +/- 20 mm year(-1). The subsidence and the upliftment observed in the city shows a linear trend with time. It is observed that the eastern part of Bengaluru city shows more subsidence than the western part.

CP  - 13th Biennial Pan Ocean Remote Sensing Conference (PORSEC)

AB  - The results of the satellite monitoring of oil spills in the Barents Sea are analysed and discussed. For the first time, in 2015-2016, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images occurred regularly using the European Space Agency Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellites. To effectively analyse the SAR images and their detected dark patches, a geoinformation approach, specifically, a web-based GeoMixer application, was used. This involves the creation of a dedicated geoportal with a large volume of oceanographic, physical-geographical, and industrial information about the water basin, including the offshore oil and gas infrastructures and coastal vulnerability. Using this approach, as well as data from automatic ship identification systems, it is shown that the main sources of oil pollution (spills from 0.5 to 90km(2)) are cargo shipping and fishing fleets. Summary maps of the detected and identified oil spills are presented and discussed.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on OCEANS MTS/IEEE Charleston
CL  - Charleston, SC
AB  - The study is focused on the analysis of the kinematic structure and dynamics of eddy currents that develop in sub-surface layers of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM); that is, eddy currents that do not have a clear surface signature. Such eddies have a weak surface expression and therefore are difficult to detect and monitor based on remote sensing data. Although in the past studies of such eddies received certain attention, our understanding of their characteristics, generation mechanisms, and dynamics remains poor, due to the lack of direct measurements and process-oriented modeling studies. In our study, we use publicly available current profile data, collected in the GOM to meet the requirements of data collection associated with the regulations imposed by the US government, in combination with the surface drifter data used to describe the oceanographic context behind the measurements and results from the HYCOM, Mercator, and TOPS hydrodynamic models. The results of our analyses show that, for the most part. these sub-surface events appear to correspond with the presence of cyclonic eddies. The surface signature of the eddies is usually weak, but the near-surface drifting buoys do pick up the circulation. Also, in some cases, the maps of surface currents reveal the presence of a Loop Current Eddy in the vicinity of a deep sub-surface flow, suggesting frontal instabilities that lead to the development of meso-scale (mostly cold-core) features along frontal boundaries as a plausible eddy generation mechanism. Our comparison of model data with observations, for the periods of the occurrence of deep subsurface flows, did not reveal any signatures of deep sub-surface flows in the outputs of the hydrodynamic models. Moreover, screening of the model data for the presence of deep sub-surface flows with a weak surface expression did not turn up even a single such case, suggesting that the models do not have the right physics to resolve deep subsurface flows. The latter result emphasizes the timeliness of the study for a better understanding of flow dynamics in the GOM.

Mapping of the croplands on the territory of 9 river basins for the two time slices (the middle of the 1980s, and the present-day period 2013-2015) was carried out by visual interpretation of multi-seasonal images Landsat 5 and Landsat 8. Using vector layers obtained as a result of digitization, the areas of croplands in the analyzed periods have been calculated, and changes which occurred in 30 years were estimated. The decrease of croplands area was revealed in all studied river basins. An assessment of the effect of cropland reduction on the soil loss rate was carried out. Using the SRMM DEM with a 30 m spatial resolution, the following morphometric characteristics of relief for cultivated and abandoned croplands were calculated: steepness of slopes, flowpath length, factor LS. Based on the results of calculations, the average values of the factor LS reduced from 1985 to 2015 on the croplands in all considered basins. The obtained data confirm that the reduction of the croplands area is one of the factors responsible for the decrease of modern soil loss rates observed in field studies.

AB  - In the modern world, which is often called a society of postmodern, a new form of worldview and lifestyle gathers force, which can be conventionally called mobility. Mobility implies unattachment of a human being to a place of residence, a place of work, permanent human environment. In the paper, mobility is considered as a constituent of a life strategy, allowing one, according to individual representations of testees, to achieve personal security more effectively, in contrast to settled lifestyle, implying greater vulnerability. The results of the research, conducted based on the youth sampling, are presented. The objective of the research was the study of mobility as a social phenomenon of postmodern society and determination of its individual-psychological determinants from the position of personality security psychology. The following was used as research techniques: a questionnaire, the method of studying value types by M.S. Yasnitskiy, the author's method of studying strategies of providing personal security, the method of depth interview with subsequent meaningful and content analysis of data. Obtained results indicate high popularity of mobility as a preferable reference point in alignment of a life strategy of providing personal security. Strategic preferences are analysed in the context of value types and other psychological and social characteristics. A conclusion on the increase of "mobility tendencies" among postmodern youth is made, and unattachment, bordering with impermanence, becomes a part of "postmodern self".

TI  - Do adjectives exhaust the personality lexicon? A psycholexical study of the Lithuanian language
T2  - CURRENT ISSUES IN PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDThe psycholexical approach is based on the assumption that the most important individual differences that people can observe have been encoded into the natural language. Thus, by studying the structure of these lexicons, we are able to identify individual differences that are universal across cultures as well as dimensions that are unique to some of them. The aim of the study was to develop a psycholexical taxonomy of the Lithuanian language including different parts of speech.PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDUREthe authors analysed over 76,000 entries included in a dictionary of Lithuanian and identified 9625 person-descriptive terms: adjectives, attribute-nouns, type-nouns, and participles. The selected lexical material was classified by a team of six judges into 11 subcategories making up six higher-order categories. The authors performed the psychometric validity and consistency of the judges' classification decisions.RESULTSThe analysis of proportions between types of lexical units describing dispositional traits showed that nearly 20.00% of terms in the personality lexicon did not have an adjectival form and were expressed by means of other - morphemically non-redundant - parts of speech.CONCLUSIONSThe present study points to the necessity of taking into account various parts of speech describing dispositional traits in order to avoid the error of reductionism; it also contributes to the debate on universals in personality description. The results of the study can be used to determine the structure of the description of individual differences for the Lithuanian personality lexicon, for type-nouns or attribute-nouns, and for non-dispositional categories, including emotions, social effects, and worldview.

T2  - EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS IX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications IX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The present study is a continuation of the previous monitoring studies on floating reed islands based on remote sensing methods, but this time the study is much more precise in order to create a sustainable operating model for subsequent monitoring studies on this specific type of habitats. The aim of this study is to create a precise model for the movement and dynamic of the floating reed islands in Srebarna Lake. This was done by creating a hybrid model (based on optical and SAR data), assessing the actually condition of floating reed islands, and applying it to quantify of the movement of floating reed islands to perform an actual and seasonal habitats monitoring. To create the hybrid model, the advantages of SAR data-Sentinel-1 for the hydrological dynamics monitoring of Srebarna Lake were used. The SAR data used were obtained for different time periods, within the observed seasons. Multispectral satellite data from Sentinel-2 was also used in order to apply an orthogonal transformation model called Tasselled Cap Transformation (TCT). The Tasselled Cap model is a very effective method for classifying and analyzing processes related to the dynamics of changes affecting the main components of the Earth's surface: soil, water, and vegetation. This model proved to be very effective in recognizing specific types of vegetation and habitats, such as floating reed islands and their transformation over a period of time. The results for the reconciliation of TCT images and SAR data define very well the precise boundaries of both the central water body in Srebarna Lake, and the floating reed islands. The results obtained by means of comparative analysis confirm both methods as being equally effective to determine the floating reed islands dynamics in the hybrid model proposed in this study.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of this study is to evaluate different remote sensing indices to detect spatial distribution of wet soils using GIS based algorithms. Area of this study represents different soil types on various quaternary deposits as well as different forest types. We analyzed 25 sites with the area of 1 km(2) each in central and western part of Latvia. Data about soil characteristics like thickness of peat layer and presence of reductimorphic colors in soil was collected during field surveys in 228 random points within study sites. ANOVA test for comparing means of different soil wetness classes and binary logistic regression analysis for evaluating the accuracy of different remote sensing indices to model spatial distribution of wet areas are used for analysis. Main conclusion of this study is that for different quaternary deposits and soil texture classes different algorithms for soil wetness prediction should be used. Data layers for predicting soil wetness in this study are various modifications and resolutions of digital elevation model like depressions, slope and SAGA wetness index as well as Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery. Accuracy of soil wetness classification of soils on moraine, fluvial and eolian sediments exceeds 94%, whereas on the clayey sediments it is close to 80%.

TI  - THE YOUTH'S PERCEPTION OF RELIGIOUS VALUES: A SOCIOLOGICAL STUDY
T2  - RUDN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY-VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV SERIYA SOTSIOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the younger generations' perception of religion and the role of religious values. The authors argue that in the last decades the attitudes to religion in the Russian society have transformed. Religion determines values of every culture that influence the worldview of different generations. In the contemporary secularized society, religion plays the role of a moral referee, forms a national mentality and a worldview. Younger generations as a dynamic social group do not tend to follow conservative traditional values, which allows to understand further trajectories of social development. The youth's interpretation of key life values significantly differs from the understanding of the same values by older generations. Younger generations are usually characterized by social dynamism, psychological lability, changing perception of cultural traditions and values, constant search for innovations and revision of the established traditions. Religious values are traditional and conservative by nature, thus they turn people to the past rather than to the future, that is why the youth is often unclear about religion. The data of international and Russian surveys prove that the youth consider religion quite pragmatically, as a kind of psychotherapy. The article presents the results of the sociological research, in which religious values were compared with other cultural values-artistic, scientific, moral and practical. According to the data, the number of people interested in religion and faith issues has significantly increased compared with the late Soviet period but religious values for younger generations are not a priority for other cultural values seem to be more important.

TI  - Cloud Property Retrieval from Multiband Infrared Measurements by Himawari-8
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm for retrieving the macroscopic, physical, and optical properties of clouds from thermal infrared measurements is applied to the Himawari-8 multiband observations. A sensitivity study demonstrates that the addition of the single CO2 band of Himawari-8 is effective for the estimation of cloud top height. For validation, retrieved cloud properties are compared systematically with collocated active remote sensing counterparts with small time lags. While retrievals agree reasonably for single-layer clouds, multilayer cloud systems with optically thin upper clouds overlying lower clouds are the major source of error in the present algorithm. Validation of cloud products is critical for identifying the characteristics, advantages, and limitation of each product and should be continued in the future.As an application example, data are analyzed for eight days in the vicinity of the New Guinea to study the diurnal cycle of the cloud system. The present cloud property analysis investigates cloud evolution through separation of different cloud types and reveals typical features of diurnal cycles related to the topography. Over land, middle clouds increase from 0900 to 1200 local solar time (LST), deep convective clouds develop rapidly during 1200 - 1700 LST with a subsequent increase in cirrus and cirrostratus cloud amounts. Over the ocean near coastlines, a broad peak of convective cloud fraction is seen in the early morning. The present study demonstrates the utility of frequent observations by Himawari-8 for life cycle study of cloud systems, owing to the ability to capture their continuous temporal variations.

TI  - Two problems from the Polishchuk and Positselski book on quadratic algebras
T2  - JOURNAL OF NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the book Quadratic algebras by Polishchuk and Positselski [23], algebras with a small number of generators (n = 2, 3) are considered. For some number r of relations possible Hilbert series are listed, and those appearing as series of Koszul algebras are specified. The first case, where it was not possible to do, namely the case of three generators n = 3 and six relations r = 6 is formulated as an open problem. We give here a complete answer to this question, namely for quadratic algebras with dim A(1) = dim A(2) = 3, we list all possible Hilbert series, and find out which of them can come from Koszul algebras, and which can not.As a consequence of this classification, we found an algebra, which serves as a counterexample to another problem from the same book [23, Chapter 7, Sec. 1, Conjecture 2], saying that Koszul algebra of finite global homological dimension d has dim A(1) >= d. Namely, the 3-generated algebra A given by relations xx + yx = xz = zy = 0 is Koszul and its Koszul dual algebra A(!) has Hilbert series of degree 4: H-A!(t) = 1 + 3t + 3t(2) + 2t(3) + t(4), hence A has global homological dimension 4.

TI  - Carcass and meat traits of different Iberian pig genotypes fed in a traditional extensive system
T2  - Archivos de Zootecnia
M3  - Article
AB  - Carcass composition and meat quality traits of three different genotypes of pure Iberian pig, i.e., Retinto (R), Torbiscal (T) and Torbiscal*Retinto (TR), as well as a Duroc*Retinto (DR) crossbred, were evaluated. A total of 48 pigs, 12 of each genotype, were used. Thickness of back fat (BF) depots, namely inner (i), middle (m), outer (o) and total (t), measured at the 10th and 14th rib levels (iBF10, mBF10, oBF10, tBF10, iBF14, mBF14, oBF14 and tBF14, respectively), were determined in the carcass. Loin area (LA) at the 10th and 14th rib levels (LA10 and LA14, respectively) were measured with a planimeter, and percent intramuscular fat (IMF) was chemically analysed. Weights (W) and yields (Y) of prime meat cuts, namely ham (H), foreleg (F), loin (L), and tenderloin (TL) were recorded (HW, FW, LW, TLW and HY, FY and LY, respectively), and total prime cut weight (TCW) and yield (TCY) were calculated. Since the DR genotype grew faster than expected, these had to be finished on concentrate and, consequently, not all meat quality traits were analysed, as they are affected by feeding system. Therefore, DR pigs were used only for carcass traits comparisons. Data were analysed by using the GLM procedures in SAS with carcass weight (within genotype) as a covariate. In relation to fat deposition traits, the R genotype had significantly greater IMF, IBF10, MBF10 and TBF10 than the other genotypes, and the T genotype had significantly greater OBF10 and OBF14 than the other genotypes. In relation to meat deposition, HW and HY were equal for all genotypes, but TR and DR genotypes had heavier forelegs and loins than R and T genotypes. Among pure Iberian genotypes, TR had larger prime cut weights and yields than R but similar to T. On the other hand, DR had the largest TCW and TCY.

AB  - In this paper, we attempt to develop the soil moisture retrieval method taking into account a wide variety of vegetation variations for the sparsely vegetated area. The method is constructed by introducing generalized volume scattering model into the polarimetric two-scale two-component model (PTSTCM). The proposed method was applied to L-band fully polarimetric ALOS-2 SAR datasets obtained over tropical peatland, Indonesia. The retrieved results were validated by simultaneously measured in-situ soil moisture. The proposed method yields more improved results than original PTSTCM with specific types of volume model (i.e., randomly, horizontally, and vertically oriented volume models) regarding the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) as well as inversion rate.

TI  - Landsat-based vegetation abundance and surface temperature for surface urban heat island studies: the tale of Greater Amman Municipality
T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed at characterizing the spatial and temporal characteristics of vegetation abundance (represented by At-Sensor Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ASNDVI) and/or Land Surface Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (LSNDVI)) and surface temperature (represented by At-Sensor Brightness Temperature (ASBT) and/or Land Surface Temperature (LST)) and investigating the types of the relationships between these variables in different seasons in different years using Landsat data in Greater Amman Municipality in Jordan. Correlation analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that using either ASNDVI or LSNDVI and either ASBT or LST should lead to the same results. Change analysis from 1987-2016 using map algebra showed that the majority of the municipality was subjected to both no change and small increase in vegetation abundance in summer and winter and both no change and small increase in surface temperature in summer and both no change and small decrease in surface temperature in winter. Vegetation abundance variability reflected partly the land cover characteristics of the municipality while surface temperature variability indicated the potential of the presence of an inverted surface urban heat island pattern. Correlation analysis using contingency tables showed the presence of negative relationship in summer and positive relationship in winter between vegetation abundance and surface temperature.

TI  - Testing the causal relationship between religious belief and death anxiety
T2  - RELIGION BRAIN & BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Religion has long been speculated to function as a strategy to ameliorate our fear of death. Terror management theory provides two possible causal pathways through which religious beliefs can fulfil this function. According to the "worldview defence" account of terror management, worldviews reduce death anxiety by offering symbolic immortality: on this view, only people who accept the religious worldview in question should benefit from religious beliefs. Alternatively, religious worldviews also offer literal immortality, and may do so independently of individuals' worldviews. Both strands of thought appear in the terror management theory literature. In this paper, we attempt to resolve this issue experimentally by manipulating religious belief and measuring explicit (Study 1) and implicit (Study 2) death anxiety. In Study 1, we found that the effect of religious belief on explicit death anxiety depends critically on participants' own religious worldviews, such that believers and nonbelievers reported greater death anxiety when their worldview is threatened. In Study 2, however, we find that religious belief alleviates implicit death anxiety amongst both believers and non-believers. These findings suggest that religious beliefs can alleviate death anxiety at two different levels, by offering symbolic and literal immortality, respectively.

TI  - Assessment of the Relationship between Air Temperature and TOA Brightness Temperature in Different Seasons Using Landsat-8 TIRS
T2  - Journal of the Korean Association of Geographic Information Studies
T2  - 한국지리정보학회지
M3  - research-article
AB  - In general, Top Of Atmosphere(TOA) brightness temperature is closely related to air temperature. Brightness temperature can be derived from the Thermal Infra-Red Sensors (TIRS) of the earth observation satellites such as the Landsat series. The TIRS instrument of the Landsat-8 satellite collects the two spectral bands (Bands 10 and 11) that measure brightness temperature. In this research, the relationship between the air temperature data measured by the weather stations in Seoul, South Korea and the brightness temperature data separately derived from Bands 10 and 11 of the Landsat-8 satellite were assessed in the different seasons through the correlation analysis. The statistical results led to the following conclusions. First, brightness temperature is closely related to air temperature in order of Spring, Autumn, Winter and Summer. Second, whenair temperature increases, brightness temperature also increases in Spring, Autumn and Winter but decreases in Summer. Third, Band 10 has a closer relationship to air temperature than Band 11.

T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The quality and quantity of observed and reanalysed data influence the direction and accuracy of scientific research. This paper reviews the data available for the study of climate and weather patterns in Australia. A list of global reanalysis and satellite data is provided, along with a more detailed review of available in situ (weather station) data in Australia. Regularly updated climate indices are identified that have previously been linked to Australian climate and weather events. Observation of Australian weather is severely hampered by the continents' vastness and remoteness, as evidenced by heavy bias of in situ measurements that are generally clustered in the coastal high-population centres (mainly southeast of Australia), with central and northern regions often having to rely on remote sensing and reanalysis data. Data sparsity can introduce significant uncertainty in terms of extreme weather and climate change management, as variables such as rainfall exhibit high spatial and temporal variability. Several areas for future research are identified, including investigation into the impact of Australian aerosol levels, the connection between soil moisture and flooding potential, and teleconnection between Atlantic sea surface temperature and Australian climate. While this study focusses on data availability to investigate Australian climate patterns, findings are applicable at a global scale.

AB  - Combined active-passive remote sensing has the potential for capturing the relative advantage of each sensing approach in geophysical retrievals. One cornerstone of combined active-passive microwave sensing is the modeling of the covariation of active and passive signals, which arise from equivalent sensitivities of both sensor types to changes in geophysical properties. In this research contribution, we propose a physics-based active-passive combination of active and passive microwave observations based on Kirchhoff's law of energy conservation. This allows establishing a physics-based forward model as well as a fully data-driven, single-pass retrieval methodology for active-passive microwave covariation. The forward model and the retrieval approach are adaptable to different sensor characteristics (incidence angle, frequency & polarization). The theoretical (forward model) as well as applied (retrieval method) physics-based covariation framework is tested with SMAP (LL) and SMAP/Sentinel-1 (LC) data to reveal potentials and constraints for active-passive microwave sensing. As a result of the conducted study, a linear functional relationship between active and passive microwave observations (e.g. assumed for the SMAP mission) is confirmed, if higher-order scattering can be omitted.

AB  - This paper presents Design and Development of an ultra-broad band, X-band 8x8 printed array for satellite payload application in micro and nano-satellites. The antenna is a single layer printed design with sequential rotation of phase at three levels in a corporate-feed structure. It is printed on a 62mil RT-Duriod substrate. Being single layer, the construction is simple, light weight. It is also rugged and withstands temperature, vibration and shocks. The antenna is particularly useful for high-speed satellite data-links almost in excess of 500Mbps. The antenna VSWR performance is good from 7 to 9.2 GHz, while axial ratio is less than 2 dB for the same. Desired gain only limits it utility to +/- 1 GHz.

TI  - Quantification of Geodiversity of Sikkim (India) and Its Implications for Conservation and Disaster Risk Reduction Research
T2  - CLIMATE CHANGE, EXTREME EVENTS AND DISASTER RISK REDUCTION: TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Geodiversity is the term which describes the variability of earth's surface materials, forms and physical processes. Conservation of geodiversity has become increasingly significant in recent decades since it has become obvious that geodiversity provides the abiotic preconditions for habitat development and maintenance and has a crucial influence on biodiversity. The Himalaya is one of the mountain systems showing highest levels of geodiversity and biodiversity. However, no research has been done on the quantification of geodiversity or on the relationships between geodiversity and biodiversity. Sikkim, located in the humid eastern Himalaya, has been selected as a study area within this global hot spot of biodiversity. The main approach of this research was to explore the geodiversity of Sikkim, using topographical and climatological information, and analyse the importance of geodiversity in the context of climate change and future conservation of natural resources. We used several quantitative approaches to produce geodiversity information which could be able to explain biodiversity patterns in the study area, since species richness models can be derived from explicit measures of geodiversity. A detailed database on species (flora) richness has been drawn from several floras and published literature. In Sikkim, the altitudinal range between 500 and 2000 m shows the highest species diversity. At higher altitudes, species diversity decreases, in particular above 5000 m. We used System for Automated Geoscientific Analysis (SAGA) GIS software for automated quantification of geodiversity. We produced a geodiversity index map which almost matches the high richness areas of the biological richness map by the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS). Quantifying geodiversity indices for biodiversity hotspots such as Sikkim may contribute to biodiversity as well as geodiversity conservation, and further the understanding of geodiversity-biodiversity relationships.

TI  - Inter-slot radiometric discrepancy correction (IRDC) for GOCI ocean colour products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th Biennial Pan Ocean Remote Sensing Conference (PORSEC)
CL  - Fortaleza, BRAZIL
AB  - The inter-slot radiometric discrepancy (IRD) causes serious inconsistency in geostationary ocean colour imager (GOCI) radiometric products across the neighbouring slots. An accurate IRD correction is essential for generating operational ocean colour products, but it remains a challenging task because of its dynamic variation irrespective of sensor's optical mechanism. The IRD is caused due to the variation in time, location, viewing geometry, and electrical sensitivity of the sensor, which result in a radiometric discontinuity in the radiance distribution between the slot images observed at the top of atmosphere (TOA). Atmospheric correction of erroneous TOA radiance (L-t, Level-1 product) leads to noisy and degraded remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs, Level-2 product) products that limit ocean colour work. To improve the quality of Level-2 products (such as R-rs and chlorophyll), radiometric bias caused due to the IRD error in Level-1 product level needs to be removed. In the present study, a practical method for correcting the IRD effects is developed and tested on several GOCI radiometric products. The method is applied to TOA radiance data from all the slots based on a variable gain factor (triangle). The gain factors for every slot are calculated with linear statistical and Lagrangian interpolation methods and applied consistently across the slot images provided by the GOCI sensor. In the absence of in situ data for these chosen images, GOCI results are compared with the corresponding MODIS-Aqua data. The proposed method is found to be effective in terms of reducing the radiance discontinuity for different slot pairs of the GOCI image, with mean relative differences of less than 0.1% and 2% for the Level-1 and Level-2 products, respectively. Despite its successful application to GOCI data, this method can be extended to similar sensors which rely on the slot-wise reception of ocean colour information over a large area.

TI  - Efficacy of Filtering Techniques in Improving Landsat SLC-Off Thermal Infrared Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2003, Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus encountered a defect in its Scan Line Corrector (SLC) mechanism resulting in the loss of about 22% pixels in each image. Thermal Infrared band is used in applications such as temperature estimation and requires a single source image for estimation of dead pixels. This analysis tests the efficacy of various Radar and Morphological filters in reconstruction of dead pixels and improving the quality of Landsat SLC-off image. Efficacy has been based on visual analysis, histogram, and image quality metrics, namely, histogram error, root mean square error, peak signal to noise ratio, and Structural SIMilarity. Of all the experimented filters, nonlinear filters-Median, Local Region, and Morphological perform better. However, Morphological filter is able to eliminate dead pixels using a 7 * 7 kernel window while Median filter is able to do so with a 29 * 29 window. All four functions-Open, Close, Erode, and Dilate of Morphological filter are able to suppress noise (fill dead pixel gaps) while preserving edges and details resulting in sharp output images. On the basis of image quality metrics, use of Open Morphological filter is suggested.

CL  - Dehradun, INDIA
AB  - The problem of Urban Municipal solid waste disposal is a challenging task faced by civic bodies and planning authorities in almost all the cities of rapidly developing countries like India. A similar situation is being faced by Dehradun, the capital, and the fastest growing city of Uttarakhand, India. In the current study, an attempt has been made to find out the suitable sites for waste disposal in the area around Dehradun city using Geospatial Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) techniques from remote sensing data. Two different decision rules of MCDA are used, namely, Analytical Hierarchical Process based Weighted Linear Combination (AHP - WLC) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). WLC has been used previously for similar studies for its ease and simplicity to apply in raster format but TOPSIS has an advantage over WLC, it orders a set of alternatives on the basis of their separation from the ideal point. It defines the best alternative as the one that is simultaneously closest to the ideal alternative and farthest from the negative ideal point. Raster-based suitability analysis has been done and the results obtained by the two methods are compared. Identical results with minor differences identifying best suitable sites outside the eastern boundary of the city where the existing dumping site is located are obtained. Also, new potential sites are identified in the western part of the city which faces the problem of waste disposal more acutely because of expansion of the city in that direction.

AB  - The Austrian architect, philosopher and artist Friedensreich Hundertwasser is an exhilarating example of the life of an ecological man. Throughout his whole life, he was in opposition to the dominating ideology characterized by growth, competition and materialism, and became one of the world's leading designers working against mainstream ideas. His alternative to the Western tunnel vision and color blindness originated in a mechanistic worldview could be described through his lifelong project of expressing knowledge and insight in nature and society through paintings, clothes, buildings and his own lifestyle. He considered himself more as a magician of vegetation rather than an academic. Artists and art can help to promote insight, understanding and dedication, and thus inspire efforts for a better world.Hundertwasser was a radical and fascinating example of an artist using scientific knowledge about nature as the basis for his artistic expressions. Hundertwasser's view might help us to see reality in new ways or bring out new aspects of it, by showing us different interpretations and unexpected approaches. By going deeper into his distinction between the five skins characterizing the dynamic relationships between the individuals and their social and natural surroundings, we might see and understand the life of an ecological man in a deeper way.

CP  - SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications IX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Permanent grasslands (meadows and pastures) are the most common agricultural land use type covering 34% (0.65 million hectares) of agricultural land in Latvia. The Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) stipulates that the EU Member States have to designate permanent grasslands, ensure that farmers do not convert or plough them and that the ratio of permanent grasslands to the total agricultural area does not decrease by more than 5% in order to receive support payments. Mapping of grasslands and assessment of their biomass (productivity) is of interest for evaluation of bio-economical potential. Field sampling is the most precise approach assessment of biomass but it is expensive and time-consuming when applied to a larger territory. In contrast, remote sensing can provide large coverage and mapping of grass biomass distribution for further use in the assessment of the available fodder for livestock and/or the optimal location for biomass-based renewable energy production sites.The study was carried out in Cesis Municipality in Latvia using airborne flying laboratory ARSENAL-the constellation of hyperspectral imagers in the visible to mid-wave infrared (400-5000 nm) spectral range, topographic LiDAR and high-resolution RGB camera for simultaneous multi-sensor data acquisition. Hyperspectral data were used for both mapping of grasslands and assessment of grass biomass. Different spectral ranges and machine learning algorithms were tested in order to find the best one. The performance of Sentinel-2 like spectral bands also was tested for further possible further use of multispectral satellite data.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive of the European Union aims to protect water bodies from feature degradation. Monitoring is essential for assessment and comprehensive overview of water status. Annex V of WFD define tree type of water quality parameters which need to be monitored (biological and two supported one - hydro morphological and physic chemical) in order to assess ecological status of water bodies. Remote sensing data can be used for monitoring and identification of water bodies over large scale regions in a more effective and efficient manner. However, this technique must to be integrated with traditions in situ sampling method and field surveying in order to provide precise results. Various empirical, semi-analytics and machine learning algorithms exist to derive relationship between multi spectral image surface reflectance and water quality indicators derived from in situ measurement. In this study we evaluate the capabilities of Landsat 8 satellite image for assessment of abundance of phytoplankton's (biological parameters) and Turbidity, Dissolved oxygen, Total Phosphorus and Total Nitrogen (physic chemical parameters) in region of Vojvodina, Republic of Serbia. The Neuron Networks are used to analyzing correlation between in situ measurements and 7 Landsat 8 atmospherically corrected satellite images acquired in 2013. In situ data are obtained from Agency for environment protection of Serbia. Our results shows that satellite-based monitoring, in combination with in situ data, provide an improved basis for more effective monitoring of large number of water bodies over large geographical area. Relationship between derived and WFD quality parameters is established in order to provide usage of remote sensing data for ecological status classification according to WFD.

T2  - POLISH MARITIME RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice conditions in the Baltic Sea during six latest winters - 2010/2011 to 2015/2016 are analysed using coupled ice-ocean numerical model 3D CEMBS (3D Coupled Ecosystem Model of the Baltic Sea). Simulation results are compared with observations from monitoring stations, ice charts and satellite data. High correlation between model results and observations has been confirmed both in terms of spatial and temporal approach. The analysed period has a high interannual variability of ice extent, the number of ice days and ice thickness. Increasing number of relatively mild winters in the Northern Europe directly associated with climate change results in reduced ice concentration in the Baltic Sea. In this perspective, the implementation and development of the sea ice modelling approach (in addition to standard monitoring techniques) is critical to assess current state of the Baltic Sea environment and predict possible climate related changes in the ecosystem and their influence for human marine-related activities, such as fishery or transportation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Monovalent rotavirus vaccine (RV1) was introduced in Tanzania in January 2013 under the Reach Every Child initiative, to be given at ages 6 and 10 weeks. We used the sentinel hospital rotavirus surveillance system to examine the rotavirus detection rate before and after vaccine introduction and estimate vaccine effectiveness.METHODS: Before vaccine introduction, rotavirus surveillance was established at two mainland hospitals; children admitted for acute diarrhea were eligible for enrollment and stools were tested for rotavirus antigen. We compared the rotavirus positivity rate in the pre-vaccine period (Tanga Hospital, 2009 and 2011; Bugando Medical Centre, 2012) to that from post-introduction years, 2014-2015. In 2013, surveillance was established at 9 additional hospitals. We examined rotavirus positivity among infants at these sites for 2014-2015. We obtained vaccine records and calculated vaccine effectiveness at 3 sites using case-test-negative control design.RESULTS: At Tanga Hospital, the rotavirus positivity rate among infants was 41% (102/251) pre-vaccine and 14% (28/197) in post-vaccine years (rate ratio: 0.35 [95% CI 0.22-0.54]). At Bugando, the positivity rate was 58% (83/143) pre-vaccine, and 18% (49/277) post-introduction (rate ratio 0.30 [95% CI 0.210.44]). Results were similar among children <5 years. At the new sites, the median site rotavirus positivity rate among infants was 26% in 2014 (range 19-44%) and 18% in 2015 (range 16-33%). The effectiveness of ≥1 RV1 dose against rotavirus hospitalization among children 5-23 months was 53% (95% CI: -14, 81), and 66% (95% CI: 9-87) against hospitalization with intravenous rehydration. Following introduction, peak rotavirus activity occurred later in the year and appeared more concentrated in time.CONCLUSION: Rotavirus surveillance data from Tanzania indicate that the rotavirus positivity rate among children hospitalized with diarrhea that were enrolled was substantially reduced after vaccine introduction. Low positivity rates among infants were detected at hospitals across the country. Overall, the data support that rotavirus vaccine has been successfully introduced and is effective in Tanzanian children.

TI  - Characterization of psychotherapeutic assistance in the IPS CES Sabaneta, Colombia, 2014-2015
T2  - REVISTA CES PSICOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The changes happened in the prevailing worldview in the last decades have brought subjects with new characteristics, interests and requirements, which have had an impact on the clinical psychology, as a consequence, they require from clinical psychology new ways of understanding and controlling the arisen issues that concern the institutional contexts. In order to face these realities, relevant psychotherapeutic interventions were implemented through a characterization of health attendance carried out in IPS CES Sabaneta during 2014-2015, conducted by a descriptive analysis of 9140 records of assistance and an analysis of 532 clinical records, chosen randomly. Sociodemographic, administrative and theoretical-technical aspects of the care service were studied based on frequency analysis, measures of central tendency and dispersion using the SPSS software. It was found that 3 men in 1 woman attend to medical service, being the population between ages of 6 and 18 the one that present the highest weight (59, 77 %). Emotional and behavioral disorders were the main diagnosis (44.92%), followed by neurotic disorders secondary to stressful and somatomorphic situations (18.6%). It is noticed the low prevalence of personality disorders (0.56%) even though 48.9% of patients attended a maximum of six sessions. The results allow adjusting the profiles and care service strategies according to the most prevalent problems, as well as the administrative and formative processes that involve these issues.

TI  - Community participation in the management of palm leaf manuscripts as Lanna cultural material in Thailand
T2  - JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The cultural heritage of the Lanna region of upper Northern Thailand is unique. One of its distinctive features is palm leaf manuscripts (PLMs), which are viewed simultaneously as examples of sacred writing and religious symbols, means of transferring cultural knowledge, artefacts of beauty and fragile historical documents. Local people still care about these objects, and speak the language but knowledge of the script is limited. The purpose of this paper is to explore the views of community members and experts about the value and management of PLMs as the basis for developing a model of community-based collection management.Design/methodology/approach Because the purpose was to explore differing perceptions and beliefs around PLMs the study adopted an interpretivist worldview. Data were collected through interviews with local people with an interest in PLMs and experts who advised on organising them. In addition, observation and a photo inventory method was used to collect data. Data were analysed thematically.Findings The results showed that while both groups saw the value of the knowledge PLMs contained, the community placed particular importance on the earning of merit through activities related to them as Buddhist objects. Experts gave particular emphasis to the knowledge of herbal medicine contained in the PLMs. The community valued indigenous storage and preservation practices. Experts were particularly pre-occupied with the intellectual property issue around medical knowledge and convenient storage and digitisation.Research limitations/implications Existing theory around libraries, archives and museums suggest some starting points for how community participation might be managed, but the unique circumstances of Lanna PLMs calls for a distinctive approach.Practical implications The paper identifies a pathway suitable to the Lanna context that can build on current local practices, to enhance community participation in the management of PLMs, including a consideration of the role of information professionals.Originality/value This paper is one of the first to extend thinking about participatory practices in the library, archive and museum literature to the context of Thailand and specifically to the case of PLMs, in the Lanna region. Rigorous data analysis of a substantial body of evidence has enhanced the understanding of the different types of value placed on PLMs. It identifies an important but not unbridgeable tension between how local people and experts view PLMs. It builds on previous library, archive and museum theory to propose a realistic model of how communities and experts (including librarians) can work together to protect the rich cultural resource represented by PLMs.

AB  - The study addresses issues of the detection of built-up areas based on satellite images and prediction of changes in spatial planning using artificial neural networks. Using satellite images from the Landsat satellite, the authors have developed a built-up areas detection model using a combination of indexes such as NDBI, NDVI and MNDWI. The quality of classification was empirically verified on the basis of a set of randomly selected image points. Forecasts of changes in spatial planning were carried out with the use of two types of neural networks: MLP and RBF. For MLPs, the activation functions, such as logistic, hyperbolic tangent, Gaussian and sine, were tested. In total, more than 5.000 different models of artificial neural network have been built and verified. The simulations covered two areas diversified in terms of building density - fragments of the cities of Lodz and Zgierz located in central Poland in central Europe. Developed model provided changes in built-up areas between 1998 and 2006. In order to confirm the quality of model's operation, the authors calculated percentage correctness of the area classification, which was 94.06% for the area with a higher degree of urbanization and 91.86% for the less urbanized area.

TI  - Analysis of the Vegetation Process in a Two-stage Reservoir on the Basis of Satellite Imagery - a Case Study: Radzyny Reservoir on the Sama River
T2  - ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of the study was to assess the dynamics of the vegetation process in a two-stage reservoir on the basis of satellite data. The analysis is based on Sentinel-2 satellite data from the period 2015-2017. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was selected to detect the vegetation process in the Radzyny reservoir located on the Sama river. The reservoir is split into two parts - the main and the pre-dam zone. The main role of the pre-dam reservoir is to store sediments and water pollutants. The main problem related to the management of the Radzyny reservoir is water quality. Particularly high concentrations of phosphorus compounds may lead to reservoir vegetation.The vegetation process was analyzed for the main and pre-dam reservoir. To specify areas mainly affected by vegetation, the reservoir was split into 10 parts, depending on the distance from the inflow of the Sama river (distance between profiles splitting polygons is 500 m). All calculations were performed using Quantum GIS 2.18 and ArcGIS 10.5 software, and statistical analysis was conducted with Statistical 13 software. The analysis showed that the NDVI values in the period from May to September in the pre-dam reservoir were higher than those recorded in the main reservoir. The greatest variation of the NDVI within the pre-dam reservoir was observed in August while the lowest was observed in May. In the main reservoir, NDVI values were characterized by similar variability. The analysis of the vegetation process along the reservoirs showed that in the pre-dam reservoir in zones 1-4 there was a marked decrease in the NDVI. The highest NDVI values occurred at the inlet to the pre-dam reservoir (zone 1) while the lowest values occurred near the pre-dam (zone 4).The results indicate that the functions assumed at the design stage for the preliminary reservoir have been implemented, i.e. protection of the main reservoir against sediment accumulation and water quality degradation. SENTINEL-2 satellite imagery allows analysis of the vegetation process in retention reservoirs in terms of time and space. The study suggests that open-access satellite data are a more effective source for aquatic monitoring than traditional in situ measurements, in which water bodies are represented by a single sampling point.

AB  - In joint research initiatives with focus on interdisciplinary environmental research, such as the ongoing Catch Mekong Project or the recent projects WISDOM and DELIGHT, scientists of different disciplines work together to answer questions related to a broader social-environmental theme. In this context, environmental information systems have proven to be effective tools for data search, analysis, interpretation and dissemination among project partners and stakeholders. During the WISDOM project the web-based EnvironmentaL Visualization and Information System (ELVIS) was developed that has been constantly further developed and improved to store, manage, disseminate and visualize a broad range of environmental geo-data, such as hydrological in situ data from measurement networks, local planning data in vector format, or large scale Earth Observation satellite data gathered from the participating project partners. This article describes the system's architecture which is completely based on free and open source software. Furthermore, it shows how software project management tools, continuous integration and configuration are applied to be able to instantiate the system for different project contexts. This is especially useful for groups who deal with similar issues in developing one system for many projects.

TI  - Use of testosterone in men infected with human immunodeficiency virus in the veterans healthcare system
T2  - AIDS CARE-PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AIDS/HIV
M3  - Article
AB  - Testosterone supplementation has been widely used in those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for hypogonadism, and wasting. But with effective antiretroviral therapy and increasing recognition of atherosclerotic disease and adults infected with HIV, the risks of inappropriate testosterone use in HIV-infected patients are far better recognized than previously. Testosterone use has expanded among U.S. males, but few studies have examined prescribing in those infected with HIV. In a national cohort of males with at least one outpatient prescription in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), we examined 9475 HIV-infected males, including 2484 who had received testosterone and a randomly selected 6991 who had not. For comparison, we identified 1,387,241 uninfected males (189,369 had received testosterone and a randomly selected 1,197,872 had not). We determined rates of new and prevalent testosterone use, and also examined the adequacy of the diagnostic evaluation that had preceded testosterone initiation among our HIV-infected and uninfected testosterone groups. Our main results were as follows. HIV-infected men had higher rates of initiation (0.8% vs. 0.4% in FY09; p<0.001) and prevalence of testosterone use (2.2% vs. 0.8% in FY08; p<0.001) compared to the uninfected men across the entire period. Trends of prescribing for both groups followed a similar pattern, rising from FY08, reaching a peak in FY13, and then dipping in FY 14. Only 1.1% of HIV-infected patients had a fully guideline-concordant workup before starting testosterone therapy, compared to 3.5% of uninfected patients (p<0.001). In conclusion, testosterone use among HIV-infected patients in the VHA system rose to a peak in FY13 and has decreased somewhat since. Only a small minority of HIV-infected patients who receive testosterone therapy from VHA have undergone an appropriate workup before starting therapy, suggesting an opportunity for improvement.

AB  - Electronic governance (e-governance) can be used as a vehicle for better decision making, resources monitoring, budget allocation, planning and development of cities as per the aspirations of people. Urban growth simulation and modelling in association with information technologies like Geographical Information Systems (GIS) can be used to ascertain possible impacts of urbanization on climate, ecology and environment. Such techniques can assist in effective governance of cities in making optimum decisions of urban development by developing different alternatives urbanization scenarios corresponding to different policies to achieve sustainable and environment friendly smart cities. Present study is aimed to demonstrate the application of geo-spatial techniques and urban growth modelling in determining different urban growth scenarios corresponding to different land use policies and sustainable developmental goals. A cellular automata (CA) based SLEUTH urban growth model and GIS has been used to simulate the urban growth of Pushkar fringe. Pushkar has experienced scattered and rapid urban development in recent past owing to increased tourism and industrial activities causing significant ecological and environmental problems. The SLEUTH model was conceptualized and calibrated using historical urban growth obtained from classification of multi-spectral satellite data. Further, calibrated model has been used to simulate urban growth of the Puskar fringe for year 2040 corresponding to six land use policy scenarios formulated to achieve sustainable developmental objectives and smart Pushkar town. (The study demonstrated the ability of GIS and CA based urban growth modelling to improvise the existing urban growth practices and in developing growth scenarios corresponding to different sustainable and smart city goals.

AB  - In this paper, we present new results of the use of Sentinel-1 data to monitor Alpine glacier displacement by SAR differential interferometry (D-InSAR) in Chamonix-Mont-Blanc Valley. Two time series of Sentinel-1 A/B images acquired from October 2016 to early April 2017 (including 31 ascending and 25 descending acquisitions) are used to form 6-day interferograms and to evaluate their potential for displacement measurements over small fast moving Alpine glaciers. Results show that, even at low latitudes as in the French Alps, fringe patterns can be observed over the glaciers during the cold season with favorable anti-cyclonic meteorological conditions. Different processing steps to derive final displacement fields are presented and discussed and the results are compared with ERS-Tandem results obtained on the same glaciers in winter 1996.

TI  - Neurological complications of Zika virus infection
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTI-INFECTIVE THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Zika virus (ZIKV) disease is a vector-borne infectious disease transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Recently, ZIKV has caused outbreaks in most American countries.Areas covered: Publications about neurological complications of ZIKV infection retrieved from pubmed searchers were reviewed, and reference lists and relevant articles from review articles were also examined. Vertical/intrauterine transmission leads to congenital infection and causes microcephaly and congenital ZIKV syndrome. ZIKV preferentially infects human neural progenitor cells and triggers cell apoptosis. ZIKV RNA has been identified in foetal brain tissue and brains of microcephalic infants who died; amniotic fluid and placentas of pregnant mothers; and umbilical cord, cerebro-spinal fluid and meninges of newborns. The increase in the number of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) cases during the ZIKV outbreak in the Americas provides epidemiological evidence for the link between ZIKV infection and GBS. Less frequently reported ZIKV neurological complications include encephalitis/meningoencephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, myelitis, cerebrovascular complications (ischemic infarction; vasculopathy), seizures and encephalopathy, sensory polyneuropathy and sensory neuronopathy. Analysis of GBS incidence could serve as an epidemiological marker' or sentinel for ZIKV disease and other neurological complications associated to ZIKV.Expert commentary: An expanding spectrum of neurological complications associated with ZIKV infection is being recognised.

AB  - In this work we describe the methodology applied for the retrieval of global LAI, FAPAR and FVC from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board the Meteorological-Operational (MetOp) polar orbiting satellites also known as EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS). A novel approach has been developed for the joint retrieval of three parameters (LAI, FVC, and FAPAR) instead of training one model per parameter. The method relies on multi-output Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR) trained over PROSAIL EPS simulations. A sensitivity analysis is performed to assess several sources of uncertainties in retrievals and maximize the positive impact of modeling the noise in training simulations. We describes the main features of the operational processing chain along with the current status of the global EPS vegetation products, including details about its overall quality and preliminary assessment of the products based on intercomparsion with equivalent (MODIS, PROBA-V) satellite vegetation products.

AB  - Evaluation of drought patterns in Iraq and determining the most susceptible areas of this phenomenon were analyzed, using the remotely-sensed Drought Severity Index (DSI) through analysis the daily and annual DSI for three zones over Iraq, also have been analyzed DSI time series using run theory to evaluate the characteristics of drought in Iraq. The efficiency of DSI for drought monitoring was examined from compared with Percentage of Precipitation Anomaly (PPA) for three zones (Arid and Semi-Arid, Steppes and Desert), and compared with drought indicators (Evapotranspiration (ET), Potential evapotranspiration (PET) and total annual precipitation (PRE)) for the period 2000-2011, were derived from the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG). The spatial interpolation techniques in Geographic Information System (GIS) package has been used, to cover the whole extent of country and extracting the zones. Statistical methods were applied to compute the probability of drought events at every zone. The results showed the drier year is 2008, the wetter years are 2001 in Desert zone and 2003 in steppes and Arid and Semi-Arid Zone zones. The results also showed a significant fluctuation in precipitation from the average, especially at Arid and Semi-Arid Zone when compared with other zones. The values of standard deviation of precipitation were compared with precipitation anomalies for each zone, Arid and Semi-Arid is the drier zone in 2007-2008, the wetter zone is also Arid and Semi-Arid in 2002-2003. Using run theory, the drier Zone is Arid and Semi-Arid and the wetter Zone is steppes during study period.

T2  - BIOLOGICALLY RATIONALIZED COMPUTING TECHNIQUES FOR IMAGE PROCESSING APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Attempts to classify high-resolution satellite data with conventional classifier show limited success since the traditional-per-pixel classifiers examine only the spectral variance ignoring the spatial distribution of the pixels corresponding to the land use/land cover classes. The work is carried out in two stages on panchromatic sharpened IRS P-6 LISS-IV (2.5 m) multispectral (MS) imagery of the year 2014 of Mangalore coastal zone along the west coast of Karnataka state of India. In the first stage, in order to overcome the limitations experienced in the parametric and nonparametric classifications, the swarm intelligence optimisation technique based on Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm has been studied for twelve land cover classes that are mapped. In the second stage, to bring out a greater separability between the spectrally overlapping classes, a texture-based image classification approach has been introduced and a methodology is developed to determine the optimal window size, interpixel distance and the best combinations of texture bands in multispectral data. The five texture measures, viz. entropy (ENT), angular second moment (ASM), contrast (CON), MEAN and homogeneity (Hmg) derived from the grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), are investigated in the study. The major observations and contributions of this work are as follows: in the first stage, the image classifier employing the ABC algorithm exhibits higher classification accuracy when compared with maximum likelihood classifier. In the second stage, the results show that combining textural features and spectral bands in classification approach has proven very useful in delineating the spectrally overlapping classes, particularly at higher class hierarchy level.

TI  - Shoreline change and potential sea level rise impacts in a climate hazardous location in southeast coast of India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change impact on the environment makes the coastal areas vulnerable and demands the evaluation of such susceptibility. Historical changes in the shoreline positions and inundation based on projected sea-level scenarios of 0.5 and 1 m were assessed for Nagapattinam District, a low-lying coastal area in the southeast coast of India, using high-resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data; multi-dated Landsat satellite images of 1978, 1991, 2003, and 2015; and census data of 2011. Image processing, geographical information system, and digital shoreline analysis system methods were used in the study. The shoreline variation indicated that erosion rate varied at different time scales. The end point rate indicated the highest mean erosion of - 3.12 m/year, occurred in 73% of coast between 1978 and 1991. Weighted linear regression analysis revealed that the coast length of 83% was under erosion at a mean rate of - 2.11 m/year from 1978 to 2015. Sea level rise (SLR) impact indicated that the coastal area of about 14,122 ha from 225 villages and 31,318 ha from 272 villages would be permanently inundated for the SLR of 0.5 and 1 m, respectively, which includes agriculture, mangroves, wetlands, aquaculture, and forest lands. The loss of coastal wetlands and its associated productivity will severely threaten more than half the coastal population. Adaptation measures in people participatory mode, integrated into coastal zone management with a focus on sub-regional coastal activities, are needed to respond to the consequences of climate change.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a), which is an index of phytoplankton pigment present in the oceans, is considered as a key indicator of health of marine ecosystems that could have direct effect on the human life. In this study, spatial and temporal variability of chl-a in the Arabian Sea (AS) is examined using reconstructed cloud-free ocean colour data for the period 2002-2015. Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Function method is used to reconstruct the missing data. Subsequently, wavelet analysis is applied on the reconstructed data to assess the temporal variability in terms of seasonal, intra-seasonal, and interannual variability of chl-a in the AS. Wavelet analysis clearly depicted the low-frequency, stationary modes or approximation levels inferring the monthly, seasonal, and annual mean of the signal, while the high-frequency, non-stationary modes indicated the local abnormalities. From the analysis of gap-free data, the presence of biennial mode of variability in the northern AS chl-a is observed. The analysis further showed the existence of intra-seasonal oscillations in the northern AS during summer monsoon and single dominant peak during winter monsoon. Chl-a appeared to decline slightly during the entire study period across all the selected regions of the AS. Also, it is observed that chl-a in the northwestern region is highly dynamic than in the other regions of the AS.

TI  - The impact of sea ice conditions on breeding decisions is modulated by body condition in an arctic partial capital breeder
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining how environmental conditions interact with individual intrinsic properties is important for unravelling the underlying mechanisms that drive variation in reproductive decisions among migratory species. We investigated the influence of sea ice conditions and body condition at arrival on the breeding propensity, i.e. the decision to reproduce or not within a single breeding season, and timing of laying in migrating common eiders (Somateria mollissima) breeding in the Arctic. Using Radarsat satellite images acquired from 2002 to 2013, we estimated the proportion of open water in the intertidal zone in early summer to track the availability of potential foraging areas for pre-breeding females. Timing of ice-breakup varied by up to 20 days across years and showed strong relationship with both breeding propensity and the timing of laying of eiders: fewer pre-breeding individuals were resighted nesting in the colony and laying was also delayed in years with late ice-breakup. Interestingly, the effect of sea ice dynamics on reproduction was modulated by the state of individuals at arrival on the breeding grounds: females arriving in low condition were more affected by a late ice-breakup. Open water accessibility in early summer, a likely proxy of food availability, is thus crucial for reproductive decisions in a (partial) capital breeder. Our predictive capacity in determining how Arctic-breeding seabirds respond to changes in environmental conditions will require incorporating such cross-seasonal cumulative effects.

M3  - Software
AB  - E3SM v1.1 updates the model's land, ocean, sea ice, and coupled biogeochemistry configurations, and will be used for the E3SMv1 biogeochemistry science campaign. This release includes scientifically-validated tunings of the E3SM Land Model (ELM) and E3SM Atmosphere Model (EAM) for coupled simulations with active land biogeochemistry, for ELM configurations using both the CTC and ECA approaches to representation of nutrient competition. Spun-up initial conditions will be made available later. Additional diagnostic variables have been made available as history variables from the ELM, and from the MPAS-Ocean and MPAS-Seaice biogeochemistry modules, in order to improve consistency with the output variable requests of the Coupled Climate Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (C4MIP), and to support improved analysis of the land, ocean, and sea ice carbon cycles. The atmosphere models prognostic CO2 code has been updated to enable regridding of anthropogenic CO2 emission files to the E3SMs native spectral element grid. Note that (1) the prognostic CO2 configuration of E3SM has not been scientifically validated, and (2) the regridding of emission files as currently implemented is not mass-conserving and is intended as a temporary workaround. We do not advise using E3SMv1.1 for fully-coupled carbon cycle simulations where mass conservation is critical, but it is suitable for enabling use of the 3D CO2 tracer for diagnostic and testing purposes. Several bugs found after v1.0 DECK runs started have been fixed. These include: adding limiters to avoid bad extrapolation in RRTMG, CLM surface water and lake fixes, fixes an error in the calculation of NIR reflectance that affects cloud fields derived from MODIS simulator As a result, this version can not reproduce BFB v1.0 simulations results. In addition, a number of minor bugfixes and technical improvements have been introduced in the EAM, ELM and MPAS-Ocean models. DO NOT download the .zip or .tar.gz files included here.

AB  - Remote sensing is one of the most dynamically developing fields of science, and due to its versatility, it can be applicable in many different areas of interest, i.e., biomedical science, forestry, water monitoring, agriculture, urban planning. At present, land cover classification, and precise classification of urban areas is extremely significant regarding environmental protection, particularly in relation to environmental protection and detection and identification of the roofing materials, i.e. roofs covered with asbestos, due to the mandatory removal of asbestos from the environment. Thus the use of advanced remote sensing techniques and various data can significantly accelerate and facilitate this process, depending on the data types and used algorithms. In this paper, the authors present the comparison of object classifications and object identification of chosen urban area-in the north part of Warsaw, Poland. As a basis for the analysis, data from different types of sensors were used, i.e., optical multispectral, SAR data, and LiDAR data. The results of this experiment can be useful when choosing data and methods for accurate and precise land cover classification, and particularly for rapid inventory of roofs' coverages. The preliminary results shown in the paper demonstrate the potentiality of the joint processing of different remote sensing data.

AB  - I have shown that the changing of subject composition in each period and region in Koguryo relates deeply to Koguryo people’s views on the world, life and death. From the middle of the 4th century to the early 5th century, the mural tombs depict seated portraits of the deceased and the everyday life scenes. This suggests that some Koguryo people believed the deceased to become an ancestor god to enjoy a new life in the realm of afterlife beyond the horizons, or within a new heavenly space by becoming Immortal.From the mid-fifth century when Buddhism established in Koguryo, the deceased take his place among the scenery or as the sacred portrait that is part of a Buddhist ritual. As people sought rebirth in the Buddhist paradise, the former world view lost meaning and the concept of spirits and souls weakened.From the 6th to the 7th century, the Four Deities, the heavenly constellations incarnate, take the walls while the Apsaras of Buddhism, Immortals adorn the ceiling. As the Four Deities completely take the wall space, the walls and the ceilings in the late mural tombs become one heavenly space.As the space where the Immortals and the Buddhist paradise coexists comes to focus as the place of new life, the concept of spirits and souls move out of Koguryo people’s interest and artistic endeavor.

TI  - Application of an unmanned aerial system for monitoring paddy productivity using the GRAMI-rice model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent developments in unmanned aerial system (UAS) require an urgent introduction to monitoring technologies of crop diagnostic information because of their advantage in manoeuvering tasks at a high-spatial resolutions and low costs in a user-friendly manner. In this study, an advanced application method of an UAS remote sensing system was performed using the grid GRAMI-rice model such that it can be driven using weather and remote sensing data to monitor the spatiotemporal productivities of rice (Oryza sativa). Remotely sensed data for the model were supplied, along with normalized difference vegetation index images obtained using the UAS remote sensing system. The model was first evaluated using paddy data from experimental fields (treated with two nitrogen (N) applications) at Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea (ROK). Practical application was then performed using paddy data from farm fields under conventional farm management practices at the Gimje plain in ROK. The grid GRAMI-rice model statistically well reproduces the field conditions of spatiotemporal rice productivities, showing an acceptable statistical accuracy in the comparison of growth between the simulated and observed values, using a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency range of 0.113-0.955. According to t-tests (=0.05), there were no significant differences between the simulated and observed grain yields from both the evaluation and practical applications. The scientific approach adopted here is unique, advanced, and practical, in a way that UAS remote sensing methods were effectively incorporated with crop modelling techniques. Therefore, it was concluded that the UAS-based remote sensing techniques proposed in this study could represent an innovative way of projecting reliable spatiotemporal crop productivities for precision agriculture.

TI  - Stereotypes and health literacy in seafarers: views of the students of medicine and maritime science on contraception
T2  - INTERNATIONAL MARITIME HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There are a number of stereotypes of seafarers in today's society. In Croatia, the prevailing stereotype assumes that they are a specific population having an ideal life and a great time both at sea and at home and have a liberal woridview. In the reality, seafaring is a hardly, demanding, stressful and high-risk occupation. The goal of this research was to gain comparative insights into the standpoints of the students of the University of Split Faculty of Maritime Studies and School of Medicine on the issues regarding reproductive health and contraception.Materials and methods: We used the views on contraception questionnaire created by Kelly J. Black from the University of Washington. The respondents participating in the research are the students of the two constituent faculties at the University of Split: School of Medicine and the Faculty of Maritime Studies. A total of 274 students took part in the research, out of which 116 were female students.Results: There is a significant difference in the attitude to the use of contraception, which is more positive in female student population. The students of medical science have a more positive attitude to contraception than their peers at the Faculty of Maritime Studies.Conclusions: Considering the results obtained through the survey and the information from relevant sources, it can be concluded that it is necessary to enhance health literacy in the seafaring population, given the challenges in their working and living environment.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decades, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image exploitation has matured with the launch of different satellite missions and the development of different techniques, which allow exploiting the capabilities of the radar images. Among these techniques, persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) has proven to be a powerful tool to derive terrain deformations over urban areas. It is based on the use of a large number of images over wide areas in order to obtain terrain displacements time series. The imagery from the different SAR missions has led to an archive with data that covers up to 30years in the past. Moreover, different methods and algorithms have been proposed in order to perform this complex task. In this line, this work aims at identifying if data from different missions and processed by different techniques can be combined in order to study the evolution of urban monitoring. Three different PSI techniques are used in order to process data from four SAR missions: European Remote Sensing (ERS)-1/2, Environmental Satellite, COSMO-SkyMed, and the recent Sentinel-1 A/B. The rapidly evolving urban area of Madrid, where numerous undergrounding works have been carried out in the last decade, has been chosen as the testing environment. The density of persistent scatterers, the deformation accuracy validated with GPS displacements and deformation trends are used as the key performance items for the assessment.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes a novel three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks (CNN) based method that automatically classifies crops from spatio-temporal remote sensing images. First, 3D kernel is designed according to the structure of multi-spectral multi-temporal remote sensing data. Secondly, the 3D CNN framework with fine-tuned parameters is designed for training 3D crop samples and learning spatio-temporal discriminative representations, with the full crop growth cycles being preserved. In addition, we introduce an active learning strategy to the CNN model to improve labelling accuracy up to a required threshold with the most efficiency. Finally, experiments are carried out to test the advantage of the 3D CNN, in comparison to the two-dimensional (2D) CNN and other conventional methods. Our experiments show that the 3D CNN is especially suitable in characterizing the dynamics of crop growth and outperformed the other mainstream methods.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous meteorological drought-monitoring indices and remote-sensing-based spatial drought monitoring indices have been developed and applied to monitor drought in different ways. However, individual indices have obvious deficiencies in terms of their responses to drought, and they do not comprehensively reflect the available information on drought. To overcome issues with the data themselves and improve drought monitoring techniques, we use a comprehensive drought index (CDI) derived from the vegetation condition index, the temperature condition index, and the precipitation condition index to monitor meteorological or agricultural drought for the Sichuan-Chongqing region. To assess CDI performance, monthly CDI values for Sichuan-Chongqing region were used to analyse the spatial and temporal variations of the 2006 drought. The results indicated that all aspects of the drought were monitored, and the results were in agreement with related research. Meanwhile, an extreme drought was accurately explored using the CDI in the Sichuan-Chongqing region from 2000 to 2011. Finally, a validation was performed, and the results show that the CDI is closely related with the standardized precipitation index calculated using a 3-month time scale (SPI3), as well as variations in crop yield and drought-affected crop area. These results provide further evidence that the CDI is an indicator that can be used in integrated drought monitoring and that it can simultaneously reflect meteorological and agricultural drought information.

AB  - An unsupervised earthquake/tsunami damage information extraction method using single post-event polarimetric SAR data is proposed in this paper. All urban areas are extracted by an improved classification method which can effectively discriminate urban and foreshortening mountain areas, they are grouped into four kinds of buildings to detect damaged buildings. The proposed unsupervised method can explicitly detect all the damaged buildings, including those with large orientation angle which are easily recognized as undamaged buildings. The technique is validated based on the study about Tohoku earthquake/tsunami event, and is implemented on the L-band ALOS/PALSAR data set. The analysis in this paper verifies that the proposed method can achieve accurate damage information.

AB  - With the rapid development of marine satellites in China, several marine satellites are about to be launched in recent planning. It is important to evaluate the payload performance of marine satellites, but the research on satellite load assessment is almost carried out for terrestrial satellites. The imaging region of the Coastal Zone Imager includes marine water bodies, so some assessment methods for estimating the performance of terrestrial satellites may not be applicable. In this paper, by analyzing and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the current calculation methods of load performance evaluation, combined with the characteristics of the Coastal Zone Imager, the load performance evaluation scheme for Ocean color satellite is selected, and the real remote sensing data is used to verify the results.

TI  - Hyperspectral image super-resolution with spectral-spatial network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The super-resolution problem for hyperspectral images is currently one of the most challenging topics in remote sensing. Increasingly effective methods have been presented to solve this ill-posed problem under certain circumstances. In this article, we propose a new approach named the spectral-spatial network (SSN), which can effectively increase spatial resolution while keeping spectral information. The SSN consists of two sections: a spatial section and a spectral section that contribute to enhancing spatial resolution and preserving spectral information, respectively. The spatial section is proposed to learn end-to-end mapping between single-band images, from low-resolution and high-resolution hyperspectral images. In this section, we enhance the traditional sub-pixel convolutional layer by adding a maximum variance principle that can realize nonlinear fitting through piecewise linearization. The spectral section aims to fine-tune spectral caves to keep the spectral signature with a spectral angle error loss function. In order to make the SSN converge quickly, we also develop a corresponding three-step training method. The experimental results on two databases, with both indoor and outdoor scenes, show that our proposed method performs better than the existing state-of-the-art methods.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an important parameter for describing the land surface vegetation conditions and widely used for land surface process simulations and global change studies. Global FVC products are mainly derived from satellite data and several global FVC products have been generated. Validation of the satellite FVC products is important before they can be applied. The objective of this study is to validate the newly generated Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) FVC product based on the time series of field FVC measurements in an agriculture region in the Heihe Basin of Northwest China. The high spatial resolution remotely sensed Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Compact Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (CASI) data were used to upscale the ground FVC measurements to validate the GLASS FVC product at 0.5km spatial resolution. The results indicated that the GLASS FVC was highly accurate with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.86 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.087. Furthermore, the time series FVC profiles were consistent with the crop growing characteristics. It can be a reliable FVC product for agricultural applications.

AB  - Leaf nitrogen content (LNC) can be used to diagnose the nutritional status and guide precise fertilization. Numerous previous researchers estimated LNC on reflectance spectrum or active chlorophyll fluorescence techniques with certain limitations. This study proposed a new technique of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) for detecting LNC. We conducted an experiment to determine the optimal measurement point at the leaf scale for SIF and the best fluorescence yield indices (FY indices) extracted from SIF for LNC detection. The differences of the upward and downward FY indices were compared to determine the optimal FY indices. The results showed that the 1/3 distance from the leaf base is the optimal position for measuring SIF at the leaf level, and the downward FY indices are much better than the upward one with ratio peak FY687/FY739 as the best to monitor the LNC. The findings demonstrated that SIF can be utilized as a potential method for monitoring the LNC of winter wheat with higher efficiency.

AB  - Hyperspectral image(HSI) has hundreds of bands witch provide hyperspectral data to distinguish different ground objects. However, owing to the low number of samples and strong relativity between different bands, its always tough to get a precise classification result. In this paper, 3D-Gabor-based feature selection algorithm name 3DG-EFDPC is proposed to address this problem. 3D Gabor filter can preserve intrinsic information of hyperspectral image and extract distinguished features with joint spatial/spectral domains for increasing accuracy of classification, via capturing different orientation, scale, and wavelength properties of hyperspectral image data. However, a feature selection process must be taken due to redundance might exist in 3D Gabor feature. For this purpose, we introduce enhanced fast density-peak-based clustering(EFDPC) algorithm. Through calculating the normalized local density and the intracluster distance of each feature, EFDPC regard features which both values are anomalously large as cluster center which contain discriminative and valuable information. Furthermore, in order to confirm the number of chosen features decided by the cutoff threshold, the EFDPC algorithm propose an exponential-based learning rule. We demonstrate the performance of the 3DG-EFDPC features for classification on real hyperspectral remote sensing data sets.

AB  - In recent years, it has been found that the fusion processing of remote sensing data produced by multiple sensors is often effective for material classification. Specifically, the joint use of hyperspectral image (HSI) and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data for classification has been an active topic of research in remote sensing field. Since hyperspectral and LiDAR data provide complementary information (spectral reflectance, and vertical structure, respectively), one promising and challenging approach is to fuse these data in the information extraction procedure. In this paper, we propose an efficient feature extraction and fusion method based on Gabor wavelet, leading to a fusion of the spectral, spatial and elevation data. The core idea of the proposed fusion approach is stacking elevation and intensity data of LiDAR as additional channels to spectral bands. Our strategies are based on the Gabor feature stack structure, which are natural and effective. The features extracted by Gabor wavelets have proved to be discriminant features when considered for thematic classification in remote sensing applications especially when dealing with hyperspectral images due to their ability to extract joint spatial and spectrum information from HSI. Experimental results on the real hyperspectral image data have shown the better discriminative power of our approach for classification.

AB  - Wildfires are a major ecological disturbance in Southern California and often lead to great destruction along the Wildland-Urban Interface. Live fuel moisture has been used as an important indicator of wildfire risk in measurements of vegetation water content. However, the limited field measurements of live fuel moisture in both time and space have affected the accuracy of wildfire risk estimations. Traditional estimation of live fuel moisture using remote sensing data was based on vegetation indices, indirect proxies of vegetation water content and subject to influence from weather conditions. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of estimating live fuel moisture using vegetation indices, Soil Moisture Active Passive L-band soil moisture data and the modeled vegetation water content using a nonlinear model based on VIs and the stem factor associated with remote sensing moisture data products. The stem factor describes the peak amount of water residing in stems of plants and varies by land cover. We also compared the outcomes from regression models and recurrent neural network using the same independent variables. We found the modeled vegetation water content outperformed vegetation indices and the L-band soil moisture observations, suggesting a nonlinear relationship between live fuel moisture and the remotely sensed vegetation signatures. We discuss our results which will improve the predictability of live fuel moisture.

TI  - SAR Observation and Numerical Simulation of Internal Solitary Wave Refraction and Reconnection Behind the Dongsha Atoll
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The refraction and reconnection of internal solitary waves (ISWs) around the Dongsha Atoll (DSA) in the northern South China Sea (SCS) are investigated based on spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations and numerical simulations. In general, a long ISW front propagating from the deep basin of the northern SCS splits into northern and southern branches when it passes the DSA. In this study, the statistics of Envisat Advanced SAR (ASAR) images show that the northern and southern wave branches can reconnect behind the DSA, but the reconnection location varies. A previously developed nonlinear refraction model is set up to simulate the refraction and reconnection of the ISWs behind the DSA, and the model is used to evaluate the effects of ocean stratification, background currents, and incoming ISW characteristics at the DSA on the variation in reconnection locations. The results of the first realistic simulation agree with consecutive TerraSAR-X (TSX) images captured within 12 h of each other. Further sensitivity simulations show that ocean stratification, background currents, and initial wave amplitudes all affect the phase speeds of wave branches and therefore shift their reconnection locations while shapes and locations of incoming wave branches upstream of the DSA profoundly influence the subsequent propagation paths. This study clarifies the variation in reconnection locations of ISWs downstream of the DSA and reveals the important mechanisms governing the reconnection process, which can improve our understanding of the propagation of ISWs near the DSA.

TI  - Using GOCI to detect the diffusion of pollution after the TianJin harbour explosion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tianjin harbour explosion has become the most serious man-made disaster in China in the last 20 years. Chemical materials and dust were cast into the air after explosion. In this research, Geostationary Ocean Colour Imager (GOCI) was used for detecting the transportation of pollution that was composed of brown carbon, nitrogen oxides, dust, etc. It is considered to be an efficient and effective approach to monitor infectant using GOCI-Rayleigh corrected reflectance Rrc (865nm)/Rrc (412nm). Images of pollutant index Rrc (865nm)/Rrc (412nm) and forward trajectories show that pollutant index exceeded 20 in the morning and then dropped to 1 at 07:28 (UTC) on 13 August 2015. Combined with the prediction model of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forward trajectory, this research shows that the diffusion of infectant, originated at the northern part of the Bohai Sea water near Tangshan and Qinhuangdao, eventually spread to the south of the Bohai Sea (Yellow River Estuary). The vertical distribution of the pollutant was identified in the air, 1000-2000 m above sea level, and pollutant migrated to the south, which finally dissipated at the south of Bohai Bay. Since GOCI aerosol optical thickness of infectant is less than 1, and Rrc (865nm)/Rrc (412nm) pollutant index of infectant is more than 1, the type of explosive pollutant is preliminarily distinguished by the characteristic of spectrum and GOCI-Rrc image. The main pollutants were carbonaceous aerosol (caused by combustion explosion, main brown carbon), nitrogen oxides (which were adsorbed and adhered to particulate matter), dust, and other substances. This research provides an effective method to detect explosive pollution by GOCI in the future.

TI  - Triple negative breast cancer and immunoglobulin A nephropathy: A case report and literature review
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - The association between malignant tumors and the occurrence of glomerular disease has been well documented in previous studies. The most common types of malignant tumor include Hodgkin's lymphoma with minimal change glomerular nephritis, solid tumor with membranous nephropathy and renal cell carcinoma with immunoglobulin (Ig)A nephropathy. The present case study describes a case of a 31-year-old Chinese female patient who was hospitalized with chronic glomerulonephritis. The patient self-administered unknown traditional Chinese medicine; however, protein excretion/24-h remained increased compared with normal levels. After 34 months, a tumor was identified in the patient. Subsequently, the patient was administered breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy, which validated the diagnosis of triple negative breast cancer at stage IA (T1cN0M0). The patient received chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Following the review of the relevant studies within the last 30 years, it was demonstrated that the present report was the second documented case of breast cancer associated with IgA nephropathy. Thus, the present study hypothesized that IgA nephropathy may be a tumor manifestation in breast cancer.

AB  - Affected by intense human activities, Bohai Sea, the largest inland sea of China, has being suffered from serious water pollution, e.g., exacerbated water eutrophication, frequent red tide outbreaks, causing major damages to marine ecology/environment, public health, and economy. Based on MODIS data during 2014-2015, the spatial and temporal characteristics of surface layer chlorophyll-a concentration has been analyzed and then, the red tide has been monitored for Bohai Sea. The results showed that surface layer chlorophyll-a concentration was overall higher from May to October, which reached its peak in May. Spatially, chlorophyll-a concentration decreased from the coastal area to the offshore, which was higher in Qinhuangdao offshore area, Laizhou Bay, Bohai Bay and Liaodong Bay. According to the chlorophyll-a concentration threshold of 16 mg/m3 and ERGB composite, the red tide information has been successfully extracted. In the Qinhuangdao offshore area with the frequent occurrence and worst-hit area of red tide in Bohai Sea, red tide happened in May and its dispersion area reached its maximum in late May. The distribution of red tide agreed with the location of two bottom hypoxia zones in Bohai sea, suggesting that red tide outbreaks may play an important role in the formation and development of bottom hypoxia zone. The results for this study will provide scientific foundation for the red tide prediction and control of Bohai Sea.

AB  - With the development of satellite remote sensing technology, remote sensing image has become an important data source gradually for modern Geo-science analysis and research. Among the massive Multi-source Remote Sensing data, the processing of Remote Sensing image is considered as a crucial mean to achieve image data mining and knowledge discovery. Therefore, ERDAS software will play a significant role in the geographical teaching and reforms, with its advantage as an important tool and platform for remote sensing data analysis. Based on the introduction of the characteristics of ERDAS software, the specific application of ERDAS in middle school geography class is also proposed, concluding mobilizing students' subjective initiative in learning, improving teaching effect, establishing an open geography class, and improving students' foreign language level and operational ability. Then, the key methods of images preprocessing are introduced in the application of ERDAS software. Finally, practical problems of ERDAS software applications are analyzed. In conclusion, the present study provides an important reference value for improving the quality of geography teaching in junior high school.

TI  - Single image dehazing for visible remote sensing based on tagged haze thickness maps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Haze degrades the quality of optical remote sensing data and reduces the accuracy of interpretation and classification. In this paper, we present an empirical single image-based haze removal method. Our work relies on an additive haze model, which describes at-satellite acquired radiance as the sum of globally constant path radiance, surface reflected radiance and spatially varying haze contribution. First, we search a tagged haze thickness map in band blue, green, red and near-infrared. Then a proportional strategy is adopted to infer haze thickness map of selected starting band from tagged haze thickness map and gain haze thickness map of other spectral bands from the starting band. Finally, haze is removed through subtracting haze thickness map from each band. The method is applicable for medium- and high- resolution satellite images and can handle scenes affected by different haze depths. Dehazed results are in good quality with improved visibility, enhanced image information and highly spectral consistency. The algorithm is simple enough and requires no human intervention, making it possible for use of non-experts and implementation of automatic batch processing.

AB  - As an important land surface parameter for crop growth model, leaf area index (LAI) is desired to be estimated accurately on regional scale. Before applying LAI estimation model built at local scale to the regional scale, the mismatch between multi-scale sensors should be corrected. We firstly applied the kernel-driven BRDF model to describe the two-dimensional reflection characteristics of Landsat 5-TM data based on the kernel weights from MODIS MCD43A1 products and the angle vectors obtained from TM Collection 1 Level-1 dataset. Then the point spread function (PSF) was used to simulate the spatial response of the sensor. Results show that there is a good agreement between TM observations and corrected MODIS values (Red band: R-2 = 0.736, RMSE = 2.65e-4, Near-infrared band: R-2 = 0.539, RMSE = 5.39e-4). If we apply the LAI estimation model that has been validated at local scale (TM) directly to the data at large scale (MODIS) without any correction, more than 50% uncertainty of LAI estimation would be introduced. This study implies that the estimation of LAI in winter wheat could be significantly improved by correcting the differences between multi-scale sensors.

T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and informative space-time mapping of air pollutants is a crucial component of many human exposure studies. In the present work, space-time maps of daily distributions of PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations were generated in the severely polluted northern China region using the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) method. This method can incorporate hard PM2.5 and NO2 data (obtained at ground-level monitoring sites), and various kinds of soft (uncertain) data, including satellite data processed in terms of machine learning techniques, meteorological variables, and geographical predictors. The BME maps of space-time PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations over northern China generated during the winter season (when severe haze episodes occur frequently) were realistic and informative. As regards their numerical accuracy, for the space-time PM2.5 estimates, the tenfold cross-validation R-2 and the RMSE were, respectively, 0.86 and 14.37 mu g/m(3); for the space-time NO2 estimates, the R-2 and RMSE values were, respectively, 0.85 and 6.93 mu g/m(3). Lastly, it was shown that the BME method performed better than the mainstream spatiotemporal ordinary kriging technique in terms of the higher R-2 values of both the predicted PM2.5 and NO2 concentration maps.

AB  - As an important complement to satellite observation, the technique of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) shows great advantages because of its high spatiotemporal resolutions, low cost and risk. With the development of technology related to UAV, its research was increasingly enhanced and has been applied to many fields such as environmental monitoring. Taking a coastal zone of Yantai as test area, this paper studied how to utilize the UAV system to monitor contaminated water in coastal zones. The results show that the contaminated water information can be extracted from the UAV remote sensing (RS) image. The multi-time monitoring conducted in this study can monitor the change of polluted water. This will provide technical support for the monitoring and treatment of polluted water bodies.

AB  - Daily evapotranspiration (ET) is considered more significant in many practical applications, compared to the instantaneous ET obtained from remote-sensing based models. The constant reference evaporative fraction (EFr, the ratio of actual to reference ET) method is one of the well preformed upscaling methods used to extrapolate instantaneous ET to daily timescales. The constant decoupling coefficient (Omega) method requires similar input data to the constant EFr method and can be used to calculate daily ET directly. This study evaluated the performances of the two methods underlying the estimation of daily ET. The results from field data only showed that (i) daily ET were both overestimated by two methods when compared to the uncorrected Eddy covariance (EC) measurements; (ii) the estimated daily ET had a good agreement with the measurement corrected by the Bowen Ratio (BR) method. Based on MODIS and filed data and when the ET measurements were corrected by the BR method, the results showed that (i) the constant EFr method overestimated daily ET by a bias of 5.6 W/m(2) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 18.6 W/m(2); (ii) the constant Omega method underestimated daily ET by a smaller bias of -4.8W/m(2) and a RMSE of 22.5 W/m(2). Therefore, the constant Omega method had a similar performance with the constant EFr method, and could be applied to estimate daily ET effectively.

By using multi-temporal MODIS's Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, and analyzing the correlation between these data and the rice yield in the past years, we search for high correlation characteristic parameters of remote sensing, then we use mathematical statistic regression to construct a correlation regression model between remote sensing characteristic parameters and rice yield. After joining these variables in this model, we can estimate the future rice yield information of Sichuan province.

AB  - Atmospheric correction is one of the important issues that restrict the application of remote sensing monitoring in inland lakes. Therefore, In this paper, we taking TaiHu Lake, the freshwater lake in China as study area, using the 6S, FLAASH, QUAC and ACOLITE four atmospheric correction algorithms of Landsat8 images and discussing the applicability of four algorithms in TaiHu Lake. The results show that all the four algorithms can be used under the premise of low precision, but compared with the other three algorithms, the average relative error of the 6S algorithm is 31.98%, this show that 6S algorithm is suitable for TaiHu Lake in the four algorithms; Compared single band error, the results show that FLAASH, QUAC and 6S algorithm are similar in the visible wavelength band, their errors at the wavelengths of 561nm and 655nm are in the range from 14.43% to 26.06%. However, the accuracy of the 443nm, the 482nm and 865nm band is lower than that of the ACOLITE algorithm, so the corresponding atmospheric correction method needs to be selected according to the required band to obtain higher accuracy; The relative error between the 561nm band and the 655nm band is the minimum; The ACOLITE algorithm has higher accuracy in the band ratio. It is suggested that the ACOLITE algorithm should be chosen when establishing the inversion algorithm using the band ratio, which can effectively reduce the atmospheric impact.

AB  - The availability of dense time series of Landsat images pro-vides a great chance to reconstruct forest disturbance and change history with high temporal resolution, medium spatial resolution and long period. This proposal aims to apply forest change detection method in Hainan Jianfengling Forest Park using yearly Landsat time-series images. A simple detection method from the dense time series Landsat NDVI images will be used to reconstruct forest change history (afforestation and deforestation). The mapping result showed a large decrease occurred in the extent of closed forest from 1980s to 1990s. From the beginning of the 21st century, we found an increase in forest areas with the implementation of forestry measures such as the prohibition of cutting and sealing in our study area. Our findings provide an effective approach for quickly detecting forest changes in tropical original forest, especially for afforestation and deforestation, and a comprehensive analysis tool for forest resource protection.

AB  - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values extracted from remotely sensed optical imagery are used ubiquitously to monitor crop condition. However, challenges in the operational use of optical imagery are well documented making it difficult to capture measures of crop condition during critical phenology stages when clouds obscure. This study investigates the integration of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery to characterize the condition of crop canopies in order to deliver daily measures of NDVI during the entire growing season. Multi-temporal C-band polarimetric RADARSAT-2 SAR data and RapidEye images were acquired in 2012 for a study site in western Canada. SAR polarimetric parameters and NDVI were extracted. The temporal variations in SAR polarimetric parameters and NDVI were interpreted with respect to the development of the canola canopy. Optical NDVI was statistically related with SAR polarimetric parameters over test canola fields. Significant correlations were documented between a number of SAR polarimetric parameters and optical NDVI, in particular with respect to HV backscatter, span, volume scattering of the Freeman Durden decomposition and the radar vegetation index, with R-values of 0.83, 0.72, 0.81 and 0.71 respectively. Based on the statistical analysis, SAR polarimetric parameters were calibrated to optical NDVI, creating a SAR-calibrated NDVI (SARc-NDVI)). A canopy structure dynamics model (CSDM) was fitted to the SARc-NDVI, providing a seasonal temporal vegetation index curve. The coupling of NDVI from optical and SAR imagery with a CSDM demonstrates the potential to derive daily measures of crop condition over the entire growing season.

AB  - The accuracy of hotspot signatures is crucial to the development of algorithms for the retrieval of various biophysical parameters of terrestrial surface targets. The hotspot effect determined by the kernel-driven RossThick-LiSparseReciprocal (RTLSR) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model fully relies on the performance of the two kernels in modeling the hotspot effect. Previously, a method has been developed to correct the volumetric scattering component of the RTLSR model (Jiao et al., 2016); however, in few cases that the weight of the volumetric scattering component (f(vol)) is no longer significant (e.g., f(vol) = 0) in the framework of the RTLSR model, the slight underestimation of the hotspot effect still exists. In this study, we propose a method to enhance the overlap function inherent in the geometric-optical (GO) kernel using a physical hotspot factor. The hotspot observations extracted from the entire archive of the POLDER-3 BRDF database are used to determine two parameters of this hotspot factor. Result shows that the proposed method further improves the model-observation fits in the vicinity of hotspot direction, particularly in some extreme cases where the GO scattering component is fully dominant in the multiangle measurements. Such an improved GO kernel, combining with the hotspot adjustment method for the volumetric scattering kernel, reconstructs hotspot effect more accurately; therefore, necessarily further improves the performance of the kernel-driven BRDF model particularly for the retrieval of the canopy structure parameters that is associated with the hotspot effect.

Results are validated from comparison of S3/SLSTR retrievals against in situ measurements of surface temperature collected over one instrumented site in the Peruvian Amazon. The validation exercise was performed on the standard S3/SLSTR Level-2 LST product as well as on a dedicated LST split-window algorithm with an explicit dependence on surface emissivity. Surface emissivity maps obtained from the high spatial resolution of S2/MSI are also presented over the test area.

TI  - Varied degrees of urbanization effects on observed surface air temperature trends in China
T2  - CLIMATE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Debates over the bias in regional climate records caused by urbanization effects continue, and the diverse estimates of this bias can be partly attributed to different study methods and materials. In this study, we proposed an index (the extent of urban impact, EUI) by quantifying urbanization effects in terms of urban area and station location relative to urbanized areas. The EUI was used to represent the extent of urban impact on the meteorological stations used for observing temperature. Based on the EUI quantification, 569 stations in China were classified into 3 categories: stations with little or no urban impact (R stations), stations with low urban impact (LU stations), and stations with high urban impact (HU stations). Results show that, on average, EUIs for R, LU, and HU stations were 0.3, 2.6, and 15.3%, respectively, implying diverse urbanization influences on the studied stations. Using R stations as a baseline, the average urbanization effects on the warming trend of surface air temperature (SAT) for China during 1961-2012 for the LU and HU stations were estimated to be 0.06 and 0.09 degrees C decade(-1), respectively. Therefore, including LU and HU stations to estimate regional SAT trends would lead to notable biases. The bias of the urbanization effect in the average SAT trend of China based on all stations was estimated to be 0.05 degrees C decade(-1), accounting for 18% of the overall warming over the period 1961-2012. This estimation should be considered the lowest range of the bias. This study highlights the necessity of considering urbanization effect biases when assessing regional climate change.

AB  - This study analyses recent science fiction (SF) for children and young adults, focusing on main issues of SF related to feminism, such as a maternal bond, the relationship between women and technology, sexuality and love, and minorities.Since the 1960s, in-depth research and critiques on SF including theoretical approaches such as Marxism, feminism, queer theory, postmodernism, ecology, and futurology have been increased in the U.S.and U.K., which emphasized the potential of SF as literature.Particularly, the approaches related to feminism can be meaningful as they overset patriarchal structures and dismantle and reconstruct traditional theories based on gender. This study examines SF based on cyborg feminism by Donna Haraway and Technofeminism by Judy Wajcman, which have been considered representative feminist theories of technology.In the 1960s and 1970s, SF for children and young adults had been created and translated in South Korea, along with various genres of literature, and since the 2010s, the SF had been actively created again and shown the novelty in literature. However, currently, it seems the SF has lost its vitality and reiterates similar dystopian perspectives.Therefore, this study based on feminism intends to indicate the various and extensive potential of SF as literature.Feminism SF would contribute to overall literature for children and young adults as it has both the creativity of SF that dismantles the world of ‘now and here’ and the worldview of feminism that listens to the voices of minorities and vulnerable populations including women.Children and young adults are minorities in our ‘now and here’ society that adults controls and administers. The revolutionary and innovative creativity of SF, which is different from realism literature for children and adults, would awaken the current and future directions of literature for children and young adults and facilitate new writing experiments.

TI  - A review of data assimilation of remote sensing and crop models
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Review
AB  - Timely and accurate estimation of crop yield before harvest to allow crop yields management decision-making at a regional scale is crucial for national food policy and security assessments. Modeling dynamic change of crop growth is of great help because it allows researchers to determine crop management strategies for maximizing crop yield. Remote sensing is often used to provide information about important canopy state variables for crop models of large regions. Crop models and remote sensing techniques have been combined and applied in crop yield estimation on a regional scale or worldwide based on the simultaneous development of crop models and remote sensing. Many studies have proposed models for estimating canopy state variables and soil properties based on remote sensing data and assimilating these estimated canopy state variables into crop models. This paper, firstly, summarizes recent developments of crop models, remote sensing technology, and data assimilation methods. Secondly, it compares the advantages and disadvantages of different data assimilation methods (calibration method, forcing method, and updating method) for assimilating remote sensing data into crop models and analyzes the impacts of different error sources on the different parts of the data assimilation chain in detail. Finally, it provides some methods that can be used to reduce the different errors of data assimilation and presents further opportunities and development direction of data assimilation for future studies. This paper presents a detailed overview of the comparative introduction, latest developments and applications of crop models, remote sensing techniques, and data assimilation methods in the growth status monitoring and yield estimation of crops. In particular, it discusses the impacts of different error sources on the different portions of the data assimilation chain in detail and analyzes how to reduce the different errors of data assimilation chain. The literature shows that many new satellite sensors and valuable methods have been developed for the retrieval of canopy state variables and soil properties from remote sensing data for assimilating the retrieved variables into crop models. Additionally, new proposed or modified crop models have been reported for improving the simulated canopy state variables and soil properties of crop models. In short, the data assimilation of remote sensing and crop models have the potential to improve the estimation accuracy of canopy state variables, soil properties and yield based on these new technologies and methods in the future.

AB  - Background and Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of sentinelnode centered selective neck dissection in patients with early stage tongue cancer (T1T2N0).Subjects and Method Lymphoscintigraphy was performed for 12 patients, subsequentlyfollowed by sentinel node centered selective neck dissection. The location of the sentinel node,pathological confirmation of node metastasis, and follow-up recurrence were analyzed.Results In total, 19 sentinel lymph nodes were identified. Of these, 18 were located in levelsI to III, and one in level IV. After surgery, 3 patients (25%) were diagnosed with neck nodemetastasis: two experienced sentinel node metastasis and one experienced skipped metastasis.During follow-up, 3 of the 12 patients (25%) experienced recurrence.Conclusion The recurrence of lymph node could be covered with supraomohyoid neck dissection,which indicates that it has superiority over sentinel node centered selective neck dissectionin preventing recurrence in T1T2N0 tongue cancer patients.

AB  - With the rapid development of information technology, the amount of remote sensing data is increasing at an unprecedented scale. In the presence of massive remote sensing data, the traditional processing methods have the problems of low efficiency and lack of scalability, so this paper uses open source big data technology to improve it. Firstly, the storage model of remote sensing image data is designed by using the distributed storage database HBase. Then, the grid index and the Hibert curve are combined to establish the index for the image data. Finally, the method of MapReduce parallel processing is used to write and query remote sensing images. The experimental results show that the method can effectively improve the data writing and query speed, and has good scalability. Copyright (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Machine Learning for Estimating Leaf Dust Retention Based on Hyperspectral Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral sensors provide detailed information for dust retention content (DRC) estimation. However, rich hyperspectral data are not fully utilized by traditional image analysis techniques. We integrated several recently developed machine learning algorithms to estimate DRC on plant leaves using the spectra measured by the ASD FieldSpec 3. The experiments were carried out on three common green plants of southern China. The important hyperspectral variables were first identified by applying the random forest (RF) algorithm. Three estimation models were then developed using the support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART), and RF algorithms. The results showed that the increase in dust retention contents on plant leaves enhanced their reflectance in the visible wavelength but weakened their reflectance in the infrared wavelength. Wavelengths in the ranges of 450-500 nm, 550-600 nm, 750-1000 nm, and 1100-1300 nm were identified as important variables using the RF algorithm and were used to estimate the DRC. The comparison of the three machine learning techniques for DRC estimation confirmed that the SVM and RF models performed well because their estimations were similar to the measured DRC. Specifically, the average le for SVM and RF model are 0.85 and 0.88. The technical approach of this study proved to be a successful illustration of using hyperspectral measurements to estimate the DRC on plant leaves. The findings of this study can be applied to monitor the DRC on leaves of other plants and can also be integrated with other types of spectral data to measure the DRC at a regional scale.

AB  - The traditional methods of sampling plays an important role in the wetland ecosystem health assessment, but there also exists some problems such as a waste of human and financial resources and the limition of the number of sampling points. Remote sensing technology can obtain surface data for long time series, which has important advantages in wetland structural change and ecological health assessment. In this paper, the characteristics of wetland structure of Wuliangsuhai in the past 40 years from 1977 to 2015 were studied by using multi-temporal LandSAT data. The driving factors of wetland structure change were analyzed. The ecological health of Wuliangsuhai wetland was evaluated based on the pressure-state-response (PSR) model. The results showed that: (1) In 1997, the wetland structure was dominated by the water, and the water area was 61.70% of the whole wetland area. With the decrease of the water area and the increase of the reed area, the reed and water became the main types of wetland structure during the period from 1998 to 2006. The total area of wetland was 50% higher than that of wetland in 2015, and the structure of wetland was changed from water to reed in 1977. (2) The ecological health status of Wuliangsuhai wetland was in an alert state from 1977 to 1996. The ecological function level of the Wuliangsuhai wetland was degraded, but the ecological system could be maintained. The ecological health status of the Wuliangsuhai Wetland in 2006 and 2015 changed from the original alert state to a good state, but the comprehensive evaluation index was in the lower limit of the good condition, which indicated that the ecological health status of the Wuliangsuhai wetland had improved, the external pressure was decreased but not obvious. The results provide scientific basis for the management of Wuliangsuhai wetland, and have important reference value for monitoring the structure and health status of wetland via remote sensing data.

TI  - Monitoring dynamics and driving forces of lake changes in different seasons in Xinjiang using multi-source remote sensing
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are important for ensuring the development of the regional economy and ecological security. Based on MODIS and Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing images captured in 2005-2015 and a Combined Water Index (CWI), this paper extracted information on changes in the temporal and spatial characteristics and driving forces for lake areas in Xinjiang during past 11 years in different seasons (April, July and September). The results showed that over this time period, the area of the lakes exhibited an increasing trend. The largest surface area usually occurred in April, and the lowest value was measured in September. The lake shrinkage area in Xinjiang occurred mainly in Northern Xinjiang and the northeastern region of Southern Xinjiang, whereas the lake expansion area was concentrated in Eastern Xinjiang. Seasonal changes in Manas, Kanas, Barkol, Arkatag, Arik and Ebinur Lakes showed higher trends. Extracted the lake area based on the MODIS and TM/OLI image were analyzed, and both had a good corresponding relationship. The minimum R-2 was 0.548, and maximum RMSE was 44.1 km(2). Therefore, it was feasible to use MODIS to extract lake area. These changes in lake area resulted from both natural factors and human activities, and coupled effects greatly accelerated local environmental changes.

AB  - Zen Psychology refers to the psychology of Zen Buddhism as a field of Buddhist psychology. This paper examines the psychology of human beings, focusing on the “Platform Sutra” written by Huineng, the founder of Patriarchal Zen, and the southern Zen school. According to the classification of Buddhist psychology, Zen psychology is divided into theory of Zen mind, theory of Zend mind function, and Zen psychotherapy.In theory of Zen mind, Huineng explains the mind based on self-nature, and explains the theory of dharma, theory of humanity, theory of dependent origination, and worldview though self-nature. Every human mind has its own original character of self-nature. When one’s own mind with self-nature is revealed, it is the basic mind. When it is covered, it is the mind of common people. Self-nature is characterized by dharma construction, incompetence, non-naming, cleanliness, equality, and self-Buddhahood. In the theory of dharma, dharma is non-dual and is equal. The theory of humanity is divided into two groups according to the sharpness and dullness or capacity of the human being. From theory of dependent origination, you can see the mobility of cover and revealment, enlightment and delusion, sacred and common. In the worldview, the world and phenomena are the functions of self-nature and one's own mind.The theory of Zen mind function deals with wisdom and defilement of common people. The function of wisdom is to know the whole and one at the same time, and is intangible. Defilement of common people is an inner common people that cover the functions of wisdom.In Zen psychotherapy, in order to eliminate the gap between human and dharma, seeing into self-nature is suggested and the goal. In teleology, the goal is to reveal and see the self-nature covered by defilements. As a methodology from cover to revealment, Huineng interprets the traditional methodology as a new interpretation from the viewpoint of the mind, and presents Sammu as its own methodology. Based on the absence of attachment, Huineng proposed a methodology of No-abiding, No-thought and No-form, to gather mind on reality and treat all things equally. Based on this, Huineng proposed a new methodology for dealing with karma through repentance and vows, and a methodology for edification.In view of the Four Noble Truth, it is the phenomenon that self-nature is covered, the cause of defilement and the mind, the aim of seeing the self-nature which is covered, and the way of revealing the covered self-nature is presented. In this sense, the Zen Psychology of Platform Sutra is psychology of self-nature.

AB  - The GlobCurrent project (http://www.globcurrent.org) aimed to: (i) advance the quantitative estimation of ocean surface currents from satellite sensor synergy; and (ii) demonstrate impact in user-led scientific, operational and commercial applications that, in turn, would improve and strengthen the uptake of satellite measurements. It is often demonstrated that sharp gradients in the sea surface temperature (SST) and current fields and the ocean surface chlorophyll-a distribution are spatially correlated with the sea surface roughness anomaly fields at small spatial scales, in the sub-mesocale (1-10 km) to the mesoscale (30-80 km). The 2-dimensional structures manifested in the satellite observations represent evidence of the upper ocean dynamics. Whereas the quasi geostrophic assumption is valid for the upper ocean dynamics at the larger scale (>100 km), possible triggering mechanisms for the expressions at the mesoscale-to-submesoscale may include spiraling tracers of inertial motion and the interaction of the wind-driven Ekman layer with the quasi-geostrophic current field. This latter, in turn, produces bands of downwelling (convergence) and upwelling (divergence) near fronts. A regular utilization of the sensor synergy approach with the combination of Sentinel-3, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 together with other satellite missions will provide a highly valuable data set for further research and development to better relate the 2-dimensional surface expressions and the upper ocean dynamics.

CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - We are seeing tree mortality increase in western U.S. forests and die-off events around the world caused by serve or interacting disturbances like logging, drought, wildfire and pine beetle infestation. Limiting our knowledge of how forests respond is a lack of data on functional vegetation states at the tree or stand level over long periods of time and broad regions. Moderate resolution satellite imagery can provide changes in percent forest cover but cannot resolve vegetation state changes (e.g. from conifer to deciduous forest). The high resolution of Planet's Dove imaging technologies may provide an opportunity to capture response at fine scales. We aim to integrate Planet's constellation of satellites with Landsat imagery to create a multi-scale network for forest monitoring. However, the uncalibrated nature of these systems and the variability of sensor characteristics across the constellation make this problematic. We conducted a limited investigation of radiometric and thematic data methods for linking vegetation properties across spatial scales from 3 to 30 meters. The greatest challenge arises from the variation in Dove sensor radiometric response (roughly +/- 10%) across the constellation and optical cross talk associated with their broad, overlapping Bayer filter response. Applying a spectral band adjustment factor to improve radiometric correlation requires knowledge of the actual spectral response of the sensors which is not readily available. Using a K-means clustering algorithm to bridge scales and minimize sensor differences had mixed results for low reflectance scene components - perhaps again the result of crosstalk between Dove sensor spectral bands.

TI  - Hyperspectral Determination of Ocean Color as an Ocean Monitoring Tool: Example Applications in the Gulf of Mexico
T2  - OCEAN SENSING AND MONITORING X
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Ocean Sensing and Monitoring X
CL  - Orlando, FL
AB  - The combination of increased spectral resolution for in situ ocean optical instrumentation as well as future ocean remote sensing missions (e.g., PACE) provides an opportunity to examine new methods of analysis and ocean monitoring that were not feasible during the multispectral satellite era. For example, hyperspectral data enables a much more precise determination of the apparent true color for natural waters, one based on the full spectral shape of water-leaving radiance distributions. Herein we provide examples of how specific integrated biogeo-optical and physical processes in the northern Gulf of Mexico have characteristic hyperspectral signatures, and thusly, characteristic true color identifiers. Our emergent hypothesis is that once the characteristic hyperspectral color signature of a specific biophysical process is known, it can be detected and monitored even with multispectral or broad-band response digital imaging systems. To test this hypothesis, we examine archived imagery from MODIS and HICO to identify putative bottom boundary layer ventilation events along divergent shelf-frontal boundaries across the northern Gulf continental margin. Whereas on-demand in situ physical data that provide spatiotemporal correspondence with archived images are not available, we employ the data-assimilative Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) as a physical data surrogate. Preliminary results of this method appear to support the hypothesis, with the caveat that model results must be interpreted with due caution.

TI  - The distribution and hydrological significance of rock glaciers in the Nepalese Himalaya
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Nepalese Himalaya, there is little information on the number, spatial distribution and morphometric characteristics of rock glaciers, and this information is required if their hydrological contribution is to be understood. Based on freely available fine spatial resolution satellite data accessible through Google Earth, we produced the first comprehensive Nepalese rock glacier inventory, supported through statistical validation and field survey. The inventory includes the location of over 6000 rock glaciers, with a mean specific density of 3.4%. This corresponds to an areal coverage of 1371 km(2). Our approach subsampled approximately 20% of the total identified rock glacier inventory (n = 1137) and digitised their outlines so that quantitative/qualitative landform attributes could be extracted. Intact landforms (containing ice) accounted for 68% of the subsample, and the remaining were classified as relict (not containing ice). The majority (56%) were found to have a northerly aspect (NE, N, and NW), and landforms situated within north- to west-aspects reside at lower elevations than those with south- to- east aspects. In Nepal, we show that rock glaciers are situated between 3225 and 5675 m a.s.l., with the mean minimum elevation at the front estimated to be 4977 +/- 280 m a.s.l. for intact landforms and 4541 +/- 346 m a.s.l. for relict landforms. The hydrological significance of rock glaciers in Nepal was then established by statistically upscaling the results from the subsample to estimate that these cryospheric reserves store between 16.72 and 25.08 billion m(3) of water. This study, for the first time, estimates rock glacier water volume equivalents and evaluates their relative hydrological importance in comparison to ice glaciers. Across the Nepalese Himalaya, rock glacier to ice glacier water volume equivalent is 1:9, and generally increases westwards (e.g., ratio = 1:3, West region). This inventory represents a preliminary step for understanding the spatial distribution and the geomorphic conditions necessary for rock glacier formation in the Himalaya. With continued climatically-driven ice glacier recession, the relative importance of rock glaciers in the Nepalese Himalaya will potentially increase.

AB  - The utility of Geostationary active fire detection and surveillance has recently been supplemented by two new algorithms developed by our group: the AHI-FSA (Advanced Himawari Imager - Fire Surveillance Algorithm) and the Broad Area Training (BAT) method [1], [2]. Here we present results from a large area validation of these products to support wildfire surveillance and mapping using the geostationary Himawari-8 satellite.The AHI-FSA/BAT algorithms were developed and tested on a number of case study areas in Western Australia. Initial results demonstrate a high potential as a wildfire surveillance algorithm providing high frequency (every 10 minutes) fire detections. However, the AHI-FSA and BAT products need to be validated over a large area to quantify the performance of the algorithms. This paper validates their performance in the Northern Territory of Australia (1.4 million km2) over a 10 day period by comparing AHI-FSA/BAT to well-established products from LEO satellites: MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite). This paper also discusses difficulties in validating high temporal resolution products with existing low temporal resolution LEO satellite products. Results indicate that the multi-resolution approach developed for AHI-FSA/BAT significantly improves fire detection. When compared to the MODIS thermal anomaly products, BAT omission error was only 2%. High temporal frequency data results in AHI-FSA/BAT detecting fires, at times, three hours before the MODIS overpass with much-enhanced detail on fire movement.

TI  - The religious correlates of death anxiety: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - RELIGION BRAIN & BEHAVIOR
M3  - Review
AB  - Various theories of religion hypothesize a connection between death anxiety and religiosity. In particular, Terror Management Theory's worldview defence hypothesis predicts that death anxiety is lowest among very religious and irreligious individuals, and highest among uncertain individuals. Likewise, the supposition that death anxiety motivates religious belief, which in turn mitigates death anxiety, predicts that religiosity increases with death anxiety among non-believers, and that death anxiety decreases as religiosity increases among believers. In both cases, a curvilinear relationship - specifically, an inverted-U curve - is predicted. We extracted 202 effect sizes from 100 studies for an "omnibus" religiosity meta-analysis, and six meta-analyses that examine particular dimensions of religiosity. We found high heterogeneity and a weak negative association between death anxiety and religiosity. A closer examination revealed that 10 of the 11 studies that directly tested for curvilinearity provided some support for an inverted-U pattern. The curvilinearity hypothesis cannot be ruled out, but more evidence - particularly on non-religious individuals, and in non-Western, non-Abrahamic contexts - is needed.

AB  - This paper presents the the first attempt to include soil moisture information from remote sensing in the tools available to desert locust managers. The soil moisture requirements were first assessed with the users. The main objectives of this paper are: i) to describe and validate the algorithms used to produce a soil moisture dataset at 1 km resolution relevant to desert locust management based on DisPATCh methodology applied to SMOS and ii) the development of an innovative approach to derive high (100 m) resolution soil moisture products from Sentinel-1 in synergy with SMOS data. For the purpose of soil moisture validation, 4 soil moisture stations where installed in desert areas (one in each user country). The soil moisture 1km product was thoroughly validated and its accuracy is amongst the best available soil moisture products. Current comparison with in-situ soil moisture stations shows good values of correlation (R > 0.7) and low RMSE (below 0.04 m(3) m(-3)). The low number of acquisitions on wet dates has limited the development of the soil moisture 100m product over the Users Areas. The Soil Moisture product at 1km will be integrated into the national and global Desert Locust early warning systems in national locust centres and at DLIS-FAO, respectively.

TI  - Environmental and socioeconomic factors of abandonment of rainfed and irrigated crops in northeast Spain
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes over the last century in the economic model of European countries and the development of the market economy have led to intense shifts in land occupation patterns. Agricultural abandonment is an important consequence of these processes and has modified natural and cultural landscapes, involving side-effects for society. Understanding how environmental and socio-economic factors influence the abandonment process can provide useful insights for managing investments, whether from the public or the private sector. In Spain, the Pyrenees and the Ebro Depression are two differentiated areas in terms of land-use dynamics, particularly in terms of the agricultural model carried out. In this paper we have analyzed the agricultural abandonment in these areas during the 1987-2012 period in relation to several potential explanatory factors. The analysis focuses on the abandonment of rainfed and irrigated herbaceous crops in order to derive specific explanations according to the crop type and geographical region. Crop covers were classified from four Landsat scenes, and conditions were described by topographic variables, human factors and drought occurrence. Boosted regression trees (BRT) were used to identify the most important variables and to describe the relationships between agricultural abandonment and key factors. Topography derived variables were found to be the main determinants, except for irrigated crops in the Ebro Basin, where locational factors play a more important role. BRT models allowed us to identify other significant patterns such as: the vulnerability of irrigated crops to drought; the higher dependence of agricultural activity in the Pyrenees on internal networks; pattern shifts of land abandonment in the analyzed sub-periods, and; evidence of the importance of economic diversification for maintaining cropland.

TI  - THE USE OF NDVI AND CORINE LAND COVER DATABASES FOR FOREST MANAGEMENT IN SERBIA
T2  - ACTA GEOGRAPHICA SLOVENICA-GEOGRAFSKI ZBORNIK
M3  - Article
AB  - This article evaluates the possible use of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and CORINE Land Cover (CLC) databases for better forest management in the municipalities of Kursumlija and Topola in Serbia. The forest areas obtained using CLC were up to 11.5% larger than the official forest area estimates, whereas NDVI gave more precise results. Hence, NDVI can efficiently provide local forest managers with essential annual information about the forest inventory. This is of a crucial importance for preventing illegal logging, which is very prevalent in southern Serbian municipalities, which have substantial forested territory. NDVI thus very promising for Serbia and also for countries that rarely carry out national forest inventories. This method can also easily be applied to other Balkan countries with a similar situation regarding local forest management.

TI  - COSMOLOGY, WORLDVIEW, AND ATTITUDE A Discussion of Maximus the Confessor in Light of Mindfulness Meditation
T2  - STUDIES IN SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Among other things, contemporary mindfulness studies have identified how a meditation that engages non-judgementally with experiences can help transform a person's attitudes. By responding to experiences in a non-judgemental way, negative behavioral patterns lessen. In this way, mindfulness has demonstrated a positive effect on mental health, physical pain, and even improves community resilience. Meditative traditions that emerge from religious contexts, on the other hand, often have quite complex worldviews, concepts, and attitudes. These structures inform how a person responds to experiences that arise in meditation. In this paper, I discuss how Maximus the Confessor's (580-662) Ambigua 7 describes the creation and the world we experience which provides a framework for an attitudinal shift toward receptivity. Cosmology and worldview play an important role in Maximus' redefinition of attitude away from a more active engagement with experience to a more receptivity attitude. I suggest that receptivity can be understood as a way of encountering experiences in meditation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Copper is one of the essential mineral that has many functions in variety of applications. This research aimed to detect the copper potential using remote sensing data. The research location is in Sumbawa. Remote sensing data used were Landsat, ALOS PALSAR, X SAR, SRTM C, and Satellite Geodesy. Landsat was used for geological parameters extraction such as land cover and its changes, geomorphology, landforms, and hydrothermal alteration. ALOS PALSAR, X SAR and SRTM C were used for height model integration (DTM). This DTM was useful for the other geological parameters extraction, such as geological structures and formations. DTM used has vertical accuracy + 1,5 m. Geodesy Satellite data can be used for the extraction of gravity, magnetic field, geodynamics, and rock densities. These various geological parameters were extracted by VIDN, integration, dip and strike, interferometry, backscattering, hydrothermal alteration, physical geodesy, and classification based digital objects. All of those parameters were then correlated copper potential detection. This research is one of the newer innovation by correlating many parameter for geology-mining potency identification. The results obtained were geospatial information of copper potential and geological parameters at a scale of 1:50.000 with reference ASPRS Accuracy Data for Digital Geospatial Data.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This study was reviewed the views of life and death(死生觀) of ancient Japanese found in Kojiki(古事記). The views of life and death of the ancient Japanese was divided into the soul notion and the afterlife and it was examined in relation to the related words in Kojiki. The results are as follows. The idea of ​‘spirit(靈)’, ‘soul(魂)’ and ‘god(神)’ is seen in the soul museum of Kojiki, but the idea of ​​‘ghost(鬼)’ is not seen. The presence of the soul can be confirmed by the awareness of the existence of various gods, and though the thought about the heavenly system where the gods are seated is seen, the idea of ​​the place where the soul can rest is lacking. In other words, it can be said that there is no positive concept of the ‘immortal world(仙界)’ and ‘paradise world(極樂)’ in which the soul can go after death. Therefore, the ancient Japanese could not think of a positive the world after death until Buddhism was introduced. However, in terms of the use of terminology, I think that there was a master of ‘Huangcheon(黃泉)’ and ‘Sangse(常世)’ derived from Confucian ideas. However, the two terms are different. In the case of ‘Hwacheon’, it was recognized as a subterranean world going after death. But, when compared with this, it can be said that ‘Sangse’ is understood as the heterogeneous region existing in the sea. In general, it is understood that Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, which were foreign religions, came to Japanese society in the 6th and 7th centuries, citing the records of Nihonshoki(日本書紀). Neverthless, it can be understood that, even in the early 8th century, when the Kojiki was established, the viewpoints of the foreign religions did not have a great influence on the formation of the view of life and death of the ancient Japanese. Also, the negative worldview of afterlife is a concept similar to the views of life and death of shaman faith distinguished by this world and the next world.

AB  - This study aims to monitor the long term behavior of the bridge using time series interferometric technique. The accurate interpretation of the interferometric phase in the case of bridge, relies on the understanding of contributions of components such as DEM error, thermal expansion, and linear displacement. To decompose each contribution, this study applied the PSI algorithm using multi-temporal Cosmo-Skymed SAR data for Kimdaejung bridge. This study was able to find the unique displacement pattern, which is called as a deflection. The deflection is commonly caused by the creep, shrinkage, and ageing. Due to the early stage after the completion of the construction, the physical change of the bridge characteristics leads to the deflection. Thus, this paper verifies the potential to monitoring the long term deflection and implies that the bridge need to be monitored continuously.

AB  - Satellite images, which are widely used in various applications, are very useful for monitoring the surface of the earth. Since satellite data is obtained from a remote sensor, it contains a lot of noise and errors depending on observation weather conditions during data acquisition and sensor malfunction status. Since the accuracy of the data affects the accuracy and reliability of the data analysis results, noise removal and data restoration for high quality data is important. In this study, we propose a reconstruction system that models the time dependent dynamic characteristics of satellite data using a multi-period harmonic model and performs adaptive data restoration considering the spatial correlation of data. The proposed method is a real-time restoration method and thus can be employed as a preprocessing algorithm for real-time reconstruction of satellite data. The proposed method was evaluated with both simulated data and MODIS NDVI data for six years from 2011 to 2016. Experimental results show that the proposed method has the potentiality for reconstructing high quality satellite data.

AB  - Satellite data have been widely used in many applications such as monitoring changes of land-cover. Remotely sensed data inevitably contain disturbances caused by cloud presence, atmospheric variability and instrument problems, which limit the application utility. Noise reduction and reconstruction of high-quality data streams is important for the accuracy and reliability of the data analysis. This study proposes an adaptive reconstruction system for time series satellite data using multi-period harmonic analysis. A complex model of multiple periods would be proper to embody inter-annual and inner-annual variations of surface parameters. The experimental results with both simulation data and the remotely sensed data show the potentiality of the proposed adaptive reconstruction system. In addition, it has an advantage of real-time data reconstruction by adaptive estimation approach.

T2  - SOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cloud Resolving Storm Simulator (CReSS) model with default parameter settings largely underestimates the diurnal variation of land surface temperature (LST) and hence the formation of summertime diurnal convective clouds over the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which are the primary target of cloud seeding in the UAE. Based on sensitivity experiment results, we optimized a set of land surface parameters to minimize the underestimation of LST and improve the performance of weather simulations over deserts and mountains in the UAE. In the optimized experiment, the difference in LST between Aqua/MODIS observations and CReSS simulation results decreased from 13.0 to 2.3 K under daytime conditions, mainly due to decreased evapotranspiration efficiency and soil thermal diffusivity. Moreover, the difference decreased from 3.8 to 2.0 K under nighttime conditions, mainly due to decreased evapotranspiration efficiency and increased soil temperature at the deepest layer. A decrease in roughness length suppressed the increase in surface air temperature (SAT), contributing to the reproduction of a realistically large difference between LST and SAT during the daytime. The improvement in temperature matching demonstrates that the CReSS model, when used at a 1-km horizontal resolution, accurately simulates the formation of diurnal convective clouds and development of precipitation over deserts in the UAE and low mountains in northeastern UAE.

AB  - The goal of this study is to review the artistic world view of creative indie musicians through Walter Benjamin’s aesthetic theories. As it is widely known, the core element of Benjamin’s melancholic contemplativeness acknowledges the significant roles of our dreams or a subconscious messiah. Such an allegorical methodology of interpreting the world and its subjects and texts as original concepts enables going beyond the universality and obviousness of daily destruction for the search of ‘messianic present time.’ The subject matters include Jaurim’s “Dream,” Kiha and the Faces,’ “I Watched TV” and Broccoli, You Too’s “Graduation.” The lyrics contain the melancholic worldview of distancing themselves from the catastrophic reality. By identifying the aesthetical nature with political characteristics, their lyrics demonstrate the potential of philosophical contemplation through pop culture.

AB  - Tsunami is a series of huge sea waves that commonly occurs because of the oceanic plate movement or tectonic activity under the sea. As a sudden hazard, the tsunami has damaged many people over the years. Parangtritis village is one of high tsunami hazard risk area in Indonesia which needs an effective tsunami risk reduction. This study aims are modelling a tsunami susceptibility map, existing assembly points evaluation, and suggesting effective evacuation routes. The susceptibility map was created using ALOS PALSAR DEM and surface roughness coefficient. The method of tsunami modelling employed inundation model developed by Berryman (2006). The results are used to determine new assembly points based on the Sentinel 2A imagery and to determine the most effective evacuation route by using network analyst. This model can be used to create detailed scale of evacuation route, but unrepresentative for assembly point that far from road network.

AB  - Mangroves are estuary dominant vegetation in tropic and subtropic area which have an important role to balance the coastal ecosystem. One of the main mangrove biophysics parameters is leaf area index, which is defined as an unitless quantity from the area of one side of the leaf on each unit of ground surface area. LAI measurement using satellite imagery is more efficient than direct measurement because it covers the isolated area in the mangrove forest. This paper discussion focus on mangrove leaf area index estimation model comparison to obtain the best estimation model based on accuracy test value. The imagery used in this research is Sentinel 2A with 10 meters resolution and generic vegetation index (NDVI) compared with nongeneric index vegetation (EVI). Normalized vegetation index is chosen because its sensitivity to chlorophyll tissue of the leaves beside, Enhanced Vegetation Index is chosen because its sensitivity to vegetation canopy structure. The LAI measurement result in Teluk Ratai, Pesawaran, Lampung showing values range from 0.37 until 1.39. The correlation analysis result showing an adequate strong relationship between NDVI and EVI with LAI field measurement value. The correlation value between NDVI and the field measurement value of LAI is 0.779 also the correlation value between EVI and the field measurement value of LAI is 0.762. Based on those value both of vegetation index have a strong relationship with the field measurement result of LAI. From the standard error estimation value, the LAI estimation model accuracy using NDVI is 79.8% and 78.78% using EVI. Visual comparison also done by compare vegetation density pattern in Sentinel 2A with estimation classes in NDVI and EVI model. The best model to estimate leaf area index mangrove is EVI model based on visual comparison, accuracy test, and saturation effect from NDVI.

TI  - Histology of Sculpin spp. in East Greenland. II. Histopathology and trace element concentrations
T2  - TOXICOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - For many years, the sculpin has been utilized as a sentinel monitoring species for anthropogenic impacts on the marine environment. To further develop its potential as a screening model body burden of several trace elements, including cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) and selenium (Se), were investigated. In addition, histopathology in shorthorn sculpins (Myoxocephalus scorpius; n = 20) and fourhorn sculpins (Myoxocephalus quadricornis; n = 10) were examined at three sites around the Scoresby Sound settlement in Central East Greenland. Fourhorn sculpins caught at the most distant site from the settlement, contained significantly higher hepatic Cu and Cd concentrations as well as significantly elevated gill Pb levels compared to the shorthorn sculpins collected at two other sites closer to the settlement. Histological examinations showed that fish with significantly higher concentrations of hepatic Cd and Se exhibited greater nuclear alterations, interstitial hyperplasia/hypertrophy, interstitial mononuclear infiltrations and granulomas. Further, fish with higher Cd and Cu gill tissue levels displayed a significantly higher number of cytoplasmic alterations and lamellar epithelium lifting, hypertrophic and hyperplastic epithelium along with mucus cell hyperplasia. While the presence of liver lesions were not species or sex-specific, the presence of gill lesions decreased in the order female fourhorn sculpins > female shorthorn sculpins> male fourhorn sculpins > male shorthorn sculpins. Hepatic Hg concentrations exceeded known lowest observable effect doses (LOED) for fish (0.1-0.5 mu g g(-1) ww) in 27% of fish, while liver Cd residues in 80% exceeded LOED (0.42-1.8 mu g g(-1) ww). Based upon these results, data suggest that using the sculpin as a valuable sentinel fish species histopathology may serve as a reliable tool for assessing marine ecosystem exposure to trace metals. However, confounding physiological and ecological factors also need to be considered.

T2  - African journal of infectious diseases
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Influenza sentinel surveillance in Cote d'Ivoire showed that 70% of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) cases remained without etiology. This work aims to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and virological pattern of ARI that tested negative for influenza virus, in children under five years old.MATERIALS AND METHODS: one thousand and fifty nine samples of patients presenting influenza Like Illness (ILI) or Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) symptoms were tested for other respiratory viruses using multiplex RT-PCR assays targeting 10 respiratory viruses.RESULTS: The following pathogens were detected as follows, hRV 31,92% (98/307), hRSV 24.4% (75/329), PIV 20.5% (63/307), HCoV 229E 12,05% (37/307), hMPV 6.2% (19/307), HCoVOC43 1.0% (3/307) and EnV 1.0% (3/307). Among the 1,059 specimens analyzed, 917 (86.6%) were ILI samples and 142 (23.4%) were SARI samples. The proportion of children infected with at least one virus was 29.8% (273/917) in ILI cases and 23.9% (34/142) in SARI cases. The most prevalent viruses, responsible for ILI cases were hRV with 35.89% (98/273) and hRSV in SARI cases with 41.2% (14/34) of cases. Among the 1,059 patients, only 22 (2.1%) children presented risk factors related to the severity of influenza virus infection.CONCLUSION: This study showed that respiratory viruses play an important role in the etiology of ARI in children. For a better understanding of the epidemiology of ARI and improved case management, it would be interesting in this context to expand the surveillance of influenza to other respiratory viruses.

TI  - Animal agents in Russian fairy tales
T2  - CANADIAN SLAVONIC PAPERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most traditional interpretations of literary animals focus on the animals' metaphoric or symbolic significance, exposing the prevailing anthropocentrism of the humanities in general, and literary studies in particular. The present examination of selected Russian fairy tales helps demonstrate that in many Russian fairy tales animals exercise agency and retain subjectivity. Such portrayals of animals and the resulting human-animal relationship suggest an ecosystemic worldview in which humans are positioned on an equal plane with other living beings.

AB  - Land surface emissivity (LSE) is a parameter that must be known to retrieve land surface temperature (LST). Thus, this work presents the application of NDVI Threshold Method (NDV/THm) in a field of coastal dunes with partial vegetation cover in Southern Brazil. We used a spectral library of quartz samples measured at different temperatures to minimize the error of the initial emissivity value in the method. Finally, we calculated LST through the improved single-channel (1SC) algorithm by using the band 10 (10,6-11,19 mu m) of a Landsat-8 image. The quartz emissivity was tested at two temperatures: (1) the emissivity value corresponding to the higher brightness temperature obtained from the image; (2) the emissivity value based on the saturation point of the spectral library. We verified that this approach is indispensable to acquire more reliable data. The ISC algorithm may produce an error up to 10K in the LST retrieval if the quartz emissivity is not correctly calibrated.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Savannas are widespread global biomes covering 20% of terrestrial ecosystems on all continents except Antarctica. These ecosystems play a critical role in regulating terrestrial carbon cycle, ecosystem productivity, and the hydrological cycle and contribute to human livelihoods and biodiversity conservation. Despite the importance of savannas in ecosystem processes and human well-being, the presence of mixed woody and herbaceous components at scales much finer than most medium- and coarse-resolution satellite imagery poses significant challenges to their effective representation in remote sensing and modeling of vegetation dynamics. Although previous studies have attempted to separate woody and herbaceous components, the focus on greenness indices and fractional cover provides little insight into spatiotemporal variability in woody and herbaceous vegetation structure, in particular, leaf area index (LAI). This paper presents a method to partition 1km spatial resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aggregate green leaf area index (LAI(A)) from 2003 to 2015, into separate woody (LAI(W)) and herbaceous (LAI(H)) constituents in both drought seasonal savannas and moist tropical forests of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In our analysis, we use an allometric relationship describing the variation in peak within-canopy woody LAI of dominant tree species (LAI(Wpinc)) across gradients in mean annual precipitation, coupled with independent estimates of woody canopy cover ((w)), to constrain seasonally changing LAI(W). We present the LAI partitioning approach and highlight the broad spatial and temporal patterns of woody and herbaceous LAI across SSA. The long-term average 8day phenologies of woody and herbaceous LAI (averaged across 2003-2015) are available for evaluation, research, and application purposes.

TI  - A Very Rare Case: HPV-Negative Vulvar Cancer in an Adolescent.
T2  - Case reports in obstetrics and gynecology
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Carcinoma of the vulva is usually regarded as a disease of older women, with the typical age of 65-85 years. There are a limited number of reports of vulvar cancer cases younger than 30 years. These patients have usually risk factors such as human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and immunosuppression. Herein, we present a case of invasive squamous vulvar cancer in an 18-year-old patient without any risk factor. Vulvar radical local excision and bilateral inguinal sentinel lymph node biopsies were performed. The clitoris was preserved during the surgery. Patient did not receive adjuvant therapy. Follow-up after 12 months of the disease showed no evidence of disease. Vulvar carcinoma in very young women may develop without any predisposing factor. Early detection will result in better survival. So, there should be a high index of suspicion when a vulvar lesion is seen, even if the patient falls below the typical age range and does not carry any well-known risk factors such as HPV infection and immunodeficiency.

AB  - Thailand has historically been an area of very high rates of forest destruction. Responses have included designating forests as protected areas and restricting access and usage by forest-dwelling communities. Smallholder farmers in these communities have often found themselves faced with critical issues of environmental degradation and deforestation and without the appropriate channels to resolve them. Over several decades, community forest management (CFM) has gained global momentum as a potential solution with both economic and environmental benefits, but results have been mixed. In 2012 we presented a case study at the IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference (GHTC) documenting the progress of the CFM program in the northern Thailand village of Huai Lu Luang. This village partnered with several non-government organizations, including Upland Holistic Development Project and Plant With Purpose, to implement CFM using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) remote sensing technologies for mapping and monitoring. At the 2012 GHTC we presented results showing significant improvements in both forest health and the community standard of living as a result of this combined approach. Now, six years later, not only has Huai Lu Luang village continued its efforts at CFM, but their success in community-based forest protection has expanded to the watershed level. Fifteen communities in the Huai Lu River watershed have created an effective CFM network to advocate for community forestry, and have expanded the use of remote sensing and mapping technologies to develop accurate village maps and relevant land management plans. This initiative has gained the active support of local and national government agencies. We provide evidence that the participating communities are experiencing greater economic stability and more sustainable farm systems. Using NDVI data, we observe a consistent increase in vegetative cover in the watershed relative to similar neighboring watersheds over a period of 7 years, indicating continuing improvements in forest health. These successes have made this watershed a model for others in northern Thailand and Burma who would use CFM and remote sensing technology to achieve environmental restoration and improve the standard of living for forest-dwelling communities.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MODERN JEWISH STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Holocaust and a worldwide Jewish enthusiasm and support for the Red Army's defeat of the German Army on the Eastern Front led to a greater sense of international Jewish consciousness and solidarity often tied to an antifascist politics. Utilizing a transnational lens, I explore how Jewish antifascists of the immediate post-war period proffered a novel cultural politics as a means of addressing ongoing international issues of post-Holocaust Jewish survival in a dangerous and politically uncertain modernity. I examine three Jewish left magazines of the late 1940s that were involved in a loose international antifascist progressive Jewish network and ideological framework. These magazines Jewish Life (USA), New Life (UK) and Unity (Australia) represented similar antifascist politics and cultural outlooks in the USA, Britain and Australia, respectively. They have received little sustained scholarly attention previously. I analyse their vision of diverse multilingual Jewish cultures which were to be promoted and developed in any country where Jews lived and in whatever language they spoke. Their cultural vision represented antifascist values against bourgeois or nationalist Jewish culture and broadly reflected a pro-Soviet, progressive and Jewish internationalist, Popular Front politics and worldview.

AB  - The article contains the results of research and development, which can be considered as a solution to the scientific problem concerning the selection and development of methods of decoding the occurring at different times series of multispectral images for monitoring and evaluation of the dynamics of agricultural plants of Karasai district of Almaty region.The methods of pretreatment of multispectral imagery of medium spatial resolution (LANDSAT-7,8) based on structural and spatial model allows to more efficiently decrypt the agricultural plants of Karasai district of Almaty region in comparison with the classification of the original zonal images. The reliability of decryption by using the structural and spatial model is increased by an average of 16%. Experiments on classification of agricultural plants of Karasai district of Almaty region according to multispectral imagery by means of structural and spatial models have shown the ability of decrypting alpine forests, mixed forests, bushes that are in the rivers basin and forest covers, cultural lands of gardeners, agricultural lands especially rain-fed and irrigated lands with a sufficient reliability level. The obtained results of decrypting the agricultural plants according to the occurring at different times multispectral images LANDSAT-7, 8 provide an ability to create and update maps of vegetation, scale 1: 100 000, and also create the maps of vegetation dynamics, scale 1: 100 000.Spectral analysis of agricultural plants of Karasai district of Almaty region showed that the most informative areas of agricultural land especially the rain fed and irrigated land are green and middle infrared band.

AB  - It is well known that SAR imagery is affected by SAR geometric distortions due to the SAR imaging process (i.e. Layover, Foreshortening and Shadows). Specially in mountainous areas these distortions affect large portions of the images and in some applications, these areas shouldn't be included in analysis. Using a foreshortening mask is a suitable solution, but finding the mask is challenging. The aim of this research is to exploit the fusion of Sentinel-1 multi-temporal images and SRTM DEM to produce a quasi-global foreshortening mask using the Google Earth Engine (GEE), cloud-based platform. The mean value of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 images is calculated. Then a local minimum algorithm finds probable foreshortening area. Aspect and slope information from SRTM DEM are used to refine Sentinel-1 derived foreshortening mask. The proposed method is tested in British Columbia (Canada), Everest Mountain (Nepal), and Mazandaran (Iran). The results demonstrate the reliability of proposed method to detect the foreshortening area.

AB  - Identification of crop and its accuracy is an important aspect in predicting crop production using Remote Sensing technology. This study investigates the ability of Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm in discriminating fodder crops and estimating its area using moderate resolution multi-temporal Landsat-8 OLI data. SVM is a non-parametric statistical learning method and its accuracy is dependent on the parameters and the kernels used. The objective was to evaluate the feasibility of SVM in fodder classification and compare the results with traditional parametric Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC). Fodder crops are available over small fields in the study area thus having large number of pure fodder pixels over small area is difficult. Hence, SVM has an advantage over MLC as it works well with less training data sets also. Three kernels (linear, polynomial and radial based function) were used with SVM classification. Comparative analysis showed that higher overall accuracy was observed in SVM in comparison to MLC. Temporal change in the spectral properties of the crops derived through Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from multi-temporal Landsat-8 was found to be the most important information that affects accuracy of classification. The classification accuracies for SVM with radial based function, polynomial, linear kernel and MLC were 90.09%, 89.9%, 88.9% and 82.4 % respectively. The result suggested that SVM including three kernels performed significantly better than MLC. India has low livestock productivity due to unavailability of fodder hence this study could help in strengthening the fodder productivity.

CP  - 35th International Technical Meeting on Air Pollution Modelling and its Application (ITM)
CL  - Chania, GREECE
AB  - The physical and chemical characteristics of aerosols are considered as critical for nucleation processes, cloud formation and evolution. The Mediterranean Region is well known for the mixture of aerosols from different origins such as desert dust, sea salt and anthropogenic and biomass burning. Sea salt is in relatively small quantities compared to dust amounts during episodes but its constant presence plays a key role in cloud formation, especially concerning the initial stage. In this work we discuss modeling results related to nucleation processes and cloud formation in the Eastern Mediterranean. Emphasis is given in the impact of sea salt on Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) and orographic cloud formation. The role of other sources of aerosols is also discussed. The modeling tool used for the simulations is the RAMS/ICLAMS fully-coupled modeling system. Satellite data and in situ measurements have been also used for a more comprehensive analysis.

AB  - New European civilization, including Russia, is experiencing the third transition period after Hellenism and Renaissance. The old scale of values does not work, and the new one is still emerging. The situation is exacerbated by total globalization and the search for new worldorder. The hallmark of the historic challenge is the uncertainty of the nearest days and psychological tension. Both society and people suffer.Goals and objectives of the study. Through a comparative analysis of the past and the present, the author examines the causes of the crisis and states that in Russia this crisis is burdened by the legacy of the past, the specifics of development with a reference from the power of authority to authority of power. This trajectory could not stand the test of strength in February 1917. In 2017, Russia celebrates its centennial. The upcoming event demonstrates the reality of the historic challenge, which awaits a worthy response.The essence of the research task is:Finding a sound idea that can provide a capable worldview of people;determining the subject of the search for a response to a historical challenge, who is capable of this mission, whose prerogative and vocation it is, what is the mechanism for implementing this idea;Investigating the potential of the intelligentsia as the optimal subject of the participative consciousness predisposed to analyze the next historical challenge and readiness not only to seek the Idea to answer this challenge but also to participate in its implementation.Research methods: system approach, principles of interrelation, interaction and interdependence, comparative analysis of past and present.The results of the research: the domestic intelligentsia has the opportunity to declare itself in the status of an ideological component of the subjective factor of social development, on which the country's perspective depends. Keywords: a historical challenge, response, the idea of response, intelligentsia, intellectual, objective conditions, subjective factor.

TI  - African cassava whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, cassava colonization preferences and control implications
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Cassava is a staple food for people across sub-Saharan Africa. Over the last 20 years, there has been an increased frequency of outbreaks and crop damage in this region caused by the cassava-adapted Bemisia tabaci putative species. Little is known about when and why B. tabaci adults move and colonize new cassava crops, especially in farming systems that contain a mixture of cultivar types and plant ages. Here, we assessed experimentally whether the age and variety of cassava affected the density of B. tabaci. We also tested whether the age and variety of the source cassava field affected the variety preference of B. tabaci when they colonized new cassava plants. We placed uninfested potted sentinel plants of three cassava varieties (Nam 130, Nase 14, and Njule Red) in source fields containing one of two varieties (Nam 130 or Nase 14) and one of three age classes (young, medium, or old). After two weeks, the numbers of nymphs on the sentinel plants were used as a measure of colonization. Molecular identification revealed that the B. tabaci species was sub-Saharan Africa 1 (SSA1). We found a positive correlation between the density of nymphs on sentinel plants and the density of adults in the source field. The density of nymphs on the sentinels was not significantly related to the age of the source field. Bemisia tabaci adults did not preferentially colonize the sentinel plant of the same variety as the source field. There was a significant interactive effect, however, between the source and sentinel variety that may indicate variability in colonization. We conclude that managing cassava source fields to reduce B. tabaci abundance will be more effective than manipulating nearby varieties. We also suggest that planting a whitefly sink variety is unlikely to reduce B. tabaci SSA1 populations unless fields are managed to reduce B. tabaci densities using other integrative approaches.

TI  - Combining Field and Image Spectral Reflectance for Mangrove Species Identification and Mapping using WorldView-2 image
T2  - EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS IX
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications IX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Mangrove species inventory and mapping is very important as an effort to preserve the ecosystem and biodiversity of mangrove forests. One way of efficient mangrove species inventory and mapping is to use remote sensing imagery, especially through the analysis of its spectral reflectance pattern. This study aims to map the fourteen mangrove species on Karimunjawa Island, Central Java, Indonesia by: (1) measuring the mangrove species spectral reflectance pattern in the field, (2) characteristic analysis of the mangrove species reflectance pattern, and (3) mapping the dominant mangrove species distribution. The spectral reflectance measurement of mangrove species objects in the field was done by using JAZ EL-350 VIS-NIR (ranges from 300 to 1100 nm). The JAZ field spectrometer was pointed at a distance of 2 cm from the target objects with 10 reading repetitions for each species. Field measurements results were then taken to the laboratory for analysis of spectral reflectance and absorbance patterns, which served as key object recognition in this study. To combine the field and image spectral reflectance patterns, the field reflectance patterns were resampled to the spectral resolution of WorldView-2 image (8 bands, 2 m pixel size). The spectral angle mapper (SAM) method was the used to locate and map the distribution of each targeted mangrove species. As expected, the results showed that the largest difference of spectral curves between species was at the NIR wavelength spectrum (700-900nm). Hence, it is potential to be used as the basis for identification of species mangrove from remote sensing imagery. However, the result of this mapping approach only showed a low accuracy of 62%. The low value of map accuracy was attributed to the inaccuracy in defining threshold in SAM for each class. This study provides a basic understanding of the use of spectral reflectance for mangrove species mapping from remote sensing imagery.

T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article considers the applicability of the concept of backwardness which was one of the basic concepts of both Russian and Western historiography of pre-revolutionary Russia until the late 20th century and resulted from the constant comparison of Russia with the conventional 'West: On the one hand, modern historiography is characterised by a 'normalisation' of Russian history, i.e. attempts to prove that, considered generally, Russian historical development was identical to that of Western Europe, and, on the other hand, complete refusal to compare Russia and the West due to Russia having an altogether different and unique model of historical development. However, both of these trends contradict the worldview Russians had between the 18th and early 20th centuries. The author characterises both trends as dead ends as the concept of Russia's 'normality' makes it impossible to explain the events of the imperial era, while the other approach deprives a historian of one of the major research tools in studying the past. It results in an intellectual trap, and the author suggests that to solve this problem, scholars should create a new language of historical research and accumulate empirical data that would create a more complex and multidimensional image of the past.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article demonstrates the relevance of the postmodern worldview for creating marketing texts and ways of teaching students of Humanities. Modern communication technologies encourage communicants for parallelism and diversity, for the expansion of communicative ways, so nowadays communicants do not seek for integrity and consistency.A special role in creating content for different target audiences today belongs to the ability to tell fascinating but simple stories that reflect the worldview of the addressee. However, the intergenerational gap in Russia is growing every year, not least because of the active introduction of digital communications. That is why it is even called the "the digital division". Technologism of communication has increased the communication problems between the younger and the older generations.With digital literacy, many students, being able to target technically, do not know how to create content suitable for different generations. In this regard, the target audiences of "45 plus" are especially difficult for students.Nowadays, the authors of marketing texts need not only to be aware of attitudes and values of different social groups and generations, but also to be able to adapt to them through intertextuality, using precedent phenomena and a special kind of metaphor. These speech techniques can be considered a copywriting technique. However, they can be actively used only under the condition of speech and social literacy of the text authors. The authors should create texts as a component of culture, adapting them to the tasks and expectations of the addressee.The article gives examples of successful cases of storytelling used in modern Russian business, and also suggests ways of how to teach modern students to create media and marketing texts.

AB  - LAPAN-A2 and LAPAN-A3 arc the second and third generation microsatellites developed by Satellite Technology Center, Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space. To support earth observation and maritime surveillance, these satellites were equipped with matrix camera payload capable of producing digital images formed in Bayer pattern. Due to usage time of the camera, the quality of captured images is degraded leading to the appearance of vertical and horizontal stripe noise on captured images. The purpose of this study is to implement a statistical based stripe noise correction involving median and mean filter in order to overcome relying stripe noise on images captured by LAPAN-A2 and LAPAN-A3 microsatellites. The performance of proposed method was evaluated quantitatively by calculating peak signal to noise ratio and structural similarity of corrected image.

NASA's SLI program aims to develop technologies for future Landsat-like measurements. In support of this, NASA's SLI-Technology program aims to develop a new generation of smaller, more capable, less costly payloads that meet or exceed current Landsat imaging capabilities. By providing continuous visible-to-shortwave hyperspectral data, CHPS will support legacy Landsat data products as well as a much broader range of land science products. We discuss the development of the CHPS technology, initial performance test results, planned airborne demonstration and data distribution to science collaborators, and path to spaceborne demonstration.

AB  - The Compact Hyperspectral Prism Spectrometer is being developed as a candidate imaging spectrometer technology for insertion into future Sustainable Land Imaging missions. The 2013 NRC report Landsat and Beyond: Sustaining and Enhancing the Nations Land Imaging Program recommended that the nation should "maintain a sustained, space-based, land-imaging program, while ensuring the continuity of 42-years of multispectral information." In support of this, NASA's Sustainable Land Imaging-Technology program aims to develop a new generation of smaller, more capable, less costly payloads that meet or exceed current Landsat imaging capabilities. CHPS meets these objectives and will provide continuous visible-to-shortwave spectroscopic information at high spectral resolution. CHPS supports continuation of legacy Landsat data products as well as providing additional spectral information for a broader range of land science products. CHPS features full aperture full optical path calibration, exhibits high uniformity, extremely low straylight, and low polarization sensitivity. These are critical for meeting the demanding SLI measurement objectives. In preparation for space-borne instrument development, Ball is currently developing an airborne instrument that will provide representative spectroscopic data and data products. We are now in year 2 of a 3-year program and anticipate conducting initial airborne engineering flights in 4th-quarter 2018.

TI  - Investigating the urban heat island effect of transit oriented development in Brisbane
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transit oriented development (TOD) has been identified as a key planning tool to limit sprawl development and thereby to tackle a range of undesirable outcomes of cities. Generally, research findings are supportive of TOD policies over sprawl development in many aspects such as reducing car-dependency, congestion, and emissions. Although sprawl development has been identified as a key factor of the urban heat island (UHI) effect, a phenomenon when an urban area experiences a higher temperature compared to its surrounding non-urban areas, existing empirical studies, however, lack to answer whether TODs are likely to reduce the UHI effect. Using Brisbane as a case, this research answers this question by: a) identifying TOD neighbourhoods based on a cluster analysis of six built environment factors (residential density, employment density, land use diversity, intersection and cul-de-sac densities, public transport accessibility levels); b) validating the selection of TOD neighbourhoods based on travel behaviour analysis of residents living between TOD and non-TOD areas; c) examining patterns of UHI effects between the areas and their changes over the period of 2004-2013 based on Landsat remote sensing data; and d) identifying the factors contributing to the UHI effects in TODs. Results show that TODs experienced a higher level of UHI effect compared to non-TOD areas. Although both areas experienced an increase in the UHI effect between the periods, the rate of increase was found to be significantly higher in TOD areas. Land use diversity, percentage of porous land vis-vis density significantly contributed to the UHI effect. The findings suggest that a compromise between natural and built-up areas is essential to reduce the UHI effect while contributing to the ultimate goal of TODs - i.e. to create settings which prompt people to drive less and ride public transit more.

AB  - This paper aimed to characterize the spatial and temporal pattern of agricultural drought in Pre-Kharif season using Vegetation Health Index (VHI) andillustrated drought characteristics in Bangladesh during 2001-2015. VHI was calculated from TCI (Temperature Condition Index) and VCI (VegetationCondition Index) derived from MODIS Terra satellite data, LST (Land Surface Temperature) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), respectively. Thefinding showed that all drought-affected areas were experienced by mild, moderate, severe and extreme droughts in several years of Pre-Kharif seasons.Significant drought events were found in the year of 2002 and 2013. On average, Chittagong district covered the largest drought area in all droughtstages, and the fraction of drought area was the highest in Sylhet and Rangpur for Pre-Kharif season. Finally, overlaying annual VHI raster mapsresulted in that the most vulnerable district to agricultural drought were Sylhet, Rangpur, and Mymensingh in the northern and eastern regions ofBangladesh.

AB  - This paper proposes the regression model for the estimation of the yield for the two crops (Rice and Groundnut) by applying image processing techniques on Landsat 8 imagery. The Undecimated Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (UDT-CWT) is used to denoise the Landsat 8 Imagery. After that Remote Sensing (RS) parameters like Leaf Area Index (LAI), and 6 Vegetation Indices (VI) including Normalized Difference of Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (SARVI), and Modified Soil Vegetation Index (MSAVI) etc., were retrieved. This paper, reveals the impact of noise on these derived RS parameters and the denoising technique results PSNR= 49 dB; SSIM=1 for SARVI. Then designed a regression model with this SARVI approach. This regression model also involves Meteorological Parameters like Rainfall, Temperature, Evapotranspiration which are collected from Automatic Weather Stations (AWS). The outcome of the proposed estimation model is precisely validated for a period of 2014 to 2017 with ground truth data and outperforms good correlation R-2=0.78 for Kharif and R-2=0.74 for Rabi seasons.

M3  - Article
AB  - Stresses acting on fault systems before major earthquakes can produce thermal anomalies; these abnormalities can be observed using multi-sensor satellite data. Moderate resolution spectro-radiometer on board the terra and aqua satellites can provide thermal infrared (TIR) imaging data for land and ocean. These TIR data have recorded short-lived thermal anomaly prior to major earthquakes. It is suggested by others that these electromagnetic (EM) phenomena relate to stress build up before earthquakes. The objective of this study is to find an association between spatial extent and temporal evolution of thermal anomalies and known major earthquakes near the boundary of Nazca plate and South American plate. Our approach is to map the TIR transient fields from polar orbiting satellites and analysing those data using time series temperature plots to detect the abnormal thermal trends before the earthquake. This study concentrated on marine earthquakes to detect the changes in both land and ocean before seismic activity.

TI  - Consequences of genetic selection for environmental impact traits on economically important traits in dairy cows
T2  - ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane (CH4) emission is an important environmental trait in dairy cows. Breeding aiming to mitigate CH4 emissions require the estimation of genetic correlations with other economically important traits and the prediction of their selection response. In this study, test-day CH4 emissions were predicted from milk mid-infrared spectra of Holstein cows. Predicted CH4 emissions (PME) and log-transformed CH4 intensity (LMI) computed as the natural logarithm of PME divided by milk yield (MY). Genetic correlations of PME and LMI with traits used currently were approximated from correlations between estimated breeding values of sires. Values were for PME with MY 0.06, fat yield (FY) 0.09, protein yield (PY) 0.13, fertility 0.17; body condition score (BCS) -0.02; udder health (UDH) 0.22; and longevity 0.22. As expected by its definition, values were negative for LMI with production traits (MY -0.61; FY -0.15 and PY -0.40) and positive with fertility (0.36); BCS (0.20); UDH(0.08) and longevity (0.06). The genetic correlations of 33 type traits with PME ranged from -0.12 to 0.25 and for LMI ranged from -0.22 to 0.18. Without selecting PME and LMI (status quo) the relative genetic change through correlated responses of other traits were in PME by 2% and in LMI by -15%, but only due to the correlated response to MY. Results showed for PME that direct selection of this environmental trait would reduce milk carbon foot print but would also affect negatively fertility. Therefore, more profound changes in current indexes will be required than simply adding environmental traits as these traits also affect the expected progress of other traits.

TI  - Measuring War in Early Modern East Asia, 1368-1841: Introducing Chinese and Korean Language Sources
T2  - Harvard Dataverse
M3  - Data study
C8  - 1
AB  - How much war was there in early modern East Asia? This article empirically corroborates characterizations of relations between Sinic East Asian polities as being unusually peaceful and stable, which we attribute to the participants shared subscription to a common and accepted hierarchy framed by a Confucian worldview. More broadly, we provide direct empirical evidence that international hierarchies derive their stability from cultural consensus rather than simply asymmetries in material power. We make these claims by addressing the extent, range, and patterns of war in early modern East Asia by introducing and describing an extensive dataset of over 1,100 entries that measures war and other violence in early modern East Asia from 1368 to 1841 and relies principally on both Chinese and Korean language sources. The combination of these two Asian language sources forms the basis of a unique dataset that will substantially widen and complement the largely Chinese or English language sources that are generally used in debating war in early modern East Asia. Asia was composed of much more than simply China, and bringing in scholarship from other areas of early modern East Asia reflects a trend of moving past national studies to research the region more holistically.

TI  - An Accurate and Automated Method for Identifying and Mapping Exposed Rock Outcrop in Antarctica Using Landsat 8 Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctica plays a significant role in global change studies. As a typical land cover in Antarctica, exposed rock is considered indispensable in many studies, and the mapping of exposed rocks is seen as a key basis of work to meet the demand for more accurate and updated datasets with the consecutive development of satellite technology. Although the normalized difference snow index has been commonly used for differentiating exposed rocks and snow, it often misidentifies clouds as rocks. The British Antarctic Survey has used Landsat 8 data to create a new rock outcrop map for Antarctica, overcoming the limitations of previous techniques and generating Antarctic Digital Database (ADD) New Rock Outcrop with higher accuracy than previously achieved. However, there are still some omission and commission errors apparent in the shaded areas, which affect the accuracy. Widespread shaded areas in Antarctica due to low solar elevation angles and extreme topography cause difficulty in accurately mapping exposed rock. In addition, major differences are present between existing products. Addressing the existing issues about extraction of exposed rock, this study used the near infrared band and shortwave infrared 2 band of Landsat 8 reflectance data to build a specific exposed rock index for the extraction of exposed rocks. A shadow detection method combined with a blue reflectance threshold is used for the shadowed rock identification. Accuracy assessment of these extraction results showed that the accuracy of the new product is higher than all existing exposed rock products. The conversion from DN values to top of atmosphere reflectance and the solar elevation correction for each pixel individually eliminate a variety of errors associated with the different acquisition times of each image. From the statistics of the reflectance related to the training samples, this paper established the threshold of exposed rock extraction so as to ensure the applicability of the same threshold for exposed rock extraction in all images. This method is applied to a total of 1100 high-quality images that were collected for covering the Antarctic continent from November 2013 to February 2014. The results show that 253 of the images contain exposed rocks, and these images were used for mapping work. The map showed that the main exposed rock areas are mainly distributed in four coastal regions: The Antarctic Peninsula, Queen Maud Land, Lambert Glacier basin, and Victoria Land regions. We also compared our results with ADD New Rock Outcrop and Bedrock Mapping Project 2 (Bedmap2) data in the four main regions. Our results were close to the ADD rock outcrops and exhibited remarkable differences with Bedmap2. We explored the possibility of analyzing and explaining these differences. Especially, as using the same data source Landsat 8 but with a different method, the comparison between our results and ADD New Rock Outcrop is discussed and concludes in shadowed rocks extraction, mixed-pixels, and omission disagreement. The results also show that shadowed rocks accounts for nearly 12% of the total exposed rocks and cannot be neglected. The method we developed can be quickly applied for extraction and mapping of large areas of exposed rocks using Landsat 8.

AB  - Crop classification makes it possible to obtain the spatial distribution and planting area information of crops. Meanwhile, a multi-year crop mapping helps to study the dynamics of agricultural fields and may serve as the basis of crop structure adjustment and optimization to assist government decision-making. This study aims to explore the feasibility of Sentinel-2 imagery data for crop type mapping and to evaluate the effectiveness of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in discriminating various crop types using a small training dataset. In doing so, the classical SVM classification method was applied to distinguish major crop types in Plymouth County, Iowa, USA, based on Sentinel-2 time-series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data in 2016. The results show that the SVM model can effectively classify three major crop types (corn, soybean and alfalfa) in Plymouth with an overall accuracy of > 67% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.52, which evaluated the potential of utilizing SVM to obtain the spatial distribution information of crops based on the new Sentinel-2 imagery. Besides, this exploration of new data sources for crop classification can give some guidance and the method can be applied to other regions.

AB  - Recently, object classification of remote sensing images has attracted more and more research interests due to the development of satellite and aerial vehicle technologies. Hashing learning is an efficient method to handle the huge amount of the remote sensing data. In this paper, we proposed a novel hashing learning method named partial randomness supervised discrete hashing (PRSDH), which combines data-dependent methods and data-independent methods. It jointly learns a discrete binary codes generation and partial random constraint optimization model. By random projection, the computation complexity is reduced effectively. With the weight matrix derived from the training data, the semantic similarity between the data can be well preserved while generating the hashing codes. For the discrete constraint problem, this paper adopts the discrete cyclic coordinate descent (DCC) algorithm to optimize the codes bit by bit. The experimental results show that PRSDH outperforms other comparative methods and demonstrated that PRSDH has good adaptability to the characteristic of remote sensing object.

AB  - Due to the increasing importance and demand of 3D Web GIS for visualization and spatial-temporal analysis of Big Earth data, this research proposes and develops methods of intelligent spatial location search and KML-based (Keyhole Markup Language) visualization of spatial-temporal remote sensing data under the open Cesium Digital Earth framework. The results demonstrate the design and implementation of visualization for tiled time-series remote sensing imagery and KML time-sequence image data using Cesium.js based on HTML5 and WebGL(Web Graphic Library) technology, which greatly facilitates spatial data mining of correlation between dimensions and periodic development within the big Earth data. Such method plays an important role in disaster relief as well as being a scientific decision-making tool for government agencies. Furthermore, building upon TIANDITU map and cesium engine API, spatial similarity and bus location search as well as administrative division search are also implemented and the search results are overlaid on top of a Digital Earth System.

AB  - Dong-Ri Kim’s Eul-Hwa and N. Scott Momaday’s House Made of Dawn have a theme of religious conflict in common. As Kim’s narrative tracts a process of gradually aggravated religious conflict between a shaman Eul-Hwa and a fundamentalist Christian Young-Sool, Momaday also depicts his main characters’ inner conflict originating from difference in their worldview and religious creed, per se. However, the two novelists show a significantly enough difference in terms of their thematic focus and its degree. Whereas narratives in Eul-Hwa just center on religious arguments between the two protagonists, Momaday, distancing his narrative from never-ending religious controversy, focuses on describing how the main characters like Abel, Angela and Father Alguin suffer from their actual life-based agony and illness such as Abel’s war fatigue and Angela’s spiritual disease. And beyond individuals’ sufferings, Momaday’s thematic message broadens into a sense of community which ecological communalism predominates in. The two writers’ difference on their narrative focus renders Eul-Hwa result in aggravating religious conflict while reserving, in House Made of Dawn, a significant message that enables religious and cultural reconciliation.

AB  - The Royal Belum forest reserve is one of the oldest tropical rainforests in the world and it is one of the largest virgin forest reserves in Malaysia. However, not many studies have been conducted to understand the ecology of this forest. In this study we estimated the aboveground biomass (AGB) of the forest using diameter at breast height (DBH) and height of trees (h), tree species and hemispherical photographs of tree canopy. We estimated AGB using five allometric equations. Our results demonstrated that the AGB given by the one tree species specific allometric equation does not show any significant differences from the values given by the non-tree species specific allometric equations at tree and plot levels. The AGB of Intsia bijuga species, Koompassia malaccensis species and Shorea genera were comparatively higher, owing to their greater wood density, DBH and h. This has added importance because some of these species are categorized as threatened species. Our results demonstrated that mean AGB values in this forest (293.16t ha(-1)) are the highest compared to some studies of other areas in Malaysia, tropical Africa and tropical Bazilian Amazonia, implying that the Royal Belum forest reserve, is an important carbon reservoir.

AB  - Karachi is located on southernmost border of Pakistan along the Arabian Sea coast. Concerned institutions fear the occurrence of subsidence in the city, further contributing to the relative sea level rise. No direct measurement has been made so far about the subsidence rate and its contribution to city's submergence risk. Our study presents first and preliminary results of vertical ground deformation measurement over this area using an advanced Temporarily Coherent Point InSAR technique using Envisat/ASAR and Sentinel-1A data. These datasets allowed us to study deformation in this area from 2004-2016, with some data gaps, thus providing a long-term analysis. Results show that various parts of the city are unstable and undergoing deformation of up to about 15 mm/yr. However, we could not find significant correlation between faults passing through the city and the deformation in its different parts. Future studies should focus on monitoring the deformation on a regular basis.

TI  - The Communicative Grammar Phenomenon as the Reflection of the Anthropocentric Worldview of the Contemporary Humanitarian Discourse
T2  - HELIX
M3  - Article
AB  - The article highlights the actual theoretical and methodological issues of communicative grammar from the point of view of the "new" communicative trend in teaching Russian as a foreign language considering the anthropocentric worldview of the contemporary humanitarian discourse. The relevance of the stated problem is caused by the absence in the modern methodological and anthropological "picture of the world" of clear criteria for description for the separation of the "traditional" and "non-traditional" approach to communicative grammar. The authors raise the question of the continuity of methodological traditions, tracing the development of the communicative approach, revealing its theoretical prerequisites and "involvement" in the modern anthropological paradigm of humanitarian discourse. Relative-comparative methods, the use of discourse analysis techniques allowed the authors of the article to approach the anthropocentric (cultural) understanding of the reasons for shifting the interests of grammarians from the device of the language system (traditional grammar) to its functioning ("non-traditional grammar" or grammar of the "speaker"). Despite the significant differences between the three main "nontraditional" approaches (functional-communicative grammar, the theory of functional grammar and the applied theory of functional-communicative syntax), their basis is the orientation toward text and immersion in the discursive space of the language being studied. The main result of this research is the understanding of the phenomenal essence of communicative grammar as a linguistic and cultural fact, and the practical way out is the use of the methodological principles of communicative grammar as a nucleus in the modern linguodidactic model in the study of the Russian language as a foreign language.

AB  - Stricter requirements for new satellite systems for remote sensing of the Earth (ERS) require the use of video cameras of different frequency ranges with high resolution, which leads to a significant increase in the volume of images.Applied in modern remote sensing satellites SPOT-5, IRS-P5, Beijing-1 and Cartosat-1,2 JPEG method, and on satellites IMS-1, x-SAT, PLEIADES-HR, Radarsat-2 and TerraSAR method JPEG-2000 have a number of limitations due to the fact that they were developed in the era of television standards NTSC, PAL and SECAM.It is known that the procedures of compression and decompression, protective coding and decoding are symmetrical. This is the basis for using orthogonal transformations in these procedures.The choice of DCT in these algorithms in their development was due, including, small size of personnel. However, modern practice shows that not always DCT allows you to successfully compress the image and keep it informative at a resolution of 4K, 8K or more. The explanation is simple-the size of the small parts in the high-resolution image is commensurate with the size of the DCT matrix.One of the ways to solve the problem of high-quality image processing with high resolution is the creation and use of new compression filters, new algorithms of noise-resistant coding, based on the use of orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal matrices of large sizes.

This article examines a trip Turgenev made to Rome in February-April 1840, and focuses on his affiliation with the salon of the Khovrin family and his relationship with the eldest daughter, Alexandra Khovrina (1823-1903), who later became the prototype for Lisa Kalitina in the novel Home of the Gentry (1858). The 1840 trip to Rome spiritually transformed Turgenev, and played a formative role in the author's worldview and character The author also considers the influence that the widely admired Russian philosopher and writer Nikolai Stankevich (1813-1840) had on the evolution of Turgenev's views.

T2  - Voprosy Onkologii (St. Petersburg)
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of biopsy of sentinel lymph node as the first lymph node in the pathway of lymphogenous tumor spread has been actively discussed over the past decades and has already taken its rightful place in breast and melanoma surgery. The goal of this method is to exclude vain lymphadenectomy in patients without solid tumor metastases in regional lymph nodes. In the era of minimally invasive and organ-saving operations interventions it seems obvious an idea to introduce a biopsy of sentinel lymph node in surgery of early gastric cancer. Meanwhile the complexity of lymphatic system of the stomach and the presence of so-called skip metastases are factors limiting the introduction of a biopsy of sentinel lymph node in stomach cancer. This article presents a systematic analysis of biopsy technology of signaling lymph node as well as its safety and oncological adequacy. Based on literature data it seems to us that the special value of biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes in the future will be in the selection of personalized surgical tactics for stomach cancer.

AB  - This study aims at illuminating a culturally situated understanding of Information literacy (IL) contextualized by a particular landscape in terms of a specific geographic region with related socio-cultural characteristics. The understanding of IL defines the frameworks for teaching IL in academic settings and impacts pedagogy. The study embraces the constructivist worldview through the lens of a socio-cultural theoretical framework and employs instrumental (with exploratory and ethnographic elements) case study approach. The research design includes: field observations and analysis, unobtrusive data set(s) collection and examination, artifact analysis such as websites, and in-depth interviews with Bulgarian academic librarians. This study addresses the need to apply culturally grounded approaches to IL to better serve specific groups. It will add to the international pool of knowledge in the field and will benefit Bulgarian academic librarians by providing a view of their understanding of IL and possibly facilitate further inquiry into suitable framework and practices.

AB  - The detailed, accurate and frequent land cover and crop-type mapping emerge as essential for several scientific communities and geospatial applications. This paper presents a methodology for the semi-automatic production of land cover and crop type maps using a highly analytic nomenclature of more than 40 classes. An intensive manual annotation procedure was carried out for the production of reference data. A class nomenclature based on CORINE land cover Level-3 was employed along with several additional crop-type classes. Multitemporal surface reflectance Landsat-8 data for the year of 2016 were used for all classification experiments with a linear SVM classifier. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation highlighted the efficiency of the proposed approach achieving high accuracy rates. Further analysis on individual classes' performance highlighted the challenges in the proposed classification scheme as well as important outcomes regarding the spectral behavior of the considered categories.

TI  - Dual-tree complex wavelet transform-based image enhancement for accurate long-term change assessment in coal mining areas
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study was to improve the long-term land use change detection by improving classification accuracy of previous generation satellite image using a recent super-resolution technique. The study also analysed the change in land cover over a period of 41 years in a coal mining area. A dual-tree complex wavelet transform-based image super-resolution technique was used to enhance Landsat images of 1975 and 2016. Separating pixels with similar spectral response is an enigmatical task, especially when those pixel represent different ground features. Therefore, an advanced neural net supervised classifier was used to minimize classification errors. Accuracy of the classified images (both super-resolved and original) were measured using confusion matrices and kappa coefficients. A significant improvement of more than 10% was observed in the overall classification accuracy for the image of 1975, highlighting that the classification accuracy of earlier generation satellite data can be improved substantially.

TI  - Improving accuracy of long-term land-use change in coal mining areas using wavelets and Support Vector Machines
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Old satellite sensors lack several quality features such as high spatial and spectral resolution. For accurate long-term change detection, improvement of the quality of old satellite images is required. In the present study, we used two wavelet-based image enhancement techniques [(discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and dual tree-complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT)] for improving the quality of Landsat 2 data of 1975 and Landsat 8 data of 2015 to study the impact of coal mining on land use change over a period of four decades. The enhanced images were subjected to land-use classification using Support Vector Machines. Land-use classification accuracy was measured using confusion matrix-based accuracy assessment. Accuracy assessment revealed that the overall classification accuracy of DWT enhanced images was 82.10% for the year 1975 and 88.46% for the year 2015. The overall classification accuracy of DT-CWT enhanced images was 85.71% for the year 1975 and 88.54% for the year 2015. The results of change detection revealed that the total areal coverage of dense vegetation increased by 65%, indicating that the rate of land degradation had slowed down due to the legislative and policy changes to promote sustainable development in coal mining after 1986.

TI  - The Destiny of a Venetian Craftsman in Peter the Great's Russia and the Destiny of a Genre: the Tsar's Gramota for Safe Conduct in the Context of Diplomatic Correspondance between Russia and the Republic of Venice
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the genre of the imperial gramota for safe conduct, which initially appears peripheral in the sphere of diplomatic correspondence due to its modest function, i.e. introducing the bearer of the document, explaining the reasons for his journey, and ensuring his safe passage through both Russian territory ( in this case, the documents are internal mandates) and foreign states (here we are dealing with petitions to foreign authorities). Despite the willingness of Venetian authorities to assist Peter I in his shipbuilding projects in Voronezh, it was not easy for them to persuade their subjects to travel to distant Russia. Nonetheless, a number of craftsmen were engaged. At the completion of their work in Russia, however, they were not immediately released and their delayed return became a matter of national importance. Peter I himself wrote twice to the doge explaining why he had detained the craftsmen and then sent them back to Venice in a series of groups. For each of these groups traveling home, a gramota for safe-conduct was issued. Our analysis of these texts suggests that the genre of the safe-conduct contains changes in epistolary etiquette, analogous to those observable in Peter's petitions to Venetian authorities. In pre-Petrine diplomatic etiquette, the independent diplomatic status of the Russian tsars had allowed them to define its rules for themselves; this was now replaced by new norms that more closely resembled those of European usage. In this way, tsarist gramoty reflected the worldview of Russia's first emperor, his peculiar vision of Russian foreign policy. The office of foreign affairs, which had become an important cultural center during the reign of Peter's father (when the tsar would indicate a gramota's contents and approve its final form), became under Peter laboratory where the norms of this new Russian epistolary etiquette were worked out.

AB  - This paper aims at developing and introducing an onto-epistemological concept of afterlife in a modern philosophical worldview. In particular, it leads to expanding the scientific instrumentation in knowledge of being. The authors define three relational models, which form the concept of afterlife in accordance with axiological social communities' constants: the mortal, the future, and the middle models. Social-worldview models are based on philosophical notions "purpose of life" and "purpose of death". The main aspect of the mortal model of the afterlife concept is ignorance of religious sense, confirmation of creature comforts and death inevitability. The future model has the priority of spiritual values and the total denying of material ones. The middle model comprises the spiritual and material balance of values. The authors construct the Afterlife worldviews (ALW) concept and classify it into anthropocentric ALW, theocentric ALW and anthropotheocentric ALW. These notions give the possibility to see the historical Afterlife worldviews development as dialectic conformity of ALW opposite's abrogation in the diachronic structure of the social-historic process. The paper uncovers theoretical categories such as a category of binarity and a category of ternarity in an evolution of the notions of afterlife. Furthermore, evidences of dialectic change of these three models are studied from the perspective of ontology and epistemology. (c) 2018 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing data offer unique opportunities for the characterization of land surface in urban areas. However, no hyperspectral-unmixing based studies have been conducted to automatically detect photovoltaic panels, which represent one of the important components of energy systems in such areas.In this paper, a hyperspectral-unmixing based method is proposed to detect photovoltaic panels and to estimate their areas. This approach is based on an original multiplicative nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm with some known photovoltaic panel spectra. The proposed method can be considered as a partial/ informed NMF approach. Experiments are conducted on realistic synthetic and real data to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. In both cases, obtained results show that the proposed method yields much better overall performance than a method from the literature.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing data are widely used in various applications like classification and target detection. However, recently the influence of shadow has become increasingly greater due to the higher spatial resolution of such data. Shaded areas usually have lower intensity and fuzzy boundary, which make the images hard to interpret automatically. To overcome this issue, shadow correction/compensation of hyperspectral remote sensing data is one of the most used techniques. This process includes in general, the detection and de-shadowing steps. In this work, which focuses only on the de-shadowing step, a new hyperspectral unmixing-based shadow correction/compensation is presented. Experiments are conducted on a real hyperspectral image to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Experiments show that the proposed method yields satisfactory de-shadowing results and provides better overall performance compared to another unmixing-based method from the literature.

CP  - SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications IX

AB  - The analyses of trends in vegetation dynamics require a profound knowledge of its seasonality. For the determination of the seasonality conventional methods of time series analyses often use a simple averaging of measured values of the identical time in different cycle of the whole time series (e.g. bfast). Then it is assumed that the resulting seasonal portion of a time series is constant and stable for the entire time series. However, analyses of vegetation time series show that trends in vegetation dynamics do not always run steadily, but show structural breaks, especially in regions with high potential for possible landscape changes. For such conversion areas, the assumption of a constant seasonality is not always ensured. The dynamic or variability of the seasonality can have temporal effects by a shift of the start of the season (SOS) or the end of the season (EOS) and therefore also on the length of the vegetation period. To show whether seasonal dynamics can be detected in vegetation time series, two requirements must be fulfilled. (1) High-temporal resolution vegetation information provided for example as MODIS-NDVI. (2) Indicators are needed which allows the description of the variability of seasonality. As a result these metrics allow a better modeling of long-term vegetation dynamics in the trend, taking into account the variability of the seasonality. But at the same time the metrics itself serve as indicators for long term vegetation dynamics. The aim of the present study is to analyse phenological and greenness metrics for the modelling of vegetation dynamics in the nature reserve Konigsbrucker Heide. Detailed analyses of key metrics like SOS and EOS using different metric approaches and interpolation methods are applied and compared. The results show that it is difficult to determine consistent information for example for the trend of single phenology metrics.

AB  - Comprehending the prominence of forest carbon in climate change, this study was piloted in different land use of West Kameng district, Arunachal Pradesh, India to record the floristic composition, community characteristics, and above ground biomass (AGB) carbon using random sampling and geospatial approach. Preliminary field survey was done in 2016. Altogether 45 quadrats (0.1 ha each) were laid. Total tree richness recorded was 164 species from 49 families. Dominance and frequency distribution pattern of species revealed heterogeneity in composition with majority species showing clumped distribution. Plantations showed highest tree density while mixed dense forest showed maximum basal area (58.89 m(2) ha(-1)). Estimated AGB were 218.21 ton/ha for mixed dense forest, 84.94 ton/ha for abandoned forest, and 105.09 ton/ha for plantations. Total estimated carbon stocks were 120.01, 46.17, and 57.80 ton/ha for mixed dense, abandoned forest, and plantations, respectively. Predicted average AGB using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques was 163.25 ton/ha. Field-based AGB was slightly greater than the values observed from satellite data. Findings of the study may be useful for calculating total biomass and carbon stored in the major land cover of the district in particular and region in general. It will also support in future studies for calculating the long-term data on biomass carbon sequestration.

AB  - Soil salinity is one of the common factors leading to land degradation problems on earth, especially in arid and semiarid regions. There is an urgent need for rapid, accurate and cost-effective monitoring and assessment of soil salinization. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are employed as viable technologies for detecting, monitoring, and predicting spatial-temporal patterns of soil salinization. The purpose of this study is to establish partial least squares regression (PLSR) models that are based on remotely sensed data and field measured electrical conductivity (ECa) and to retrieve soil salinity estimates by constructing an optimal model. First, the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was calculated based on WorldView-2 images. Second, a statistical regression method was applied to analyze the correlation between ECa and SAVI under different parameters. The SAVI that was measured as the most stable parameter was an optimum index. Finally, a PLSR prediction model of soil salinity was established based on the sensitivity bands, the optimum index and ECa. The results of this study are the following: ( a) According to the adjusted parameter (L = 100), the SAVI index illustrated the best correlation with ECa, and ECa was also significantly related to the bands (( Red Edge) Band6, ( Near-IR1) Band7 and ( Near-IR2) Band8) derived from a World-view-2 image. (b) The results of the PLSR predictive model calibration showed that the model-D performed best through the sensitivity bands and optimal index, with the highest coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.67) and the smallest root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.19 dS center dot m(-1). The results indicated that the model-D that is constructed and applied in this paper could provide quantitative information for detecting and monitoring soil salinization in the Keriya Oasis and could also supply examples for the study of soil salinization in arid and semiarid regions with similar environmental conditions.

TI  - Reducing landscape heterogeneity for improved land use and land cover (LULC) classification across the large and complex Ethiopian highlands
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a land use and land cover (LULC) classification approach that accounts landscape heterogeneity. We addressed this challenge by subdividing the study area into more homogeneous segments using several biophysical and socio-economic factors as well as spectral information. This was followed by unsupervised clustering within each homogeneous segment and supervised class assignment. Two classification schemes differing in their level of detail were successfully applied to four landscape types of distinct LULC composition. The resulting LULC map fulfills two major requirements: (1) differentiation and identification of several LULC classes that are of interest at the local, regional, and national scales, and (2) high accuracy of classification. The approach overcomes commonly encountered difficulties of classifying second-level classes in large and heterogeneous landscapes. The output of the study responds to the need for comprehensive LULC data to support ecosystem assessment, policy formulation, and decision-making towards sustainable land resources management.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of Clouds and the Atmosphere XXIII
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Substantial difference between cloud amounts obtained from active and passive remote sensing has been documented by previous studies. The difference is typically attributed to two main factors: the different field-of-view (FOV) (first factor) and different sensitivity to cloud properties (second factor) of the active and passive ground-based instruments. The relative impact of these two main factors on shallow cumuli cloud amount is demonstrated in this study. The demonstration involves a new multi-year (2000-2017) product, which integrates both the active and passive remote sensing data collected at the mid-continental Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) Central Facility. Cloud fraction (CF) obtained from the narrow-FOV lidar-radar observations and wide-FOV fractional sky cover (FSC) acquired from sky images are key components of the integrated product. Results of this study indicate that (1) CF tends to overestimate FSC and this overestimation can be large (similar to 40% on average) even at extended temporal scales (several years) and (2) the observed overestimate is primarily due to different sensitivity of the active and passive remote sensing instruments to shallow cumuli, while the limited FOV of active remote sensing instruments plays a minor role in such overestimation.

TI  - Treatment and biology of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia
T2  - PEDIATRICS INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy. In the past ALL was intractable but now the survival probability is as high as 80-90%. Improved supportive care, treatment stratification based on relapse risk, biological features of leukemic cells, and optimization of treatment regimens by nationwide and international collaboration have contributed to this dramatic improvement. While including traditional risk factors (e.g. age and leukocyte count at diagnosis), the treatment has been modified based on biological characteristics (aneuploidy and translocation) and treatment response (assessed by minimal residual disease). Treatment for pediatric ALL typically consists of induction therapy with steroids, vincristine, and asparaginase with or without anthracycline, followed by multi-agent consolidation including high-dose methotrexate and re-induction therapy. After consolidation, less intensive maintenance therapy is required for 1-2years to maintain event-free survival. Recently, using advanced genomic analysis technology, novel sentinel genomic alterations that may provide more precise stratification or therapeutic targets, were identified. Moreover, in the last decade germline variations have been recognized as similarly important contributors to understanding the etiology and sensitivity of ALL to treatment. A more individualized approach based on genomic features (somatic and germline) and treatment response, the introduction of newly developed agents such as molecular targeted drugs or immunotherapy, and social support including long-term follow up are required for further improvement.

TI  - GWAS of Blood pressure
T2  - GWAS Central
M3  - Data study
AB  - We carried out a trans-ancestry genome-wide association and replication study of blood pressure phenotypes among up to 320,251 individuals of East Asian, European and South Asian ancestry. We find genetic variants at 12 new loci to be associated with blood pressure (P = 3.9 * 10(-11) to 5.0 * 10(-21)). The sentinel blood pressure SNPs are enriched for association with DNA methylation at multiple nearby CpG sites, suggesting that, at some of the loci identified, DNA methylation may lie on the regulatory pathway linking sequence variation to blood pressure. The sentinel SNPs at the 12 new loci point to genes involved in vascular smooth muscle (IGFBP3, KCNK3, PDE3A and PRDM6) and renal (ARHGAP24, OSR1, SLC22A7 and TBX2) function. The new and known genetic variants predict increased left ventricular mass, circulating levels of NT-proBNP, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (P = 0.04 to 8.6 * 10(-6)). Our results provide new evidence for the role of DNA methylation in blood pressure regulation.

TI  - Simultaneous retrieval of temperature and area according to sub-pixel hotspots from nighttime Landsat 8 OLI data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of thermal anomalies such as from wildfires, coal fires, and volcanoes has been a major application of satellite remote sensing. The Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has achieved sufficient enhanced radiometric performance to quantify visible and near infrared (VNIR) to shortwave infrared (SWIR) radiance emitted from thermal anomalies during nighttime. We propose a method to simultaneously retrieve the brightness temperature and corresponding area of a subpixel hotspot assuming a single isothermal heat source using the spectral radiances in VNIR and SWIR regions (bands 3-7) from nighttime Landsat 8 01,1 data. We conducted a prescribed fire experiment coincident with a Landsat 8 overpass on January 24, 2015. The brightness temperature retrieved from the OLI data agreed with the peak temperature of the time series thermocouple record within 60 K. The retrieved area of fire was 19% of the true fire area. The blackbody assumption (emissivity = 1) might cause the underestimated retrieved area. We applied the hotspot brightness temperature and area retrieval to 17 Landsat 8 scenes that cover Kanto, Japan to validate the proposed method. More than 79% of the detected results were confirmed as true positives based on the land use for each scene. Meanwhile, the obvious false positive was only up to 1% of the detected results. The remaining ambiguous results, mostly found in areas regarding agriculture, were possibly caused by occasional burnings because these locations were never repetitively detected. Time series comparison of the retrieved results in cement plants as a typical stable heat source revealed that the brightness temperature is accurately retrieved, though the retrieval of area is somewhat sensitive to noise on OLI imagery. The proposed method had founded more than twice of the hotspots detected using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) fire products in the studied area. More than 82% among the hotspots from VIIRS were detected by OLI. However our method failed to detect spatially broad but slightly cool hotspots. Higher spatial resolution at an appropriate spectral configuration enabled enhanced sensitivity to detect small heat sources, as well as quantification of the subpixel hotspots.

AB  - Asian dust (i.e., dust and sandstorm: DSS) is a phenomenon that wind-borne soil and mineral particles are raised thousands of meters into the air in arid and semi-arid regions of China and Mongolia, and is carried by westerly winds and sometimes reaches Japan. The PM2.5 air pollution often occurs in urban and industrial areas of China recently, and sometimes flows into Japan. DSS and PM2.5 affect the human health. DSS can be detected by using AVI method of the satellite remote sensing technique. AVI is defined as AVI=T12-T11, where T12 and T11 are the brightness temperatures at 12 mu m and 11 mu m wave lengths, respectively. For MODIS data, T12 and T11 correspond to band32 and band31, respectively. PM2.5 can be detected by using the proposed method {R, G, B} = {band10, band 9, T11}. In this paper, these methods are applied to the DSS events which aggravated Respiratory Symptoms (Asthma) in Western Japan in May 2011. The DustRGB method {R, G, B} = {AVI, T11-T8.5, T11}. which was proposed by EUMETSAT in 2011, is examined and also is applied to some dust images.

TI  - Estimation of wind speed over lakes in Central Europe using spaceborne C-band SAR
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1 satellite mission provides high-resolution, all-weather, day and night Synthetic Aperture Radar images. Studies about wind parameters above the ocean are frequent, inland lakes were seldom investigated. The objective of this article is to investigate the potential of C-band SAR for wind retrieval over lakes for evaluation of representativeness of meteorological station data. A number of lakes from Austria and Hungary (lakes in Salzkammergut, Lake Neusiedl and Lake Balaton), where wind measurements from automatic weather stations are available from the surroundings, has been selected for this study. Functions for speed retrieval are developed from empirical relationships for both available polarizations, W and VH. Meteorological station data are used for calibration and validation. Best results were obtained for W although with a dependency on incidence angle. Functions for different incidence angles according to the wind speed were, therefore, determined. There is a good correlation between the measured and the calculated wind speed (R of 0.71-0.91 for calibration sites; average R 0.71 for all sites). Average wind speed patterns for the lakes can be derived, but need to be analyzed separately for descending and ascending acquisitions due to difference in daytime (morning versus late afternoon).

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Symposium on Sensing Plant Water Status - Methods and Applications in Horticultural Science
CL  - Potsdam, GERMANY
AB  - Water deficit stress is one of the most important growth limiting factors in crop production. Several methods have been used to detect and evaluate the effects of water deficit on plants. In the present study, remote sensing has been used. The objectives were to 1) determine the effects of water deficit on greenhouse crop using spectral indices and 2) evaluate the reflectance spectra using the classification tree method for distinguishing water deficit levels based on substrate water content. For this reason, tomato plants were grown in slabs filled with perlite: i) under no irrigation for five days and ii) continuously well-watered. A hyperspectral camera was used to remotely measure plant reflectance during the periods with normal or low substrate water content. A large number of vegetation and water indices were compiled in order to measure plant vigour and other biophysical parameters using the remotely sensed data. A significant correlation was found between the mrNDVI reflectance index and substrate water content (0). In addition, the PRI values observed for plants of the water deficit treatment varied, once 0% rapidly decreased to 4.5%. The daily mean TCARI was linearly correlated with chlorophyll content but not with 0% variations. A classification tree was developed to investigate the relationship between the categorical data and determine the variables affecting other independent variables. The decision tree methodology could be used to build the model for the prediction of irrigation event outcomes.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications IX
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The vegetation in the riparian zone of a watercourse in fluences the water state with multiple factors, first via direct substance discharge and secondly via shadow casting on the water surface. Shadowing directly regulates the solar radiant energy arriving at the water surface. Solar radiation input to aquatic environments is the most important abiotic factor for aquatic flora and fauna habitat development. Thus, to adequately asses the ecological state of water courses it is necessary to quantify the solar surface irradiance E (W/m(2)) arriving on the water surface. When estimating the solar surface irradiance the complex coherence between incoming solar radiation, atmospheric in fluences, and spatial-temporal geometries need to be investigated. This work established a work flow to compute the solar surface irradiance for water bodies using different remote sensing data. The work flow was tested on regional level for a section of the river Freiberger Mulde, Saxony, for the year 2016. Product of the calculations is a map visualising the annual sum of the solar surface irradiance (kWh/m(2)) arriving on the Freiberger Mulde water surface and the surrounding terrain. Based on these information bio-hydrological issues can be further examinated.

T2  - JOURNAL FOR SEMITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Christianity has often been accused of promoting an anthropocentric worldview that has contributed to the current ecological crisis. Since Lynn White's accusation that Genesis 1:26-28 is responsible for the crisis, biblical scholars and theologians have been discussing this text. Although Genesis 1:26-28 contains hints of anthropocentrism, it does not represent the only way in which the biblical authors viewed humans and their relationship with nature. This article focuses on Job 38, which presents many phenomena of nature, inter alia water-related phenomena, as surpassing humans' understanding. The world does not revolve around humans. They are merely part of the natural world. Humans cannot control water-related phenomena, which are depicted as having their own worth.

AB  - Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) consists in processing an image or a bunch of images to generate a new image of higher spatial resolution. This problem has been intensively studied, but seldom is SRR applied in practice for satellite data. In this paper, we briefly review the state of the art on SRR algorithms and we argue that commonly adopted strategies for their evaluation do not reflect the operational conditions. We report our study on assessing the SRR outcome, relying on new quantitative measures. The obtained results allow us to outline the most important research pathways to improve the performance of SRR.

AB  - This paper describes the results of the work, which was divided into three parts: 1) the proof-of-concept of lightweight low cost UAV-borne multispectral NIR (shortwave infrared) sensor, 2) the evaluation of performances of airborne tailored NIR sensor vs. consumer-grade RGB digital camera, and 3) the feasibility study and the comparison of NIR multispectral data vs. Sentinel-2A high-resolution satellite multispectral imagery. The moderated cost-efficient UAV-borne imaging remote sensing solution was requested by the agricultural sector in Ukraine. The existing solutions did not meet the requirements of the end user neither suitable high-resolution satellite multispectral imagery was available too. The designed system integrated consumer-grade RGB digital camera and NIR sensor. Multi-temporary data was collected eight times during one growth season. Eight aerial missions were conducted in midsummer 2015 over the same area, which consisted of 50 plots with various cultivars of wheat, barley and rye. The vegetation indices were calculated for both datasets. Vegetation indices calculated from the NIR sensor highly correlated with plant chlorophyll and plant LAI, and revealed satisfactory correlation with plant fresh mass. Vegetation indices derived from onboard RGB camera did not reveal the significant correlation with any of plant growth parameter. The NDVI values calculated from NIR data demonstrated high correlation with the ones, which were derived from the Sentinel-2 high-resolution satellite multispectral images. The values of UAV-derived NDVI were lower than Sentinel-2-derived NDVI, and the regression slope of this relationship varied in different plant species. Reasons of such variation are discussed in the paper. After the numerous field-tests the customer accepted the developed tailored COTS UAV-borne multispectral solution cost-efficient and sufficient.

TI  - Path as Spatial and Spiritual Category in A. Najjar's Novel "The Exiles of the Caucasus"
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The proposed study examines the value components that make up the figurative and semantic complex of a path in the novel by A. Najjar "The Exiles of the Caucasus." In the context of conjugation of the spatial and spiritual hypostases of a path, the point of beginning and the end, the image of the guide, the intersection, the opposition "friend foe" and associated with them motive of fate and overcoming are mainly singled out. The role of druidism in preserving the integrity of the space of the Adyghe ethnic group is outlined. On the example of separate episodes of the novel it is shown that the destruction of the native Circassian space is equivalent to its desacralization, and the latter makes the inevitable tragedy of the ethnic group. The proposed prototype of the guide, the Circassian Sheikh Mansur, is indicated. The vector of spiritual transformation occurring within the limits of another's space is tracked and the symbolic implication of constant accentuation by the author of stability of external appearance is defined. It is proved that the result of the path depicted in the novel acquires any meaning only insofar as it is connected with its Beginning. Special attention is paid to the spiritual prerequisites laid down in the basis of A. Najjar's creation of this novel, as well as the ability to "preserve the Motherland within himself" as one of the dominants of his worldview. The novelty of the study is that the path as a spatial and spiritual category in the novel "The Exiles of the Caucasus" by A. Najjar is explicated and analytically comprehended for the first time.

TI  - Postmastectomy Breast Reconstruction With the Totally Autologous Latissimus Dorsi Flap in the Thin, Small-Breasted Woman: Give It More Thought!
T2  - Eplasty
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction: Thin women have fewer autologous tissue breast reconstructive options than their higher body mass index counterparts-due to a lack of adequate donor sites. They are therefore usually offered expander/implant techniques. The total autologous latissimus dorsi flap is generally used in "well-padded" individuals, as they have enough fat on their back on which a completely autologous reconstruction could be based. When implant-based reconstruction is contraindicated (for instance due to planned adjuvant radiotherapy) or unacceptable to the patient, the total autologous latissimus dorsi flap can provide adequate tissue volume by utilizing the additional back fat deposits even in the thin, small-breasted patient. This option is often overlooked by many surgeons. Our case series assesses indications and patient and surgeon satisfaction with the cosmetic outcome of this technique. Methods: The oncological and clinical details of 6 patients with breast cancer who underwent total autologous latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap immediate breast reconstruction by a single surgeon over an 8-year period were reviewed. An objective assessment of satisfaction with the cosmetic result was made by whether any additional surgical interventions (ipsilateral fat grafting/implant augmentation or contralateral liposuction/ reduction) were needed or not. A subjective assessment of breast symmetry by the surgeon using photographic records was also undertaken. The aesthetic outcomes were also objectively quantified using the BCCT.core software, initially developed for assessing the results of breast conservation surgery. Results: All 6 patients had small breasts and a low or normal body mass index. The mastectomies were performed for invasive carcinoma (n = 3) and extensive high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (n = 3). Four had axillary surgery (2 sentinel lymph node biopsies and 2 axillary clearances), and 3 received adjuvant radiotherapy. All were happy with their reconstructive outcomes, and none suffered major postoperative complications or disease recurrence. None requested or needed any subsequent ipsilateral adjustment or contralateral symmetrizing procedures. Subjectively, the reconstructions provided acceptable or excellent cosmetic results. The cosmetic results were categorized as excellent or good on the BCCT.core scoring system. Conclusion: This underutilized method of totally autologous breast reconstruction in thinner patients with lower body mass indexes yielded good, well-accepted cosmetic results without recourse to adjustment procedures, contralateral balancing surgery, or complex microvascular surgery. We recommend that the total autologous latissimus dorsi flap should be given more consideration when planning immediate breast reconstruction in this challenging group of thin, small-breasted patients.

TI  - The Burden of Typhoid Fever in South Africa: The Potential Impact of Selected Interventions
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoid fever is notifiable in South Africa but clinical notification is notoriously poor. South Africa has an estimated annual incidence rate of 0.1 cases per 100,000 population of culture-confirmed typhoid fever, decreased from 17 cases per 100,000 population in the 1980s. This work was undertaken to identify the reasons for this decrease and identify potential weaknesses that may result in an increase of observed cases. Culture-confirmed cases, with additional demographic and clinical data have been collected from selected sentinel sites since 2003. Data on contextual factors (gross domestic product [GDP], sanitation, female education, and childhood diarrhea mortality) were collected. National incidence rates of culture-confirmed typhoid fever have remained constant for the past 13 years, with the exception of an outbreak in 2005: incidence was 0.4 per 100,000 population. Paratyphoid fever remains a rare disease. Antimicrobial susceptibility data suggest resistance to ciprofloxacin and azithromycin is emerging. The South African population increased from 27.5 million in 1980 to 55.0 million in 2015: urbanization increased from 50% to 65%, GDP increased from United States Dollar (USD) $2,910 to USD $6,167, access to sanitation improved from 64.4% to 70.0% in the urban population and 26.4% to 60.5% in rural areas. Female literacy levels improved from 74.8% to 92.6% over the period. Improved socioeconomic circumstances in South Africa have been temporally associated with decreasing incidence rates of typhoid fever over a 35-year period. Ongoing challenges remain including potential for large outbreaks, a large immigrant population, and emerging antimicrobial resistance. Continued active surveillance is mandatory.

TI  - Contribution of participatory forest management towards conservation and rehabilitation of dry Afromontane forests and its implications for carbon management in the tropical Southeastern Highlands of Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Participatory forest management (PFM) has been applied as an approach to create a framework for collaborative forest management between local communities and government forestry agencies. This study was designed to assess the contribution of PFM approach in improving forest status in the Southeastern Highlands of Ethiopia. Landsat satellite imageries of four years were used to evaluate the trends and rate of deforestation before and after PFM interventions. Socio-economic data were collected from sample household surveys, key participants, focus group discussions, and field observations. The results showed that there was high rate of deforestation before PFM intervention as forestland has decreased by 19% (2531 ha) between 1990 and 2000. However, after the PFM intervention (2000-2016), the forest cover has increased by 247 ha (2.2%). During this period, net 1016 ha of shrub-lands were converted into forestland owing to significant forest regeneration. In addition, most sampled households (94% and 96% from lower and upper altitudes, respectively) perceived that PFM had significantly contributed to improve forest regeneration in their locality. This study revealed that PFM can serve as a stepping stone for carbon financing mechanisms to reduce greenhouses emission and enhance carbon sinks via forest resources.

T2  - 세계문학비교연구

AB  - The theme of the Orient, which started in earnest from Russian symbolist poets in the late 19th century and the early 20th century, heavily influenced on the Acmeist and Futuristic poets. The interest in the Orient has spread gradually, seeking to overcome the crisis of Eurocentrism. Gumilev’s interest in Orient does not stay in the dimension of exotic longing. He has also paid attention to metaphysical problems such as the similarity of poetics in the East and West, including the exploration of poetry, soul and spiritual world, reincarnation, and reincarnation.The theme of China, which Gumilev paid attention to the largest proportion of oriental themes, shows various changes throughout the period of his poetic creation. In the early poetries, poet describe China as non-practical facts and portray it as a symbolic space that does not exist. In the middle poetries, Guilev shows a unique ‘Chinese Souls’ as opposed to the previous one. His late poetry contrasts the scary and tragic reality of Russia at this time with those of some idyllic and ideal faraway world.Indochina motifs in the poetry of Gumilev show the exotic mood of the Orient and the special world of poet who lives, according to their laws. In this way, the poet shows his characteristic of Adamism to give a clear reality to a strange world.The motif of reincarnation, which shows the eternal repeatability of life, is at the core of the Indian theme. The process of reincarnation of souls and infinity of similar transformations exhibit similarities with the orthodox doctrines of India, having at the same time considerable differences from the contextual point of view.Unlike the contemporary poets who regarded it as the main theme, Gumilev's presentation of Japan as a theme was only a secondary subject for him. It was just an unfamiliar art. This difference in perception based on similar experience with oriental themes presents very interesting facts. To put it differently, Gumilev unravels deep and diverse interest in the Orient in his works and often presents and reinterprets such themes, but his worldview has nevertheless never been derailed from the theme of Europeanism.

TI  - Monitoring algal blooms in drinking water reservoirs using the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we demonstrated that the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor is a powerful tool that can provide periodic and system-wide information on the condition of drinking water reservoirs. The OLI is a multispectral radiometer (30m spatial resolution) that allows ecosystem observations at spatial and temporal scales that allow the environmental community and water managers another means to monitor changes in water quality not feasible with field-based monitoring. Using the provisional Land Surface Reflectance product and field-collected chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations from drinking water monitoring programs in North Carolina and Rhode Island, we compared five established approaches for estimating chl-a concentrations using spectral data. We found that using the three band reflectance approach with a combination of OLI spectral bands 1, 3, and 5 produced the most promising results for accurately estimating chl-a concentrations in lakes (R-2 value of 0.66; root mean square error value of 8.9 mu g l(-1)). Using this model, we forecast the spatial and temporal variability of chl-a for Jordan Lake, a recreational and drinking water source in piedmont North Carolina and several small ponds that supply drinking water in southeastern Rhode Island.

TI  - Normative Trade Theory Under Gossenian Assumptions
T2  - RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN NORMATIVE TRADE THEORY AND WELFARE ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - It is now more than 250 years since Montesquieu wrote a letter to William Domville in which he discussed what would now be called the welfare implications of international trade. In what sense can a country be said to benefit from trade with other countries? Early in the twenty-first century, that question still lacks a complete answer. It was shown by Grandmont JM and McFadden D, J Int Econ 2:109-125, 1972 and by Kemp MC and Wan HY, Int Econ Rev 13:509-522, 1972 that, for a single country, free trade coupled with suitable compensatory lump sum payments confined to that country would leave each resident of that country better off than in autarky. However the normative trade theory of 1972 neglected the fact that all consumption, production and endowment of commodities take time and are subject to a second budget of 24 h a day. The importance of the time constraint was first recognized by Gossen HH, Entwickelung der gesetz des menschlichen verkehrs, F. Vieweg und Sohn, Braunschweig, 1854. His book was written in German but was neglected even by German scholars. Eventually the greatest of all economic theorists, Leon Walras (J des Economistes 30:68-90 and 260-261. Walras' article was later published (in slightly abridged form) in English in Spiegel HW, The development of economic thought. Great economists in perspective, Chapman and Hall, London, 1952, pp 471-488, 1885, translated Gossen's book into French and ensured that it would not be forgotten. Jevons WS, The theory of political economy, 2nd edn. Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, 1879, and Edgeworth FY, Gossen, Hermann Heinrich (1810-1858). In: Palgrave RHI (ed) Dictionary of political economy, vol II. Macmillan, London, 1896, were the first to write about Gossen in English, but it was not until 1983 that an English translation of Gossen's book became available. Since then Gossen has become unforgettable for economists. Books about Gossen have become easier to sell than the book by Gossen in 1854. This chapter demonstrates that key propositions in normative trade theory remain valid in the presence of Gossen's time constraint. Each individual must now pool his/her family's time with members of other households. Pooling may extend across the world.

AB  - Hydrothermal alteration due to geothermal fluids often introduces mineral alteration and weathering that poses significant natural hazards around volcanoes. Hydrothermal alteration can be mapped remotely using satellite and airborne derive images. In this study, we explored the capacity of available multispectral satellites, high-resolution airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR imagery to provide an improved geological mapping and classification capability for volcanic terrains. Image classification experiments using a Random Forest approach trained using ground class data to classify 15 ground cover types show that Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI+TIR can provide a geological map with Overall (OA) and Kappa Accuracies (KA) of 69% and 66% respectively. Classification accuracy was dramatically improved when high-resolution airborne datasets were included. The use of full-spectrum AisaFENIX hyperspectral images improved accuracies to OA = 84% and KA = 82%. The maximum image classification accuracy is reached (OA = 87, KA = 85%) when all input features were combined.

AB  - After almost 9 years in orbit L-band satellite radiometry has demonstrated its impacts and values for a wide range of science and applications. However, so as to cover specific applications use of other sensors can prove very valuable. In particular use of altimetry, optical and thermal infrared measurements can offer new avenues. Many of them were tested with existing satellites at the time of SMOS launch, but with the Copernicus' Sentinel-3 mission's data now available, new applications and operational products can be envisioned.

TI  - Defining the incidence and clinical significance of lymph node metastasis in soft tissue sarcoma
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The incidence and clinical significance of lymph node metastasis (LNM, N1) in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is unclear. Recent studies have focused on extremity/trunk STS (ETSTS). We sought to define the subgroup of patients with LNM at sarcoma diagnosis across all disease sites and histologies.Methods: We identified and categorized 89,870 STS patients from the National Cancer Data Base (1998-2012) by nodal stage. Pathologically confirmed LNM (pN1) were identified in 1404 patients; 1750 had clinically suspicious but not pathologically confirmed LNM (cN1). Survival analyses were performed by Kaplan-Meier method.Results: Of 3154 patients (3.5%) with pN1 or cN1 LNM at presentation, 1310 had synchronous distant metastasis (Ml). LNM affected a small proportion of patients (5.8% head/neck, 5.3% intrathoracic, 5.1% intra-abdominal, 2.0% ETSTS). Angiosarcoma (6%), epithelioid (13%), clear cell (16%), and small cell sarcoma (19%) had the highest incidence of LNM, although liposarcoma, fibrous histiocytoma, and leiomyosarcoma accounted for the greatest number of LNM patients. For pN1M0 disease, median overall survival (OS) was 28.2 months, varying by histology. Among patients with pN1M0 STS, angiosarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and fibrous histiocytoma were associated with worse median OS (19.4, 23.8, 27.1, and 29.3 months) compared to epithelioid sarcoma and liposarcoma (49.6 and 56.0 months, p < 0.001).Conclusion: Despite clinical suspicion, pathologic LN evaluation in STS is inconsistently performed. LNM occurs across anatomic disease sites and is unevenly distributed across histologies. Although Ml disease portends poor prognosis regardless of LN status, LNM predicts worse OS in a histology-dependent manner in MO disease. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Keys TA, Scott DT. 2017. Monitoring volumetric fluctuations in tropical lakes and reservoirs using satellite remote sensing. Lake Reserv Manage. 34:154166.Sustainable management of lakes and reservoirs is currently a major challenge in regions of the world with limited hydrologic data and monitoring equipment. Specifically, temporal variability of water storage is difficult to quantify and is often neglected in lake and reservoir management. Here, we present a high temporal resolution remote sensing technique for quantifying volumetric fluctuations in surface water bodies without any field data. For this study, we utilized Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery in conjunction with satellite radar altimetry from 2 altimetry databases to develop high frequency time series of storage variations in 10 large tropical surface water bodies. For 3 of the sites, altimetry-based water level (L) estimates were validated by in situ data from monitoring stations while estimates of surface area (A) and changes in water volume (V) were validated by bathymetric maps with corresponding LA and LV polynomial relationships. Results indicate that remotely sensed V estimates agree well with in situ measurements for 2 of the 3 water bodies. For the third, A and V estimates were greatly underestimated due to the coarse spatial resolution of MODIS. Our findings suggest that the presented methodology works well for lakes and reservoirs with well-defined boundaries and low shoreline to surface area (S:A) ratios, in contrast to reservoirs with dendritic geometry and high S:A ratios. Overall, this method provides a free, user-friendly platform for monitoring and managing lakes and reservoirs.

AB  - Peatland fire and haze events in Southeast Asia are disasters with trans-boundary implications, having increased in recent years along with rapid deforestation, land clearing and severe dry seasons. Aerosols are emitted in high concentrations from the fires, which degrade air quality and reduce visibility, in turn causing economic, social, health, and environmental problems. During haze events, it is critical for public authorities to have timely information about affected populations. Currently, Indonesian disaster management authorities manage forest and peatland fire and haze events based on satellite data and sensors. They are looking for more real-time information in order to better protect vulnerable populations and environment. This paper explores information on visibility extracted from photos shared on social media to improve forecasting performance for haze severity. Our results show that visibility information can improve forecast accuracy over a baseline approach with common features, namely data from satellites and ground air quality sensors. Furthermore, by using social media photos, our model adds a near real-time property to the forecast model, with potential to improve disaster management and mitigation.

AB  - Vegetation change detection is needed for conserve of quality and water cycle in Cidanau watershed. The NDVI was applied to quantify the vegetation changes of Cidanau watershed for three different years 1989, 2001, and 2015. Using NDVI we mapped the reflectance from chlorophyll and distinguished varying amounts of vegetation at the pixel level by index. In the present study, as a preliminary study, we proposed a vegetation change detection analysis based on the NDVI from 1989 through 2015. Multi-temporal satellite data i.e. Landsat imagery with 30 m spatial resolution are used in the present study. It is reported that agroforestry land exhibited the greatest reductions in highly dense vegetation class in 1989-2001 and also moderate vegetation class in 2001-2015. It's mean that amount of vegetation present in agroforestry land is getting lower year by year.

M3  - Article
AB  - With the emergence of regular samizdat periodicals in the mid-70s. for the members of the "second culture" became aware of the need of conceptual understanding of the goals and objectives of the Leningrad uncensored poetry and its place in the cultural context. One of the literary-critical strategies that describe the specifics of the Leningrad unofficial poetry in the 1970s was proposed by V. Krivulin in a number of the articles published in the journals Chasy, Obvodniy kanal, Thirty-Seven (37) and others. This article discusses the main critical thoughts of Krivulin about the concept of "spirituality" which combines the aesthetic and religious connotations. Krivulin's critical articles are analyzed in the context of his participation in the religious and philosophical section organized by the poet together with T. Goricheva, within which the terminological language of self-representation of members of unofficial culture was formed. This language also included ethical models, through which Krivulin analyzed the works of uncensored authors. In his article on I. Brodsky, the poet's work after emigration is regarded as a rejection of the "prophetic" function, which is the most characteristic feature of Leningrad poetry and also the main concept of the aesthetic program of Krivulin itself during this period. This article also raises the question of Krivulin's passeism, his "retro-modern" desire to re-establish connection with the culture of the Silver Age by expanding the status of the poet and endowing him with prophetic properties. Partially examined the transformation of Krivulin's views on the Leningrad unofficial poetry of the 1970s in the post-Soviet period, which was characterized by a focus on the adogmatism and independence of the worldview of the authors of that period.

AB  - Sumatera Island is located adjacent to the ocean and directly influenced by the dynamic of Indian Ocean. Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) as one of the global climate factor has a big impact towards this dynamic. As it aims to get the influence of IOD towards Sumatera water area, high-resolution remote sensing data is needed. Those are Sea Surface Temperature (SST), precipitation, and Dipole Mode Index (DMI). DMI is calculated by the differentiation of SST anomaly. IOD condition is emphasized by using precipitation data. Area observed is divided into three areas which are in series West Sumatera water, East Sumatera water, and Bukit Barisan highland. During IOD negative, the precipitation values were estimated 5,43; 4,63; 4,5 mm/hr sequentially. Meanwhile, during IOD positive, those values were 2,74; 3,47; 3,11 mm/hr sequentially. It is shown that IOD has the impact of the precipitation values in Sumatera waters. By showing the higher value of IOD negative and the lower value on IOD positive. West Sumatera water is observed as the most influencing area by the dynamic of IOD. Topography is also influencing towards the precipitation and it is shown by its values weather on IOD negative or positive.

AB  - Fulfilment of the underlying structure within an indivisible system which leads to a specific pattern of behaviour was previously addressed by prominent approaches. However, there was a considerable lack for proposal of a proper idea that considers the susceptibility of structures to change with time through other adjacent structures. Considering such a point of view necessitates an alternative approach to functional perspective. Thus, a process-oriented architectural decomposition of a simplified organization structure embedded in a supply chain is applied to analyse the structure dynamics. This novel perspective to dynamic multi structure systems is introduced in this research and the comparison with its function-oriented perspective is studied. Furthermore, the critical role of enterprise resource planning systems for data acquisition, analysis and retrieval in such a complicated worldview into organizations is discussed. Moreover, the value added to enhance these planning systems by this perspective is specified.

AB  - Mapping and monitoring trees in tropical forest is deemed necessary especially for forest personnel. Unfortunately, acquisition of tree parameters for mapping purposes are tedious due to labour intensive, timely and cost-consuming. Thus, the advancement of remote sensing technology which provides tree parameters economically in term of cost and time saving over large forest area is in demand. The intent of this study is to map the distribution of Shorea tree species in the Ampang Forest Reserve using information extracted from Worldview-2 and LiDAR datasets. The pan-sharpening Worldview-2 imagery was used to classify the tropical trees using the support vector machine (SVM) image classification method. The overall classification accuracy for SVM method was 90.28% and the individual accuracy for Shorea and mixed tree species ranges from 68.25% to 82.86%. Finally, the classified result was overlaid with tree height information extracted from LiDAR data and forming the 3D distribution of Shorea tree species in the dense tropical forest area.

AB  - The increased importance of the religious factor, which influences various aspects of social life, has made it relevant for current academic research. The interrelation of this factor with the political history of Russia makes it one of the most complex and priority areas in the confessional policy of the State, and provokes the rethinking of Russia's policy in the national regions. The issues related to the relationship between official authorities and Orthodox organizations in polyconfessional regions with a predominance of Muslim populations, particularly in Dagestan are of particular interest for us. The absence of historical interpretations on the history of Orthodox organizations in the transitional and post-Soviet periods makes the stated subject topical for identifying and introducing into scientific circulation a specific material that regional studies can provide. Proceeding from the above, in the proposed paper for the first time in regional historiography we've made an attempt to consider the transformation processes in the socio-political situation in the country during the transitional and first decade of the post-Soviet period (1985-1997) and their influence on the development of the Orthodox religion, Christian believers and clergy in Dagestan.We've made conclusion about the latent process of religious orthodox revival in the republic against the background of the general spiritual crisis in the country during the transitional period of history, conditioned by the continuing policy of "state atheism". Atheistic worldview of governing bodies often influenced the process of building relationships with religious organizations and was characterized as "ambiguous". Religious renaissance in the first half of the 1990s in Dagestan had its own local features, due to the deterioration of the socio-political background of the republic and was accompanied by factors that adversely affect the position of Orthodoxy here.Authots' contribution: O.B. Khalidova is responsible for the idea, literature review, data interpretation, paper compilation and edition; G.F. Gebekov has carried out the analysis and intepretation of sociological poll data.

AB  - In agricultural practices, it is very essential to monitor crops phenological pattern over the time to manage agronomic activities such as irrigation, weed control, pest control, fertilization, drainage system etc. From the past decade, due to free availability of data and large coverage area, satellite based remote sensing has been most popular and widely used among other techniques such as physical ground surveys, ground based sensors and aerial based remote sensing. Sentinel-2 is European based satellite equipped with the state of the art multispectral imager which offers high spectral resolution (13-spectral bands), high spatial resolution (up to 10m pixel(-1)) and good temporal resolution (6 to 10days). Considering these features, time series of multispectral images of sentinel-2 has been used to establish temporal pattern of spectral vegetation indices (i.e. NDVI, SAVI, EVI, RVI) of crops to monitor the phenological behavior over time. In addition, the influence of various atmospheric variables (such as temperature in the air and precipitation) on the derived spectral vegetation indices has also been investigated in this work. Land use and coverage area frame survey (LUCAS-2015) has been used as ground reference data for this study. This study shows that by using sentinel-2, understanding relation between atmospheric conditions and crops phenological behavior can be useful to manage agricultural activities.

AB  - For maize crop, biophysical parameters such as canopy height and above ground biomass are the crucial agro-ecological indicator that can be used to describe the crop growth, photosynthetic efficiency and carbon stock. Remote sensing is widely used approach and most appropriate source in terms of area coverage that can be used to monitor vegetative conditions over the large area. In this study, sentinel-2 multispectral imagery is used to calculate spectral vegetation indices over the different maize growth period using some visible bands including near infrared spectrum. The relationship has been established and analyzed between maize biophysical variables (height of the canopy and above ground biomass) collected during the field measurements and derived spectral vegetation indices using simple linear regression and pearson correlation to exploit the possibility of using satellite imagery for estimation of crop biophysical parameters.

AB  - Italy is considered one of the developed country in the field of agriculture in Europe. For many reasons, reliable classification of crops and mapping plays an important role in Precision Agriculture (PA). Increasing availability, improving spatial resolution and high revisit time of sentinel-2 satellite become more useful and play an important role in analyses for land cover, crop classification and other remote sensing applications. Most of the Crops with similar spectral characteristics can be distinguished by accumulating spectral information of different phenological stages. In literature, many solutions have been proposed to classify crops using multitemporal images acquired from various satellites equipped with multispectral imagery sensors. However, features and images selection from multispectral, multitemporal images still needs improvement. In this paper, crops phenological cycles are investigated using temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) patterns and major crop phenological information are used to select best multitemporal images for the input of random forest (RF) classifier to classify land cover and crops.

M3  - Article
AB  - The adverse effects of the weed flora on the agricultural yield are well documented. In an agro-ecosystem, weed species distribution pattern depends on both surrounding environment and farming practices. This first ever study was designed to compare and determine the weed species richness, distribution pattern and their ecologically meaningful groups in wheat and maize field of Gujrat, Pakistan. In this study, seasonal variation variable and satellite derived measurements like normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) and topographic wetness index (TWI) were calculated for each vegetation sample and their contribution towards explaining variations in the weed species data was tested by using direct unimodal ordination method. Phytosociological data was collected from 50 crop fields (25 each from wheat and maize fields during winter and monsoon season respectively) comprising of 250 sub-samples/plots (size 1 x 1 m) during 2016. The results of Monte Carlo testing and cluster analysis showed that there were four statistically significant weeds groups (i.e. 1. Anagallis-Medicago-Phalaris or AMP-Wheat weed group; 2. Chenopodium-Convolvulus-Vicia or CCV-Wheat weed group; 3. Cyperus Halva-Amaranthus or CMA-Maize weed group; 4. Cannabis-Cynodon-Digera or CCD-Maize weed group). A total of 60 weed species were recorded and the majority of them belongs to Poaceae and Amaranthaceae families. The majority of weed species flowered during monsoon season whereas therophytic life form and microphyllous leaf size categories were the most dominant The highest mean weed diversity, NDVI and NDMI values were recorded for the weed communities of maize fields whereas the higher mean TWI value was recorded for the weed groups of wheat fields, suggesting strong linkage with the local climatic conditions. Canonical correspondence analysis (net effects) suggested that sum of local climatic conditions (seasonality variable) was found to be the most important in controlling the variations in the weed species data followed by longitude and altitude variables and least by the NDVI, NDMI and TWI. It is concluded that effective weed management activities are required to enhance the yield of these two important crops in the area. Thus, further studies related to determination of weed types and their distribution pattern by using factors like fertilization (type, timing, quantity), wheat and maize cultivar, land preparation (types, timing and intensities), soil management, pesticides (usage, type, quantity, quality), irrigation (type like rain-fed, tube-well, canals; timing, quantity), socio-economic and anthropogenic activities, and their relationship with the yield variable on temporal and spatial scales are recommended for this agro-ecosystem of the study area.

TI  - Synthetic GNSS spoofing data generation using field recorded signals
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increase in GNSS user base, the studies of threats and vulnerabilities of GNSS system are also increased. Among the threats, spoofing is of particular interest because of the risk associated with it. The studies on spoofing are generally limited to simulated scenarios as the real world spoofing attack is very difficult to create or spot and record for analysis. This paper presents a method of generating baseband spoofing data using real world signals by simultaneous recordings of GNSS signals using two separate receivers, where one of them simulates the receiver under attack and the other simulates the response the spoofer will be going to produce to fabricate the attack. After taking the records and merging them to create the spoofing baseband signals, it is checked against several spoofing detection methods to verify the valid spoofing attack being present in the signal. This method produces the signal recordings that have real world disturbances in it that may be difficult to simulate.The developed method has the following advantages:It does not require very expensive hardware to produce an intermediate spoofing signal.The user has control over the spoofing power advantage.The same scenario can be reproduced with varying parameters.

AB  - Muhgal court played a dynamic role in the pursuit of knowledge and investigation in medieval India. Science and Technology was also a major preoccupation for the lndo-Persian intelligentsia and there existed a public space for the scientific enquiry' and research. India, over the centuries had borrowed extensively from, and contributed generously to the scientific and technical knowledge of neighbouring regions, from the Middle East and Central Asia to China and Southeast Asia. Therefore, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the encounter between the modern European science and its counterpart was not one of simple conquest and diffusion from the West to the East. Rather an intellectual engagement with new ideas was inevitable which need to be appreciated in a proper historical perspective.

TI  - Weak population structure and no genetic erosion in Pilosocereus aureispinus: A microendemic and threatened cactus species from eastern Brazil
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Succulent cacti (Cactaceae) are among the most threatened taxonomic groups assessed to date. Here we evaluated the genetic diversity and population structure of a narrow endemic columnar cactus Pilosocereus aureispinus. This species is only found in a small area of c. 300 km2 of rocky savanna from eastern Brazil and it is currently classified as vulnerable (VU) on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. Eight microsatellite loci were genotyped for 91 individuals from four localities of the known P. aureispinus range. In contrast with expectations for narrow endemic species, we found relatively high levels of genetic diversity (e.g., HE = 0.390 to 0.525; HO = 0.394 to 0.572) and very low population structure based on the variation of six loci. All the analyzed individuals were clustered in one unique genetic group in assignment tests. We also generated the sequences of two plastid markers (trnT-trnL and psbD-trnT) and found no variation on a subsample of 39 individuals. We used Landsat 8 images and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to estimate a potential extent of occurrence of c. 750 km2 for this species. Our results showed that P. aureispinus is not suffering from erosion of nuclear genetic variability due to its narrow distribution. However, we advocate that because of the extremely limited extent of occurrence, the ongoing anthropogenic disturbances in its habitat, and phylogenetic distinctiveness of P. aureispinus, this species should be classified as endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List.

TI  - Mapping MODIS LST NDVI Imagery for Drought Monitoring in Punjab Pakistan
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - A near-real-time drought monitoring approach termed as vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) and a geospatial near-real-time coupling (NRTC) approach were applied to investigate drought over the great plain of Punjab, Pakistan. We identified the warm edges (LSTmax) and cold edges (LSTmin) as well as determined and validated the drought on a time series (2003-2008) of satellite EOS's MODIS-Aqua data products. We assessed six years of drought conditions during the winter-wheat-growing seasons and determined the effects of the record-breaking drought during 1998-2002 and its impact on the 2003-2008 periods. The VTCI drought monitoring approach is based on the integration of the normalized difference vegetation index and land surface temperature for comprehensive coverage of current drought and edges determination. The geospatial NRTC approach, which utilizes the VTCI imagery and daily precipitation data, was used for the validation of drought over five weather stations. It was established that the VTCI result has a higher correlation coefficient (r) with cumulative precipitation (r = 0.88) in the winter, during the six-year period of the Julian day of year (D-041), whereas the D-169 correlation was found to be negative in the summer, as the thermal boundaries gradually increases, which indicate the seasons and time of the days. The drift finding indicates that the VTCI not only achieves results that are very close to the recent precipitation anomaly but also correlates on the past precipitation. This analysis shows the good sensitivity of the VTCI to soil moisture and precipitation in agricultural areas. Our results suggest the capability of the VTCI for near-real-time drought monitoring as a better indicator of vegetation and thermal conditions over the regions in both rainfed and irrigated covenant areas.

TI  - The Image of the Camel in V. Khlebnikov's Kalmyk Theme
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the image of the camel in V. Khlebnikov's Kalmyk theme in its relation to his poetic worldview. Khlebnikov's poetic recollections of 1909 are a manifestation of Kalmyk elements in his works. While the autobiographic poem depicts the image of the camel as a symbol of his steppe birth-place, the poems Zverinets (Menagerie, 1909, 1911), Khadzhi-Tarkhan (1913), and S Utroboy Mednoyu. (The One with a Copper Womb., 1921) represent this bestiary image in wider and deeper perspectives - cosmological, geopolitical, mythopoetic, sacral, and philosophical ones, determined by the Turko-Mongolian beliefs where the camel acts as a solar deity. In the geopolitical context, the camel is placed in the Kalmyk and Astrakhan steppes. The connection of the image with the Kalmyk (Mongolian) component is also associated with the name of Genghis Khan's descendant, as well as with India where Buddhism first appeared, and also with Buddhist books, Buddhist philosophy and the related idea of reincarnation of sentient beings, with the migration of the Kalmyks' ancestors from Northwest China to the Russian Empire. The poet's aetiological mythopoetics proclaims some close ties between animals and religions, manifests a spiritual unity of the Orient and the West. This interconnection between human and animal worlds is determined by Khlebnikov's concept of unity of micro-and macrocosm. Thus, the image of the camel in Khlebnikov's Kalmyk theme facilitates the understanding of the idea of the forthcoming unity of peoples and countries, and their faiths (see the poem Edinaya Kniga, i.e. The Universal Book).

TI  - Multi-scale assessment of invasive plant species diversity using Pleiades 1A, RapidEye and Landsat-8 data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We used a full remote sensing-based approach to assess plant species diversity in large and inaccessible areas affected by Lantana camara L., a common invasive species within the deciduous forests of Western Himalayan region of India, using spectral heterogeneity information extracted from optical data. The spread of L. camara was precisely mapped by Pleiades 1A data, followed by comparing Pleiades 1A, RapidEye and Landsat-8 OLI - assessed plant species diversities in invaded areas. The single plant species analysis was improved by Pleiades 1A-based diversity analysis, and higher species diversity values were observed for mixed vegetation cover. Furthermore, lower Coefficient of Variation and Renyi diversity values were observed where L. camara was the only species, while higher variations were observed in areas with a mixed spectral reflectance. This study was concluded to add a crucial baseline to the previous studies on remote sensing-based solutions for rapid estimation of biodiversity attributes.

TI  - Geospatial assessment of the Mokra Sura river ecological condition using remote sensing and <i>in situ</i> monitoring data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing methods for environmental monitoring of the surface water quality is proved. Regression relationships are consistent with ground-based measurements at sampling sites in water bodies and are an effective tool for assessing the ecological status of water bodies. The state of the water bodies of the Mokra Sura river basin varies considerably. The best is the water quality in the upper part of the Mokra Sura river, the worst - in the middle and lower parts. The factors of water pollution are discharges of not enough treated wastewater of industrial enterprises of the Kamyans'koy and Dniprovs'koy industrial agglomeration. The purpose of our search included the following tasks: (a) calculation of integrated environmental water quality indices; b) obtaining satellite information, processing of multispectral satellite images of water bodies using appropriate applied software techniques; c) establishment of statistical dependencies between water quality indexes obtained for biotopically space images and data of actual in situ measurements. The results of systematic hydrochemical control of the Mokra Sura river basin from 2007 to 2011 years were initial data in 4 control areas located in the Dnipropetrovsk region: 1 - the Sursko-Litovske village; 2 - the Bratske village; 3 - the Novomykolayvka village; 4 - the Novooleksandryvka village. Environmental assessment of the water quality of the Mokra Sura river within the Dnipropetrovsk region was based on the calculation the integrated environmental index (IEI). Priority pollutants in this case are oil products and ions SO42- , Mg (2+) , Zn (2+) , Cr (6+) .Two images with a difference in three years in April 2015 and May 2017 were used to determine the current changes in the land cover of the study area. Geomorphological assessment of the water network of the Morka Sura river was performed using satellite radar interferometry. Multispectral images of Landsat 5/TM (2007-2011) and Sentinel 2B/MSI (2017) satellite systems were used for remote assessment of water bodies in the study area of the Mokra Sura river basin. The multispectral index TCW (Tasseled Cap Wetness) was used to measure the spectral reflection of the aquatic environment along of the Mokra Sura river flow. The main advantage of the studies is a demonstration of remote sensing capabilities to estimate Mokra Sura river ecological status not only in individual sites, but also throughout the flow - from source to mouth. Follow the necessity to use water from the Mokra Sura river for irrigation, the level of soil water erosion can only increase and enhance the negative processes of eutrophication of reservoirs. Long term technogenic pollution requires information about the state of surface water of fishery, drinking and municipal water use facilities as an integral part of the aquatic ecosystem, the habitat of aquatic organisms and as a resource of drinking water supply. Over 80% of the Mokra Sura river basin surface (IEI 4-12) belong to the classes with the assessment of dirty, very and extremely dirty. The results of studies using remote sensing indicate the need to reduce the streams of not enough treated wastewater to the the Mokra Sura river. The obtained data can be used for ecological assessment of the current and retrospective state of water bodies, development of forecasts of rivers pollution.

TI  - TRANSLATION PECULIARITIES OF COMPARATIVE CONSTRUCTIONS IN LITERARY WORKSTEAL
T2  - IIOAB JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the translation peculiarities of comparative constructions in literary works. It offers various methods of full-fledged translation of such constructions, based on their semantics and functional features. The main way to represent comparisons in simple and complex sentences in Tatar language is to use postpositions. The meanings of these postpositions in Russian translation can be transferred by conjunctions, the instrumental case of nouns, etc. The analysis of translation of comparative constructions helps to identify the integral and the differential in the semantics and functioning of the conjunctions, which not only connect the components of the comparative constructions, but also create imagery. We used the following methods of linguistic analysis in the work: generalization and systematization, analytical, descriptive, comparative methods, etc. The singularity of comparative constructions in the Tatar and Russian languages is influenced by such factors as different mindset, intellectual heritage, worldview, historical development of the ethnos, their national culture and habitat. The presence of similar comparative constructions in the languages compared is due to the universality of human thinking, the common history and territory of residence. Analyzing translation of literary texts, functional and semantic correspondences can be revealed: comparative postpositions such as kebek, syman, k gamma k, etc. and comparative conjunctions such as slovno, tochno, kak budto, etc. (eng. like, as if, kind of); relative pair words in the Tatar language and correlative pairs in Russian; affixes of adverbs -cha/-ch partial derivative, -daj/-d partial derivative j in Tatar and the instrumental case of nouns in Russian. It is impossible to establish strictly defined correspondences among certain connecting words in comparative constructions, since these postpositions and conjunctions do not differ significantly in terms of nuances in meaning. The conducted research has practical relevance, since the results contribute to the study of the worldview of two ethnic groups.

TI  - Lithological Mapping of Sedimentary Rocks in Southern Laki Range, Lower Indus Basin Using Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - Sindh University Research Journal -Science Series
M3  - Article
AB  - Lithological mapping of rocks by using Landsat7 Images is carried out in Thano Bula Khan area in southern Indus Basin. The area is mainly composed of various sedimentary rocks of various formations are well exposed in Thano Bula Khan area. The areas composed of the exposed different geologically formations include Dada Conglomerate, Manchar Fm, Gaj Fm, Nari Fm, Tiyon Fm and Laki Fm. To process data, we used band rationing technique such as false color composite band ratio for identifying lithological features of the study area. Our processed data revealed the exposed formations of sedimentary rocks in the study area. The Landsat7 Satellite imagery is proved to be very useful in discriminating the lithology of various formations of the selected area. The data band ratio pairs (5/7, 5/4, 3/1) as well as RGB composite images (4/5, 5/7, 7/5) and (5/7, 3/1, 4/3) played an important role in discriminating different formations of sedimentary rocks in the area. The method using ratios of color band is significant approach for the study of different types of rocks as well as for the identification of minerals.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Selecting an appropriate time to acquire imagery for land-cover classification can have a substantial effect on classification accuracy. In this research, multi-temporal analysis of six Landsat images for binary impervious surface classification was conducted to investigate whether specific image dates (beyond simply leaf on/off) have a significant effect on impervious surface classification. We further examined the image date effects across training data sample sizes and classification algorithms. In terms of single time classification, the selection of an appropriate image time had the largest effect on the accuracy with a range of 7% to 10% between the most and least accurate classifications. The greenness transitional time between leaf off and leaf on (May images for our site) offered the highest performance. With multi-temporal images, an additional improvement in classification accuracy, up to 2.4%, was achieved when compared to the best single-time classification, when an advanced classifier (Support Vector Machine) was used. In addition, using all six available images with a reference data sample size as small as 150 pixels, classification accuracy was higher than that of many single-time classifications with substantially larger calibration data sample size. Our study suggests that there is considerable variability in classification accuracy of multi-temporal imagery and image dates should be carefully considered, beyond a general leaf on/off rule. Further testing should be conducted in other sites to identify optimal image dates.

AB  - This study presents an integrated model based on cellular automata for assessing and simulating land use/cover changes and their impact on the environment. Satellite images from Landsat TM and ETM + sensors from the time period of 1985 to 2014 were applied. Seven static and five dynamic variables were applied. These included elevation, slope, aspect, soil salinity, soil texture, distance from rivers, and roads, and distance from the five classes of land use. The model was validated by a fuzzy reciprocal similarity method. The results showed that this model is suitable for simulating changes in periods of less than 15 years and patches with areas greater than 25 hectares. The model was run for 15 years, beginning with the year 2014. The results for the study area predict that settlement areas will expand; agricultural land, rangeland and barren areas will decline; and forests will remain unchanged until 2029.

TI  - Validation of MODIS and AHI Observed Water Cloud Properties Using Surface Radiation Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study implements long-term surface observed radiation data (pyranometer observed global flux and sky radiometer observed spectral zenith transmittance data) of multiple SKYNET sites to validate water cloud optical properties (cloud optical depth COD and effective radius Re) observed from space by MODIS onboard TERRA and AQUA satellites and AHI onboard Himawari-8 satellite. Despite some degrees of differences in COD and Re between MODIS and AHI, they both showed common features when validated using surface based global flux data as well as cloud properties retrieved from sky radiometer observed zenith transmittance data. In general, CODs from both satellite sensors arc found to overestimated when clouds arc optically thin. Among a number of factors (spatial and temporal variations of cloud, sensor and solar zenith angles), the solar zenith angle (SZA) is found to have an impact on COD difference between reflectance based satellite sensor and transmittance based sky radiometer. The Re values from the sky radiometer and satellite sensor are generally poorly correlated. The difference in Re between the sky radiometer and satellite sensor is negatively correlated with COD difference between them, which is likely due to the inherent influence of Re retrieval precision on COD retrieval and vice versa in transmittance based sky radiometer.

AB  - Determination of the vegetation coverage (VC) plays an important role in different aspects of watershed management. Remote sensing products can provide estimates of VC; however, the uncertainty of the data acquisition and processing has always challenged the usability of spaceborne imagery data. In this study, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) products used to model VC of three basins: Lower Fox (LF) in Wisconsin, Lower East Fork White (LEFW) in Indiana, and Lower San Joaquin River (LSJR) in California. MODIS MOD13Q1 product is used to obtain VC based on enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). However, the commonly used threshold value of 0.4, used to differentiate vegetated from non-vegetated areas, does not necessarily yield to accurate estimates when compared to the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). A statistical criterion-determined based on probability distributions of VC-used to filter pixels with low vegetation index (VI) values during the time of peak-vegetation as non-vegetated. The same approach implemented to determine vegetated areas during the low-vegetation season. These pixels were left out of analysis-regardless of the VI value-and their VC condition was determined based on the group of filtered data they belong to. Then, VC was calculated for the remaining pixels and results were integrated with those of the filtered areas. Application of the suggested technique improved VC estimations. The errors of VC estimations based on NLCD-VI comparison were reduced by 0%, 3%, and 33% for EVI and 17%, 6%, and 2% for NDVI in LF, LEFW, and LSJR basins, respectively.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - In this paper, we shall describe a statistical approach for land change detection and extraction based on multivariate alteration detection (MAD) transformation combined with three thresholding methods. Unlike the most other multivariate change detection techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), the MAD analysis is invariant to linear and affine transformations of the input data. Consequently, it is insensitive to linear differences in atmospheric conditions or sensor calibrations of multitemporal acquisitions. Statistical thresholding methods which are based on 1) an Ad-hoc thresholding test, 2) Chi-2 thresholding test and, 3) ChiMerge thresholding test are applied to extract changes detected by means of MAD transformation. A case study with SPOT-HRV bitemporal and multispectral images before and after a flood event occurred in November 2000 over Gloucester (UK) region shows the efficiency and robustness of MAD/ChiMerge change detection scheme compared to MAD/Ad-hoc and MAD/Chi-2 schemes. A comparison of extracted change objects is also carried out according to the ground truth of the study zone.

TI  - Object-oriented satellite image time series analysis using a graph-based representation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, remote sensing technologies produce huge amounts of satellite images that can be helpful to monitor geographical areas over time. A satellite image time series (SITS) usually contains spatio-temporal phenomena that are complex and difficult to understand. Conceiving new data mining tools for SITS analysis is challenging since we need to simultaneously manage the spatial and the temporal dimensions at the same time. In this work, we propose a new clustering framework specifically designed for SITS data. Our method firstly detects spatio-temporal entities, then it characterizes their evolutions by mean of a graph-based representation, and finally it produces clusters of spatio-temporal entities sharing similar temporal behaviors. Unlike previous approaches, which mainly work at pixel-level, our framework exploits a purely object-based representation to perform the clustering task. Object-based analysis involves a segmentation step where segments (objects) are extracted from an image and constitute the element of analysis. We experimentally validate our method on two real world SITS datasets by comparing it with standard techniques employed in remote sensing analysis. We also use a qualitative analysis to highlight the interpretability of the results obtained.

TI  - Confessional State Policy of Alexander I
T2  - BYLYE GODY
M3  - Article
AB  - Freedom of religion is considered a fundamental human right in the modern world. In Russia, this right has arisen long time ago, but earlier it was significantly different in content from the modern one. Moreover, it had its specifics in different eras. Confessional policy is a part of the state policy, which under the conditions of the absolute monarchy largely depended on the views of the head of state.Public policy of Alexander I, including the policy on issues of religion, bear the imprint of the distinctive worldview of the Emperor and of the political background of that time: the revolution in France and the Patriotic war of 1812, which caused some changes in the further development of society and law.Based on the study of legislative acts adopted during the reign of Alexander I and some legislative acts of his predecessors, as well as taking into account new theoretical and methodological approaches, the article deals with the development of state policy on religious issues in Russia in the period from 1801 to 1825.The article uses normative legal acts on religious matters adopted during the period under review, the opinions of scholars and public figures of the past in relation to the content of these acts, as well as the opinions of modern researchers. The results of the state policy pursued by Alexander I were discussed, the main characteristic features of his state confessional policy, its principles and objectives were highlighted.The paper presents previously unpublished data from the State archives of the Saratov region.

TI  - LINGUISTIC REPRESENTATION OF A PERCEPTUAL IMAGE <i>THUNDERSTORM</i> IN BL PASTERNAK'S POETIC WORKS
T2  - CURRENT ISSUES OF THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE TEACHING XIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Scientific Conference on Current Issues of the Russian Language Teaching XIII
CL  - Brno, CZECH REPUBLIC
AB  - The analysis of linguistic means of verbalization of a perceptual image thunderstorm in B.L. Pasternak's poetic works is presented in the article. Primary focus is on text production potentialities of the studied perceptual units and author's individual features of the poet's imagery.In the context of the offered research the perceptual imagery is considered as a subordinate concept in relation to a verbal imagery. The bases for separating of perceptual units is their ability "to create" a perceptual imagery (the esthetic basis) and "to mark" a perception proposition in the text (a proposition as linguistic model of a situation) (the semantic basis).Study material is original poems written by B.L. Pasternak in which contexts with semantics of thunderstorm were revealed by the continuous sampling method. In the course of work methods of the semantic and contextual analysis, elements of the linguistic and stylistic analysis of the literary text were also used.The image of a thunderstorm belongs to the brightest and significant perceptual images which are found in B.L. Pasternak's poetry - there are also nightingale, lilac, candle, kiss, etc. - and it is a complex image, along with such as rain, city, garden, tears, sobbing, etc. In the course of verbalization of a perceptual image of a thunderstorm such expressive means as metaphors, embodiments, comparisons are used.The perceptual image of a thunderstorm passes through the entire periods of B.L. Pasternak's poetic work and is represented by means of various linguistic levels (phonetic, lexical, syntactic). It is polyphonical and connected with rough manifestation of spontaneous vital forces. At the same time the image of a thunderstorm occurs in later poems less often because of its tonality of composure, clarity and acceptance of the world.

TI  - L'HOMME AS A CORNERSTONE OF DESCARTES' ANTHROPOLOGY
T2  - STUDIA WARMINSKIE
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the authors, in the current research on the legacy of Descartes, the significance of the text left by Descartes in the form of an unfinished text L'Honutte has not yet been sufficiently appreciated. The analysis of this dissertation makes it possible to see that for Descartes, which this philosopher expressed especially in the early period of his activity, the worldview issues were of priority, and in particular the understanding of man and his place in reality. On the basis of the analyzes carried out, the authors conclude that in all of Descartes' work, even those that do not directly refer to anthropological issues and raise physics issues, there is a vision of the man Descartes sketched in L'Hontm.e.

TI  - The Modernity of Nikolai Popov: Novelty of Music - Novelty of his World View
T2  - PROBLEMY MUZYKALNOI NAUKI-MUSIC SCHOLARSHIP
M3  - Article
AB  - Nikolai Popov is a talented Russian composer of the younger generation, whose music is regularly performed in his native country and in other countries. His worldview combines together the most ancient and the most contemporary parameters. The objects of his philosophical and musical thinking are the cosmos, the physical sound of the world, and in the sphere of human history -antiquity and new technologies. His musical language synthesizes classical instrumental timbres with electronic sounds, as well as with video footage. Popov was born in Bashkortostan, graduated from the Moscow Conservatory, participated in the master-classes of many innovative composers from outside of Russia. He created video-musical multimedia compositions in collaboration with several video-artists. Especially noteworthy are his compositions from 2013 - "The Song of Uldra," writted in collaboration with Andrew Quinn and Alena Skornyakova, based on Scandinavian folklore, "Artra," written in collaboration of Todor Pozarew and Andrew Quinn with a quotation from the "Danses des adolescentes" from Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring" heard on a disc of the spacecraft Voyager, "Nibiru 20/13" together with Skornyakova and Quinn, based on motives from Sumerian-Acadian mythology. For the most part finding solutions to the issue of correlation of the audio and the visual effects, Popov also admits pure sounds without video footage in some of his compositions. Such is one of the versions of his composition "The Song of Uldra," as well as his early compositions for bayan, strings and percussion. The emotional "message" to the listener provides a specially important component for him.

TI  - From Terror to Transcendence: Death Reflection Promotes Preferences for Human Drama
T2  - MEDIA PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies that examined the impact of death awareness on entertainment gratifications have used mortality salience. The present study introduces a more personal form of mortality priming called death reflection, which simulates near-death experiences. Compared to mortality salience, death reflection is a competing manipulation that has been found to promote positive outcomes, including improved self-perceptions, rather than worldview defense and self-esteem motives. A between-subjects online experiment (N = 108) was designed to test the main effects of two different death primes on emotional valence and arousal, meaningful affect, and genre preferences for sad drama and comedy. Results show that death reflection was distinct from mortality salience in its capacity to produce greater arousal and interest in watching sad drama. Furthermore, mediation analyses using structural equation modeling show indirect effects of death reflection on interest in sad drama through emotional intensity and self-perceptual depth as mediators. Death reflection as a mortality reminder is arguably more compatible with a key function of somber entertainment, including dramas and tragedies, which is to facilitate human insights and personal growth.

M3  - Data study
AB  - Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is a major cause of blindness worldwide. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) followed by replication in a combined total of 10,503 PACG cases and 29,567 controls drawn from 24 countries across Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. We observed significant evidence of disease association at five new genetic loci upon meta-analysis of all patient collections. These loci are at EPDR1 rs3816415 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.24, P = 5.94 * 10(-15)), CHAT rs1258267 (OR = 1.22, P = 2.85 * 10(-16)), GLIS3 rs736893 (OR = 1.18, P = 1.43 * 10(-14)), FERMT2 rs7494379 (OR = 1.14, P = 3.43 * 10(-11)), and DPM2-FAM102A rs3739821 (OR = 1.15, P = 8.32 * 10(-12)). We also confirmed significant association at three previously described loci (P < 5 * 10(-8) for each sentinel SNP at PLEKHA7, COL11A1, and PCMTD1-ST18), providing new insights into the biology of PACG.

M3  - Article
AB  - The first long-term Land Surface Temperature (LST) maps for the Peninsular Spain at annual and seasonal time scales for 1981-2015 is presented in this work. A robust protocol for correcting and calibrating NOAA-AVHRR images and computing LST datasets at the spatial resolution of 1.1km has been used. Simultaneously, maximum air temperature (Tmax) maps at the same spatial resolution have been produced using data from meteorological stations. The comparison between the two datasets resulted in statistically significant spatial correlations at annual and seasonal scales. Finally, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data were also compared with the obtained LST datasets and the results showed significant negative correlations between the two variables, especially in summer.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to determine what factors affect LST. To accomplish this research purpose, I selected Mt. Uam and its surrounding area in Cheongju City, Chungcheongbuk-do, Korea as the study area and collected Landsat 8 data and DEM data for this area. First, LST, NDVI, NDBI, and NDWI were calculated using Landsat 8 data. Elevation value and Aspect value were extracted by using DEM data. Simple linear regression analysis and multiple linear regression analysis were performed to investigate the effects of NDVI, NDBI, NDWI, Elevation, and Aspect on LST. As a result of the analysis, it was confirmed that all variables included in the regression model affected LST. Especially, NDBI and Elevation have a strong influence on LST. However, NDBI has a positive impact on LST, while Elevation has a negative effect on LST. Thus, the direction of influence of the two variables was confirmed to be different. NDWI, Aspect, and NDVI also affected LST, but the magnitude of impact was not as large as that of NDBI or Elevation.

AB  - Despite the rapid expansion of satellite images supply, the application of imagery is often restricted due to unautomated image processing. This paper presents the automated process for the selection of training areas which are essential to conducting supervised image classification. The training areas were selected based on the prior and cover information. After the selection, the training data were used to classify land cover in an urban area with the latest image and the classification accuracy was valuated. The automatic selection of training area was processed with following steps, 1) to redraw inner areas of prior land cover polygon with negative buffer (-15m) 2) to select the polygons with proper size of area (2,000 ~200,000㎡) 3) to calculate the mean and standard deviation of reflectance and NDVI of the polygons 4) to select the polygons having characteristic mean value of each land cover type with minimum standard deviation. The supervised image classification was conducted using the automatically selected training data with Sentinel-2 images in 2017. The accuracy of land cover classification was 86.9% ( = 0.81). The result shows that the process of automatic selection is effective in image processing and able to contribute to solving the bottleneck in the application of imagery.

AB  - Earth observation satellite imaging is considered as an excellent tool to extract the Earth's surface information. Forest fire burnt scars are a spectacular problem for land surface analysis. Fire burnt scar mapping is very important to be able to identify these areas. The damage assessment is necessary for fire management planning. This paper presents the algorithm for forest fire burnt scar coverage assessment using Normalized Burn Rate, and image classification based on mathematical morphology of Landsat-8 satellite images. The objective is to accurately determine the area of forest fire burnt scar in the optical satellite images, which is improved from the existing algorithms. In addition, a comparison of the Normalized Burn Rate before versus after the fire in the analyzed area has been studied. Also, a comparison of the proposed algorithm and the shape file from the operation team has been discussed in this paper.

AB  - This study is a study to investigate montage and its world view as literary methodology. The montage is an artistic technique that appeared in the early 20th century. In order to explain the world view of the montage, we have examined the worldview of the organic world and the worldview that the metaphor implies. saw. The organic world view seeks a harmonious world. The world view of the traditional metaphor is to reconcile the two worlds with differences based on commonality and difference. The traditional metaphor seeks to understand the abstract through the concrete world experienced. Thus, the worldview of metaphors is based on reconciliation and integration, which is an inherent property of human beings. The montage, on the other hand, cuts out the world of organicity and unity, and exposes the fragmented world in the process of compilation. Montage is highly related to the development of technical civilization. The modern industrial society that emerged after the Industrial Revolution collapsed the traditional poetry and space. The montage brings emotional effects to the readers and audiences by bringing together the fragmented poems, spaces and objects of modern society brought about by capitalism and industrialization, to make the modern impression and the meaning behind it. Montage is closely related to reality reflection. The montage of the poetry of modernism in the 1980s was strong in the experimental aspect to dismantle the existing literary system, grammar, social history and power. The 21st century, on the other hand, shows a world of pluralism and hybridity. The montage of the 21st century poem shows the self-fragmentation phenomenon and anxiety of the modern man and shows a mixture of virtual reality and reality. In addition, modern city of the 21st century does not consciously and intention of disassembly and crack. The media of the 21st century, based on computers and the Internet, is completely different from the aesthetics of the 20th century. The aesthetics of disharmony that have been seen in the montage aesthetics of modern art are naturalized and infiltrate users. This montage is different from the natural organism and is closer to the mix than the classical unity.

AB  - The study sought to establish the political character of Hwang Ji-woo through his connection with the perception of reality shown in Hwang's prose book, 『사람과 사람 사이의 신호』 and with the key creative techniques featured in the poem. The montage is an aesthetic method to reveal the modern society through the form of recombination, recognizing that the organic and holistic worldview that classical aesthetics seeks to pursue is no longer able to express modern society. Hwang Ji-woo expressed the political implications with a literary device such as a montage. Hwang Ji - woo 's politics is politics as literary counter - discourse, and he tried to update grammar such as sentimentalism which was pointed out as limit of existing poetry poem through montage technique. Hwang Ji-woo's montage technique is to reveal the world of objectivity as a way of 'disharmony' by eliminating subjectivity. The poem as 'exercise literature', which Hwang Ji-woo thinks ideally, shows the people's life in detail and at the same time it is neither hard nor overwhelming to Patos. Hwang Ji-woo's montage technique is intended to show uncritical acceptance of the insensitivity and everyday life of the subdued people. At this time, Hwang Ji-woo brings ordinary texts called "poetic things" into the city. It is a device that recalls the insensitivity of everyday life and draws the awareness of the reader. The politics of Hwang Jiwoo Literary is in stripping away the concealed reality that 'silence' does not reveal, and this intention is revealed as a montage technique that superimposes scenes of real and conflicting reality into the space of text.

T2  - ANNALS OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Esophageal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Surgery plays an important role in the treatment strategies for esophageal cancer. Recent advances in surgical techniques and perioperative management have dramatically improved the mortality rate; however, esophagectomy remains a highly invasive procedure that can lead to severe postoperative complications. Future advances in thoracoscopic surgery with the development of surgical endoscopy systems such as three-dimensional (3D) imaging systems with a 4K ultra high-definition camera or two-dimensional (2D) imaging systems with an 8K camera, which is expected to provide 3D-like visual sensation, will enable us to further understand the microscopic anatomy of the thoracic cavity and mediastinum, and to perform delicate surgical procedures that enable minimally invasive esophagectomy with mediastinal lymphadenectomy. A robot-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy is attractive for surgeons and may be beneficial to esophageal cancer patients. Preoperative simulation and intraoperative real-time navigation are expected to further help surgeons safely perform esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy. Reduction of the lymphadenectomy field and setting of lymphadenectomy areas with highest priority may be feasible when sentinel node (SN) navigation is appropriately performed in cN0 early-stage esophageal cancer. These technical advances are expected to decrease the morbidity and mortality rate of surgery for esophageal cancer and hopefully improve oncological outcomes.

TI  - Understanding the LST (Land Surface Temperature) Effects of Urban-forests in Seoul, Korea
T2  - Journal of forest and environmental science
M3  - research-article
AB  - Urban development and population have augmented the increase of impervious land-cover. This phenomenon has amplified the effects of climate change and increasing urban island effects due to increases in urban temperatures. Seoul, South Korea is one of the largest metropolitan cities in the world. While land uses in Seoul vary, land cover patterns have not changed much (under 2%) in the past 10 years, making the city a prime target for studying the effects of land cover types on the urban temperature. This research seeks to generalize the urban temperature of Seoul through a series of statistical tests using multi-temporal remote sensing data focusing on multiple scales and typologies of green space to determine its overall effectiveness in reducing the urban heat. The distribution of LST values was reduced as the size of urban forests increased. It means that changing temperature of largescale green-spaces is less influenced because the broad distribution could be resulted in various external variables such as slope aspect, topographic height and density of planting areas, while small-scale urban forests are more affected from that. The largescalegreen spaces contributed significantly to lowering urban temperature by showing a similar mean LST value. Both of concentration and dispersal of urban forests affected the reduction of urban temperature. Therefore, the findings of this research support that creating urban forests in an urban region could reduce urban temperature regardless of the scale.

T2  - 영미어문학
M3  - research-article
AB  - This article examines maritime culture and rationality by comparing the mythic narratives of Odysseus and Seok Talhae, according to the theory of “dialectic of enlightenment”. The Odyssey by Homer records Odysseus’s voyage after the Trojan War. Similarly, according to Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa, Seok Talhae became king of Silla after a long and arduous sea voyage. These two epic heroes represent enlightenment and rationality, since both broke from the mythical veil of older cultures. As leaders who responded rationally, they launched a world where conquest through seafaring exploits was the main interest.This rational worldview can be traced back to the sea peoples, who first appeared in the 13th century BC. Both use cunning and deceit to win.Odysseus’s later murder proves that his adventure had “the seed of death” in it. This can be interpreted as a metaphor for our contemporary crisis.Unlike Odysseus, Seok Talhae became king by respecting the pre-existing order. Thus, that myth suggests a possible transformation to a civilization of coexistence and peace.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes an algorithm to retrieve the outgoing longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA OLR) using the advanced Himawari imager (AHI) unit that is a narrowband sensor installed in Himawari-8, a geostationary satellite providing window and water vapor imagery. The outgoing longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA OLR) was retrieved by an empirical method where a radiative transfer model (RTM) was used to simulate various atmospheric conditions, such as the surface temperature, water vapor, and cloud characteristics (e.g., cloud optical thickness and cloud height). The results of an algorithm using a single channel (OLR12.4) and two channels (OLR6.2+12.4) were converted into Terra Cloud and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) TOA OLR for the daytime (0105-0135 UTC) and nighttime (1325-1355 UTC) cases of a scene analysis (typhoon Goni on August 18, 2015). Long-term analysis (August 2015-July 2016) and statistical analysis (i.e., mean, bias, root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient) were conducted. The analysis results showed that the largest error was produced in the cloudy areas (overcast areas), and the minimum RMSE and a high correlation coefficient were observed over an ocean area. In the scene analysis, however, the daytime and nighttime average RMSE of the CERES TOA OLR and OLR6.2 + 12.4 was 12.21 Wm(-2) and showed the correlation coefficient of 0.971. It was an improved result over the RMSE (12.33 Wm(-2)) and correlation coefficient (0.967) shown in the analysis of OLR12 4. In the long-term analysis, the average RMSE was 11.83 Wm(-2) and showed a correlation coefficient of 0.972 (OLR12.4 showed 12.17 Wm(-2) and 0.969). Furthermore, to minimize the difference in the cloud area that had the largest error, the study analyzed TOA OLR at the significance level of 95% (+/- 2 RMSE). As a result, the scene analysis showed an RMSE of 10.54 Wm(-2) and correlation coefficient of 0.977, and the long-term data showed an RMSE of 10.23 Wm(-2) and correlation coefficient of 0.979.

AB  - Recently, National interest has been rising due to earthquakes in Gyeongju and Pohang, disasters caused by landslides, landslides, and sinkholes around construction sites, and damage caused by disasters. SAR is able to detect ground displacement in mm for wide area, collect data through satellite, predict timeliness of crustal change by time series analysis, and reduce disaster and disaster damage. The purpose of this study is to investigate the latest SAR interference analysis technique (SqueeSAR analysis technique) of Sentinel-1A satellite (SAR sensor) of European ESA for about 3 years by selecting the 1st landfill site in the metropolitan area in Incheon, The settlement amount was calculated in a time series. Especially, in order to examine the accuracy of the subsidence and subsidence tendency by the SqueeSAR analysis method, the ground level survey was compared and analyzed for the first time in Korea. Also, the tendency of the subsidence trend was predicted by analyzing the time series and correlation trend of the subsidence for three years. Through this study, it is expected that disaster prevention and disaster prevention such as sinkhole and landslide can be utilized from time series monitoring of crustal variation of the land.

T2  - PAIN RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. The pectoral nerve block type II (PECS II block) is widely used for postoperative analgesia after breast surgery. This study evaluated the analgesic efficacy of PECS II block in patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB). Methods. Patients were randomized to the control group (n = 40) and the PECS II group (n = 40). An ultrasound-guided PECS II block was performed after induction of anesthesia. The primary outcome measure was opioid consumption, and the secondary outcome was pain at the breast and axillary measured using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)24 hours after surgery. Opioid requirement was assessed according to tumor location. Results. Opioid requirement was lower in the PECS II than in the control group (43.8 +/- 28.5 g versus 77.0 +/- 41.9 g, p < 0.001). However, the frequency of rescue analgesics did not differ between these groups. Opioid consumption in the PECS II group was significantly lower in patients with tumors in the outer area than that in patients with tumors in the inner area (32.5 +/- 23.0 g versus 58.0 +/- 29.3 g, p = 0.007). The axillary NRS was consistently lower through 24 hr in the PECS II group. Conclusion. Although the PECS II block seemed to reduce pain intensity and opioid requirements for 24 h after BCS and SNB, these reductions may not be clinically significant. This trial is registered with Clinical Research Information Service KCT0002509.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to identify the long-term area changes in the subalpine coniferous forests in Korea as a basic step to understand the changes and decline in the subalpine forest ecosystems vulnerable to climate change. We analyzed time-series Landsat satellite images (mid 1990s, mid 2010s) for change detection of coniferous forest area in nationwide subalpine areas. As a result, the area of coniferous forests in the study sites decreased by 25% over last 20 years. The sites with the largest changes are Seoraksan, Baegunsan, Jirisan, and Hallasan. The site shown the largest decrease area was Baegunsan (reduced area: 542ha), and the site with the largest rate of decrease of clustered forest was Hallasan (rate of decrease: 33.3%). This national and long-term information on the change of coniferous forests in the subalpine region can be utilized as base data for the detailed survey of endangered subalpine coniferous trees in the future.

AB  - This paper examines how the sallim (daily life) texts received and accepted the idea of eco-naturology as a form of Taoist living during the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910). It deals with seon (仙), Taoist utopia or ideal human, which usually pursues the realm of transcendence far beyond this world, also finds its place in sallim, the daily life in Nature. The Chinese letter 仙 is composed of human (人) and mountain (山) meaning the person who lives in the mountain. The letter sok (俗) is composed of human (人) and valley (谷) meaning the person who lives in the valley. In this respect the synthetic word seon-sok (Taoist utopia-valley) meaning the Taoist and the valley lifes to be one unity becomes central in Taoist perspective of eco-naturology.The Book of Tao says, "The valley god is immortal." This god is the root of all the existence of heaven and earth. The valley-friendly view of Taoism became the basis of Korean world view derived from the eco-geographical condition of the peninsula of which two thirds is composed of mountains. In particular, Sallim geongje (Domestic Economy 1715) compiled by Hong Manseon (1643-1715) is the publication that signifies the establishment of the knowledge system of eco-naturology based on the Korean peninsula. This paper indicates that the purpose of Hong's compilation is to supply all the useful information for daily life in Nature. It emphasizes that this book of domestic economy, due to its practicality and organization, became the most broadly read book during the late Joseon period.The strong influence of Danhak worldview of Taoism which spread during the mid Joseon period is also evident in Sallim geongje. The second chapter "Healthy Living" is entirely devoted to the articles of Taoist practice. Such attention to Taoist health methodology is noteworthy especially considering the society under Neo-Confucian domination. People aspired to the philosophy of healthy long life achieved by overcoming disease and obtaining vitality, longevity, relaxation, and enjoyment.Additionally Taoist-oriented Sallim geongje is largely formulated by the quotes from Guseon sineunseo (Book of Mystic Quietude by Guseon) written by the Taoist master Zhu Quan (1378-1448) of early Ming China. This paper thus explores the intellectual exchanges between the two sallim books by examining the quotes in Sallim geongje and the list of contents of Guseon sineunseo. Furthermore, this paper examines the fact that during the mid and late Joseon period such intellectual exchanges contributed to the propagation of Taoist based knowledge of eco-naturology. In doing that people developed the mystic world view of peace in Nature, in which daily life and meditative quietude are not separate.

AB  - Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is a biomedical imaging method that can provide both structural and functional information of living tissues beyond the optical diffusion limit by combining the concepts of conventional optical and ultrasound imaging methods. Although endogenous chromophores can be utilized to acquire PA images of biological tissues, exogenous contrast agents that absorb near-infrared (NIR) lights have been extensively explored to improve the contrast and penetration depth of PA images. Here, we demonstrate Bi2Se3 nanoplates, that strongly absorbs NIR lights, as a contrast agent for PA imaging. In particularly, the Bi2Se3 nanoplates produce relatively strong PA signals with an optical wavelength of 1064 nm, which has several advantages for deep tissue imaging including: (1) relatively low absorption by other intrinsic chromophores, (2) cost-effective light source using Nd: YAG laser, and (3) higher available energy than other NIR lights according to American National Standards Institute (ANSI) safety limit. We have investigated deep tissue imaging capability of the Bi2Se3 nanoplates by acquiring in vitro PA images of microtubes under chicken breast tissues. We have also acquired in vivo PA images of bladders, gastrointestinal tracts, and sentinel lymph nodes in mice after injection of the Bi2Se3 nanoplates to verify their applicability to a variety of biomedical research. The results show the promising potential of the Bi2Se3 nanoplates as a PA contrast agent for deep tissue imaging with an optical wavelength of 1064 nm.

AB  - This paper reviews how Jurgen Moltmann embraces and transforms the philosophy of Ernst Bloch. For what are the hopes of the two thinkers who presuppose opposing worldviews? This question will provide a good opportunity to look at how different religious types, based on different worldviews in modern philosophy of religion, can understand and communicate with one another.Ernst Bloch was a philosopher who originally interpreted Judeo-Christian thought through Marxism and Persian Dualism and helped to carry out the intrinsic criticism of the doctrine of Christian eschatology by developing atheism of Christianity into a philosophy of hope. Bloch and Moltmann deal with the concepts of future, humanity, nation, and hope in the eschatological horizon, but their worldviews are so different. For example, the connection between the Beginning and Ending, Disjunction or Continuation, the Core of Existence and Resurrection, Messianism and Marxism, Atheism and Theism, Persian Dualism and Judeo-Christian Monotheism. Therefore, a one-sided interpretation that ignores worldview differences in the hopes of these two thinkers should be avoided.Moltmann actively embraced the Messianism of the Jewish thinker, Bloch, by excluding Marxism, made the spectrum of broad-minded horizons diminished in the union of Messianism and Marxism. Moltmann replaced the utopian possibilities of matter in the Ontology of Not-Yet-Being, with the resurrection of Christ, who was crucified, and with the God of Creation and the God of Exodus. By overthrowing the position of atheism in Christianity, which was very important for Bloch, with the system of Trinitarian Monotheism, it resulted in the disconnection and conflict between the Old Testament and the New Testament, especially the ignorance of the tension between God the Lord and Jesus Christ.

AB  - During last 10 years, the government tried to make public residential development in order to supply a large number of affordable housing. Most of public residential developments were built in green belt areas. Rapid urban development would promote land cover changes and lead to increase land surface temperature (LST). The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of public residential development projects on LST in Seoul, Korea. This study investigated LST change in 7 residential and urban development areas including districts of Sinnae 3, Sinjung 4, Naegok, Segok 2, Gangnam, Ogum, and Wirye. Landsat satellite image were used to calculate variation in LST from 2007 to 2017. The results show that most of districts have increased in standardized LST change. Especially, Wirye district experienced an average relative LST increase of 2.73℃. Moreover, the LST was also high in districts where the % Impervious Surface Area (%ISA) increased over the past 10 years. It is meaningful to suggest the direction of the plan considering the environmental aspect when the public residential and urban development project is implemented in the future.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The aim of the paper is to give an answer to the question ‘why are the Christian worldview studies nearly powerless to change our everyday life?’ In order to do it, first, I assume that the ‘voluntarist’ approach to motivation theories in action is more preferable to the ‘intellectualist’ approach. Then, based on this approach, I show that virtue ethics combined with the Christian worldview studies can be an approach that strengthens the power of practice. According to virtue ethics, virtues are character traits which make virtuous actions execute with preferable feelings. Virtuous persons do virtuous actions willingly. If we include the result of studies based on the Christian worldview within a comprehensive list of virtues, we might increase practicality of the Christian worldview by using the method of virtue ethics. one of the methods which we focus on is so-called ‘exemplarism’, which holds that the best way to form virtuous character traits is to emulate the actions of virtouous persons by the feeling of admiration. When we repeatedly emulate the virtuous actions from virtuous persons from a standpoint of the Christian worldview, we can not only have noetic structure which the Christian worldveiw studies offer, but also live our life in accordance with it willingly.

AB  - This paper aims to theoretically analyze reciprocal economy and its principle, gift exchange mechanism, more dynamically. Analytically, two types of the social as organizational principles of a society are intertwined with each other in the practices of gift exchange: the social as normative networks between persons and the one as factual and objective networks between things. From the perspective of fetishism analysis, the gift exchange is a mythical way to hide the latter, its real mechanism, behind the former. To the contrary, from the magical worldview, it can be understood as a constitutive practice to organize a society on the basis of the former. If so, we can imagine the reciprocal economy, based on gift exchange, or ultimately society itself as a battle field where the two types of the social fight against each other. These two forces compete to organize our social life according to their own logic. In this warfare, however, structural conditions favorable for the latter are likely to be formed in the ongoing process of rationalization of everyday life. Thus, the former have to mobilize new forces from other sources in order to challenge the force of the latter. I suggest two strategies. One is that the normative dimension of the former hung up on the search for ‘good life’ is required to extend itself beyond its narrow base to the search for ‘righteousness’, universal normative morality. The other is that it have to ally with the force of the political, the practical planning of strategies and tactics, beyond the search for pure normative values.

AB  - This article is for introducing the concept of the meso and the meso leadership as the solution for the dilemma or the awkward coexistence of the macro perspectives and the micro prospects of Korean Christianity.  Therefore, the  investigating the intermediate area is required, where can offers the cause and effect relations or interrelatedness between the personal micro context and the national macro context in the Korean churches.  Many Korean Christians seem to have the vacuum between the micro and the macro in terms of Christian worldview, which needs to be filled up with meso space.  It is necessary for Korean Christianity to pursue the meso paradigms for interconnectedness of the personal as the micro and the national as the macro Iin order to accomplish our goals.First, this research tries to make the literature reviews for the meso concepts in the interdisciplinary approach.  Second, the Christian organizations, as the mediun of the meso social spaces, are dealt with for the Christian structures nd behaviors in addition to the organizations.  Finally, the Christian meso leadership model are suggested to function in the meso public context, which is able to cope with the complex adaptive system as the meso space through the complexity leadership.  It is the influencer leadership model as the effective complexity leadership.This article is confined within the introductory approach to the meso modeling of Christian leadership, its organizations and the communities by overcoming the dilemma of the extreme of the micro and the macro in Korean Christianity.

CP  - IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) / Workshop on Integrating UAVs into 5G

AB  - In this paper, a cooperative cyclic-prefixed single carrier (CP-SC) system to improve physical layer security is investigated. By considering a distributed cyclic delay diversity (dCDD) scheme, a jamming method is proposed to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over the channels from the transmitters to the legitimate user, while degrading the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) over the channels from the transmitters to the illegitimate user. A CDD transmitter among the set of CDD transmitters is selected as the sentinel transmitter, and it transmits a jamming signal to the illegitimate user. The sentinel transmitter is the transmitter that provides the best channel gain in order to maximize the SNR at the legitimate user and minimize the SINR at the non-legitimate users. This allow us to enhance the security of the CP-SC system. New closed form expressions for the SNR and SINR for the dCDD protocol are derived for frequency selective fading channels. Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to verify the analytic derivations of the performance metrics for various simulation scenarios.

M3  - Article
AB  - Overshooting tops can cause a variety of severe weather conditions, such as cloud-to-ground lightning, strong winds, and heavy rainfall, which can affect flight and ground operations. Many previous studies have developed overshooting top (OT) detection models. However, rather than identifying individual pixels in satellite images as OTs or non-OTs, we typically find OTs through visual inspection of the contextual information of pixels (i.e., dome-like shape). Such an approach is more intuitive, accurate, and generalizable regardless of the OT characteristics that are used in the existing OT detection algorithms. In this paper, a new approach is proposed for OT detection using deep learning, more specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN), which can mimic the human process by convolution operation. Himawari-8 satellite images were used as input data, which were chopped into patches (i.e., grids) with a 31x31 window size and binary detection (OT or non-OT) for each patch was the output of the model. The validation results show that CNN can be successfully applied for the detection of OTs over the tropical regions, showing a mean probability of detection (POD) of 79.68% and a mean false alarm ratio (FAR) of 9.78%.

AB  - This paper focuses on Jo Ohhyun's buddhist poetry, and I think to try to investigate his literary world through the Buddhist events that form the time.Jo Ohhyun is regardless of Korea modern literary history as a monk, where it has been created their own buddhist poetry, his buddhist poetry's assessment that are pursuing the enlightenment and metaphysical depth Buddhist thought and literature is bound.I was discussed Buddhist worldview and Buddhist poetry with Jo Ohhyun.In Ⅳ chapter section 1, as Buddhist worldview "Fire" of birth and death "Kegon" of the universe all things, "non-picture" of the masses indoctrination.The 'fire' of life and death is emerging and destroying it is based on a Gongsasang. His has been shown to guru "fire" also "live" at the top of the "flashing" and. 'Fire' in his Buddhist poetry is also a line of 'Life' and 'Death'.So I explained to center the relevant test piece to it. "Kegon" of the universe all things has the virtue ten thousand, all things are those that form the coalescence and reached the frontier that is not separated from each other by the preceding ten thousand. This is as 'Iljeukda', Dajeukil one of the inside of things already contains the universe, which means that it has entered into that space has. This is so that stare that no essential award that exists from exceeding representation, which means that those trivial including human beings nature is already inherent in my. So these are dependent on each other, has been reached Ilchebeop principles to coexist with each other. So here I've discussed around the test specimen on the Kegon Jo Ohhyun. "Non-picture" of the masses indoctrination is one in which the attendant and insight their inner surface to try to discover the "Geez".In Section 2, Seongisi of "Gyeonseongodo", Seonchwisi of "Jayeongyeonggye", Woobeomsi of "Jungsaengguje" Seonhwasi of "Seungsokilyeo" on the face and the theme of Buddhist poetry , was shown. off the market value religious missionary purpose of shipping companies, while present in self when pure, it is meant broke that encloses the shipment connotation. Seongisi of Gyeonseongodo was meant Seonsa's poem off the religious missionary purpose, while present in self when pure, it was enclosed linear connotation Buddhist poetry. It contains the linear of insight as seen from the perspective of Seonsa the Sihyeongsik. The meaning of "Seongi" refers to the barrier that leads to enlightenment of magnetism through the line run as Seonsa. Here, I was examined mainly in continuous cropping of "Maningochik"."Maningochik" is, as can be seen from the title, to run with the topic. In seonchwisi of "Jayeongyeonggye", beauty of nature permeated calmly with linear enlightenment. So, at the time of his preoccupation, genre properties of the lyrics are shown. It principle of identification that nature and yourself become one, moment and compressibility appears to encounter dialogue.Woobeomsi of "Jungsaengguje can be seen that during join the real one with the aid of understanding of the line. Although mediate site life and history of play in the case, which after the Illuminati unchanged and can proceed to 'Hwagwangdongjin'. Here, we have investigated about "Visiting 1970" and "1980 Bangbun 'series. As you can see from the title 'visit' can appear and institutional awareness of Jo Ohhyun. So Woobeomsi of Jo ohyhun it shows how intense the attitude toward life in the field playing, it was considered to center the text that was sublimed it to the poem. In Seonhwasi of "Seungsokilyeo", I was analyzed mainly Yonjakushi "Talk between The Sections" that is included in the "Talk between The Section". The test piece, but you can see it is divided into three large in terms of theme, enlightenment of the world obtained from Daeseunggodeok, in the world of Dudumulmul kind that the nature theme, and his in the field of life such as the world of playback to go live I think calling the work has been explored.

AB  - In this study, I consider Yeom Sang-sub’s What did you get in point of a serial novel. What did you get is Dong-A Ilbo’s serial novel, so it has continuity and differentiation of Dong-A Ilbo’s other serial novel. Continuity is that Dong - A Ilbo 's discourse is revealed in the novel. In the growth novels and detective novels, Dong-A Ilbo revealed their worldview. Similarly, a romance novel makes a sacred love affair between people as its content. However, the novel contents reveal the difference. The character in the novel does not get the ability to love.In Donga Ilbo's love discourse, unrestrained emotions are eliminated as bad things. And love is considered sacred, so lovers should be a excellent person who can do divine love. After all, lovers should be able to contribute to society through their love. Emotions not leading to home and marriage were considered bad. The characters of What did you get are the same. They are faithful to their feelings, but the external gaze is critical. So they internalize the external gaze and critically see their emotions. The problem, then, they will not be able to make love. The external gaze is only focused on criticizing emotions, and it never raises the ability to make love.Consequently there is a crack between Dong-A Ilbo's discourse and romance novel’ content. Dong-A Ilbo tried to show the figure of personality person who can love. However, what was actually revealed was the inability of charater and the impossible of love. So it became clear that the romance novel is no longer suitable for the Dong-A Ilbo. Changes in the trends of the novel consisting of Dong-A Ilbo paper space innovation were influenced by these internal flow changes. Discourse no longer affects novels and is exposed to the it’s limit.

AB  - Kaitai shinsho (解體新書) is an anatomical book important to modern Japanese medical history. The publishing of Kaitai shinsho created a movement to learn Dutch and Western sciences. As a result, Japan had the fastest push for Western modernization in East Asia. Sugita Genpaku (杉田玄白) and his colleagues, who translated Kaitai shinsho, thoroughly rejected the unscientific features of traditional Chinese medicine with regards to anatomy. They had absolute trust in Western studies because of the exact and detailed descriptions of Western anatomy. It was clear anatomy was the basic science of medicine.Kaitai shinsho and Jutei kaitai shinsho (重訂解體新書) changed the minds of the Japanese in the fields of medicine, culture, and history. Otsuki Gentaku (大 槻玄澤), the author of Jutei kaitai shinsho, turned it into a positive anatomy by emphasizing the history of the anatomy. He overcame the worldview centered on China and made the idea that China was the same as other countries in the Japanese position. By emphasizing the neurohumor, he strengthened functional explanations that were difficult to explain in anatomy and used logic to overcome traditionalists who criticized anatomy.

AB  - How to read the Bible? We can’t help but read the Bible through the prism of our religious tradition or affiliation. The prism of our time and social location make a big difference as well. We read the Bible through the prism of our interpretive methods. The prism of theological and historical paradigms we embrace shapes our interpretation. If we are honest with ourselves then we have to admit that we read our Bible through our unique context, in a very subjective way. Moreover, a paradigm is a type of a worldview, a system, a model, a pattern. These paradigms affect one’s identity theology on the deepest level and will shape one’s interpretation of the Bible’s message(s). For example, statues Ecclesia and Synagoga at Strasbourg Cathedral (Notre Dame, c. 1235) represents Judaism and Christianity, Synagogue and Church. Church displays freedom, confidence and authority vs. misery, shame and submission of Synagogue. This paradigm was developed out of early patristic period and remained as a main view into the middle ages. It’s core problem is the supercessionist (replacement) perspective built on the early Church vs. Synagogue polemics, denial of Israel’s spiritual inheritance. It is in considerable tension with Romans 9-11.It should be remembered that the Bible was written predominantly by Jews and to a Jewish audience at first. It was written in the Hebrew soil and culture. The Bible basically reflects the Hebrew view of reality. And it has been transmitted to the Gentile churches. Indeed, the roots of Christianity run deep into Hebrew soil. Much of what is written in the New Testament is incomprehensible apart from its Jewish context. For the Christians of the first Church, the way of “Christian thinking” meant the way of Hebraic thinking. Then what does it mean to have the Jewish/Hebraic viewpoint? That is to redintegrate the Jewishness of the Bible. Why that is so important? Because the most books of the Bible found its primary propensity in the Semitic culture of the ancient neat East. However, though the Hebrew heritage of the Church is rich and extensive, the crop of our understanding about Hebrew heritage and Christian-Jewish relations is quite lean. Therefore, proper reading the Bible and understand the meaning of it is required. Most of all, in reading and interpreting the Bible, inquiry and understanding of Jewish roots is a prerequisite that must be precededIn this article, I will emphasize the importance of the Hebrew heritage that has been treated so passively or superficially in the understanding of the Bible as the basis of Christian faith and doctrine. I will also enumerate some examples of the Hebrew heritage in the Bible texts and also its traditions. Furthermore, as a spiritual child of Abraham, I will see the ties of the church with Israel.

TI  - The Understanding and Evaluation of Authorial Audience Criticism and Its Pros and Cons: A Case Study of Warren Cater’s Works
T2  - CC
T2  - Canon&Culture(캐논앤컬처)
M3  - research-article
AB  - This study has the purpose of understanding authorial audience criticism and evaluating its pros and cons with a case study of Warren Carter’s works. Cater employs authorial audience criticism to interpret the writings of the New Testament (NT) with a counter-narrative reading against the social, political, cultural, economic, and religious value systems of the Roman Empire. He adopts the concept of “authorial audience” that refers to the reader whom the author keeps in mind. He first determines who the audience is and what situations they were placed under and experienced; and then the texts are read and interpreted along with this audience and their experiences. According to Cater, authorial audience indicates neither the real (or flesh-and-bone) reader nor the implied reader. As for the real reader, it is impossible to identify who this historical reader is; and as for the implied reader, there exists a limitation because this reader is only projected by the text with the exclusion of the historical contexts. Authorial audience, however, is not only the real reader who was actually reading the author’s writing, but also the implied reader whom the text projects in that the authors bear in his mind. Carter first defines the identity of the authorial audience by examining both text and context, and then interprets the NT writings in view of authorial audience. In this study, I investigate and evaluate Carter’s works, especially in relation to the study of the Gospel of Matthew that is his major field in the NT. He argues that Matthean community (audience) was located in Antioch on the Orontes River in Syria, which was one of the largest cities in the Roman Empire at that time. Matthean community, however, belonged to a lower class in this urban city and suffered under the opposition, contempt, and isolation, while living as a marginal group. Carter also suggests the counter-narrative reading which is to find the resistance of Matthew’s community against the evils of social, economic, political, and cultural structures in the Roman Empire. In so doing, there happen tensions between the theology of the Roman Empire and the theology of the Kingdom of God, which lead to discover the alternative worldview of God’s reign by rejecting the Roman imperialism.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper analyzes Yukaghir's view of nature and world through the summer festival Shahad'ibyе(Шахадьибэ, Шахадзибэ), in which can be examined their religion, customs, and culture. Shahad'ibyе is a term referring to Yukaghir's summer festival and is also a name for gathering place. Shahad'ibyе means "camps, hills, gathering places, places for meetings, places for play". Until the 1930s, the Yukaghirian people have been gathered with harvests of winter and spring at Shahad'ibyе near Yasatsnaya river by sailing for distances of over hundreds or a thousand kilometers and have been enjoying the festival every year. In the Shahad'ibyе have found the traditional lifestyle of Yukaghir, who used to hunting, fishing and collecting, and some links of interrelationship formed between the surrounding natural world and souls, between animals and human being through such economic activities. The Yukaghirian people saw all things like water, fire, earth, and sun as living subjects, soul-bearing masters, and perform religious ritual to them for fertility, abundance, peace, love, and reconciliation. Shahad'ibyе, that gives influence to society and culture as a whole, provided the material, psychological motive and source of power, national identity and bond for that the whole Yukaghir can live in the following year. In this way, the study of Shahad'ibyе has important significance in understanding the ethnic characteristics, identity, religious view, and worldview of the Yukaghir. The Yukaghir summer festival, Shahad'ibyе was disappeared in the 1930s due to the oppression of festivals and shamanism of ethnic and religious minorities in the Soviet Union. I hope the summer festival Shahad'ibyе, that awakened the winter and spring, to be the beginning of the medium and opportunity to revive the memories of Yukaghir's national culture and mother language, which is being destroyed who awakens the winter and spring.

AB  - This paper investigated the views of Luther and Calvin about Christian Schools and found out the educational principles and lessons that may apply to today's Christian school education. Both Luther and Calvin asserted that the foundation of the curriculum and the core in the schools must be the Bible.Second, they emphasized that Christian schools should rear up the leaders who can work not only for churches, but also for governmental agencies and society in accordance with God’s will. This thought led to the idea that Christian schools should teach general disciplines. They also insisted that the government should provide financial support for the establishment and maintenance of Christian schools. Third, they emphasized compulsory education under the most basic belief that the Bible should be taught to all.The first implication found in their views to today’s Christian education is that there is a need for textbooks and communication tools such as catechism consistent with the Biblical worldview for all the persons supporting the establishment and operation of Christian schools. Second, even though the persons can not participate in the establishment and operation of Christian schools at the level of the reformation age, it is necessary for all possible available forces to make joint efforts for the establishment and operation of the schools. Third, it is necessary to establish educational institutions to educate teachers and educational administrators of Christian schools, and to improve the efficiency of existing educational institutions. Lastly, prayer as well as support for the Christian schools is absolutely essential for the existence and growth of the schools.

TI  - Preoperative axillary nodal staging with ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging: predictive values o quantitative and semantic features
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Although axillary imaging has recently received renewed interest for preoperative staging in tandem with the evolving minimally invasive surgical approaches, axillary imaging is limited by the lack of standardization in the interpretation. We aimed to classify imaging features in ultrasound and MRI into quantitative and semantic features and evaluate predictive value of each feature for predicting nodal metastases.Methods: A total of 316 breast cancers patients who underwent ultrasound and MRI prior to axillary surgery were included. Retrospective reviews of our breastimaging database were done for the quantitative features [cortical thickness (CT) and CT-derived parameters, long diameter (LD), short diameter (SD), and LD/SD ratio] and semantic features (eccentricity, loss of fatty hilum, and irregularity) of the axillary lymph node in images. Odd ratios (ORs) for each imaging feature were calculated with adjustment for clinicopathological characteristics significantly associated with nodal metastases.Results: All CT-derived parameters were significantly associated with nodal metastases in both ultrasound and MRI (OR, 3.3-3.5 for ultrasound and 3.3-3.9 for MRI, respectively; Ps < .05). For the ultrasound, LD/SD ratio (OR, 2.1), eccentricity (OR, 2.4), and fatty hilum loss (OR, 27.2) were significantly associated with nodal metastases (Ps < .05). For the MRI, SD (OR, 21) and eccentricity (OR, 3.0) were significantly associated with nodal metastases (Ps < .05).Conclusion: Among the quantitative features, all CT-derived parameters can be used for predicting nodal metastases. Significant predictors of semantic features were heterogeneous between ultrasound and MRI.

TI  - Image Fusion Methods for Multispectral and Panchromatic Images of Pleiades and KOMPSAT 3 Satellites

T2  - 한국측량학회지
M3  - research-article
AB  - Many applications using satellite data from high-resolution multispectral sensors require an image fusion step, known as pansharpening, before processing and analyzing the multispectral images when spatial fidelity is crucial. Image fusion methods are to improve images with higher spatial and spectral resolutions by reducing spectral distortion, which occurs on image fusion processing. The image fusion methods can be classified into MRA (Multi-Resolution Analysis) and CSA (Component Substitution Analysis) approaches. To suggest the efficient image fusion method for Pleiades and KOMPSAT (Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite) 3 satellites, this study will evaluate image fusion methods for multispectral and panchromatic images. HPF (High-Pass Filtering), SFIM (Smoothing Filter-based Intensity Modulation), GS (Gram Schmidt), and GSA (Adoptive GS) were selected for MRA and CSA based image fusion methods and applied on multispectral and panchromatic images. Their performances were evaluated using visual and quality index analysis. HPF and SFIM fusion results presented low performance of spatial details. GS and GSA fusion results had enhanced spatial information closer to panchromatic images, but GS produced more spectral distortions on urban structures. This study presented that GSA was effective to improve spatial resolution of multispectral images from Pleiades 1A and KOMPSAT 3.

AB  - This essay is focused upon explicating from what the order of world was originated and in what consciousness a mode of life was formed in Chinese ancient times. As the representative example, I pay attention to the character and region of the ancient capital of Zhongyuan. And, from the idealistic world of Zhongyuan, I trace a process of extending from the realm of local region to that of centrality of Tianxia. The key point of argument is the principle of natural philosophy such as the conception of opening heaven and beginning earth, the perspective of four quarters, the worldview of huanyu, etc. From the viewpoint of the principle of natural philosophy, it is to be understandable that the world of Zhongyuan is closely associated with the sustainable reality of opening heaven and beginning earth, oriented toward the historical utopia of time-pace in the practice of life and its social process. It stems from the human capacity of making creative imagination to make the order of Tianxia in accordance with the scheme of circular heaven and rectangular earth. After all, it is consequent that the world of Zhongyuan can a cornerstone of origination in establishing the archetype of culture and its ethos so as to make the unique boundary of Chinese character in the ancient East Asia.

AB  - Soon-won Hwang's novel, The Moving Castle is a work that reveals the artist's interest in the Christian worldview. The Moving Castle is showing the lives of the marginalized poor in contemporary society is dealing with the issues of love and salvation for the human beings wandering and the Christian and shamanistic conflict. However, there is a limit to this evaluation. The reality perception in the moving castle and the spatial perception of the artist have not been studied. The operation of modern power is 'abstract space'. Among them, "urban space" is not a simple living space for those living in modern times, Invisible power structures produce urban space. It threatens the existence of the subject through various spaces that exist inside it. The Moving Castle clearly reveals the artist's consciousness of these problems.It does not stop at this problem consciousness. Imagine a space against the urban space. Pursue the possibilities of the origin space after. that In this paper, we study space appearing in The Moving Castle. In the artist 's work, we see that there is a perception of reality in the present. Analyze the meaning of the space that appears in the works. repeat the consciousness of the reality that the artist had. Furthermore, it goes beyond 'lyricism' which was pointed out as a limitation point in the research on the artist.

AB  - In this article, the effect of forest foliage in L-band SAR data is studied using images containing deciduous (beech) and evergreen (cedar) forests. Four datasets with different seasons by ALOS polarimetric PALSAR are analyzed. With respect to beech forests, more decrease of the cross-polarization backscatter power is observed after leaves fall compared to cedar forest. The effect of foliage is not large in extent but existing in L-band backscattering. From the ratios of diagonal elements in coherency matrix between August and October/December datasets show changes, which suggest changes of backscattering mechanism.

AB  - Arid regions are highly vulnerable to climate change and human activity. Global warming has the potential to increase their area. In most arid regions, desertification, land degradation, and drought are frequent. An early warning and monitoring system based on numerical models, remote sensing, and weather forecasts is urgently needed to guard human well-being in those regions. This study defined degraded land area on the basis of dust erodibility determined only from satellite data, and measured seasonal variations over each continent. During the 5years from 2012 to 2016, degraded land area showed a tendency to increase in South America and Oceania and to decrease in Asia, Europe, Africa, and North America. Degraded land area covered up to 19% of the world's total land area, almost exactly the percentage of hyper-arid (7.3%) plus arid regions (11.6%) determined by the widely used aridity index, and down to 7%.

T2  - ATMOSFERA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface processes play a critical role in governing the surface energy partitioning and the atmospheric circulation within a climate system. Improper representations of present land state, particularly spatially specific fields such as land cover, topographical and biophysical parameters contribute to the uncertainty in the model's weather simulations extending from local to regional scales. The present study investigates the impact of superior land surface datasets on the performance of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in simulating micrometeorological/near-surface weather, particularly sensible variables such as temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed. The hypothesis is that the updated land surface datasets would help in improving micrometeorological forecasts over the domain comprising of Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand states in India. A land use land cover (LULC) dataset derived from Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS); an elevation dataset from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and a Leaf Area Index (LAI) based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), are used in model initialization. Performance evaluation of the model's simulation is done for controlled (default) and modified land boundary conditions with in situ weather from a network of automatic weather stations (AWS) operated by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). In the modified run, the model more closely captured the temporal evolution of surface level temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, surface pressure and solar radiation. Improvement in 24-hr forecast ranges from 15 to 30% for these near-surface weather variables. Further testing of the model's performance on its capability to forecast 8-day micrometeorological weather variables revealed that the modified run gave consistent results. The average RMSE values for minimum and maximum temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and precipitation are 2.5 and 3 degrees C, 2 m s(-1), 18% and 3.5 mm, respectively. The modification helped in increasing the lead-time of the model's forecast by reducing the propagation error. Thus, this study emphasizes the fact that improved representation of land surface parameters has a definite effect on weather simulations at local to regional scales. For a country like India, where the feedback mechanisms between land and atmosphere are more prominent due to inherent climatic characteristics, it is critical to concentrate and improve on the inputs that represent the initial land state.

TI  - Completing yearly land cover maps for accurately describing annual changes of tropical landscapes
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Availability of up-to-date land cover information is increasingly important for describing annual changes in tropical landscapes that significantly affect ecosystem-economy interactions and environmental management. However, land cover change monitoring in humid tropical areas is complicated by difficult remote sensing conditions, which often leads to a crucial lack of accurate land cover information. In this study, we use visual interpretation of Landsat images in combination with existing land cover maps to create a set of annual maps for the East Kalimantan Province in Indonesia from 2000 to 2016. These datasets allow us to analyze the development of land cover change trends in the province since 2000 with high spatial and temporal detail. Our results reveal the acceleration of land cover changes, with overall cover changes from natural forest to plantation forest and other cultivated land cover classes, and undeveloped shrublands. The mapping approach used in this study effectively provides information on land cover changes in humid tropical areas, which can support environmental monitoring and government development programs.

AB  - Fragmentation of landscapes with conservation value is very important to show what their conditions in protected areas are. This kind of study is important for protected area management and for the situation of the biodiversity. This study is focused on mapping and assessment of three types of protected landscapes: forests, transitional woodland/shrub and alpine meadows using remote sensing data. The study area includes parts from South Pirin and Slavyanka. The aim is to show what is the current situation and what are the conditions of selected protected areas and what is the risk of landscape fragmentation. The landscape fragmentation tool (LFT v2.0) in GIS environment was used for mapping the fragmentation. The results show that protected areas are mainly not fragmented. It is clear from the spatial analysis that the territory with conditionally natural landscapes has a compact structure and the fragmentation of the habitats is very small.

TI  - Estimation of air temperature and reference evapotranspiration using MODIS land surface temperature over Greece
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), land surface temperature data, during daytime (LSTday) or night-time (LSTnight), were employed for predicting maximum (T-max) or minimum (T-min) air temperature measured at ground stations, respectively, in order to be used as alternative inputs in minimum data-based reference evapotranspiration (ET) models in 28 stations in Greece during the growing season (May-October). The deviations between daily LSTnight and T-min were found to be small, but they were greater between LSTday and Tmax. Furthermore, the temperature vegetation index (TVX) method was employed for achieving more accurate Tmax values from LSTday, after determining the normalized difference vegetation index of a full canopy (NDVImax). The TVX method was validated on 'temporal' basis, but when the method was tested spatially, the improvement on the Tmax estimates from LSTday was not encouraging, for being used operationally over Greece. Thus, LSTday or LSTnight MODIS data were used as inputs in three ET models [Hargreaves-Samani, Droogers-Allen, and Reference Evapotranspiration Model for Complex Terrains (REMCT)] and their estimations, as compared with ground-based Penman-Monteith estimates, indicated that the REMCT model achieved the most accurate ET predictions (r = 0.93, mean bias error = 0.44 mm day(-1) and root mean square error = 0.74 mm day(-1)), which can allow the spatial analysis of ET at higher spatial resolutions in areas with lack of ground temperature data.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing - Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)
CL  - Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS
AB  - A new methodology is proposed for the enhancement of endmember (EMs) fractions' maps. The new method, termed DFNeFE (data fusion through neural network for fraction estimation), is based on the fusion of a multispectral image, with low spatial resolution (LSR) and a visible RGB image, with high spatial restitution (HSR), through a back propagation neural network (BPNN). First, the fraction maps of a set of EMs are estimated for the spectral image using an accurate unmixing method. Then spatial statistical features (SSFs) are extracted from both images and a BPNN is trained to learn the relationship between the fractions, the visible bands of the HSR image and the SSFs based on invariant points (IPs) which are assumed to have the same land cover type in both the multispectral and visible images. Using an automatic method for IP extraction, we can also apply our method to images that are not co-registered. An evaluation of the proposed method, is carried out using a real data set with two spectral images acquired by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites, and an RGB image available in Google Earth. An experimental testing, with relativity to the sparse unmixing by variable splitting and augmented Lagrangian (SUnSAL), shows that the proposed DFNeFE method obtains fraction maps with a significantly enhanced spatial resolution (SR) and an average mean absolute error (MAE) of similar to 4%.

AB  - EUMETSAT is providing space observations for operational meteorology and climate monitoring, operating geostationary and sun-synchronous polar orbiting satellites through mandatory programmes. Optional programmes provide complementary observations for altimetry and oceanography. Data and products from partner agencies' satellites are made available by to the user community through EUMETSAT third party programmes. EUMETSAT's current fleet of operational geostationary spacecraft comprises the four satellites of the Second Generation of Meteosat (MSG), Meteosat-8, Meteosat-9, Meteosat-10 and Meteosat-11. Meteosat-11 was being taken out of in orbit storage and become the prime satellite in early 2018. Meteosat-8 continues to contribute to the IODC service. The EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) provides data from sun-synchronous polar orbit with currently two satellites: Metop-B, launched in September 2012 and currently the prime satellite, and Metop-A, the first of the series, in orbit since October 2006. The third of the series of three satellites, Metop-C is planned to be launched in November 2018. These satellites are part of the Initial Joint Polar System (IJPS) together with the US. EUMETSAT's first optional programme continues to provide data from the Jason-2 and Jason-3 satellites. To assure continuity in the mandatory missions the development of Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) is ongoing. The EPS-SG (EPS Second generation) programme is also under full development. In the frame of the Copernicus Programme EUMETSAT operates the Sentinel-3A satellite and provides operational marine products. Sentinel-3B, a second satellite, was launched in April 2018 and is currently under commissioning.

AB  - Fire radiative energy density (FRED, Jm(-2)) integrated from fire radiative power density (FRPD, Wm(-2)) observations of landscape-level fires can present an undersampling problem when collected from fixed-wing aircraft. In the present study, the aircraft made multiple passes over the fire at similar to 3min intervals, thus failing to observe most of the FRPD emitted as the flame front spread. We integrated the sparse FRPD time series to obtain pixel-level FRED estimates, and subsequently applied ordinary kriging (OK) and Gaussian conditional simulation (GCS) to interpolate across data voids caused by the undersampling. We compared FRED interpolated via OK and GCS with FRED estimated independently from ground measurements of biomass consumed from five prescribed burns at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, USA. In four of five burns considered where undersampling prevailed, OK and GCS effectively interpolated FRED estimates across the data voids, improving the spatial distribution of FRED across the burning event and its overall mean. In a fifth burn, the burning characteristics were such that undersampling did not present a problem needing to be fixed. We also determined where burning and FRPD sampling characteristics merited applying OK and CGS only to the highest FRED estimates to interpolate more accurate FRED maps.

We integrated the sparse FRPD time series to obtain pixel-level FRED estimates, and subsequently applied ordinary kriging (OK) and Gaussian conditional simulation (GCS) to interpolate across data voids caused by the undersampling. We compared FRED interpolated via OK and GCS with FRED estimated independently from ground measurements of biomass consumed from five prescribed burns at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, USA. In four of five burns considered where undersampling prevailed, OK and GCS effectively interpolated FRED estimates across the data voids, improving the spatial distribution of FRED across the burning event and its overall mean. In a fifth burn, the burning characteristics were such that undersampling did not present a problem needing to be fixed. We also determined where burning and FRPD sampling characteristics merited applying OK and CGS only to the highest FRED estimates to interpolate more accurate FRED maps.

AB  - Upwelling is a phenomenon which involves wind-driven motion of dense, cool, and usually nutrient-rich deep water towards the ocean surface replacing the warmer usually nutrient-depleted surface water. The deeper water is rich in nutrients, favoring the growth of seaweed and phytoplankton, and is characterized by high Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations. Upwelling regions are considered as the most fertile fishing grounds and a so fundamental economic resource.In this paper, an approach for satellite monitoring of coastal upwelling regions is proposed based on Sea Surface Temperature (SST), and Chl-a information from Sentinel-3 OLCI Level-2 products, as well as, wind information from Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service global product. The approach consists of the following parts. Firstly, using wind information the time periods of upwelling-favorable wind were identified. For these time periods, a thermal map is produced from Sentinel-3 SST products using a clustering approach. From the clustering result a vector file which contains the cold patches of upwelled water is generated. Lastly, Chl-a concentration information is parsed in the vector file.The approach was tested over the Benguela Upwelling System. The results are satisfactory and the proposed methodology is capable of detecting and monitoring the upwelling spatial extent and variations, as well as Chl-a concentration changes in the upwelling regions. The proposed methodology will be utilized within the framework of SEO-DWARF H2020 programme (MSCA-RISE-691071), in order to create the relevant metadata for Sentinel-3 OLCI Level-2 products.

TI  - The ecological framework of Russian major cities: spatial structure, territorial planning and main problems of development
T2  - VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article proposes to consider the ecological framework of cities as a set of undeveloped and unsealed green areas providing ecosystem services, so-called green infrastructure. General features of the ecological framework of the 15 largest cities of Russia are analyzed on the base of statistical and remote sensing data, the main problems of its territorial planning are identified, and possible mechanisms for their solution are proposed. The basic indicators of the structure evaluation of the framework are proposed and calculated, the protection status of its elements is estimated, on the basis of which the cities with unfavorable conditions for its preservation are identified. It is defined that in the largest cities the share of a tree cover from the city square fluctuates from 16 (Volgograd) to 61% (Perm), and in three cities from 15 (Omsk, Yekaterinburg, Krasnoyarsk) less than 1 % of the area of a tree cover is protected. The mapping models of the framework for each of the cities are presented and three typical configurations are identified. The obtained results are compared with various domestic and international regulatory indicators of greening, which leads to the conclusion about the individual features of the structure of the ecological framework of each city.

AB  - We developed two new global empirical models of the F2 layer critical frequency that discribe the main features of high latitude ionosphere in details: (1) Main Ionospheric Trough (MIT) model based on satellite data of topside ionosphere sounding and in-situ measurements; (2) CHanged of the foF2 calculation in IRI model (Kaliningrad version) - CHIRIK model based on radio occultation measurements. Using radio occultation and ground-based ionosonde database with an archive of F10.7 values we obtained the F10.7-optimized index for better global reproduction of the foF2 dependence on solar activity for all temporal intervals. Another applied product of our team is the ray tracing technique in 3D weakly inhomogeneous ionosphere.

M3  - Article
AB  - The author considers religious emigration in the late USSR with reference to Pentecostals (Christians of Evangelical Faith), focusing on the external and internal motives of emigration, measures taken by the authorities, and the attitude towards emigrants in the Protestant community. The author refers to public documents (analytical notes and reports of the Council for Religious Affairs), the ego-documents of believers (memoirs, letters, and statements), and documents of human rights organisations. The author describes the eschatological foundations of the theology of Pentecostals which underlay emigrational sentiments. She also singles out common reasons for emigration (violation of believers' rights, the incompatibility of a religious worldview and communist ideology, economic and everyday difficulties), as well as ones typical of Pentecostals (the absence of a legitimate union and the prophecy about Exodus). The Pentecostal emigrants followed the same pattern of action as other refuseniks, and their belief was kept up by religious rhetoric and support from foreign adherents of the same faith. As regards the Soviet religious community, its attitude to emigrants varied from support (petitions to protect them, donations) to disciplinary measures (exclusion from the community, penitence). The authorities resorted to a variety of measures to combat emigrantion (provocations, support of certain individuals, and pressure on family members). Their attitude to emigrants was an indicator of loyalty among registered communities or those seeking authorisation. The author concludes that the Pentecostal emigration movement did not succeed, becoming a mass one as late as the 1980s, after the socio-political situation in the country had changed. During the Cold War years, the Soviet government only allowed individual families to leave the country, using potential emigrants as proof of the fact that it respected civil rights and international treaties.

TI  - "Heidelberg Standard Examination" - Final year students' experiences with a handbook and instructional videos to improve medical competence in conducting physical examinations
T2  - GMS JOURNAL FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The physical examination (PE) of patients is a core competence in almost all medical disciplines. The teaching materials "Heidelberger Standard Examination, consisting of a handbook and accompanying videos, were developed with the objective of providing medical students with an innovative faculty-wide teaching and examination standard to sustainably advance students PE competences during medical training.Methods: In a mixed-method approach comprising both quantitative and qualitative measures, our study examined Heidelberg University Hospital final year (FY) medical students use and evaluation of the individual teaching material components. Therefore, 92 FY students completed quantitative evaluation measures and ten FY students took part in individual 30-minute semi-structured interviews.Results: Of the sample of n=77 students, who had completed the clinical part of their studies at Heidelberg University Hospital, 97.4% (n=75) had used the handbook and 35.0% (n=27) the accompanying videos. The teaching materials were evaluated via the common German six-point school grading system with an average mark of 1.35 +/- 0.5 for the handbook and a mark of 2.15 +/- 1.0 for the accompanying videos. Further, our results show that FY students especially valued the Heidelberg Standard Examination handbook as a guide and general reference work and felt the materials improved their self-perceived PE competence. Although FY students saw the accompanying video material as helpful, it was less frequently used, indicating further development potential. Overall, results reveal that FY students perceive the Heidelberg Standard Examination teaching program to contribute to the improvement of the quality of their PE training.

AB  - Fire, normally associated with the deforestation process, is used to prevent vegetation regrowth and to renew crops and pastures. This paper identifies the relation between the changes in classes of land use and cover in relation to the use of anthropic fire in the Brazilian Amazonia for 2008-2014, thus quantifying tendencies of fire use in the region. Sankey-type graphs were used to analyze fire regimes. Two sources of data were used: the Amazonia TerraClass spatial database with land use and land cover classes estimated from Landsat imagery and the MODIS-AQUA fire pixels. In the fire affected areas, the recurrence was higher in the conversion of natural and secondary forests to pasture, and for pasture maintenance, where the respective percentages in land cover/use change were 22%, 40% and 71%. Also evidenced are the inefficient policies to control the illegal use of fire and in reducing the associated atmospheric emissions.

AB  - The detection of changes in the earth's surface based on satellite remote sensing data has been an active field of research for several decades. The aim of the German land cover change detection service "Laverdi" is to use free Copernicus satellite data for an automatic derivation of land cover changes and to regularly provide this information for individual landscape objects via a web service. In addition to basic land cover change information, Laverdi will also provide a set of land cover specific thematic extensions, like, for instance, an analysis tool for the detection of windfall areas for forest land cover. The accuracy of the detected windfall area in the study region is about 0.83, showing a trend to underestimate the storm effected area. This can be explained by the pixel size of the input data and the minimum object size.

TI  - Towards a comprehensive city emission function (CCEF)
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - The comprehensive city emission function (CCEF) is developed for a heterogeneous light-emitting or blocking urban environments, embracing any combination of input parameters that characterize linear dimensions in the system (size and distances between buildings or luminaires), properties of light-emitting elements (such as luminous building facades and street lighting), ground reflectance and total uptight fraction, all of these defined for an arbitrarily sized 2D area. The analytical formula obtained is not restricted to a single model class as it can capture any specific light-emission feature for wide range of cities. The CCEF method is numerically fast in contrast to what can be expected of other probabilistic approaches that rely on repeated random sampling. Hence the present solution has great potential in light pollution modeling and can be included in larger numerical models. Our theoretical findings promise great progress in light-pollution modeling as this is the first time an analytical solution to city emission function (CEF) has been developed that depends on statistical mean size and height of city buildings, inter-building separation, prevailing heights of light fixtures, lighting density, and other factors such as e.g. luminaire light output and light distribution, including the amount of uptight, and representative city size. The model is validated for sensitivity and specificity pertinent to combinations of input parameters in order to test its behavior under various conditions, including those that can occur in complex urban environments. It is demonstrated that the solution model succeeds in reproducing a light emission peak at some elevated zenith angles and is consistent with reduced rather than enhanced emission in directions nearly parallel to the ground.

AB  - The numerical LOTOS-EUROS model that provides information on the regional distribution of aerosols was implemented for a new domain, Southern Africa. The first set-up for the study areas is discussed and a comparison of model products (aerosol concentration and optical depth) to experimental data is presented. The model compares favorably to MODIS satellite products on a regional scale. Comparisons with in-situ instrumentation at specific locations reveal that the model generally capture temporal trends, but underestimates the absolute AOD-values. In the more pronounced case, this is attributed to the complex local orography of the measurement site that cannot be captured by the model.

To answer this question, the paper will refer to data collected at demonstrations and to general population polls. It transpires, despite other claims (also formulated by experts on Pegida), that Pegida demonstrators indeed lean sharply to the extreme right of the political spectrum. This is indicated both by the party's electoral preferences (after all, a vast majority of the protesters would vote for the AID) and the worldview of Pegida's supporters that indicates their proximity to the extreme right.

TI  - Assessing the potential of sun-induced fluorescence and the canopy scattering coefficient to track large-scale vegetation dynamics in Amazon forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Two new remote sensing vegetation parameters derived from spaceborne spectrometers and simulated with a three dimensional radiative transfer model have been evaluated in terms of their prospects and drawbacks for the monitoring of dense vegetation canopies: (i) sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), a unique signal emitted by photosynthetically active vegetation and (ii) the canopy scattering coefficient (CSC), a vegetation parameter derived along with the directional area scattering factor (DASF) and expected to be particularly sensitive to leaf optical properties. Here, we present the first global data set of DASF/CSC and examine the potential of CSC and SIF for providing complementary information on the controversially discussed vegetation seasonality in Amazon forests. A comparison between near-infrared SIF derived from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) instrument and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (000-2) (overpass time in the morning and noon, respectively) reveals the response of SIF to instantaneous photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Large-scale seasonal swings of GOME-2 SIF amount up to 21% (regarding the annual maximum) and peak in October and around February, while 000-2 SIF peaks in February. However, both time series agree very well if SIF is normalized by overpass time and wavelength. We further examine anistropic reflectance characteristics with the finding that the hot spot effect significantly impacts observed GOME-2 SIF values. On the contrary, our sensitivity analysis suggests that CSC is highly independent of sun-sensor geometry as well as atmospheric effects. The slight annual variability of CSC (3%) shows no clear seasonal cycle, while a relatively high spatial standard deviation points to a high degree of spatial heterogeneity in our study domain within the central Amazon Basin.

TI  - Prediction of Topsoil Texture Through Regression Trees and Multiple Linear Regressions
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Users of soil survey products are mostly interested in understanding how soil properties vary in space and time. The aim of digital soil mapping (DSM) is to represent the spatial variability of soil properties quantitatively to support decision-making. The goal of this study is to evaluate DSM techniques (Regression Trees - RT and Multiple Linear Regressions - MLR) and the ability of these tools to predict mineral fraction content under a wide variability of landscapes. The study site was the entire Guapi-Macacu watershed (1,250.78 km(2)) in the state of Rio de Janeiro in the Southeast region of Brazil. Terrain attributes and remote sensing data (with 30 m of spatial resolution) were used to represent landscape co-variables selected as an input in predictive models in order to develop the explanatory variables. The selection of sampling sites was based on the Latin Hypercube algorithm. A representative set of one hundred points with feasible field access was chosen. Different input databases were tested for prediction of mineral fraction content (harmonized and original data). The Spline algorithm was used to harmonize data according to the GlobalSoil. Net consortium standards. The results showed better performance from the RT models, using input from an average of six covariates; the simplest MLR model used twice as many input variables, creating more complex models without gaining precision. Furthermore, better R-2 values were obtained using RT models, irrespective of harmonization of soil data. The harmonized dataset from the 0.00-0.05 and 0.05-0.15 m layers, in general, presented better results for the clay and silt, with R2 values of 0.52 (0.00-0.05 m) and 0.69 (0.05-0.15 m), respectively. Prediction of sand content showed better results when the original depth data was used as an input, although all regression tree models had R2 values greater than 0.52. The RT models provided a better statistical index than MLR for all predicted properties; however, the variance between models suggests similarity of performance. Regarding harmonization of soil data, both input databases (harmonized or not) can be used to predict soil properties, since the variance of model performance was low and generalization of the soil maps showed similar trends. The products obtained from the digital soil mapping approach make it possible to integrate the factor of uncertainties, providing easier interpretation for soil management and land use decisions.

TI  - Severity and burden of hand, foot and mouth disease in Asia: a modelling study
T2  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) affects millions of children across Asia annually, leading to an increase in implemented control policies such as surveillance, isolation and social distancing in affected jurisdictions. However, limited knowledge of disease burden and severity causes difficulty in policy optimisation as the associated economic cost cannot be easily estimated. We use a data synthesis approach to provide a comprehensive picture of HFMD disease burden, estimating infection risk, symptomatic rates, the risk of complications and death, and overall disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) losses, along with associated uncertainties.Methods Complementary data from a variety of sources were synthesised with mathematical models to obtain estimates of severity of HFMD. This includes serological and other data extracted through a systematic review of HFMD epidemiology previously published by the authors, and laboratory investigations and sentinel reports from Singapore's surveillance system.Results HFMD is estimated to cause 96 900 (95% CI 40 600 to 259 000) age-weighted DALYs per annum in eight high-burden countries in East and Southeast Asia, with the majority of DALYs attributed to years of life lost. The symptomatic case hospitalisation rate of HFMD is 6% (2.8%-14.9%), of which 18.7% (6.7%-31.5%) are expected to develop complications. 5% (2.9%-7.4%) of such cases are fatal, bringing the overall case fatality ratio to be 52.3 (24.4-92.7) per 100 000 symptomatic infections. In contrast, the EV-A71 case fatality ratio is estimated to be at least 229.7 (75.4-672.1) per 100 000 symptomatic cases. Asymptomatic rate for EV-A71 is 71.4% (68.3%-74.3%) for ages 1-4, the years of greatest incidence.Conclusion Despite the high incidence rate of HFMD, total DALY due to HFMD is limited in comparison to other endemic diseases in the region, such as dengue and upper respiratory tract infection. With the majority of DALY caused by years of life lost, it is possible to mitigate most with increased EV-A71 vaccine coverage.

TI  - Hervey virus: Study on co-circulation with Henipaviruses in Pteropid bats within their distribution range from Australia to Africa
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - In 2011, an unusually large number of independent Hendra virus outbreaks were recorded on horse properties in Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Urine from bat colonies adjacent to the outbreak sites were sampled and screened for Hendra and other viruses. Several novel paramyxoviruses were also isolated at different locations. Here one of the novel viruses, named Hervey virus (HerPV), is fully characterized by genome sequencing, annotation, phylogeny and in vitro host range, and its serological cross-reactivity and neutralization patterns are examined. HerPV may have ecological and spatial and temporal patterns similar to Hendra virus and could serve as a sentinel virus for the surveillance of this highly pathogenic virus. The suitability of HerPV as potential sentinel virus is further assessed by determining the serological prevalence of HerPV antibodies in fruit-eating bats from Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Tanzania and the Gulf of Guinea, indicating the presence of similar viruses in regions beyond the Australian border.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SPACE OPTICS-ICSO 2018
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Space Optics (ICSO)
CL  - Chania, GREECE
AB  - In this article the immersed gratings for the ESA Copernicus Sentinel-5 mission are presented. The manufacturing approach is shown and the optical performance of the SWIR-3 immersed gratings as well as the results of the environmental tests are discussed. The immersed gratings show an average efficiency of 60% and a wavefront error of 200 nm rms. The total integrated scatter over the complete stray-light hemisphere excluding ghosts from internal reflections is found to be 0.2% using a conservative estimate. A method for the derivation of the wavefront error from separate surface measurements is presented and the results are compared to measurements with an experimental Shack-Hartmann setup. The immersed gratings are produced by bonding a prism to a wafer with a grating. Environmental tests and testing at operational temperatures show the suitability of this approach for complex space optical components. The article concludes with possible improvements in the optical performance of future immersed gratings.

TI  - Estimating surface soil moisture from SMAP observations using a Neural Network technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A Neural Network (NN) algorithm was developed to estimate global surface soil moisture for April 2015 to March 2017 with a 2-3 day repeat frequency using passive microwave observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, surface soil temperatures from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Model version 5 (GEOS-5) land modeling system, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-based vegetation water content. The NN was trained on GEOS-5 soil moisture target data, making the NN estimates consistent with the GEOS-5 climatology, such that they may ultimately be assimilated into this model without further bias correction. Evaluated against in situ soil moisture measurements, the average unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE), correlation and anomaly correlation of the NN retrievals were 0.037 m(3)m(-3), 0.70 and 0.66, respectively, against SMAP core validation site measurements and 0.026 m(3)m(-3), 0.58 and 0.48, respectively, against International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) measurements. At the core validation sites, the NN retrievals have a significantly higher skill than the GEOS-5 model estimates and a slightly lower correlation skill than the SMAP Level-2 Passive (L2P) product. The feasibility of the NN method was reflected by a lower ubRMSE compared to the L2P retrievals as well as a higher skill when ancillary parameters in physically-based retrievals were uncertain. Against ISMN measurements, the skill of the two retrieval products was more comparable. A triple collocation analysis against Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture retrievals showed that the NN and L2P retrieval errors have a similar spatial distribution, but the NN retrieval errors are generally lower in densely vegetated regions and transition zones.

M3  - Article
AB  - A calendar as one of the culture elements is a significant sign and a source of the study of the people's worldview. The creation of the common integrated system of the calendars of world people belongs to important problems. A brief review and a comparative study of traditional calendars of societies with different economic systems is given in this paper. The aim of the article is to reveal basic peculiarities of the forming of calendars. Comparative-historical, historical and typological methods are used in the paper. The investigated societies are classified in accordance with 3 types: type 1 - hunter-fishers-gatherers, type 2 - early farmers-breeders, type 3 - developed farmers-breeders. Authors studied various calendars systems originated in these societies according to given types. Researchers give special consideration to calendars of ancient civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, Pre-Columbian America, China, South-East Asia, India. Main characteristics of the origin and structure of the calendars are investigated in the study. The authors revealed the regularities of the calendars' forming of every society type, showed the general and different features of these calendars.1) General features.The monoeconomical structure was served by one calendar based on activity of the people. The multieconomical structure resulted in many calendars which were connected with specific sphere of activity.The basis of the forming of calendars was an economical activity; names of the structural elements of calendars (months, microseasons) were markings of fragments of the economical activity and climatic - natural conditions of habitation.2) Different features.The notions "year", "month", notions "moon", "solar" and etc. calendars were not formed in the societies of the 1 type.The notions "year", "month", notions "moon", "solar" and etc. calendars were formed in the societies of the 2, 3 type.The structural elements of the calendars of the 1 type societies were "microseasons" - time periods without fixed beginning, duration and end.The structural elements of the calendars of the 2, 3 types societies were "months" - time periods with fixed beginning, duration and end.Reasons of the calendar's forming of the societies of the 3 type were not only the economical activity, but the religious activity, developing of the authority and administrative services.Names of the months and microseasons of the calendars of the 1 and 2 types societies were markings of fragments of the economical activity and climatic - natural conditions.Names of the months of the calendars of the 3 type society were both markings of fragments of the economical activity and climatic natural conditions and other designations (names of gods, numerals, signs of the zodiac etc.).

TI  - RUSSIAN POETIC SPEECH TODAY
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the collection of poetry texts, included in the recently published volume "Russian Poetic Speech - 2016. An Anthology of Anonymous Texts". The anonymity factor (the 115 poets of various generations, living in Russia and abroad, who contributed to the volume, were not named) certainly contributes to the discovery of common features in Russian poetic speech of the late modernity. One of the main goals of the research was to perform categorical interpretation of the poems comprising the volume as one super-text. This method allowed for discovery of the poetic value of the individual geographies of the authors, as well as for cataloguing the meaning behind the verbal designators of space and time in poetry. The method also permitted to establish the principles behind the philosophic interpretation of time in its dynamics, to give overall assessment of the chronotope in its connections and relations to the image of a Collective Author, and to rethink the worldview of collective contemporary poet as the carrier of Russian language and the heir to the cultural and literary traditions of the nation. Isolating differential features of the concept of 'poetic' led to the discovery of the representational means for the super-text of 'elevated', 'non-earthly', and 'sincere'. The article also analyzes the means for realization of the emotional and influential functions of the super-text, which particularly accompanies the through motive of linguistic and axiological resistance. Treading upon the Russian Formalist school dichotomy between the practical and the poetical language, the research determines the vector for aesthetic function of properly poetic texts as opposed to the texts of 'applied' poetry. We explored and described meaningful heuristic results of poetic speech creation: the unexpected parallels behind the mass of comparative tropes, as well as semantic approximation of words, included in the actual process of paronymic attraction. We have noted that the linguo-heuristic feature of contemporary poetic speech is less apparent in neologisms with affix genesis. The article outlines emerging unconventional tendencies, connected to orthographic, punctuational and graphic aspects of a poetic text.

TI  - COMPARING THE DEVELOPMENT OF BORDER REGIONS WITH THE USE OF GIS (THE CASE OF RUSSIA)
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA POLONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the paper is to analyze the trends and the dynamics of socio-economic development in the areas on both sides of all Russia's land boundaries (more than 22,000 km long) using remote sensing data and GIS applications at different scales. The originality of this research is in the processing of large amounts of data (30 meters resolution images and medium-scale topographic maps) on vast areas and the construction of maps allowing analyzing the data on a new scale. The peripheral character of most border areas is a serious challenge for the development of cross-border cooperation. Depopulation and the depressed state of their economy do not stimulate contacts between neighboring territories. The authors assess the socio-economic situation on both sides of Russian borders and the contrasts between neighboring territories in the mirror of the structure and the dynamics of land use and the density of settlements and roads. The authors come to the conclusion that the border space experiences further fragmentation. The processes on the 'new' (post-Soviet) and 'old' borders differ by their speed and the character of transformations. Their asynchrony is quickly increasing the asymmetry of cross-border interactions.

CP  - 18th International Conference on Environmental Degradation of Materials in Nuclear Power Systems - Water Reactors
CL  - Portland, OR
AB  - Alloy 800 nuclear grade (NG) is a material of choice for replacement steam generators (SG) due to its inherent resistance to primary water stress corrosion cracking (SCC). However, the long term performance of SGs depends on the performance of the material in upset conditions. Various degradation modes have been observed in Alloy 800NG under simulated secondary crevice environments (SCE) in C-ring and CERT experiments. Furthermore, the first incidences of SCE SCC have been observed in Alloy 800NG SG tubes in nuclear power plants and may be the sentinel events at the onset of more extensive cracking in the future. Understanding the parametric dependencies of SCC obtained under representative SCE and plausible transient conditions are keys to predicting future SG performance, validating mitigation strategies, and addressing life extension issues. The results of SCE crack growth rate (CGR) testing of Alloy 800NG in conditions representative of an acid-sulfate chemistry upset condition will be presented.

AB  - Remotely sensed data are frequently used to identify water bodies. In comparison with UAV data, they are limited by resolution and availability. Paper evaluates suitability of Landsat 8, Sentinel 2 and UAV data in the case of identification of shorelines of smaller water bodies. For the study, surrounding of Pardubice city (the Czech Republic) is an area of interest. Three data sources are used: Landsat 8, Sentinel 2 and UAV data. Several algorithms are used for spectral enhancement and data classification: Iso Cluster, Maximum Likelihood, Class Probability, Principal Components, and NDWI. Manual classification is used as a reference method. No post-classification method is used to preserve shapes of small water bodies. Error matrix is used for evaluation of the classification quality. Multi-criteria evaluation shows that Sentinel 2 data classified by means of Iso Cluster provides the best results. NDWI is very close to the best results. Next, we demonstrate that UAV can provide data with a higher spatial resolution on demand for reasonable costs so they are more suitable for small water bodies. Heterogeneity of the data and treetops overlapping the shoreline led to the manual classification based on the results of Iso Cluster classification.

AB  - New techniques for automated extraction of sea ice information from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) RADARSAT-2 images with a very high level of confidence are presented. The ice/water detection approach developed based on more than 15,000 SAR images (2010-2016) and corresponding Canadian Ice Service (CIS) Image Analysis products is able to classify 65.4% of SAR data with the accuracy of 99.8%. Introduction of an auxiliary SAR image acquired several hours before allowed to further increase the number of retrievals. Ice concentration is also estimated based on the number of ice/water retrievals. The large number of SAR retrievals with very high accuracy makes it possible to assimilate them in operational Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) Regional Ice-Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS).

TI  - Onchocerca volvulus infection and serological prevalence, ocular onchocerciasis and parasite transmission in northern and central Togo after decades of Simulium damnosum s.l. vector control and mass drug administration of ivermectin
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - BackgroundMass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin has become the main intervention to control onchocerciasis or river blindness. In Togo, after many years of MDA, Onchocerca volvulus infection has declined dramatically, and elimination appears achievable, but in certain river basins the current situation remains unknown. We have conducted parasitological, serological, ophthalmological, and entomological assessments in northern and central Togo within the river basins of Oti, Keran and Mo.Methodology/Principal findingsExaminations were completed in 1,455 participants from 11 onchocerciasis sentinel villages, and O. volvulus transmission by Simulium damnosum sensu lato (s.l.) was evaluated. In children (aged 1-10 years), the prevalence of microfilariae (Mf) was 2.3% and in adults it ranged from 5.1 to 13.3%. Positive IgG4 responses to O. volvulus adult (crude) worm antigen (OvAg) and the recombinant Ov16 antigen were in all-ages 48.7% and 34.4%, and 29.1% and 14.9% in children, respectively. In the river basin villages of Keran, Mo and Oti, the IgG4 seroprevalences to OvAg in children were 51.7%, 23.5% and 12.7%, respectively, and to the Ov16 antigen 33.3% (Keran) and 5.2% (Oti). Onchocerciasis ocular lesions (punctate keratitis, evolving iridocyclitis and chorioretinitis) were observed in children and young adults. O. volvulus-specific DNA (Ov150) was detected by poolscreen in vector samples collected from Tchitchira/Keran(22.8%), Bouzalo/Mo(11.3%), Baghan/Mo(2.9%) and Pancerys/Oti(4.9%); prevalences of O. volvulus infection in S. damnosum s.l. were, respectively, 1%, 0.5%, 0.1% and 0.2%.Conclusions/SignificanceIn the northern and central river basins in Togo, interruption of O. volvulus transmission has not yet been attained. Patent O. volvulus infections, positive antibody responses, progressive ocular onchocerciasis were diagnosed, and parasite transmission by S. damnosum s.l. occurred close to the survey locations. Future interventions may require approaches selectively targeted to non-complying endemic populations, to the seasonality of parasite transmission and national onchocerciasis control programs should harmonize cross-border MDA as a coordinated intervention.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of artesunate-amodiaquine versus artemether-lumefantrine in the treatment of uncomplicated &ITPlasmodium falciparum&IT malaria at two sentinel sites across Cote d'Ivore
T2  - Annals of Parasitology
M3  - Article
AB  - Malaria remains a major public health problem in Cote d'Ivoire. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) versus artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, at two malaria surveillance sites in Cote d'Ivoire. The World Health Organization 2003 protocol was used for this multicenter open randomized clinical trial with a 42-day follow-up. We recruited 240 patients (120 per arm), of whom 114 (ASAQ group) and 112 (AL group) were fully followed-up. According to intention-to-treat statistical analysis, PCR-corrected cure rates for ASAQ and AL treatments were 95.8% and 92.5% on day 28, and 95% and 92.5% on day 42, respectively. Based on per-protocol statistical analysis, ASAQ and AL treatment rates reached 100% and 99.1%, respectively, on day 28 and remained the same on day 42. Overall, both drugs were well-tolerated at the clinical and biological level. This study shows that ASAQ and AL are still effective and well-tolerated. Accordingly, they can continue being used to treat uncomplicated malaria in Cote d'Ivoire. However, monitoring of their efficacy should remain a priority for health authorities.

AB  - Developing nations are abandoned against tropical cyclones because of climatic changeability; the atmosphere is probably going to expand the recurrence and extent of some outrageous climate and calamity occasions. Urban areas and towns arranged along the coastline front belt in Visakhapatnam region experienced serious harm because of Hudhud cyclone, which happened on October 12, 2014. The fundamental motivation behind this exploration was to distinguish the vegetation damage in Visakhapatnam and neighbouring towns. In this analysis, Landsat-8 satellite datasets procured prior and then afterward the cyclone have been utilized; image processing techniques have been completed to evaluate the progressions of pre-and post-disaster condition. Vegetation index strategy was utilized to assess the damage to vegetation. Arrangement results and land utilize land cover change investigation demonstrate that 13.25% of agriculture Kharif and 31.1% of vegetation was damaged. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps were produced for the previously, then after the cyclone circumstance, and vegetation biomass damage was evaluated in Visakhapatnam and Bhimunipatanam. General loss of vegetation in both the spots was 30.67 and 43.37 km(2). The result of this review can be utilized by decision makers for the post-disaster support for rebuilding of influenced regions.

AB  - Physical deterministic sea surface temperature (PDSST) retrieval scheme is built on radiative transfer forward model and a mathematically deterministic approach to the solution for inverse problem. This requires atmospheric profiles information from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), which offers the prospect to account for local retrieval conditions and yields a more uniform product with superior accuracy. One of the unprecedented capabilities of the PDSST scheme is that it can use aerosol profiles in addition to atmospheric profiles information for the forward modeling, and also allows for adjustment of the aerosol burden by including it as a retrieved element. Cloud detection is a vital part of SST retrieval processing. An innovative cloud and error masking (CEM) algorithm has been developed, combining the functional spectral differences and radiative transfer based cloud detection tests, especially the functional double difference tests are unique. These advancements have led to substantial improvements in information retrieval from expensive satellite measurement. This improvement refers to a dual benefit of increased data coverage (reduced false alarms) and detection of actual cloud contamination (improved detection rate). The PDSST retrieval suite, is combining the PDSST retrieval scheme and CEM, demonstrates the superiority of this approach with an overall similar to 3-4 times information gain when implemented on data from MODIS-Aqua and GOES Imager. For example, RMSE reduction from 0.52 K to 0.35 K and data coverage enhanced from similar to 9% to similar to 19% as compared to NASA operational MODIS-AQUA SST products.

AB  - Remote sensing plays a key role to monitor the earth resources. Remote sensing uses High Resolution Satellites to capture and observe the various conditions of the earth like Land cover and Land use which provides the information regarding how much of land is covered by forest, wetland, water body and how much of land is used by people for rural development, urbanization and agricultural in digital images. Digital Image Processing is useful in decrypt satellite data which helps to know change detection and land cover classification. In this research, satellite data are used to investigate trees and identifying trees on the earth surface, where it is very difficult task to identify trees from high resolution satellite imagery. Digital Image Processing consists of various techniques like image enhancement, segmentation, feature extraction and classifying the extracted features. In this research, Cartosat2 images are used for detection and enumeration of trees. With utilization of digital image processing, the information can be known that is available in the satellite image. Image processing helps to refines the available data in the satellite images without any loss. Image segmentation is used to analyze the image in a understandable form, where it cleaves the image in the form of pixels. Basically it is used to detect and classify the shapes or object boundaries and other relevant data in the digital images. Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization(CLAHE) is one of the effective simple techniques for enhancing image quality. Active Contour Model with masking is best suit for image Segmentation and feature Detection and Tree Enumeration.

TI  - Near-Infrared Fluorescence Lymph Node Navigation Using Indocyanine Green for Gastric Cancer Surgery
T2  - Journal of Minimally Invasive Surgery
M3  - research-article
AB  - Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging is a promising method for image-guided surgery, providing robust functional images with relatively good cost-effectiveness. A cyanine vital dye indocyanine green (ICG) is a safe NIR fluorophore emitting 800~840 nm of light and has been used in numerous surgical procedures. The technique has been applied to lymph node navigation of gastric cancer surgery with an expectation of better visualization of lymphatic structures without any risk of radio-hazard compared with a “dual method” using both vital dyes and radioisotopes. Given the characteristics of ICG, such as fast distribution and quenching effect, diluted concentrations, such as 0.05~0.1 mg/ml, are thought to be optimal for sentinel node navigation. Injection into the subserosal layer is feasible; however, endoscopic submucosal injection has advantages of improved accuracy of the injection site and feasibility of injection one day prior to surgery; these advantages are preferred by some investigators due to a smaller number of sentinel nodes compared with injection in the operation theatre. The technology requires evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity, as well as the non-inferiority, compared with the dual method in a large cohort for justification as a safe node navigation method.

AB  - Accurate estimation of impervious surfaces is important but challenging due to the spectral confusion between different land covers. Recently, the synergistic use of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has shown advantage in improving impervious surfaces estimation. In this paper, multiple kernel learning (MKL) was employed to combine the heterogeneous features of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1A data. Impervious surface was estimated at a sub-pixel level based on support vector regression (SVR) model. The impervious surface percentage (ISP) of training data was derived from high resolution image using the object-oriented classification approach. The results indicate that the combined use of optical and SAR by using MKL can significantly improve the estimation of impervious surface, since it not only reduces the underestimation and overestimation of ISP in urban areas, but also well separates bare soils from impervious surface. Compared with using optical image alone, the root mean square error (RMSE) is decreased by 5.5 % and the coefficient of determination (R-2) is increased by 8.8 %.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Landslide events occur annually induced by heavy rain or an earthquake in the world. Remote sensing technique is an effective for landslide mapping and monitoring. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has a great potential due to its all-weather day and night imaging capabilities. Therefore, the utilization of SAR data for rapid damage assessment is expected. In a previous study, we demonstrated that landslide detection derived from correlation coefficient using pre- and post-event COSMO-SkyMed HH single polarization data. On the other hand, fully-polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data contain various information compared to single polarization SAR data. In this study, we demonstrated the applicability of polarimetric analysis from SAR images for detection of the landslide area. The 2016 Kumamoto earthquake in Japan caused landslide damage in Kumamoto prefecture, Japan. Rapid damage assessment after natural disasters is crucial to fast crisis response. Three ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 polarimetric data acquired on 3 December, 2015, 21 April, 2016 and 5 May, 2016 were used. Entropy/alpha angle/anisotropy were calculated from each PolSAR data. Yamaguchi four-component decomposition analysis of PoISAR was also conducted. The polarimetric coherence (gamma(HH-)(VV)) was calculated from the correlation between HH and VV polarization from pre- and post-event PolSAR data. In this study, we deal with the detection of landslides using pre- and post-event polarimetric parameters from PolSAR data. The largest landslide area in Minami-Aso village was clearly showed the surface scattering because the landslide induced by earthquake removed forested vegetation on the ground surface. The extent of the landslides was detected using pre- and post-event PolSAR data with Random forest (RF) classifier. It is clarified that pre- and post-event alpha angle, entropy and gamma(HH-)(VV) from PolSAR data with the RF classifier is effective for landslide detection.

M3  - Article
AB  - The heavy rain induced by Typhoon Talas in 2011 caused deep-seated catastrophic landslides on Kii Peninsula in the central part of Japan. Remote-sensing techniques play a key role in natural disasters in terms of quick response and mitigation. We propose a quick response method for landslide mapping using high-resolution satellite images. For synthetic aperture radar analysis, pre- and post-disaster COSMO-SkyMed images were used to detect the landslide areas on Kii Peninsula. We investigated the potential for landslide detection using backscattering coefficient difference and intensity correlation. The difference in the backscattering coefficient or the intensity correlation reflects the land-cover change between pre- and post-disaster images. We also investigated the effects of speckle noise reduction filtering and window size. The detected landslide areas were compared with the area detected by EROS-B, which has a very high-resolution optical sensor. The optimal value of the F-measure (61.24%) was obtained within a 37 x 37 window size using the intensity correlation, with a 5 x 5 window size Frost filter. The precision and recall were 65.39% and 57.58%, respectively. The results confirm that rapid detection of a landslide at the initial stage could be effectively achieved using pre-and post-disaster COSMO-SkyMed images.

AB  - Many researchers have reported that the sentinel node (SN) theory has been established for lung cancer. However, sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) has not yet become a routine medical procedure in lung cancer surgery. SN identification is important for efficient retrieval of micrometastases. Methods for identifying SNs include the dye method and the radioisotope (RI) method, but methods such as the indocyanine green (ICG) method, computed tomographic lymphography (CTLG), and the magnetic method are also being studied. More careful surgical adaptation is required for reduction surgery for early lung cancer, and rapid intraoperative diagnosis is frequently used. SN lymph nodes may be used as an indicator for selecting lymph nodes to be diagnosed intraoperatively. SN identification is considered an important method for ensuring that reduction surgery is curative. Furthermore, if overlooking lymph node metastases can be avoided by using intraoperative rapid diagnosis of micrometastases, we believe that the safety of reduction surgery will be enhanced. In addition, SN identification provides a theoretical basis to support the omission of lymph node dissection. Future developments of SN research and technology are expected.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the present article the attempt is made for the first time to apply the methodologies of Sergei Eisenstein and Lev Vygostsky to analysis of the paintings of Ilya Glazunov as well as some of his contemporaries. The attention of the researcher is focused on the phenomenon of the character suite discovered by Einsenstein in drawings as "pure motion of the run of montage thought." The present phenomenon was focused on disclosing one and the same emotion in its various gradations. Its versatile discovery is also aided by analysis of the other principles of movie montage the manifestation of which is revealed by the author of the article in painting as well: the parallel, associative and intellectual. For the aim of revealing the essence of the examined works of pictorial art the article makes use of a method, correlating with Eisenstein's, formulated by Soviet scientist Lev Vygotsky, who researched in literature the psychology of inner conflict of images on the basis of the contrariety of the plot and the storyline. The convergence of the mentioned intellectual paths of learning about the paintings of Glazunov and his contemporaries creates the possibility of systematic perfection of "multiple-point entering" into the artistic image, which makes it possible to elucidate the meaning of the authorial conceptions in pictorial art, including those paintings by Glazunov which by their worldview content and image-related compositional solution arouse impassioned critical reactions.

AB  - Rice accounts for over 20% of the global calorie supply, yet no maps exist that quantify rice paddy acreage with a regular cadence. Efforts to date have focused on classifying paddy fields either locally or regionally, and methods to do this have varied, with no agreed upon best approach. Here, we aim to generate a map of lowland rice paddy across Asia, with an accurate, easy-to-update method so that changes in area can be understood and quantified. To do so, we exploit the ability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to penetrate cloud cover since most rice is grown in the seasonally-cloudy monsoonal tropics. With the launch of the first Sentinel-1 satellite in 2014 by the European Space Agency, scientists have access to freely-available, global coverage SAR data for the first time. To leverage this data, we rely on the Descartes Labs platform, which provides the entire archive of topographically-corrected Sentinel-1 imagery. The unique phenology of rice paddies can be captured using statistics from SAR backscatter values, and these insights can be used to estimate rice paddy area across Asia. The ability to efficiently scale this method will provide scientists and policy-makers with the first comprehensive, easily-updated map of rice paddy acreage.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to find out the factors of character restoration in church ministry in the 21st-century context that character distortion prevails. Even though people in all parts of the society recognize the importance of character restoration, it has been studied mostly in the education field and even by Christian scholars. Biblical character restoration is not just for recovery of morality but the restoration of God’s image and the changes of human character and life as a result of born again in Christ. Biblical character restoration can be examined in three areas such as intellect, emotion and volition. In other words, character restoration shows that people experience the change of values in intellect, love and healing of wounds in emotion, and change of behaviors in volition. In order to achieve the purpose of this study, the researcher uses the methodology of the case study focusing on Wooridle Church in Korea, which we can evidently see the transformation of church members. Based on the case study, the researcher found five distinctive factors such as anti-prosperity message, Words and life sharing mokjang (small group), public confession, discipleship training focusing on QT and self-examination, and discipline. Anti-prosperity message, which rejects prosperity gospel and focuses on bearing the cross, makes congregation change their worldview and values. As a place that provides love and service, mokjangs, which are small groups, help members see themselves objectively and often provide feedback as well. While focusing on QT training, Discipleship training also helps congregation confront their sinful nature and sins. As a unique characteristic of Wooridle Church, public confession makes church members and visitors step into deeper repentance and experience salvation. However, it needs caution and sensitivity in the application in order to avoid side-effects. It is also important that senior pastor practices first in front of the congregation so that they can see the example to follow. Lastly, discipline, which cannot be seen in other churches in modern times, makes the church and its members keep the holiness. According to the case study, they do not work separately but function cooperatively and harmoniously. Wooridle Church is not perfect at all, but it is still valuable in providing lots of insights in relation to character restoration under circumstances that the Korean church is losing credit and power of transformation.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is the second most leading cause of cancer deaths in women and BC metastasis accounts for the majority of deaths. Early detection of breast cancer metastasis in sentinel lymph nodes is of high importance for prediction and management of breast cancer progression. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework for automatic detection of micro-and macro-metastasis in multigigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) of sentinel lymph nodes. One of our main contributions is to incorporate a Bayesian solution for the optimization of network's hyperparameters on one of the largest histology dataset, which leads to 5% gain in overall patch-based accuracy. Furthermore, we present an ensemble of two multi-resolution deep learning networks, one captures the cell level information and the other incorporates the contextual information to make the final prediction. Finally, we propose a two-step thresholding method to post-process the output of ensemble network. We evaluate our proposed method on the CAME-LYON16 dataset, where we outperformed "human experts" and achieved the second best performance compared to 32 other competing methods.

T2  - SOCCER & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses one aspect of competitive youth team soccer in the US: the tension between loyalty and success. Teams use rituals to encourage parents and players to place loyalty to the team over individual goals and self-interest. But competitive teams value team success over loyalty to its players. And youth learn to place self-interest over loyalty to the team, even at the cost of friendships. This becomes an important lesson for youth in a competitive economic system, where success in adulthood is often defined in economic terms. Thus, competitive youth soccer reproduces an upper-middle-class habitus familiar to many of the families that participate in youth sports in the US. The pursuit of desirable careers typically demands geographic mobility and the routine abandonment of significant others. It is a taken for granted aspect of the upper middle-class worldview, learned at a young age in competitive team sports such as soccer.

M3  - Multicenter Study
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gestational diabetes is one of the most common medical disorders and may cause numerous of maternal and foetal complications, such as: preterm births, congenital defects, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, metabolic changes, and macrosomia in neonates. One of the types of diabetes that may clinically manifest in pregnancy is GCK-MODY, caused by mutations in the glucokinase (GCK) gene.AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to assess the impact of diabetes during pregnancy in women with GCK-MODY on their children's health outcome and to determine the clinical and biochemical characteristics of children delivered by patients with GCK-MODY.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Study was multicentre, involving 50 children from paediatric diabetology departments in Gdansk, Katowice, Bialystok, and Lodz. The risk of GCK-MODY was evaluated on the basis of the medical history of the patient, the clinical course of the disease, and laboratory tests performed during diagnostic procedures. Data concerning family history, mothers' health status, course of pregnancy, and perinatal period was collected.RESULTS: The study showed that among children with glucokinase mutation, born by mothers affected with GCK-MODY, 62% received 10 points in Apgar score in the first minute of life, whereas 92% (n = 46) obtained 10 points in Apgar score in the fifth minute of life. The average age of diagnosis of GCK-MODY in children was 8.25 ±4.76 years, and the average HbA1c during diagnosis was 6.43 ±0.71%. Statis-tically significant difference between the absence of macrosomia (birth weight > 91st percentile) in children with GCK-MODY diabetes in comparison to the general paediatric population (p = 0.0229) was observed.CONCLUSION: According to the presented study, possible consequences of GCK-MODY during pregnancy on foetal development are generally less severe and may differ from those characteristic for other types of diabetes. Children born by mothers with diabetes should be followed up regarding glucose disorders. Further investigation of particular phenotypes of GCK-MODY, depending on the type of inherited mu-tation in mothers and their children, is required.

T2  - VESTNIK PRAVOSLAVNOGO SVYATO-TIKHONOVSKOGO GUMANITARNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA I-BOGOSLOVIE-FILOSOFIYA-RELIGIOVEDENIE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the conception of the modern German theorist and populariser of evolutionary humanism Michael Schmidt-Salomon. Along with the study of the original texts, the article contains criticism of his ideas. It shows that Schmidt-Salomon's conception, though based on the ideas of Julian Huxley, the founder of evolutionary humanism, as well as on the ideas of other theorists of humanistic and anticlerical direction, is an independent construction, consistent in its naturalistic approach and its focus on practical applicability. Many statements make their author close to R. Dawkins, but Schmidt-Salomon manages to refrain from excessive biologising in his views on the human nature. The concept of "mainstream culture", which is used by the author to formulate the problem of spreading the humanist worldview and to propose its solution, deserves special attention. Despite certain lack of thoroughness as to ethical problems, Schmidt-Salomon's evolutionary humanism can be viewed as an example of the present-day practical philosophy.

TI  - Cryo-Assisted Resection <i>En Bloc</i>, and Cryoablation <i>In Situ</i>, of Primary Breast Cancer Coupled With Intraoperative Ultrasound-Guided Tracer Injection: A Preliminary Clinical Study
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH & TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study was to perform cryosurgery on a primary breast tumor, coupled with simultaneous peritumoral and intratumoral tracer injection of a blue dye, to evaluate lymphatic mapping. We explored the ability of our strategy to prevent tumor cells, but not that of injected tracers, to migrate to the lymphovascular drainage during conventional resection of frozen breast malignancies. Seventeen patients aged 51 (14) years (mean [standard deviation]), presenting primary breast cancer with stage I to IV, were randomly selected and treated in The Rudolfinerhaus Private Clinic in Vienna, Austria, and included in this preliminary clinical study. Under intraoperative ultrasound, 14 patients underwent curative cryo-assisted tumor resection en bloc, coupled with peritumoral tracer injection, which consisted of complete tumor freezing and concomitant peritumor injection with a blue dye, before resection and sentinel lymph node dissection (group A). Group B consists of 3 patients previously refused any standard therapy and had palliative tumor cryoablation in situ combined with intratumoral tracer injection. The intraoperative ultrasound facilitated needle positioning and dye injection timing. In group A, the frozen site extruded the dye that was distributed through the unfrozen tumor, the breast tissue, and the resection cavity for 12 patients. One to 4 lymph nodes were stained for 10 of 14 patients. The resection margin was evaluable. Our intraoperative ultrasound-guided performance revealed the injection and migration of a blue dye during the frozen resection en bloc and cryoablation in situ of primary breast tumors. Sentinel lymph node mapping, pathological determination of the tumor, and resection margins were achievable. The study paves the way for intraoperative cryo-assisted therapeutic strategies for breast cancer.

AB  - For the grid integration as well as for the integration into smart grids of renewable energies accurate forecasting methods for renewal energies are important. In this paper we consider intraday forecasting of photovoltaic (PV) power production and focus on methods which can be used with satellite data. After a literature review we tested the methods cross correlation (CC), the Bayes method (BM), Variational optical flow (VOF) and persistence (PER) in more detail. With these methods we predict the PV-output for approximately 1500 PV systems in Austria. Finally we present some ideas how the existing methods can be improved and provide first results.

TI  - Religion and the cultural public sphere: the case of the Finnish liberal intelligentsia during the turmoil of the early twentieth century
T2  - HISTORY OF EUROPEAN IDEAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The political public sphere is at one and the same time both public, and private and religion operates in both the public and the private spheres in the modern way of life. This article approaches the dynamics between the cultural and the political public sphere from the point of view of religion; how the cultural intelligentsia developed its worldview fuelled with attitudes towards religion in times of political turmoil. The case study, based on the empirical analysis of cultural periodicals and societies around them, concerns the Finnish liberal intelligentsia in the early twentieth century. The first decade of the 1900s was a particularly important period of formation for the Finnish public sphere; the societal turmoil highlighted the importance of cultural periodicals in defining what was important for the national public sphere. The case of religion is an illustrative example of it, particularly from the point of view of the liberal intelligentsia of the era.

TI  - THE PERCEPTUAL PICTURE OF THE WORLD IN POETIC TRANSLATION (IN RUSSIAN AND GERMAN TRANSLATIONS OF THE POEM "POHLED SMRTI" BY O. BREZINA)
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the study of the perceptual picture of the world in terms of the anthropocentric approach to poetic translation. The study of perceptual processes in cultural linguistics is related to the problem of how the universal models and specific features of national and individual perception of the world are interrelated and reflected in the language. The creative identity of the translator is manifested in the changes the original picture of the world undergoes and in the shifts affecting its system of images. The article aims are determining the characteristics of linguistic expression of the perceptual semantics in the original and its translations and analyzing the transformations caused by the author's individual worldview and poetic tradition. The image of the world in O. Brezina's poetry reflects the specificity of his spiritual contemplation, the peculiarities of his worldview and interpretation of the reality. Perceptual images demonstrate a deep interaction between the inner and outer worlds. They become universal semantic categories that, on the one hand, direct the interpretation of the reality modeled in the poetry and, on the other hand, reflect the peculiarities of the author's individual perception of the world. The comparative linguistic analysis of O. Brezina's "Pohled Smrti" and its translations into Russian and German has shown that both translations retain the perceptual character as a key characteristic of the poetic picture of the world. The variability of linguistic means used for its implementation is the result of a series of transformations: the substitution of synaesthetic combinations with perceptual metaphors (and vice versa), the introduction of the author's individual stylistic and lexical means (K. Balmont), metonymical and metaphorical transfers, stylistic amplification (P. Eisner). These transformations reveal the process of the creative interpretation of Brezina's individual style in translations. In the translations, more profound transformations belonging to the level of understanding of the original perceptual imagery in its correlation with the theme of the poem and with the general aesthetic concept of the author were determined. The analysis has shown that in Balmont's and Eisner's translations the semantic load of the perceptual metaphor of "Pohled Smrti" changed. Its transformations, in particular, reflect the shifts in the motif of death as interpreted by the translators (Balmont's emphasis on the finiteness of life; Eisner's intensified motif of bodily death, etc.). As a result, the philosophical and aesthetic concept of the original is transformed under the influence of the translator's own ideas and spiritual experiences, which leads to the formation of a different aesthetic impact on the reader.

T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Snow is important for local to global climate and surface hydrology, but spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the extent of snow cover make accurate, fine-scale mapping and monitoring of snow an enormous challenge. We took 184,453 daily near-surface images acquired by 133 automated cameras and processed them using crowdsourcing and deep learning to determine whether snow was present or absent in each image. We found that the crowdsourced data had an accuracy of 99.1% when compared with expert evaluation of the same imagery. We then used the image classification to train a deep convolutional neural network via transfer learning, with accuracies of 92% to 98%, depending on the image set and training method. The majority of neural network errors were due to snow that was present not being detected. We used the results of the neural networks to validate the presence or absence of snow inferred from the MODIS satellite sensor and obtained similar results to those from other validation studies. This method of using automated sensors, crowdsourcing, and deep learning in combination produced an accurate high temporal dataset of snow presence across a continent. It holds broad potential for real-time large-scale acquisition and processing of ecological and environmental data in support of monitoring, management, and research objectives. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Extreme drought boosts CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from reservoir drawdown areas
T2  - INLAND WATERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although previous studies suggest that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from reservoir sediment exposed to the atmosphere during drought may be substantial, this process has not been rigorously quantified. Here we determined carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from sediment cores exposed to a drying and rewetting cycle. We found a strong temporal variation in GHG emissions with peaks when the sediment was drained (C emissions from permanently wet sediment and drained sediments were, respectively, 251 and 1646 mg m(-2) d(-1) for CO2 and 0.8 and 547.4 mg m(-2) d(-1) for CH4) and then again during rewetting (C emissions from permanently wet sediment and rewetted sediments were, respectively, 456 and 1725mg m(-2)d(-1) for CO2 and 1.3 and 3.1 mg m(-2) d(-1) for CH4). To gain insight into the importance of these emissions at a regional scale, we used Landsat satellite imagery to upscale our results to all Brazilian reservoirs. We found that during the extreme drought of 2014-2015, an additional 1299 km(2) of sediment was exposed, resulting in an estimated emission of 8.5 x 10(11) g of CO2-eq during the first 15 d after the overlying water disappeared and in the first 33 d after rewetting, the same order of magnitude as the year-round GHG emissions of large (similar to mean surface water area 454 km(2)) Brazilian reservoirs, excluding the emissions from the draw-down zone. Our estimate, however, has high uncertainty, with actual emissions likely higher. We therefore argue that the effects of drought on reservoir GHG emissions merits further study, especially because climate models indicate an increase in the frequency of severe droughts in the future. We recommend incorporation of emissions during drying and rewetting into GHG budgets of reservoirs to improve regional GHG emission estimates and to enable comparison between GHG emissions from hydroelectric and other electricity sources. We also emphasize that peak emissions at the onset of drought and the later rewetting should be quantified to obtain reliable emission estimates.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The article summarizes current possibilities of usage of the One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification method (OSNA) in the perioperative management of sentinel lymph nodes in oncologic surgery. The principle of this method is the detection of cytokeratin 19 (CK19) in the lymphatic tissue as a marker of the metastatic spread.Design: Review article.Settings: Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital Pilsen, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Prague; Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Prague; Department of Immunochemistry, University Hospital Pilsen, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Prague; Sikl's Department of Pathology, University Hospital Pilsen, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Prague.Methods: The review of the literature published until the end of April 2017 available on the PubMed database was performed. The official abbreviation OSNA and the full name of the method One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification was used for search in this database.Conclusion: The usage of the OSNA method with the detection of CK 19 in the sentinel lymph nodes as a marker of metastatic spread to the lymphatic tissue currently represents an acceptable form of perioperative sentinel lymph node management in patients with breast and colorectal cancer. Until now published data are pointing towards possible successful application of this method in sentinel lymph node management in patients with some other malignancies, such as thyroid carcinoma, gastric cancer, uterus cancer and head and neck cancer. More data is needed to establish this method also in those neoplasms.

AB  - Task of soft computing for decision support in field of risk management is analyzed in this chapter. Multi-model approach is described. Interrelations between models, remote sensing data and forecasting are described. Method of water quality assessment using satellite observation is described. Method is based on analysis of spectral reflectance of aquifers. Correlations between reflectance and pollutions are quantified. Fuzzy logic based approach for decision support in field of water quality degradation risk is discussed. Decision on water quality is making based on fuzzy algorithm using limited set of uncertain parameters. It is shown that this algorithm allows estimate water quality degradation rate and pollution risks. Using proposed approach, maps of surface water pollution risk from point and diffuse sources are calculated. Conclusions concerned soft computing in risk management are proposed and discussed. It was demonstrated, that basing on spatially distributed measurement data, proposed approach allows to calculate risk parameters with resolution close to observations.

TI  - Impact of snow cover on impervious surface detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditionally, snow cover has been seen as an obstacle to land-cover classification and impervious surface detection based on remote sensing. However, snow cover increases the spectral contrast between impermeable surfaces and other land-use types. This study evaluated the impact of snow cover on the accuracy of impervious surface detection based on Landsat optical imagery. Data from six locations worldwide (three urban, three rural; each 30 km x 30 km) provided the input to a classification of summer (snow-free) and winter (snow-covered) data. This found that for most locations, the overall accuracy of the classification of impervious surface detection was 91.0%-94.0% (kappa 81.0%-93.0%), which was only 1.0%-3.0% less than for summer (92.0%-98.0%, kappa 86.0%-95.0%). Moreover, this difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, when summer and winter observations are processed together - as a single, bi-temporal data set - the inclusion of snow cover does not decrease the classification accuracy. We conclude that snow-covered imagery is useful for impervious surface detection and has no significant impact on classification accuracy for impervious surfaces.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Symposium on Greener Cities for More Efficient Ecosystem Services in a Climate Changing World
CL  - Bologna, ITALY
AB  - This study introduces the implementation of a citizen-centered green space assessment, partly developed through a PhD thesis and earlier work, in an applied research project ("grunOase" - Integrated analysis and assessment of green city oases) in the city of Salzburg, Austria. The thesis developed a methodology that unveils the relation between spatial indicators of urban green spaces of the city of Szeged, Hungary, designed with GIS technology and remote sensing data (i.e., very high-resolution satellite imagery (VHR), and perceived quality of life contributions of the green spaces reported by their visitors. An earlier work in Salzburg developed a weighted green index by combining mapped and perceived green structures. Similar to the Szeged and the Salzburg study, the grunOase project depends on the amalgamation of quantitative information derived from remote sensing data and citizens' perception of urban green and recreation areas. The aim of grunOase is to further develop the proposed concept of an integrated urban green space assessment for supporting sustainable urban planning and environment management by combining remote sensing image classification, as quantitative data, and results of questionnaire surveys amongst visitors of two city parks in Salzburg, as qualitative information. By transferring the Szeged and the Salzburg methodologies to the grunOase project we expect to increase their robustness and their practical applicability. Eventually, grunOase involves and informs relevant local stakeholders and decision makers in Salzburg already in the conceptual phase and will contribute to citizens' quality of life.

TI  - Expansion dynamics of deciduous rubber plantations in Xishuangbanna, China during 2000-2010
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monoculture rubber plantations have been replacing tropical rain forests substantially in Southern China and Southeast Asia over the past several decades, which have affected human wellbeing and ecosystem services. However, to the best of our knowledge on the extent of rubber plantation expansion and their stand ages is limited. We tracked the spatiotemporal dynamics of deciduous rubber plantations in Xishuangbanna, the second largest natural rubber production region in China, from 2000 to 2010 using time-series data from the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), Landsat,and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We found that rubber plantations have been expanding across a gradient from the low-elevation plains to the high elevation mountains. The areas of deciduous rubber plantations with stand ages 5, 6-10, and 11-year old were 1.2x10(5)ha, 0.8x10(5)ha, and 2.9x10(5)ha, respectively. Older rubber plantations were mainly located in low-elevation and species-rich regions (500-900m) and younger rubber trees were distributed in areas of relative high-elevation with fragile ecosystems. Economic and market factors have driven the expansion of rubber plantations, which is not only a threat to biodiversity and environmental sustainability, but also a trigger for climatic disasters. This study illustrates that the integration of microwave, optical, and thermal data is an effective method for mapping deciduous rubber plantations in tropical mountainous regions and determining their stand ages. Our results demonstrate the spatiotemporal pattern of rubber expansions over the first decade of this century.

TI  - Seagrass habitat mapping: how do Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2, ZY-3A, and Worldview-3 perform?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed recently launched multispectral sensors to map seagrass properties for a similar to 150km(2) shallow bank in Moreton Bay, Australia. We utilised a previously developed semi-automated, object-based image analysis classification routine for our comparison, utilising field and image data as input. Field data were collected through georeferenced photograph transects which were analysed for species composition and percentage cover. Field data collection occurred close to image capture from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (30m pixel), Sentinel-2 (10m pixel), Ziyuan-3A (5m pixel), and WorldView-3 (2m pixel) sensors. The output maps had average overall accuracies of 66% for species and 57% for percentage cover maps. The study concluded that all sensors tested were suitable for mapping seagrass meadows in clear shallow waters, but the higher resolution sensors provided more detail and were considered more representative. The choice of sensor would depend upon the extent of the seagrass meadow, available funds and frequency of observation.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XX

AB  - The role of vegetation, especially forest ecosystems, is outstanding as a climatic indicator. In our sample area in Hungary the proportion of the trees is high and the afforestation is intense. For the geographic evaluation of the climate changes, MOD13Q1 NDVI /EVI data in 2000-2017 summer period were investigated.In the whole index series the biomass does not show a trend change in either the deciduous, the coniferous or the mixed forest categories. Reduction process is typical for consecutive drier years, but a subsequent wet season is sufficient for the forests to avoid decrease over the longer term. In the main droughty periods of July-August, the effect of dry year following the rainy years immediately reduces the green biomass. The changes in the vegetation period are also well-assessed; such as a change in spring intensity or an increase in summer biomass product, for example the mixed forest show growth not only in the spring but also at the highest summer values. The deciduous characteristic is the decrease in the maximum biomass production. Changes over the nearly two decade period are currently compensated, but forests are vulnerable within a short period of time. According to the standardized deviations in the consecutive years with significant differences, biomass production in the north and southwest of the sample area was reduced.The determination coefficients between VI data and drought index data show strong relationship (R-2 similar to 0,85). This validation is verified by the LANDSAT VI data as well.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of accurate and practicable methods of land surface temperatures (LST) mapping has benefits for a range of scientific and practical applications. The paperconsiders mapping of LST for the Bystrytsia river basin located in Western Ukraine using Landsat 8 imagerywith two thermal infrared bands, which capture emissivity values closely related to land surface temperature (LST). Three multispectral images referring to different seasons (autumn, winter and summer) were used in the study. The method of LST estimation consists of several successive steps. After preprocessing (clipping, masking, and re-projecting), the images were converted from digital numbers to top of atmosphere spectral radiance, and then - to brightness temperature. However, the brightness temperature differs from LST due to emissivity of land surface being different from that of ideal blackbody. The emissivity can vary significantly with vegetation, surface moisture and surface roughness, and can be approximately estimated from land surface reflectivity at red and near-infrared spectral ranges. Estimated values of LST were compared with measurements of Ivano-Frankivsk state weather station, showing rather good compliance for all the three scenes. Obtained estimates of LST show some regularities of its spatial distribution, which also vary significantly from season to season. All the three scenes show conspicuous vertical gradient in LST; summer and autumn scenes are also characterized by significant local variability in LST due to different land cover types (e.g., urban development, forests, different agricultural lands), whereas in winter, differences in LST for mountainous slopes of different aspects appear to be more pronounced. Graphs of LST change with elevation have a parabolic form: sharper decrease of LST is typical for lower elevations, while the vertical LST gradient decreases above 700-1000 m a.s.l.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the Russian stage of the biography of the outstanding Egyptologist and Archaeologist Franz Vladimirovich Ballod (1882-1947), whose life was split between Russia, Latvia and Sweden. The paths of becoming a scientist, the impact on his scientific worldview of various cultural traditions are analyzed in this article. Particular attention is paid to the period of work F. V. Ballod on the Volga Region, in Saratov University, where he made an invaluable contribution to the Golden Horde archeology. In 1924, F. V. Ballod forever left Russia. The article concludes that it was a deliberate, not a random choice. Ballod's emigration has undermined his contacts with colleagues who remained in Soviet Russia. In 1940, Professor Ballod left Soviet Latvia for Stockholm. The article shows that the "Russian experience" of a scientist carried a seal of deep contradictions. On the one hand, work in Russia was associated with the development of him as a scientist, on the other hand, he critically perceived many imperial practices aimed at unification through Russification. Departure from Russia in 1924, and then the exil from Riga in 1940 after the beginning of Sovietization, gave rise to deep criticism and skepticism regarding Soviet power. At the same time, they did not put the professor on the Russophobic position, did not tear him away from the Russian cultural tradition. Until the end of his life, he used scientific developments obtained in Russian period, both in concrete, practical terms, and in the field of methodology, scientific approaches, etc.

T2  - LESNOY ZHURNAL-FORESTRY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is located in subequatorial monsoon climate region, however, due to the large extent of the country from north to south its climatic conditions vary significantly. The region nature is rich and diverse. More than 80 % of the country's territory is occupied by low and subdued mountains covered with tropical forests. Forest reserves are being created for studying these mountains. The largest in area is the Kim Hy Nature Reserve, where we have done our research for determining the forest land categories. A digital map of an object was developed in order to define the area of each forest land category. The results of photogrammetric plotting of satellite data were the initial information for map's creation. A database of the reserve's forest lands has been created. Reserve's borders and territories occupied by natural and artificial forests, wastelands, agricultural lands, residential buildings, water bodies, etc. have been established. Everything has been done with the use of the modern GIS technologies. The total area of the reserve is 15416 ha, 90 % of which is forests. The forest fund of the reserve is dominated by forest stands of natural origin (90 %), artificial forests occupy only 4 %, wastelands cover 6 %, other lands - 10 % of the total area. It is defined that natural origin forests of the Kim Hy Nature Reserve are old-growth, therefore, they need conservation and rational management.

AB  - Influenza viruses cause respiratory infections every epidemic season regardless of the patient's age. The aim of this study was to determine the activity of respiratory viruses in the epidemic season 2016/2017 in Poland, with particular emphasis on influenza viruses among people aged over 14. There were 2982 clinical samples taken from patients from four age groups: 15-25, 26-44, 45-64, and >= 65 years tested under the Sentinel and non-Sentinel surveillance programs. The presence of influenza viruses was confirmed in more than 40% of cases, the predominant type was influenza A virus unsubtyped, followed by subtype A/H3N2/. The results for the four age groups indicate that the highest number of confirmed respiratory viruses was recorded in individuals >= 65 years of age, slightly less, in the decreasing order, in the age groups 45-64 years, 15-25 years, and 26-44 years. Influenza type B infections were observed only in sporadic cases. Given the epidemiological data, epidemic season 2016/2017 was characterized by similar dynamics compared to the previous season in Poland and also in most of the European countries. More than 4 million cases and suspected cases of influenza and influenza-like viruses have been reported in Poland, more than 16,000 hospitalizations, and 25 deaths, of which 20 cases occurred among people >= 65 years of age in the epidemic season 2016/2017.

AB  - In the dry tropical forest and semi-arid savanna information about the soil moisture dynamics and distribution are vital to better understand and mitigate damages caused by drought. To estimate the soil moisture over large areas from 50-m resolution ALOS-2 ScanSAR data, we adopt dual-polarization L-band algorithms originally developed for high resolution ALOS data. Based on the partial-polarimetric eigenvector decomposition, the scattering entropy and alpha angles are employed to correct for the above ground vegetation effects. The large incidence angle variation along the 350-km ScanSAR swath requires the use of an incidence angle correction factor. However, due to the relative poor data quality of the ScanSAR products suffering from scalloping and near-range/far-range striping along the subswathes, we observe lower accuracies than Stripmap mode. While in the dry season soil moisture retrieval in the open forest is well possible, in the rainy season the entropy exceeds the validity range due to the larger amounts of canopy biomass resulting in unreliable soil moisture estimates. Savanna vegetation allows a biomass-corrected soil moisture estimation throughout the whole year. Due to the lack of distributed in-situ data, we use coarse scale SMOS and SMAP soil moisture data to validate the accuracy of dual-polarization ScanSAR soil moisture estimates. Comparisons between the kilometer-scale radiometer derived soil moisture estimates and 50-m ALOS-2 results show a good agreement in the dry season with RMSEs smaller 5 Vol.-%, while in the rainy season the RMSEs can be as high as 15 Vol.-%.

AB  - The historical memory of the Great Patriotic War is one of the major factors for the unity of the modern Russian society. It contributes to the maintaining of the spiritual potential; it generates moral ideals and values, develops the worldview of younger generations. The modern society's idea of the events of the Great Patriotic War today is ambiguous. Despite the interest of the scientific community to the problems of the war period, a significant range of issues associated with the historical memory of the Great Patriotic War, requires further study. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the contribution of the Soviet Union and the countries participating in the anti-Hitler coalition into the Victory, a prominent place is given to the problems of the German occupation regime and collaboration. The authors' interest lies in the events connected with the repressions, deportations of peoples, the situation with prisoners of war. Mechanisms of the war memory formation have changed significantly today. With the veterans of the war passing away, interpersonal communication disappears. There is a growth of public transfer of information about the past by using technical means, such as periodicals, radio, television. Today the formation of the historical connections of Russians' generations meets many obstacles. First of all, these are attempts to distort the historical truth about the war, which threaten the national security of modern Russia. In these circumstances, it is necessary to form respect for the past and respect for the historical memory about the Great Patriotic War. (c) 2018 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

TI  - Novel magnetic multicore nanoparticles designed for MPI and other biomedical applications: From synthesis to first in vivo studies
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Synthesis of novel magnetic multicore particles (MCP) in the nano range, involves alkaline precipitation of iron(II) chloride in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. This step yields green rust, which is oxidized to obtain magnetic nanoparticles, which probably consist of a magnetite/maghemite mixed-phase. Final growth and annealing at 90°C in the presence of a large excess of carboxymethyl dextran gives MCP very promising magnetic properties for magnetic particle imaging (MPI), an emerging medical imaging modality, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The magnetic nanoparticles are biocompatible and thus potential candidates for future biomedical applications such as cardiovascular imaging, sentinel lymph node mapping in cancer patients, and stem cell tracking. The new MCP that we introduce here have three times higher magnetic particle spectroscopy performance at lower and middle harmonics and five times higher MPS signal strength at higher harmonics compared with Resovist. In addition, the new MCP have also an improved in vivo MPI performance compared to Resovist, and we here report the first in vivo MPI investigation of this new generation of magnetic nanoparticles.

TI  - A confessional account of community entry: doing critically reflexive ICT4D work in a deep rural community in South Africa
T2  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper I reflect on the community entry phases of doing a critical ethnography in a traditional Zulu community in a deep rural part of South Africa. I present my reflections in the form of confessional narratives on community entry and on how an Information Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D) project was introduced in the community. Drawing on a basic principle of doing social science research, I ask: In what ways should I achieve self-emancipation, in order to ensure the on-going emancipation and empowerment of the people I engage with? I also ask: How should one do critically reflexive community entry and ICT4D project introduction in communities that embrace a people-orientated worldview? The paper is practice-orientated in that it demonstrates critical self-reflexive community entry in a particular ICT4D project situation, how community entry encounters informed follow-up work, and how cultural interpreters empowered me to do community entry successfully. Methodologically, the paper contributes by demonstrating the value of using narrative examples to represent virtuoso expertise of how I developed knowledge of self-reflexivity while excavating hidden social meanings from an ICT4D project situation.

AB  - The Satellite Radar Interferometry is one of the common methods that allow to measure the land subsidence caused by the underground black coal excavation. The interferometry images processed from the repeat-pass Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems give the spatial image of the terrain subjected to the surface subsidence over mining areas. Until now, the InSAR methods using data from the SAR Systems like ERS-1/ERS-2 and Envisat-1 were limited to a repeat-pass cycle of 35-day only. Recently, the ESA launched Sentinel-1A and 1B, and together they can provide the InSAR coverage in a 6-day repeat cycle. The studied area was the Upper Silesian Coal Basin in Poland, where the underground coal mining causes continuous subsidence of terrain surface and mining tremors (mine-induced seismicity). The main problem was with overlapping the subsidence caused by the mining exploitation with the epicentre tremors. Based on the Sentinel SAR images, research was done in regard to the correlation between the short term ground subsidence range border and the mine-induced seismicity epicentres localisation.

TI  - Trends in pelvic inflammatory disease emergency department visits, United States, 2006-2013
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease is a female genital tract disorder with severe reproductive sequelae. Because of the difficulties in diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease, it is not a reportable condition in many states. Females seeking care in emergency departments are a sentinel population for pelvic inflammatory disease surveillance.OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine trends in diagnoses of acute pelvic inflammatory disease in a nationally representative sample of emergency departments.STUDY DESIGN: All emergency department visits among females aged 15-44 years with an International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code indicating pelvic inflammatory disease during 2006-2013 were assessed from the HealthCare Utilization Project Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. Total and annual percentage changes in the proportion of pelvic inflammatory disease emergency department visits were estimated using trend analyses.RESULTS: While the number of emergency department visits among females aged 15-44 years during 2006-2013 increased (6.5 million to 7.4 million), the percentage of visits due to pelvic inflammatory disease decreased from 0.57% in 2006 to 0.41% in 2013 (total percentage change, -28.4%; annual percent change, -4.3%; 95% confidence interval, -5.7% to -2.9%). The largest decreases were among those aged 15-19 years (total percent change, -40.6%; annual percentage change, -6.6%; 95% confidence interval, -8.6% to -4.4%) and living in the South (total percentage change, -38.0%; annual percentage change, -6.2%; 95% confidence interval, -7.8% to -4.6%). Females aged 15-19 years who lived in the South had a 47.9% decrease in visits due to pelvic inflammatory disease (annual percentage change, -8.4%, 95% confidence interval, -10.4 to -6.5). Patients living in ZIP codes with the lowest median income (<$38,000) had the highest percent of visits with a pelvic inflammatory disease diagnosis; the smallest declines over time were in patients living in ZIP codes with the highest median income (i.e., >$64,000, total percent change, -24.4%; annual percent change, -3.8%; 95% confidence interval, -5.2% to -2.4%). The percentage of emergency department visits due to pelvic inflammatory disease was highest among patients not charged for their visit, self-paying, or those covered by Medicaid, with total percentage changes in these 3 groups of -27.8%, -30.7%, and -35.1%, respectively. Patients with Medicaid coverage had the largest decrease in visits with a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (total percent change, -35.1%; annual percent change, -5.8%; 95% confidence interval, -7.2% to -4.3%).CONCLUSION: Nationally representative data indicate the percentage of emergency department visits with a pelvic inflammatory disease diagnosis decreased during 2006-2013 among females aged 15-44 years, primarily driven by decreased diagnoses of pelvic inflammatory disease among females aged 15-19 years and among women living in the southern United States. Despite declines, a large number of females of reproductive age are receiving care for pelvic inflammatory disease in emergency departments. Patients with lower median income and no or public health insurance status, which may decrease access to and use of health care services, consistently had the highest percentage of emergency department visits due to pelvic inflammatory disease. Future research should focus on obtaining a better understanding of factors influencing trends in pelvic inflammatory disease diagnoses and ways to address the challenges surrounding surveillance for this condition.

AB  - The detection of inland water bodies from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data provides a great advantage over water detection with optical data, since SAR imaging is not impeded by cloud cover. Traditional methods of detecting water from SAR data involves using thresholding methods that can be labor intensive and imprecise. This paper describes Water Across Synthetic Aperture Radar Data (WASARD): a method of water detection from SAR data which automates and simplifies the thresholding process using machine learning on training data created from Geoscience Australia's WOFS algorithm. Of the machine learning models tested, the Linear Support Vector Machine was determined to be optimal, with the option of training using solely the VH polarization or a combination of the VH and VV polarizations. WASARD was able to identify water in the target area with a correlation of 97% with WOFS.

TI  - Feasibility of breast MRI after sentinel procedure for breast cancer with superparamagnetic tracers
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: The gold standard for detection of axillary sentinel lymph nodes uses injection of a radioisotope (99Tc Nanocoll). As an alternative to this method, a magnetometer detecting the superparamagnetic tracer Sienna+(R) can be applied for detection of sentinel lymph nodes.The goal of this study was to determine whether interpretation of breast MRI is impaired by Sienna+(R) tracer residues in the operated breast and axillary lymph nodes after a sentinel procedure using this tracer.Patients and methods: 34 patients who received the Sienna+(R) tracer for marking the sentinel node were invited to undergo a follow-up breast MRI. Native MR images were obtained from breast and axilla. The breast MRIs were evaluated by two independent breast radiologists for Sienna+(R) tracer related artefacts and for the degree of impairment of the MR imaging.Results: 24 of the 34 invited patients took part in this study. The. mean time since injection of Sienna+(R) was 42 months (40.6-45.4 months). Two patients had bilateral surgery with injections in both breasts, leading to a total, of 26 separate cases. One case had to be excluded due to breathing artefacts. In 10 cases (40%), impaired imaging was found. In three cases (12%), the MRI scan reading was impossible due to Sienna+(R) tracer residues, the other 12 cases (48%) showed no restriction.In the subgroup of patients treated with breast conserving surgery, tracer residue artefacts were found in 13 of 17 patients (76.5%).Conclusion: To our knowledge, in this study for the first time MR feasibility after Sienna injection was investigated. Sienna+(R) impaired breast MRI after a mean follow-up time of 42 months in half of the cases. Further research is needed to investigate time and field-strength dependency of tracer detectability as well as the diagnostic impact of these artifacts on contrast-enhanced imaging in a clinical setting.

AB  - Although there are numerous land cover classification methods, still some restraints presents while labelling distinct classes to which it actually belongs to, without any past available information For an SAR image backscattering coefficient and its texture are significant characteristic to portray an image. In this paper, a classification technique for PALSAR image using decision tree based on intensity and its texture statistical features has been developed. The statistic texture features like homogeneity, mean, entropy, variance, contrast, correlation, dissimilarity, and second moment is analyzed and their capability to classify SAR image into diverse land cover classes has been evaluated. The Seperability index idea is used to analyze the prominence of texture features in classifying each land cover class from remaining classes. The proposed classification method is applied on ALOS PALSAR HV polarized image. The decision tree based classifier uses these data to classify individual pixel into one of the four categories: water, bare soil, urban and vegetation. The quantitative results shown by the proposed method gives overall classification accuracy of about 95.88% and kappa coefficient of 0.9490.

TI  - Subsidence in the Kathmandu Basin, before and after the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha Earthquake, Nepal Revealed from Small Baseline Subset-DInSAR Analysis
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence in densely urbanized areas is a global problem that is primarily caused by excessive groundwater withdrawal. The Kathmandu Basin is one such area where subsidence due to groundwater depletion has been a major problem in recent years. Moreover, on 25 April 2015, this basin experienced large crustal movements caused by the Gorkha earthquake (Mw 7.8). Consequently, the effects of earthquake-induced deformation could affect the temporal and spatial nature of anthropogenic subsidence in the basin. However, this effect has not yet been fully studied. In this paper, we applied the SBAS-DInSAR technique to estimate the spatiotemporal displacement of land subsidence in the Kathmandu Basin before and after the Gorkha earthquake, using 16 ALOS-1 Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images during the pre-seismic period and 26 Sentinel-1 A/B SAR images during the pre- and post-seismic periods. The results showed that the mean subsidence rate in the central part of the basin was about -8.2cm/year before the earthquake. The spatial extents of the subsiding areas were well-correlated with the spatial distributions of the compressible clay layers in the basin. We infer from time-series InSAR analysis that subsidence in the Kathmandu basin could be associated with fluvio-lacustrine (clay) deposits and local hydrogeological conditions. However, after the mainshock, the subsidence rate significantly increased to -15 and -12cm/year during early post-seismic (108days) and post-seismic (2015-2016) period, respectively. Based on a spatial analysis of the subsidence rate map, the entire basin uplifted during the co-seismic period has started to subside and become stable during the early-post-seismic period. This is because of the elastic rebound of co-seismic deformation. However, interestingly, the localized areas show increased subsidence rates during both the early-post- and post-seismic periods. Therefore, we believe that the large co-seismic deformation experienced in this basin might induce the local subsidence to increase in rate, caused by oscillations of the water table level in the clay layer.

AB  - Amount of remote sensing data rapidly increases. To transfer, store, and disseminate images, one has to apply compression. Lossless compression often does not satisfy requirements. In turn, lossy compression introduces distortions where their level should be controlled not to lose value of remote sensing data. In this paper, we propose a way to accurately predict mean square error of introduced distortions for DCT-based coder. Peculiarity of our approach is that prediction is considerably faster than compression. This allows estimating the introduced distortion level for a given quantization step and quick adjusting the quantization step. The proposed approach is applicable to both practically noise-free and noisy remote sensing images

T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the semantics and functions of the text of destiny in Lermontov's "The Hero of Our Time" which is the object of reflection and experience of the novel's protagonist. The mythological representation of destiny is transformed into the element of the narrator's protagonists' worldview. This idea is conflated with the plot and narrative deployment of the text of destiny as a system of signs containing encrypted information about various manifestations and actions of destiny. The article shows that Pechorin accepts the reality of destiny and its interference into human life. He emphasizes his dependence on the behavior of destiny and its unknown pattern. The role of the text of destiny sharply increases in the last part, activating the goal significant for the structural organization of the novel. The dispute about the predestination creates a situation of a dangerous game with destiny. The denouement of the final novel returns the action to the conversation about the predestination and the text of destiny, emphasizing the significance of the metaphysical experience of the protagonist. The author reveals the important features of the text of destiny, and shows how the characters of the novel interpret the events via the manifestations of destiny. Special attention is paid to the protagonist's argument about predetermination. The article considers the plot situations significant for solving the issue of predestination The peculiarities of the relationship between the protagonist and destiny and the specifics of the text of destiny formation are revealed. Finally, in his analysis, the author resolves the connection between the incompleteness of the protagonist's personality and the incompleteness of the text of destiny.

AB  - As the Gulf of Mexico has experienced major environmental hazards in the recent past, e.g. the BP oil spill in 2010, landfall of major hurricanes, and the frequent outbreak of red tide (Karenia brevis), it is required to evaluate possible alterations in the water quality and biogeochemical balance of this partially enclosed waterbody. Chlorophyll concentrations (Chl-a) and sea surface temperature (SST) Level-2 data from five satellites during the period from 2009 to 2013 were analyzed for their spatial, temporal, and inter-annual variability. Based on the evaluation of data from 24 transects from the West Florida Shelf (WFS), highest Chl-a was observed for the sector from St. Petersburg to Sanibel Island. Additionally, high Chl-a was observed for the Big Bend region, particularly during the spring and early summer. SST distribution also closely followed Chl-a distribution, even though occasional uptick in SST values were noticed from the inner continental shelf even during high primary productivity. Furthermore, between 2010 and 2011, monthly Chl-a and SST varied across the shelf significantly and can be due to the incursion of the Loop Current towards the WFS, as suggested by Weisberg et al. (2014).

T2  - REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications in Urban Environments III
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Urban green is indispensable from an urban ecological and social point of view and fulfils important functions such as dust binding, temperature reduction, wind damping or groundwater recharge. Especially for bioclimatic modeling, knowledge of size, structure and green volume of the urban vegetation is essential. Manual mapping of vegetation structures is timeconsuming and cost-intensive and can only ever be carried out in locally limited study areas. Active and passive remote sensing technologies in combination with automated methods for information extraction offer the opportunity to record the green structure in urban areas differentiated according to vegetation types. The new globally and freely available data provided by the European Copernicus Program raises the question whether these data are suitable for mapping and quantifying the urban green structure, including an accuracy estimation. Previous studies on the usability of Sentinel-2 data for vegetation analysis were essentially limited to crop and tree species classification in open space. The approach presented here thus considers for the first time the application of this data in a purely urban environment. Here we present a modeling approach based on multiple regression models. A Sentinel-2A scene from July 4, 2015 covering the greater Dresden area served as the input data set. After atmospheric correction of the satellite image scene 10 spectral channels were available. A high-resolution vegetation cover model with a grid width of 50 cm was available as a reference data set for the entire study area (City of Dresden, Germany). This takes into account the vegetation classes deciduous trees, conifers, shrubs, low (grassy) vegetation and arable land. Thus the area share of these vegetation types could be determined aggregated for each pixel of the satellite image scene. In addition, vegetation indices (NDVI and others) were calculated using suitable channels. For the prediction of each vegetation class, estimation equations were drawn up and evaluated with regard to their quality. Especially for deciduous and coniferous trees, satisfactory model quality values could be obtained, so that the green component prediction in these cases represents a useful basis for the determination of the green structure at the building block level in urban areas.

T2  - PSYCHOLINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents modern trends in the change of the semantic field of the concept "war". Based on the analysis of mass media in Russia, Ukraine and the USA, we demonstrated the regularities and interdependences of the mass media content and changes in the conceptual worldview of the people that consume information. We underlined the link between the changes in the forms of international conflicts and the increase of the units contributing to the semantic field of the concept "war". We analised how the information and communicative space effects the change of the conceptual (mental, cognitive) worldview of the public.Analysis of the semantic compatibility of the features of the concept "war" in mass media has revealed that apart from the military and armament themes, it contains the semantic units related to informational and psychological tools of influence. In the result of the systematic application of the concept "war" in relation to such semantic units as "informational", "psychological", "cyber", "hybrid", "fake news", "sanctions", etc. there takes place a fixation of compatibility of new semantic units with the concept "war".The broadening of the extent of the concept occurred due to the addition of two objects: "informational virtual component" comprising informational and psychological spheres of influence as well as a "technological component", on which the informational security of the state is based. Thus, the modern extent and intent of the concept "war" includes not only academic dictionary definitions, but also the definitions that refer to the involvement of tools and techniques aimed at the securing an armless victory in the confrontation.The findings of the research also demonstrated a certain difference in the development of the concept in Ukrainian, western and pro-Russian mass media. While "war" in the pro-Russian mass media is covered in connection with an open aggression accompanied by the use of weapons, this concept in Ukrainian and western mass media is used in relation to psychological and information influence.Thus, at the current stage, the broadening of the extent of the concept "war" has taken place, which is interrelated with the expansion of the semantic field, and is reflected in the change in the conceptual picture of the world within this concept.

AB  - In this paper, ground deformation and source model of the 12 November 2017 Kermanshah Earthquake (border region between Iran and Iraq) are investigated by using ALOS-2 ScanSAR and Sentinel-1A/B TOPSAR co-seismic Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) measurements. Geodetic inversion has been performed to constrain source parameters and invert slip distribution on the fault plane. Stress changes on the source fault and neighboring active faults around this area are estimated based on co-seismic deformation. The best-fit source model shows a reverse fault with a relative large right-lateral component, striking 353.5 degrees NNW-SSE and dipping 16.3 degrees NE. The maximum slip is up to 3.8m at 1214km depth and the inferred seismic moment is 1.01x1020 Nm, corresponding to MW 7.3. The positive stress changes on the neighboring active faults indicate that this event may trigger other earthquakes on the Zagros Mountain Front Fault (MFF).

T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF IMMUNOLOGY, VOL 36
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The liver is a key, frontline immune tissue. Ideally positioned to detect pathogens entering the body via the gut, the liver appears designed to detect, capture, and clear bacteria, viruses, and macromolecules. Containing the largest collection of phagocytic cells in the body, this organ is an important barrier between us and the outside world. Importantly, as portal blood also transports a large number of foreign but harmless molecules (e.g., food antigens), the liver's default immune status is anti-inflammatory or immuno-tolerant; however, under appropriate conditions, the liver is able to mount a rapid and robust immune response. This balance between immunity and tolerance is essential to liver function. Excessive inflammation in the absence of infection leads to sterile liver injury, tissue damage, and remodeling; insufficient immunity allows for chronic infection and cancer. Dynamic interactions between the numerous populations of immune cells in the liver are key to maintaining this balance and overall tissue health.

AB  - For the monitoring of the global 3-D distribution of aerosol components, we developed the method to retrieve the vertical profiles of water-soluble, light absorbing carbonaceous, dust, and sea salt particles by the synergy of CALIOP and MODIS data. The aerosol product from the synergistic method is expected to be better than the individual products of CALIOP and MODIS. We applied the method to the biomass-burning event in Africa and the dust event in West Asia. The reasonable results were obtained; the much amount of the water-soluble and light absorbing carbonaceous particles were estimated in the biomass-burning event, and the dust particles were estimated in the dust event.

AB  - The satellite-derived information has been widely used to observe the large-scale dynamics of marine ecosystems and to estimate primary productivity in the world ocean. This study is devoted to the assessment of opportunities for modelling of primary production through the satellite data (MODIS-Aqua and -Terra) on the sea surface temperature. The analysis of the South-eastern Baltic Sea in situ datasets of ecosystem parameters, obtained for 2003-2015, shows that the temperature of the upper 5-m layer is an efficient indicator of primary production horizontal distribution. A simple regional empirical model has been developed. It demonstrates the connection between primary production and remote sea surface temperature, and the variability of primary production values. The model performs a strong statistical significance and sufficient accuracy for practical use. The relationships between the measured and modelled estimates of primary production are tested by using linear regression.

AB  - The processes of sense formation are connected with human selfcommunication, which is often a reflection of interpersonal dialogue. Personal meanings born in the process of communication can be of two types: connected with the subject of communication, and connected with the communication act itself. Analyzing acts of virtual communication for the development of new relationships in it, without guarantees of the authenticity of the subjects, is impossible, and therefore it is only expedient to analyze virtual communication from the point of view of the development of the subject of communication in it. The article analyzes episodes of interpersonal communication in social networks, thematically related to culture, politics, worldview problems. The following indicators serve as criteria for their content: the seriousness of the declared topic of communication; the concreteness of the questions posed; duration of discussion of the topic; deviation from common stereotypes; the reasoning of self opinion.

TI  - Current Status and Future Perspectives of Axillary Management in the Neoadjuvant Setting
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Axillary surgery has undergone considerable changes in recent years, especially in relation to patients who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Due to constantly decreasing rates of recurrence and death from breast cancer, modern surgical strategies aim at de-escalating the extent of local treatment and avoiding unnecessary procedures. This relates especially to lymph node surgery which is associated with considerable morbidity. In patients who initially present with clinically node-negative disease, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is increasingly performed after NACT. The determination of the post-NACT nodal status does not only spare patients from additional surgery but also allows the assessment of pathologic complete response which is increasingly becoming an important tool for treatment planning. Since more than 70% of these patients have a ypN0 status after NACT, future trials will aim to identify patients who might be spared any axillary surgery after NACT. In patients who initially present with positive lymph nodes, the success rates of SLNB in terms of detection and accuracy are less favorable compared to those in patients who undergo primary surgery. The clinical significance of this is unclear. To reduce unnecessary axillary dissection in patients with cN1ycN0 status, prospective outcome data after SLNB without further lymph node removal are urgently needed. Improvements in surgical technique by localizing positive nodes at the time of diagnosis and removing them in a targeted surgical procedure (targeted axillary dissection) are under evaluation. Risk assessment and patient selection (including gene expression profiles) might be other ways of safely omitting axillary dissection. (C) 2018 S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg

AB  - Study of the Black Sea neritic ecosystem is of great theoretical and practical significance owing to the anthropogenic load on its coastal areas. Variability of the ecological condition of these areas can be defined by the results of studying spatial-temporal variability of the nutrients and the suspended organic matter (SOM) content distributions. Such studies permit to assess the marine ecosystem productivity, intensity of biochemical processes, and flexibility of this ecosystem to the impact of various natural and anthropogenic factors. In recent decades, along with the expeditionary studies, satellite observations of the marine environment bio-optical parameters obtained by color scanners became widely used. Such kind of observations allows obtaining qualitatively new (as for its spatial-temporal characteristics) information. Based on the multi-year (1979-1995) expeditionary observations of distribution of the SOM components' concentration and the bio-optical parameters (chlorophyll a concentration, light absorption and scattering indices) resulted from the satellite data (SeaWiFS, MODIS, 1997-2015), considered are the peculiarities of spatial-temporal variability of their distribution in the shelf areas of the western Black Sea. The degree of the effect of the riverine discharge and the open sea water masses upon the distribution of the parameters under study in the northwestern part of the sea makes it possible to define four areas (western, northern, central and eastern), and in the coastal zone of the western part - the Romanian and the Bulgarian ones. The statistical assessments of seasonal variations of the considered indices are obtained for these areas. Increase of the SOM components' concentrations in the summer-autumn period in late 1980s and early 1990s with their anomalously high values in 1992 is noted. It is shown that the seasonal interannual variability in the concentrations of the SOM components and the values of the bio-optical parameters is conditioned by the variations in the riverine discharge volume, its run to the sea, and climatic shifts.

TI  - The Sacral Function of Language, Literature and the Bible in the Context of Borislav Pekic's Novel <i>The Time of Miracles</i>
T2  - SLAVIA MERIDIONALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay promotes the thesis about mythogenesis as a form of cosmogenesis. It also addresses the sacral function of language in literature and in the Bible. It follows an approach according to which Biblical myths are constantly re-created (Lk. 11; Jn. 9) and their archetypal schemata - actualized. Specifically, the paper demonstrates that through the actualization of the mythical narratives from the Bible, the universal archetype of the Miracle (mystery, secrecy) is essentially actualized. This interpretation is made on the basis of two illuminative fragments from the novel The Time of Miracles (1965) by the contemporary Serbian writer Borislav Pekic (1930-1992).Borislav Pekic reads the coded language of the mytho-biblical mysterious vision of reality with meticulous, historical, social, political, and psychological attention, and yet, instead of submitting it to a radical parody of hyper-realistic qualities, he demythologizes them only to re-mythologize the most sensitive sacral places in the mythical-biblical matrix: the miracles of Jesus. Pekic creates a mythopoetic chronotope of a "time of miracles and deaths". In contrast to the usual categories - mythical time, historical time, time of dreams, he introduces the category of "time of miracles" or, in other words, "miraculous time". "Time" itself, understood as a replica of the Being, initiates the question of miracle creation as a radical type of mythogenesis. Connecting Christian miracles with death, Pekic actualizes the archetypical vision of the resurrection. He knows that the modern world, whose humanism is put at stake, needs a spiritual renaissance (resurrection). Only upon the foundations of the renewed spirituality can a more humane civilization be established.Pekic's novel, sensitive to the antinomies of reality and of the human psyche, reaffirms the principle of the fictional, regardless of whether it has been based on biblical narratives. Contrary to the stereotypical Christian perspective of the miracle, Pekic creates an individual performance of the miracle, both sceptical and emphatic, both biblical and imaginary. Pekic demystifies the Christian story through the prism of pre-Christian consciousness, subtly pointing to the need of renewal of free, non-canonical thought. This context implies the affirmation of the vitality of the multifocal and carnivalized pagan matrix, without rejecting the importance of the Christian one. As a result, the novel The Time of Miracles is experienced as a "perlocutionary act of speech" in which the latent, sacral function of language is activated, its power to transform the worldview, and indirectly, the world itself.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents some observations of scientists about the life and traditions of the indigenous small-numbered peoples of Siberia - Khanty and Selkups. First of all, the most interesting are those moments of innovations in the life of Khanty and Selkups, which allow us to trace and explain the influence of their worldview on behavior, rituals, and traditions. V.M. Kulemzin reports on the possibility of penetration into the spiritual world of the Khanty by observing the behavior of the Khanty fisherman, for whom the invisible world of spirits is quite real. He believes that the creek between the lakes was dug by the pike-mammoth, that the spirits help him in fishing, strengthening the stakes in the constipation with a sacred hammer, that the steam from the soup is enough for feeding the spirits, that the sacred fire, born by friction, helps to deliver gifts to the dead ancestors and gods on sky. V.M. Kulemzin suggests that the cults of elk and of bear are closely related, while the cult of elk is more ancient, and this fact requires special study.V.P. Zinoviev shares with readers his youth observations of his compatriots, the Selkup of Chvorhol-et yurts (Tyukhterevs). He was struck by the carelessness of the Tyukhterev inhabitants, who had no reserves and lived from catching to catching elk, ducks, fish. The Selkups were extremely careless about harvesting vegetables for the winter. Their lack of respect for industrial work the author explains not by laziness, but by the psychology of the person of appropriating society, who always had the opportunity to turn to the storeroom of mother nature, and therefore did not make special food reserves. Even in present time, when nature has become impoverished, and the transition to productive labor has become a necessity, the Selkups can not abandon traditions and previous ideas about the world.V.P. Zinoviev was also struck by the full gender equality in the distribution of products: even the youngest member of the family had the right to his share of food, even if it was harmful for his health vodka. According to the authors, this is one of the reasons for the general alcoholization of the Selkups.The authors came to the conclusion that the degree of combining innovations and traditions can be very different, depending on the field of activity and specific circumstances, on the intensity of acculturation and assimilation processes. At the same time, they note that the danger to traditional cultures lies not only in reducing the natural and economic basis of their existence, but also in their persistent rejection of new ways of life support.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reviews the main historical stages of the development and implementation of the largest environmental project of the late 20th century-the "General Plan to Combat Desertification of Black Lands and Kizlyar Pastures." The goal of this project was to implement a scientifically grounded set of measures to stop desertification processes, improve the economic state of pastures, increase their fertility, and protect lands. The implementation of the general plan has led to the performance of agroforestry works in an area of more than 7000 km(2), the fixing of more than 4000 km(2) of mobile sands, and the restoration of more than 2500 km(2) of pastures. According to the forecasts, if all of the measures stipulated by the general plan were observed, the area of the ecological disaster zone would decrease and then completely disappear. A study conducted with Landsat satellite images showed that this forecast has partially come true: the area of open sands that was recorded in the test plot in 2016 (27.3 km(2)) is only 1% of the open sands area recorded in 1975, which is a consequence of the implementation of the general plan, a number of environmental measures, and favorable climate fluctuations.

T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the article considers features of the mythological conception of the world structure, which is represented by the works of the ethnic artist Konstantin Pankov, who focused his attention on the imagery of the earthly incarnation of the cosmic order.Objective: is the identification of elements of developed pre-scientific ideas about being, their embodiment in the creative practice of contemporary artists, combining different types of thinking - imaginative and logical.Research materials: the work is devoted to research on the problems of amateur and naive art, theoretical research in the field of mythological thinking. Art criticism and critical literature on K. Pankov's works, paintings and reproductions of his works were attracted.Results and novelty of the research: reconstruction of the traditional world model implemented by K. Pankov reflects the relationship between man and the world, the microcosm and the macrocosm. His cosmological model is built on the basis of ideas about the horizontal structure of the universe, which is supplemented by a vertical structure. This model of the world is supplemented by numerical symbols. K. Pankov organically includes the mythological paradigms in the metaphysical description of a certain territory. As a result, the material world acquires hierarchy, integrity, sacredness and cosmology. This understanding of the world is established as a manifestation of ancient ideas that determined the paradigms of creativity and the original style of this original artist. Analysis of the creative heritage of K. Pankov from the standpoint of the "logic" of archaic thinking, mythological symbols, parallels with the works of contemporary artists demonstrate a new perspective in the analysis of master paintings. The scientific and practical significance of the article is determined by the identification in the artist's work of early worldview constructs preserved in the system of more developed thinking and constituting the foundation of traditional cultures.

The analysis is given from positions of philosophical and esthetic conceptions of XX century.Objective: to reveal on ethnic material an originality of the esthetic position of G. S. Rayshev in aspect of modernist conceptions of art.Research materials: the philosophical conceptions of art related to the notion of "ideal reality", theoretical researches on art of the Ob Ugrians, problems of the modern art are studied. Art criticism and critical literature on G. Rayshev's creativity, pictures and reproductions of his works, catalogs of exhibitions of the artist are used.Results and novelty of the research: consideration of creativity of G. S. Rayshev in aspect of philosophical and esthetic conceptions gives the chance to reveal an originality of works of the artist and at the same time to delve into a wider range of problems related to questions of communication of art with reality. The scientific novelty of the article is in the chosen aspect of the analysis of the artist's works: definition of ways of the embodiment of "ideal reality" in creative practice of G. Rayshev on the basis of "convergence" of basic provisions of modernist conceptions of art with an esthetic position of the artist. It is implemented at the substantive level with the involvement of traditional ethnic conceptions. Correlation of conceptions of symbolization of reality with early worldview constructs preserved in the system of traditional cultures shows a possibility of philosophical understanding of the world on the basis of the established ethnic constructs.

AB  - The present study mainly focuses on the comparison and quantification of meteorological droughts with agricultural droughts to understand their relationship to the occurrences and intensities of droughts. This study is based on analysis of the changing agro-climatological drought conditions from the year 2001 to 2017, over the districts of Marathwada, which are known to be the most drought-prone regions of the Maharashtra, India. To quantify the drought severity, Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) from TRMM and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) from MODIS datasets have been derived and compared. This study indicated that the years 2002, 2009, 2014 and 2015 were the most severe drought periods over Marathwada. Parts of Nanded, Aurangabad and Latur districts were the highest drought-affected areas from last 17 years, where the frequency of agricultural drought incidence was more than eight years. Over the districts of Hingoli and Parbhani, decreasing rainfall trends plus highly negative values of SPI (<=-1.5) in the month of July shows a major concern for agricultural activities. Positive correlation-ship (41%) was noticed between SPI and VCI during the study period, but it was not statistically significant. In the year 2015, which was one of the intense drought years, it is noted that the agricultural drought was the most influencing drought type covering about 53% of the affected area. This study thus can help in identification of drought types and their intensities with spatial extent through an area specific interdisciplinary approach which in turn will help to develop region-specific drought mitigation and management strategies.

AB  - Bayah is an area that is well known to have the composition of the soil of mostly limestone which may influence the organic matter content. The land use and slope gradient also influence the organic matter content of the soil. This study aims to determine the distribution of organic matter content by using Landsat 8 and linear regression of statistical analysis which is associated with land use, type of soil, rock type, and slope as the factors that are influencing it. This study uses the normalized difference soil index (NDSI) algorithm to see the soil organic matter content and also using Landsat 8 OLI as a reference for the determination of soil sampling. Spatial analysis and descriptive analysis will be done by creating classifications of soil organic matter content, using the methods of multi-criteria analysis (MCA). Overall the organic matter content in Bayah soil is comparatively low. The distribution of the soil organic matter with the classification of medium and low there was almost total throughout in Bayah and dominated by land use mixed plantation and paddy fields that were located on a slope of 15-25% and 25-40%.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims at delineating groundwater potential zones using geospatial technology and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) techniques in mining impacted hard rock terrain of Ramgarh and part of Hazaribagh districts, Jharkhand, India. Relevant thematic layers were prepared and assigned weight based on Saaty's 9-point scale and normalized by eigenvector technique of AHP to identify groundwater prospect in the study area. The weighted linear combination method was applied to prepare the groundwater potential index in geographic information system. Final groundwater prospects were classified as excellent, very good, good, moderate, poor and very poor groundwater potential zones. Study thus revealed that the excellent, very good and good groundwater potential zones, respectively, cover 148.3, 373.66 and 438.86 km(2) of the study area, whereas the poor groundwater potential zone covers 180.05 km(2). Validation was done through a receiver operating characteristic curve, which indicated that AHP had good prediction accuracy (AUC = 75.45%).

AB  - As already described in previous chapters, the obesity epidemic in America is on the rise, with approximately 36% of Americans being obese, and more than 6% having Class III obesity (8% in women) defined as a BMI >= 40 kg/m(2). The rising obesity rate in women has profound effects on gynecologic malignancy occurrence and treatment. As surgery is a part of treating the majority of gynecologic malignancies, understanding the nuances of intra-operative and peri-operative management of the obese patient is an essential skill of the gynecologic oncologist. This chapter will briefly review the medical and anesthetic considerations for surgery in the obese woman with a gynecologic malignancy. It will focus on the impact of obesity in surgery in both endometrial cancer and in ovarian cancer as well as mention the impact on other gynecologic cancers. The chapter concludes with a mention of techniques that can be employed to facilitate surgery in obese women.

TI  - Classification of key aerosol types and their frequency distributions based on satellite remote sensing data at an industrially polluted city in the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, characterization of columnar aerosol optical properties and classifying the major aerosol types was investigated at an urban-industrial city, Nanjing in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region over East China using simultaneous data sets retrieved from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) sensors during 2004-2015. A notable spatiotemporal heterogeneity was observed in the optical properties of aerosols on the seasonal scale over East China. Aerosol optical depth at 550nm (AOD(550)) exhibited pronounced seasonal variability over Nanjing in the YRD, with higher values during summer and spring seasons and lower in winter. angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE(470-660)) found higher in summer indicating the relative abundance of fine mode aerosols over the coarse mode. We also used the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model for presenting cluster trajectory analysis which revealed that the airmasses from different source regions contributed greatly to aerosol loading during the study period. In addition, we followed two techniques for studying classification of major aerosol types based on the predefined thresholds. Using the AOD-AE method (here called as Technique-I), five major aerosol types were identified via, continental clean (CC), marine (MA), biomass burning/urban-industrial (BU), desert dust (DD), and mixed (MX). In all the seasons, MX is the dominant aerosol type followed by the BU and DD type aerosols during summer and spring seasons, respectively. Further, the sub-classification of aerosol types was carried out considering into account of the characteristics of absorbing aerosol index (AAI) (here called as Technique-II). The two clustering techniques showed reasonable consistency in the obtained results. The various aerosol types (absorbing and non-absorbing) and their change over a region are highly helpful in fine tuning the models to decrease the uncertainty in the radiative and climatic effects of aerosols.

CL  - Bhubaneswar, INDIA
AB  - Apart from positioning, velocity and time transfer applications, the Global Position System (GPS) offers an exceptional opportunity for probing the space weather as well as atmospheric weather as the signals traverse various layers of earth's atmosphere. Following ionosphere delay, the troposphere delay is regarded as a non-negligible propagation threat to GPS and other navigation system performances. Present paper focuses on estimating Precipitable Water Vapour (PWV) which along with the dry gas pressure is responsible for total zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD) in GPS positioning. GPS observables at seven different locations in and around Indian subcontinent are processed through GAMIT that involves phase double difference positioning solution along through modeling of the delay parameters. With additional observed/modeled temperature and pressure parameters, the zenith hydrostatic delay (ZHD), zenith wet delay (ZWD), and PWV are estimated. The GPS- PWV is further validated with the ERA-Interim reanalysis data for investigating the disparity over the region. We noticed an acceptable agreement between the two at Bangalore (towards the equator) followed by underestimation at Hyderabad and overestimation at the farthest location Lucknow, through straddling across the average minimum values is perceived at KLU- Guntur location in India. The interpretation from the observations motivates further analysis of the GPS-based water vapor parameter at diverse locations involving the tropical wet and dry climate over Hyderabad and Guntur, semi-arid climatic conditions over Bangalore, and humid-subtropical climate over Lucknow. The outcomes of the paper would support lower atmospheric climatology as well as better mitigation of tropospheric delay errors ensuing relatively precise regional positioning services.

T2  - GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGIES IN LAND RESOURCES MAPPING, MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Soil properties show a high degree of spatial variability due to the combined effect of physical, chemical, or biological processes that operate within the soil profile with different intensities at different scales. Knowledge of spatial variability of soil properties in the form of spatial continuous surfaces is important for identifying suitable zones for agricultural land management. To accurately describe the spatial variability, a very intensive survey is required. These intensive surveys are labor- and time-consuming. Soil maps can also be viewed as a source of spatial information on soil properties. However, these maps are prepared using pedological and morphological studies of pedons and are themselves based on point observations. The soil physical and chemical properties may be found to vary within a soil map unit. These maps also lack the required information of all the soil properties. Another method to get a spatial continuous raster of soil properties is to correlate them with satellite data, particularly hyperspectral data. This method requires high computations and sophisticated methodologies. In such conditions, spatial interpolation methods provide tools to analyze the spatial variabilities of soil properties and provide a spatial continuous layer by estimating the values of unsampled sites using data from existing point observations within the same region. This chapter reviews some of the popular spatial interpolation techniques used in soil science.

AB  - The capabilities of satellite data and geographic information system (GIS) to assess and monitor land resources are escalating with the technical advancements. However, the costs of these data and the GIS softwares are barrier to their use by broader community, particularly in developing countries. To maximize the scientific and societal benefits of the spatial data, open data and softwares are being promoted. Several satellite data from different sources with a wide array of spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric resolutions are now being made available free to all categories of users. To analyze the satellite data of widely differing characteristics and other spatial and nonspatial data from different sources, rapid advancements have been observed in free/open-source software (FOSS) development in the field of GIS. This chapter discusses the availability of open spatial data (satellite and vector) and open-source GIS softwares (OSGS). The viability of adoption of OSGS as an alternative to proprietary softwares has also been discussed.

TI  - Estimation of winter wheat crop growth parameters using time series Sentinel-1A SAR data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar analysis of time series data at C-band was carried out to estimate the winter wheat crop growth parameters. Five different date images were acquired during January 2015-April 2015 at different growth stages from tillering to ripening in Varanasi district, India. The winter wheat crop parameters, i.e. leaf area index, vegetation water content (VWC), fresh biomass (FB), dry biomass (DB) and plant height (PH) were estimated using random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network regression (ANNR) and linear regression (LR) algorithms. The Ground Range Detected products of Interferometric Wide (IW) Swath were used at VV polarization. The three different subplots of 1m(2) area were taken for the measurement of crop parameters at every growth stage. In total, 73 samples were taken as the training data-sets and 39 samples were taken as testing data-sets. The highest sensitivity (adj. R-2=0.95579) of backscattering with VWC was found using RFR algorithm, whereas the lowest sensitivity (adj. R-2=0.66201) was found for the PH using LR algorithm. Overall results indicate more accurate estimation of winter wheat parameters by the RFR algorithm followed by SVR, ANNR and LR algorithms.

T2  - BIOREMEDIATION: APPLICATIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The waste generation and disposal into natural water bodies become a serious topic to be concerned by researchers today. Consequently, there is a demand for new strategies and technologies to address wastewater treatment and subsequent recycle and reuse especially in arid/semiarid areas. The harmful microbial load in raw sewage, toxic chemicals, and nutrients may cause pollution and can render water utilities unfit for human consumption or recreational activities. Biological treatment process is advantageous and constitutes tools to biodegrade organic matter, transfer toxic compounds into harmless products, and remove nutrient in wastewater microbiology. Bio-monitoring employs sentinel or indicator species in water bodies to infer water quality, ecosystem health status, and to protect public health from waterborne risks. Next-Generation Sequencing is one of the most leveraging studies focus on the ecology of microbial-mediated processes that influence freshwater quality such as algal blooms, contaminant biodegradation, and pathogen dissemination. Sequencing methods targeting small subunit (SSU) rRNA hypervariable regions have allowed for identification of microbial species which serve as bioindicators for sewage contamination in raw, treated, semi-treated water utilities. In addition, hidden diversity of unknown or uncultured microorganisms reveals the genetic capabilities for biodegradation of toxins and other contaminants. This chapter aims to provide brief knowledge about the development of bioindicators for sewage pollution and microbial source tracking, characterizing the distribution of toxin and antibiotic resistance genes in water samples. The assessment of biological risk, suitability, and unfairness inherent in the application of Next-Generation Sequencing may be a prior concern.

TI  - Prediction of spatial soil organic carbon distribution using Sentinel-2A and field inventory data in Sariska Tiger Reserve
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamic and vigorous top soil is the source for healthy flora, fauna, and humans, and soil organic matters are the underpinning for healthy and productive soils. Organic components in the soil play significant role in stimulating soil productivity processes and vegetation development. This article deals with the scientific demand for estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) in forest using geospatial techniques. We assessed distribution of SOC using field and satellite data in Sariska Tiger Reserve located in the Aravalli Hill Range, India. This study utilized the visible and near-infrared reflectance data of Sentinel-2A satellite. Three predictor variables namely Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, and Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index were derived to examine the relationship between soil and SOC and to identify the biophysical characteristic of soil. Relationship between SOC (ground and predicted) and leaf area index (LAI) measured through satellite data was examined through regression analysis. Coefficient of correlation (R (2)) was found to be 0.95 (p value < 0.05) for predicted SOC and satellite measured LAI. Thus, LAI can effectively be used for extracting SOC using remote sensing data. Soil organic carbon stock map generated through Kriging model for Landsat 8 OLI data demonstrated variation in spatial SOC stocks distribution. The model with 89% accuracy has proved to be an effective tool for predicting spatial distribution of SOC stocks in the study area. Thus, optical remote sensing data have immense potential for predicting SOC at larger scale.

AB  - Shallow aquifers in the densely-populated areas of the Indo-Gangetic plain are severely polluted with arsenic (As). The occurrence of As and its spatial concentration variability are conditioned by the geomorphological setting of the Holocene floodplain, with the highest concentrations in elevated point-bar surrounded by clay-filled oxbow lakes (clay plugs). The work hypothesis is that the As is locally derived from the clay plugs. In this study, the potential As volume in the clay plugs is calculated, and the migration process of arsenic from clay plug to adjacent point bar is studied. Satellite data in combination with a side-scan sonar survey in present-day oxbow lakes, and As concentrations in sediment from a well were used to calculate the sediment volume of the clay plug, the potential volume of As, and the contact area between the clay plug and adjacent point bar, and to estimate the initial diffusion flux of dissolved As from clay plug to the adjacent point bar.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - A global operational land imager (GOLI) Landsat-8 daytime active fire detection algorithm is presented. It utilizes established contextual active fire detection approaches but takes advantage of the significant increase in fire reflectance in Landsat-8 band 7 (2.20 mu m) relative to band 4 (0.66 mu m). The detection thresholds are fixed and based on a statistical examination of 39 million non-burning Landsat-8 pixels. Multi-temporal tests based on band 7 reflectance and relative changes in normalized difference vegetation index in the previous six months are used to reduce commissions errors. The probabilities of active fire detection for the GOLI and two recent Landsat-8 active fire detection algorithms are simulated to provide insights into their performance with respect to the fire size and temperature. The algorithms are applied to 11 Landsat-8 images that encompass a range of burning conditions and environments. Commission and omission errors are assessed by visual interpretation of detected active fire locations and by examination of the Landsat-8 images and higher spatial resolution Google Earth imagery. The GOLI algorithm has lower omission and comparable commission errors than the recent Landsat-8 active fire detection algorithms. The GOLI algorithm has demonstrable potential for global application and is suitable for implementation with other Landsat-like reflective wavelength sensors.

M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study was to mapping the potential avalanche susceptible zones in Siachen region of the Western Indian Himalaya. A geospatial analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model based on expert judgements has been applied in this study. Five most important terrain based avalanche occurrence parameters including slope, aspect, curvature, elevation and ground cover are employed in the present model. The ASTER GDEM and Landsat 8 OLI imagery are used to generate the avalanche occurrence parameters. A pairwise comparison matrix is computed to estimate the weight values for input terrain parameters. These weight values are then assigned to each respective avalanche occurrence parameter and employed in a geospatial AHP model to generate an avalanche susceptibility map. Finally, an avalanche inventory has been utilized to validate the results. The avalanche susceptibility map has been compared with the avalanche inventory map by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC-AUC) technique.

AB  - Remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) have emerged as the most effective tools in generating up-to-date, reliable information on soil and land resources of large regions in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner. Advances in spatial, spectral, and radiometric resolutions of the remote sensing sensors are providing a wide opportunity to the user to characterize soil and land resources. Multispectral broadband remote sensing data have been used for mapping soil types/classes, whereas hyperspectral remote sensing data have been used in quantifying surface soil properties showing their potential application in soil health monitoring. Soil and terrain parameters derived from remote sensing or soil proxies can be used as secondary variables to improve the interpolation of existing soil data and in deriving digital soil map. Availability of temporal remote sensing data in various spatial and spectral resolutions has provided edge in characterizing, mapping, and monitoring of degraded lands. Several web resources have provided various thematic information of soil, land use/land cover, vegetation/forest cover, geomorphology, hydro-geomorphology, geology, terrain, groundwater level, drainage network, watershed boundary, climate, etc. at various scales. Land evaluation methods like land capability classification, parametric methods of land evaluation, FAO framework of land evaluation, agroclimatic suitability, soil quality index, etc. are commonly used to assess the potential of land employing biophysical information. Recent advances in remote sensing technology provide enormous opportunity to resource managers to monitor the state of land degradation as well as to assess the potential of land resources to ascertain their optimal use in insuring food security.

AB  - Water bodies are subjected to a considerable pressure from sewage and industrial wastes. Monitoring methods adopted so far have helped in the assessment level of contaminants in water but not the interaction of these pollutants with living organisms. Water quality testing programmes use two traditional methods for water quality assessment that includes physico-chemical parameters and bio-monitoring. Looking at the limitations of these two traditional methods, a new method known as 'biomarkers of pollution' should be adopted. Evaluating various biomarkers in sentinel species can be of great help in environmental monitoring programme as they forecast various risks and hazards associated with the habitats of aquatic animals. Several countries have adopted Biomarkers in their environmental monitoring programmes; however, to make it a routine and well-recognized tool in the water quality monitoring programme, efforts are still required from scientific communities. The major advantage of Biomarkers is that bioavailability or potential exposure to toxicants can be demonstrated which is not possible in chemical analysis. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are chemical substances that do not degrade easily and persist in the environment and detecting some classes of POPs, for example organochlorine compounds, are very difficult as the limits of detection are very low. With the advancement of analytical methods, these chemicals can be now detected in every environmental matrices but changes caused physiologically in living organisms remains unknown. This limitation can be overcome with the help of biomarkers which can detect whether organisms are exposed meaningfully and the physiology is altered in comparison to normal. Whenever any pollutants enter the biological system, it brings molecular changes and the response time of molecular changes are faster than it appears at community level. This leads the scientific communities to start some research work in this area in order to develop some early warning signal or biomarkers. Measurement of molecular changes at the level of body fluids, cells or tissues reflecting an alteration in normal functioning/ magnitude due to the presence of toxicants forms the basis of selection of particular parameter as a biomarker. This chapter presents the importance of various core biomarkers used as diagnostic and prognostic tools to monitor the water quality assessing the risks associated with the health of aquatic biota. This is high time to focus on the biological responses which are more relevant to predict the health status of any aquatic ecosystem before occurrence of any catastrophic events which are unmanageable.

AB  - The present study investigates the spectral distribution of global, direct (E-b lambda) and diffuse (E-b lambda) irradiances over Delhi with the help of handheld Field Spectroradiometer in the year 2014 - 2015. Seasonal variation in the solar irradiances as well as the diffuse-to-direct ratio (E-d lambda/E-b lambda) was studied during three seasons (post-monsoon, winter and pre-monsoon) having different atmospheric conditions. Observations were carried out under clear sky days during day time when solar zenith angle is low in order to get maximum solar radiation. The ratio E-d lambda/E-b lambda is used as a function to measure the impact of aerosol load on incoming solar irradiance. NASA's Aqua satellite, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) AOD(550) data has been used to evaluate the relationship between aerosol load and ratio (E-d lambda/E-b lambda) on incoming solar radiation. A strong dependence of measured diffuse-to-direct irradiance ratio (E-d lambda/E-b lambda) on wavelength was observE(d lambda) It was found to be decreasing exponentially with wavelength. Value of E-d lambda/E-b lambda was found to be maximum and minimum during Post-monsoon and Pre-monsoon seasons respectively. Also, the maximum values of E-d lambda/E-b lambda ratio were observed at the shorter wavelengths in all the studied seasons. The AOD(550) value was found to be maximum during post-monsoon followed by winter and Pre-monsoon seasons. Crop residue burning in addition to low wind speed was responsible for high aerosol load during the post-monsoon season where as inversion layer and calm wind conditions favored high aerosol load during winter season. A strong relation between the ratio E-d lambda/E-b lambda and AOD(550) is observed in all the studied seasons, indicating that high aerosol load was responsible for the attenuation of the incoming solar radiation in all the seasons

AB  - Crop lodging is surveyed from different image sources and from the crop yield map. Crop lodging has effect on remotely sensed and field level measurements when indirectly measuring, for example, soil variation, nutrients, or crop condition. The interpretation of results may be incorrect especially in the case when it is not possible to detect lodging from the analyzed dataset. Such situation may arise, for example, when analyzing Sentinel-2 (S2) images or crop yield monitor data. In this study crop lodging is inspected from UAS-based orthophoto mosaic taken 50 meters above the ground level, S2 image and crop yield monitor connected to a combine harvester.

AB  - Monsoon variability influences the productivity processes in the ocean and has different responses in each waters. Furthermore, variability of marine productivity affects to the fisheries resources fluctuation. This research has conducted using descriptive method to investigate the consequences of monsoon variability to aquatic productivity, sea surface temperature (SST), fish catches, and fish season periods at Pesawaran Regency waters, Lampung. Variability of aquatic productivity was determined based on chlorophyll-a indicator from MODIS satellite images. Monsoon variability was governed based on wind parameters and fish catches from fish landing data of Pesawaran fish market. The result showed that monsoon variability had affected to aquatic productivity, SST, and fish catches at Pesawaran Regency waters. Maximum wind speed and lowest SST occurred twice in a year, December to March and August to October, which the peaks were on January (2.55 m/s of wind speed and 29.66 degrees C of SST) and September (2.44 m/s of wind speed and 29.06 degrees C of SST). Also, Maximum aquatic productivity happened on January to March and July to September, which it was arisen simultaneously with maximum wind speed and the peaks was 0.74 mg/m(3) and 0.78 mg/m(3), on February and August respectively. The data showed that fish catches decreased along with strong wind speed and low SST. However, when weak wind speed and high SST occurred, fish catches increased. The correlation between Catch per Unit Effort (CPUE) with SST, wind speed, and chlorophyll-a was at value 0.76, -0.67, and -0.70, respectively. The high rate fish catches in Pesawaran emerged on March-May and September-December.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Vegetation cover is an important natural resource of the terrestrial ecosystem, and it has significant role in preserving the ecological balance in an area. Analyzing the dynamic pattern of vegetation cover and its trend can be a key to explain any unusual condition of the environment. Bundelkhand, located at the central part of India, has experienced recurrent drought events in last decade, and considering the devastating effects of drought in that region, the present study aims to explore the long-term trend of vegetation using geo-spatial technology. The remote sensing-based SPOT-VGT NDVI data were used to identify the changes in vegetation with time. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has proven to be a very powerful indicator of global vegetation productivity. In this study, we used linear regression model for evaluating the long-term trend of vegetation considering NDVI as dependable and time as independent variable. Our results showed that there is a varying pattern of vegetation trend and its response to rainfall.

TI  - The severe hailstorm in southwest Germany on 28 July 2013: characteristics, impacts and meteorological conditions
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - At the end of July 2013, a series of severe thunderstorms associated with heavy rainfall, severe wind gusts and large hail affected parts of Germany. On 28 July 2013, two supercells formed almost simultaneously in southern Germany, from which only the more southerly cell produced hailstones up to 10 cm in diameter on a hailswath approximately 120 km long and 15-20 km wide. For the insurance industry, this event, with losses of more than EUR 1 billion, was one of the most expensive natural disasters that has ever occurred in Germany. This article investigates the creation, temporal evolution and effects of the most severe supercell that day by considering and merging radar and satellite data, eyewitness reports, insurance loss data and numerical model studies. Observations of hail at ground level fit very well with a cold-ring-shaped structure in the cloud-top brightness temperature observed by a geostationary satellite imager. Various simulations conducted with the convection-permitting COnsortium for Small-scale MOdeling (COSMO) revealed that the track of the hailstorm could be reproduced only when convection was triggered artificially by two warm bubbles that produced single cells that were precursors of the supercell. The model results suggested that the supercell developed near a pre-existing single cell through low-level flow convergence in an environment with moderate CAPE but substantial wind shear and storm-relative helicity, both of which persisted for several hours in the area in which the supercell moved.

AB  - An efficient and inexpensive service has been developed for the monitoring of fishing vessels in West Africa using Earth Observation (EO) data. The service makes use of fast-delivery data from the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument on Sentinel-1 and the Multi Spectral Imager (MSI) on Sentinel-2, detecting objects that differ markedly from their immediate background using a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) test. The selected objects are then discounted from further analysis if they fall within the bespoke land mask or can be shown from time series analysis to be static (signals associated with jetties, oil platforms and "ghost objects" arising from very bright land targets). Detections are matched to, and verified by, AIS data, which provides location and dimensions of ships that are legally in the region. Both matched and un-matched data are then displayed on a web portal for use by the Gulf of Guinea (GoG) state authorities.

TI  - Accounting for phenology in maize yield prediction using remotely sensed dry dekads
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rain-fed agriculture is threatened by an increased frequency of droughts worldwide thereby putting millions of livelihoods at risk especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This makes drought preparedness critical. In this study, we sought to establish whether maize yield can be predicted using the number of dry dekads that occur at specific maize growth stages for purposes of yield early warning. The dry dekads were derived from remotely sensed Vegetation Condition Index calculated from the SPOT NDVI time series ranging from 1998 to 2013. Regression between dry dekads and maize yield show a negative linear relationship for four growing seasons (2010-2013) and indicates that dry dekads at both the vegetative and reproductive stages are important for predicting maize yield. Results suggest that early warning alert could be given using dry dekads that occur at the vegetative stage, while those at the reproductive stage can be used to give better yield estimate later on.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the slope stability in Nainital town using Persistent Scatterer (PS) and Quasi Persistent Scatterer (QPS) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) techniques. C- Band radar imaging satellite Sentinel 1A and 1B SAR dataset is used for the PS and QPS processing. Mean Velocity maps have been produced for the study period. Time series plots have been also generated for the few selected points to determine the temporal behaviour of movement in satellite Line of Sight (LoS) direction.Both PS and QPS results revelled that at the NW and SW slopes, areas in vicinity to Naini Lake have shown no movement and are stable during the study period of one and half year. At the N-NE slopes many locations at snow view point and Sher-ka-Danda hill slopes noticeable movement has been detected during the study period. Snow view peak are identified as most unstable and mean velocity is measured from -25 mm to -30 mm/year in satellite Line of Sight (LoS) direction. Slow slope movement has been detected at the dense urbanized area of Lower Mall Road near Naini Lake. On the Southern slopes, velocity has been estimated at Baliya Nala Landslide area for few identified points. The study clearly illustrates the usefulness of PS and QPS approaches for slope stability analysis and for estimation of slope movement in Nainital town.

AB  - Upwelling phenomenon is crucial to be forecasted, mainly concerning the information of potential fishery areas. Utilization of calibrated model for recorded upwelling such as INDESO gives benefit for historical result up to the present time. The aim of this study is to estimate areas and seasons of upwelling occurrences in the Flores Sea using data assimilation of satellite and modeling result. This study uses sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a data from level 3 of MODIS image and sea surface height from satellite Jason-2 monthly for three years (2014-2016) and INDESO model data for sea surface temperature, sea surface height, and chlorophyll-a daily for three years (2014-2016). The upwelling is indicated by declining of sea surface temperature, sea surface height and increasing of chlorophyll-a. Verification is conducted by comparing the model result with recorded MODIS satellite image. The result shows that the area of southern Makassar Strait having occurrences of upwelling phenomenon every year starting in June, extended to July and August. The strongest upwelling occurred in 2015 covering more or less the area of 23,000 km(2). The relation of monthly data of satellite has significantly correlated with daily data of INDESO model

TI  - A Review of the Use of Geostationary Satellite Observations in Regional-Scale Models for Short-term Cloud Forecasting
T2  - METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
M3  - Review
AB  - Many research and societal applications such as surface solar irradiance assessment and forecasting require accurate short-term cloudiness forecasts at kilometre and hourly scales. Today limited-area numerical weather prediction models have the potential to provide such forecasts by simulating clouds at high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, the forecast performance during the first 12-24 h is strongly influenced by the accuracy of the cloud and thermodynamic analyses in the initial conditions. Geostationary meteorological satellites provide valuable observations that can be used in data assimilation for frequent cloud analysis determination. This paper provides an up-to-date review of the state of the art in cloud-related geostationary satellite data assimilation with limited-area models dedicated to improve cloudiness forecast performance. Research and operational studies have been reviewed by differentiating between satellite radiance and cloud property retrieval assimilation. This review gives insight into the best practices considering the large variety of limited-area models, data assimilation methods, satellite sensors and channels, cloud property retrieval products and various methodological challenges. Cloud analysis methods for regional models have become more sophisticated in recent years and are increasingly able to exploit observations from geostationary satellites. Important proofs of concept have been performed in this decade, paving the way for an optimal synergy of geostationary satellite data assimilation and convection-permitting limited-area model forecasts. At the same time, the increasing amount of channels of geostationary satellite instruments leads to more opportunities and challenges for data assimilation methods.

TI  - Unsupervised Change Detection in Landsat Images with Atmospheric Artifacts: A Fuzzy Multiobjective Approach
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new unsupervised approach based on a hybrid wavelet transform and Fuzzy Clustering Method (FCM) with Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization (MO-PSO) is proposed to obtain a binary change mask in Landsat images acquired with different atmospheric conditions. The proposed method uses the following steps: (1) preprocessing, (2) classification of preprocessed image, and (3) binary masks fusion. Firstly, a photometric invariant technique is used to transform the Landsat images from RGB to HSV colour space. A hybrid wavelet transform based on Stationary (SWT) and Discrete Wavelet (DWT) Transforms is applied to the hue channel of two Landsat satellite images to create subbands. After that, mean shift clustering method is applied to the subband difference images, computed using the absolute-valued difference technique, to smooth the difference images. Then, the proposed method optimizes iteratively two different fuzzy based objective functions using MO-PSO to evaluate changed and unchanged regions of the smoothed difference images separately. Finally, a fusion approach based on connected component with union technique is proposed to fuse two binary masks to estimate the final solution. Experimental results show the robustness of the proposed method to existence of haze and thin clouds as well as Gaussian noise in Landsat images.

TI  - Crop inventory at regional scale in Ukraine: developing in season and end of season crop maps with multi-temporal optical and SAR satellite imagery
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Along the season crop classification maps based on satellite data is a challenging task for countries with large diversity of agricultural crops with different phenology (crop calendars). In this paper, we investigate feasibility of delivering early and along the season crop specific maps using available free satellite data over multiple years, including Landsat-8, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. For this study, a test site in Kyiv region (Ukraine) is selected, for which we have been collecting ground data on crop types every year since 2011. Crop type maps are generated through a supervised classification of multi-temporal multi-source satellite data using previously developed artificial neural network algorithms. It is shown, how multi-year crop classification maps are used for crop rotation violation detection. The study shows that in case of considerable cloud cover, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, for example acquired by Sentinel-1 satellite, can be interchangeably used with optical imagery to achieve the target 85% accuracy for crop classification.

AB  - Indonesia is a Country of Volcanic Arc. The configurations of geological, geomorphological conditions and the processes has conducted several positive and negative impacts for human life. In negative perspective, those conditions have created threat and risk for human, one of it is disasters. Landslide is one of the most frequently disaster happened in Indonesia, especially in the area of volcanic landform. The study area located in Hargotirto Subsdistrict, Kulon Progo, Yogyakarta. This research is intended to identifying the factors that trigger the landslide disaster in the study area using Remote sensing and Geological Observations as the approach. DEM SRTM, LANDSAT 8, maps, and literatures as well as geological observation in the field are used and done to identify the triggerring factors of landslide in the study area. The results shows that, literature study and remote sensing of band composite, 432 and 567 distinguished the land cover, geological, and geomorphological conditions of the study area as well as several band rationing of 6/7, 4/3 and 5/6 show the presence of altered rocks, high rain intensity mean of the study area ranged from about 110 to 200 mm/year and the slope conditions ranged from 0 to about 45 degrees or 100%. Meanwhile, geological observation in the field revealed that the study area are consist of volcanic rocks, silisiclastic rocks, and limestone. Several structures also found in the form of normal fault and sinistral strike slip fault. Hydrological conditions also expected became the triggering factor as the study area act as the recharge area of groundwater. The study believe that the remote sensing and geological observation could support each other, as the remote sensing act as the preliminary study of landslide potential and the geological observation act as the verification directly in the field in identifying the landslide triggering factors of the study area.

TI  - Assessing the Baltic Sea Water Quality with Sentinel-3 OLCI Imagery
T2  - 2018 IEEE/OES BALTIC INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM (BALTIC)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE/OES Baltic International Symposium (BALTIC)
CL  - Klaipeda, LITHUANIA
AB  - ESA Copernicus program will secure availability of satellite data for monitoring European seas during coming decades. The main sensor for water quality remote sensing will be OLCI on Sentinel-3 satellites. Sentinel-3A and 3B have been launched and the follow-up sensors are in preparation process. Baltic Sea is an optically complex waterbody where retrieving water quality parameters is complicated e. g. the only product provided by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) is chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) that does not have correlation with in situ data (r(2)= 0.20). Likewise, EUMETSAT standard product is suitable for open ocean data not for the Baltic Sea. However, the EUMETSAT product contains also concentrations of Chl-a, TSS and CDOM produced with the C2RCC processor which may produce realistic results for the Baltic Sea. We used Chl-a data from the national monitoring program to validate OLCI results and used extra information from bio-optical cruises as a background information. Different processors and empirical algorithms were tested. CMEMS OLCI Level 2 (atmospherically corrected images) are currently not usable in the Baltic Sea and the reflectances produced by EUMETSAT are unrealistic in bloom conditions. We tested neural network type processors like the C2RCC. It does provide reflectance spectra that are realistic in non-bloom conditions, but the results are problematic in cyanobacterial bloom conditions. Some empirical band ratio algorithms performed reasonably well in estimating chlorophyll-a, suspended matter and CDOM concentrations. Comparisons with monitoring data showed that remote sensing products fail in spring bloom conditions, but produce reasonable results (r(2)= 0.47) during summer phytoplankton minimum and cyanobacteria season. It became obvious that quality of regular monitoring data is not of sufficient to be used in developing and validation of remote sensing products.

CL  - Klaipeda, LITHUANIA
AB  - Benthic habitats and changes in them are indicators of coastal water quality. Bathymetry is nearly impossible to measure with conventional methods (sonar on a ship) in shallow (less than 3-4 m) water due to high damage risk for the ship and instruments. Both water depth and bottom type are critical information for environmental monitoring, maritime spatial planning and managing of coastal waters. Airborne remote sensing can solve the problem and provide the necessary information. However, covering very large areas with airborne sensors is quite expensive. ESA launched Sentinel-2A and 2B satellites in the frame of Copernicus program. This imagery is free of charge, comes with high frequency (every 2-3 days at the latitude of Estonia) and has 10 m spatial resolution. We carried out in situ measurements to assess the suitability of Sentinel-2 to map benthic habitat and bathymetry in optically complex water like the Baltic Sea. The high frequency free data enables new possibilities in mapping shallow coastal waters.

TI  - Estimation of variable atmospheric parameters for the atmospheric correction of satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The information about variable components of the atmosphere (aerosol, water vapour, and ozone) during acquisition is required for the atmospheric correction of spectral images acquired by shortwave sensors of the Earth observing remote-sensing satellites. The procedure to estimate aerosol optical depth and columnar water vapour by the inversion of the atmospheric radiative transfer model 6S using moderate-resolution spectra of incident solar radiation is proposed. Comparison to the results obtained by the Aerosol Robotic Network AERONET at an AERONET site at the distance of 50km on days when both sensors were in the same air mass shows systematic overestimation both of aerosol optical depth and of columnar water vapour if aerosol optical depth is estimated in the wavelength range of 365-425nm and columnar water in the range of 895-985nm using spectra of total irradiance. If more wavelengths and diffuse-to-total spectral irradiance ratio are implemented in the inversion, the bias of estimated water vapour decreases, but aerosol optical depth is underestimated. The estimates at 50km distance are well correlated. The modelled spectral irradiance using estimated atmospheric parameters matches the measured spectra with high accuracy. In the spectral bands of the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), the differences do not exceed 2%.

TI  - Combined use of fluorescence with a magnetic tracer and dilution effect upon sentinel node localization in a murine model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel node biopsy using radioisotope and blue dye remains a gold standard for axillary staging in breast cancer patients with low axillary burden. However, limitations in the use of radioisotopes have resulted in emergence of novel techniques. This is the first in vivo study to assess the feasibility of combining the two most common novel techniques of using a magnetic tracer and indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence.Materials and methods: A total of 48 mice were divided into eight groups. Groups 1 and 2, the co-localization groups, received an injection of magnetic tracers (Resovist (R) and Sienna+(R), respectively) and ICG fluorescence; distilled water was used as the solvent of ICG. Groups 3 and 4, the diluted injection groups, received an injection of magnetic tracers (Resovist and Sienna+, respectively) and saline for dilution. Groups 5, 6, and 7, the control groups, received magnetic tracer (Resovist, Sienna+) and ICG alone, respectively. Fluorescent intensity assessment and iron quantification of excised popliteal lymph nodes were performed. Group 1', a co-localization group, received an injection of magnetic tracers (Resovist) and ICG' fluorescence: saline was used as the solvent for ICG.Results: Lymphatic uptake of all tracers was confined to the popliteal nodes only, with co-localization confirmed in all cases and no significant difference in fluorescent intensity or iron content of ex vivo nodes between the groups (except for Group 1'). There was no impact of dilution on the iron content in the diluted Sienna+ group, but it significantly enhanced Resovist uptake (P=0.005). In addition, there was a significant difference in iron content (P=0.003) in Group 1'.Conclusion: The combination of a magnetic tracer (Resovist or Sienna+) and ICG fluorescence is feasible for sentinel node biopsy and will potentially allow for precise transcutaneous node identification, in addition to accurate intraoperative assessment. This radioisotope-free "combined technique" warrants further assessment within a clinical trial.

AB  - Satellite images are to be effectively protected nowadays. There are a lot of ways of changing image content to hide important information: resampling, copy-move, object replacement and other attacks. When these changes are applied to satellite data inclination angles of shadows can be also changed. We propose a new method for satellite image forgery detection based on the analysis of high buildings shadows inclination angles on high resolution snapshots (0.5 m and less). In the proposed solution, the shadows are detected using Canny edge detector with further edge tracing. The comparison of both edge detection methods is presented in the experiments section. The next step is shadows inclination angles estimation using special model-oriented descriptors. The experiments show high accuracy of changed areas detection.

AB  - This article examines the phenomenon of media culture and its functions in the modern society. Media culture is usually understood as an area of culture that is formed in the interaction of an individual with mass communication, including mass print, radio, cinematography, television, video, certain types of network-based computer technologies. Media culture opens up great opportunities for a person and influences the values of society, the worldview of different sociocultural groups, shapes these values and manipulates public opinion. As a result of the European migration crisis, the relationship between two large social and cultural groups has become important for the German society. These two groups are host side and newcomers, migrants which have another, "foreign" culture and traditions. A concept of discrimination, its types and forms, as well as its manifestation in the modern media-culture in the German mass media materials is considered in the article.One of the common types of discrimination is ethnic discrimination that is manifested in mass media by opposing one's own to another's culture, creating a negative image of the representatives of the "alien" ethnic group and can be seen in lexical, evaluative and structural levels of texts.

AB  - Land is a central and major theme in the Bible. The Krobo are agricultural people, and the land is their lifeblood. A comparative study is made between the concept of land by the Krobos and by the Israelites. The Krobo worldview about land exhibited many similarities to and some differences from the Israelites’ worldview about land as recorded in the Bible. This paper examines agricultural perspectives of the land and discovers the mission-theological components of land that could be applied to the context of the Krobo. The mission-theological components of the concept of land should be an important narrative source and theory that can communicate the truths of the Bible to non-Christians who live in the Krobo regions and within agrarian social systems for doing agromission.

AB  - For urban flood mapping, building orientation is one of the most important parameters mainly considering amplitude images of satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This study investigated the influence of the orientation angle of a building on double bounce effect from the floodwater surface. We suggest the potential key component of urban flood detection considering the characterization of the double bounce effect from land surface backscatters in the selected experimental area, which covers the hardest flood-hit municipalities during the 2015 Kinu River flood in Japan. To improve the urban flood detection ability, the correlation coefficient of the intensity derived from the building orientation was then applied to detect the flooded buildings.

AB  - For high accuracy flood mapping, an algorithm that integrates multiple satellite data sources is essential to maximize the sensor ability and compensate the limitations of optical and SAR data. The main objective of this study is to propose an algorithm of dynamic flood detection using optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images that compares and combines two different statistical thresholding approaches. To improve the flood detection accuracy, image fusion technique was investigated to maximize the utilization of calibrated and optimized flood maps as the integrated flood detection approach. To showcase the advantages of the proposed methodology, we employ MODIS, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1A images acquired over a challenging area along the Brahmaputra River where flood events often occur.

TI  - Horseshoe crabs as potential sentinel species for coastal health: juvenile haemolymph quality and relationship to habitat conditions
T2  - MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As an interface between terrestrial and marine environments, coastal and estuarine areas are particularly prone to various pollution stresses. Identification of sentinel species is, therefore, essential to provide precautionary information on coastal health conditions. Given their significant ecological roles in estuarine ecosystems, horseshoe crabs are a potential species to indicate the general health status of coastal habitats. The present study demonstrated that the changes in haemolymph composition pattern of two Asian juvenile horseshoe crab species (Tachypleus tridentatus and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda) are sensitive to reflect heavy metal (lead, nickel and iron) and nutrient (nitrate and ammonia) concentrations of intertidal sediments. In particular, a significant negative correlation was found for the amebocyte viability and ratio of granular-spherical to granular-flattened and degranulated dendritic-like morphological states of amebocytes in juvenile haemolymph with nitrate and lead concentrations respectively. There were also significantly higher concentrations of haemolymph haemocyanin and plasma protein in juvenile C. rotundicauda than in T. tridentatus on the same shore, possibly being related to the difference in foraging habitats of these two horseshoe crab species. Such non-lethal sampling of haemolymph from juvenile horseshoe crabs can be useful for a further development of the monitoring program in assessing potential environmental impacts by anthropogenic activities.

AB  - The development of the concept of peace in South Africa has historically been contextualized towards the equal rights, reconciliation, and coexistence of ethnic groups. In South Africa, under the racial capitalist system, a small number of white rulers have constructed a structural framework that exploits or continues to create suffering to the black majority and other colored people. The whites made ideologies necessary for domination and exploitation, and used state power through laws and institutions. In the pre-apartheid era, the migrant white people violated the rights of indigenous Africans and non-white people, and between 1948 and 1994, apartheid racial discrimination policies were implemented to deepen divisions among ethnic groups. Since 1994, harmony and coexistence among racial and ethnic groups have become the most important issue. The concept of peace has become a key goal of coexistence to create a nation and people 's consciousness while respecting cultural and ethnic diversity.Under World Capitalism, South Africa's violent apartheid racism has created a social system to realize the desires of a few white people based on racial supremacy. This contradictory value system required a value system for the benefit of the community rather than the individual with the anti-apartheid movement. Under these circumstances, Ubuntu was understood as an alternative to the unique pursuit of peace that heavily rescues South Africa's racial discrimination and conflicts in the (apart) apartheid era, and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) It can be said that it is implemented through.Ubuntu means 'humanity' and can be expressed in the words 'A person is a person by other people'. Although the Ubuntu philosophy recognizes and accepts differences, it is a value system and a worldview of the African people who are rooted in interdependence and coexistence stemming from community consciousness, rather than individualism. During the post-apartheid period, Ubuntu made South Africans with different beliefs and cultures, including different races, peoples, and religions, to accept the otherness and that spirit was expressed through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). This was a path to coexistence with the recognition of the diversity of South Africa and the healing of South Africa, which has long been stifled by oppression, discrimination, violence and resistance.This article will examine how the concept of peace in South Africa was contextualized by Ubuntu and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).

AB  - This article analyzed how contemporary urbanism is revealed in the digital game <Watchdogs2>(2016) with the contemporary city as a setting. The city in the game is a precisely directed space, so the experience of the user in the space has a special meaning. It’s because the urbanism implied in player’s game experience.Urbanism is properties of the city constructed between citizen’s everyday life and space. Of course, it as the self of the city is influenced by cultural tradition and modern infrastructure. Therefore, contemporary cities inherit the modernity that is standard and norm, and at the same time, it can be unique space caused by network system installed around the city. In this context, contemporary citizenry accepts the urbanism as matter of course but try to surpass the modern limits and imprisonment of the network. This challenge reveals as resistance, creativity, and amusement in the relation in contemporary urbanism. Hacking and parkour are the representative examples of resistance, creativity and amusement acts of the citizen in the virtual and non-virtual environment.A protagonist in the game is a hacker and also traceur who resist modern network power. The playable character does the hacking and parkour striding the city. And these acts melt into the worldview, interface, and visualization to represent contemporary urbanism. In this regard, hacking and parkour performed by the player character are interfaced in different ways, giving the user a creative urban experience of the city in the game. In addition, the game’s high-angle view of the hacked CCTV and the low-angle view of the small device show contemporary people’s play on the city. This way, city people represented in <Watchdogs2> are not different from contemporary flaneur who actively practice. Consequently, the city as the space in the game contents are not just settings, but one of the important axes that implies the message of the contents.

AB  - The steep natural terrain in Hong Kong is susceptible to shallow, small to medium-sized landslides induced by rainfall. These landslides usually involve failures occurring within the top one to two meters of the surface mantle. Terrain features manifested on the ground surface, such as historical landslides, rock outcrops, tension cracks, depressions could affect the terrain's susceptibility to landsliding in future. Identification of these features by conventional means involves substantial resources for Aerial Photo Interpretation (API) and field mapping. A pilot study was carried out to explore the potential of using deep learning to enhance the efficiency in identifying rock outcrops at a territory-wide scale with a view to improving the landslide susceptibility analysis. A methodology of combining Convolutional Neural Network and remote sensing techniques has been developed to derive a very high-resolution map of rock outcrops exposed on the natural terrain throughout the entire Hong Kong territory. The developed algorithm considers the spatial relationship and texture of the surrounding pixels as well as the spectral signature of the pixel of remote sensing imageries. The identification of rock outcrops has been conducted using the orthophotos acquired in years 2012 and 2015, with the aid of SPOT satellite images acquired in year 2015 and airborne LiDAR data acquired in year 2010, and resulting in a five-meter spatial resolution rock outcrops map. The results were promising when validated with the results mapped by engineering geologists using API on the same sets of orthophotos. The developed algorithm provides an alternative for leveraging the balance between spectral and spatial resolution, and for mapping the natural surface features and enhancing the landslide susceptibility analysis.

AB  - The problem in Dignaga’s logic, especially the check list of a table of nine inferences, is the problem of the paradox that it leads to incompatible Logical consequence based on the same logical reason, and although both logical reason are mutually compatible, And to establish an object of reasoning that can not be done. The purpose of this paper is to explore the paradox and antinomy of Buddhist post Dignaga, especially Wonhyo and Dharmakirti.Wonhyo criticizes the argument that “the sound resides because it is heard,” which is not valid reasoning, but the reasoning is likewise irrelevant. In order to argue the unfairness of reasoning based on a certain worldview and grammar system, even if it suggests reasoning based on other worldviews and grammatical systems, Wonhyo have seen.On the other hand, unlike Wonhyo, who argues the principle of uncertainty that ultimately makes a mistake, The rule is that the paradox that “the sound is the sound because it is heard” and “the residence because the sound is the sound” and “the sound is made because it is made” and “the sound resides because it is heard” The antinomies can not be solved by logical relations, but rather they can be solved by the a priori principle of the intrinsic coupling between the two terms that constitute reasoning, that is, the reasoning and the reality based on the object of reasoning.While Wonhyo believes that the attempt to secure the upward logic from the logic of logic to the logic of logic always fails to make an uncertainty, Dharmakirti, on the ontological basis of logic from top to bottom. In this respect, the two walked the other way, gazing at the same spot.

AB  - Objectives: To monitor the radon concentration level in plants that handle phosphorus rock and produce gypsum board and cement, and evaluate the effective dose considering the effect of radon exposure on the human body.Methods: Airborne radon concentrations were measured using alpha-track radon detectors (α-track, Rn-tech Co., Korea) and continuous monitors (Radon Sentinel 1030, Sun Nuclear Co., USA). Radon concentrations in the air were converted to radon doses using the following equation to evaluate the human effects due to radon.H (m㏜/yr) = Radon gas concentration x Equilibrium factor x Occupancy factor x Dose conversion factor. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) used 8 n㏜/(㏃Â·hr/㎥) as the dose conversion factor in 2010, but raised it by a factor of four to 33 n㏜/(㏃Â·hr/㎥) in 2017.Results: Radon concentrations and effective doses in fertilizer manufacturing process averaged 14.3 (2.7) ㏃/㎥ (2.0-551.3 ㏃/㎥), 0.11-0.54 m㏜/yr depending on the advisory authority and recommendation year, respectively. Radon concentrations in the gypsum-board manufacturing process averaged 14.9 ㏃/㎥ at material storage, 11.4 ㏃/㎥ at burnability, 8.1 ㏃/㎥ at mixing, 10.0 ㏃/㎥ at forming, 8.9 ㏃/㎥ at drying, 14.7 ㏃/㎥ at cutting, and 10.5 ㏃/㎥ at shipment. It was low because it did not use phosphate gypsum. Radon concentrations and effective doses in the cement manufacturing process were 23.2 ㏃/㎥ in the stowage area, 20.2 ㏃/㎥ in the hopper, 16.8 ㏃/㎥ in the feeder and 11.9 ㏃/㎥ in the cement mill, marking 0.12-0.63 m㏜/yr, respectively.Conclusions: Workers handling phosphorous gypsum directly or indirectly can be assessed as exposed to an annual average radon dose of 0.16 to 2.04 mSv or 0.010 to 0.102 WLM (Working Level Month).

AB  - Landslides represent one of the greatest natural disasters and that makes their research notably crucial. The development of Sentinel missions, which implemented by European Space Agency (ESA) for the operational needs of the Copernicus programme that is directed by the European Commission, gives a new impetus to Earth Observation, providing timely, operational, easily accessible, global coverage and robust datasets. It is worth mentioning that the specific datasets are freely available to users from a web-based system, called "Copernicus Open Access Hub". This work deals with the exploitation of Sentinel-1 radar data as well as Sentinel-2 optical data in order to map the sliding areas of an active landslide. The landslide occurred in January 2017 as result of snow melting, while the area is located in Western Peloponnese, Greece. The total length of the landslide zone was about 300 m with a head width of 330 m while the landslide material is constituted from three different geologic formations mirroring the complex geotectonic of the wider area. In that context, radar data as well as optical data were collected and processed appropriately. Concerning radar data, Sentinel-1 images before and after the occurrence of the slide were acquired and interferometric processed yielding to a displacement map through the estimation of vertical displacements. On the other hand, corresponding Sentinel-2 optical data before and after the landslide event were collected and they were submitted to digital processing techniques such as change detection analysis. The results of the two methodologies were compared and also, they were evaluated for their accuracy using the actual displacement values obtained from GPS and UAV surveys.

AB  - Landslides are recognized as one of the most damaging natural hazards in Western Greece due to the complex geological structure, the intense precipitation and the high seismicity. In that context, the development of low-cost, semiautomatic, monitoring methodologies based on satellite data is a necessity in order to prevent and mitigate the landslide risk and decrease the damages in a future reactivation. The current study focuses on the application of three different processing methodologies on Sentinel-1 data: (a) interferogram generation, (b) comparison of interferometric Digital Surface Model (DSM) before and after the landslide event and (c) another processing technique called "offset tracking". The selection of Sentinel-1 data was based on the fact that the specific mission provides timely, freely accessible data, with satisfactory spatial resolution for repeated earth observation. The study area is located almost 20 km south of the city of Patras near to the Village Moira. The landslide with a total length of 300 m and a head width of 330 m is being investigating by repeated field campaigns and Global Navigation Satellite System measurements, and thus, the derived results from the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data processing were evaluated with the in situ measurements.

AB  - In this paper a method for mapping vegetation patches in semi-arid area is presented. These vegetation spots show specific morphological variations and their exact location is essential for the regional development. The proposed method is based on exploiting spatial and spectral information from Remote sensing data. First, the vegetation spots are emphasized by using the Spectral Similarity Ratio between the pixels of the image and previously defined windows which include samples of the targeted structures. Second, and once vegetation spots are highlighted, they are extracted using the grayscale Hit-or-Miss Transform from mathematical morphology. The method has been applied to map specific pre-Saharan vegetal formation from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery on Algerian Saharan Atlas.

AB  - Land cover and crop-types classification are of great importance for monitoring agricultural production and land-use patterns. Many classification approaches have used different parameters settings. In this paper, we investigate the modern classifiers using the most effective parameters to improve the classification accuracy of the major crops and land covers that exist in Sentinel-2 images for Fayoum region of Egypt. Four major crop-types and four major land-cover types are classified. This paper investigates the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) supervised classifiers. The experimental results show that the SVM and the RF report more robust results. The k-NN reports the least accuracy especially for crop types. The RT, K-NN, ANN, and SVM record 92.7%, 92%, 92.1% and 94.4% respectively. The SVM classifier out-performs the k-NN, ANN and RF classifiers.

AB  - fNowadays, Satellite images have become a major source of data for many aspects of development. Laud and crops classification using satellite images is a recent important subject. From the other side, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) is a powerful technique for understanding images. This paper describes a pixel based crops and land cover classification originating from one source satellite imagery represented by Sentinel satellite and based on several dates li)r the same agricultural season. We propose a DCNN architecture based on multi-temporal data that was fed to a one-dimension (1-I) DCNN). The proposed architecture is compared with other methods of satellite image classification algorithms; such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests (RI's) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NNs). Experiments are conducted for the mutual experiment of major crops and land cover classification for Al-Fayoutn governorate in Egypt. The 1-D DCNN achieves about 89% accuracy using 10 spectral bands from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery database tiff the area of interest. The proposed architecture although it outperforms other methods, needs further research to optimize the memory usage.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Green infrastructure (GI) mapping and monitoring is crucial in urban areas, and remote sensing is widely used to accomplish the task. Improved moderate resolution Sentinel-2A (10 m) and LandSat-8 (15 m) images, in place of commercial satellite images, enable GI mapping with little to no cost. Considering so, the objective of this paper is to evaluate the potential of GI feature extraction of Sentinel-2A (S2) and LandSat-8 (L8) (freely available images) using the Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) method. The advantage of using OBIA over pixel-based analysis has been investigated primarily with very high resolution images. Using OBIA, bottom up (i.e. Multiresolution) and top down (i.e. Spectral Difference) segmentation were implemented using eCognition to obtain image objects for both S2 and L8 images. Then, rule-based classification was performed to extract GI areas from the objects. NDVI, NDWI, NIR/R ratios were utilized in rule set development, after several trial and error process. Both S2 and L8 provided acceptable extraction of GI for urban areas. However, with an overall accuracy of 71.24%, S2 was more effective when extracting GI areas. Shadows along roads and high rise buildings caused some inaccuracy in classification.

AB  - Master/Worker distributed programming model enables huge remote sensing data processing by assigning tasks to Workers in which data is stored. Cloud computing features include the deployment of Workers by using virtualized technologies such as virtual machines and containers. These features allow programmers to configure, create, and start virtual resources for instance. In order to develop remote sensing applications by taking advantage of high-level programming languages (e.g., R, Matlab, and Julia), users have to manually address Cloud resource deployment.This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the Infra.jl research prototype. Infra.jl takes advantage of Julia Master/Worker programming simplicity for providing automatic deployment of Julia Workers in the Cloud. The assessment of Infra. jl automatic deployment is only similar to 2.8 s in two different Azure Cloud data centers.

AB  - The present work seeks to assess the relationship between daily Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and thermal front (Gradient Magnitude method) using AMSR-E, daily Sea Surface Chlorophyll-a (SSC) using MODIS, and daily long line (LL) bigeye (BG), albacore (ALB), yellowfin (YF), and southern bluefin (SBF) tuna catch data expressed as catch per unit effort (CPUE), which was calculated as the number of fish caught by 1000 hooks in 1 degrees latitude by 1 degrees longitude square grid, and integrated into a month of fishing activity for the period of March-December 2010 in South Java (Indian Ocean). Results obtained showed evidences of non-linear relationships between catch yields and environmental data. BG and ALB show largest CPUE values which occurred mainly in the area with SSTs of 26 -27 degrees C and SSCs of 0.15 - 0.3mg/m(3). CPUEs appear to be "randomly" dispersed and have a slight positive (negative) correlation with SSC (SST) i.e., 0.33 (-0.38) but not with GM values i.e., -0.02. The weak correlation between CPUE, SST, SSC and GM lead to assume that CPUEs might be linked to other influential parameters that are not assessed in the present study but are needed to give complete prediction of potential fishing ground areas, knowing that the length of observation period is less than 1 year.

AB  - Western and East Asian cultures have grown in very different geographical environments as well as thinking incubators that impacted their thinking inclinations, worldview perceptions and conceptual approaches. The study contributes to broader conceptualization of understanding Confucian heritage of East Asian countries in modern times. The method of comparison of basic features of Western and Confucian cultures is used to highlight conceptual differences in both cultures. The focus is given on their manifestations in governance patterns, social constructs, economic models and predominantly in business culture, specifically of Korea, the country with strongest Confucian influence at present. The analysis comes to conclusion that behavioral modes of Confucian heritage in East Asian countries are so deeply engrained in people' minds that even facing process of globalization and growing impact of Western culture, the Confucian heritage will still be present for a long time as a part of their social and business culture. Understanding the cultural background of East Asia helps to bridge misunderstandings in social and business interactions.

AB  - Glaciers are melting at an alarming rate due to global warming. Two major glaciers of India viz. Gangotri and the Siachen are chosen for the velocity mapping. The line-of-sight (LOS) velocity fields are derived using X-band TerraSAR-X and C-band Sentinel-1A datasets. An intensity-based offset tracking method is used to generate LOS velocities of the glaciers. The single look complex (SLC) images of the TerraSAR-X are converted into intensity before applying the offset tracking method, whereas the ground range detected (GRD) products from Sentinel-1A are directly used to estimate the glacier velocities. The Siachen glacier velocity is mapped using three X-band images from 2011 to 2017 and a C-band image between 2017 and 2018. The X-band images in the case of Siachen are available with the long-time interval between the master and slave images. The velocity of the glacier is observed to be around 30-40 cm day(-1) from X-band and around 45-50 cm day(-1) from C-band. Three X-band images in the year 2012 and a C-band image in the year 2018 are used for the Gangotri glacier velocity estimation. These images are very closely separated in time, and the velocity of the glacier is found to be 15-20 cm day(-1). A dataset with a temporal gap of approximately three years is also used for the Gangotri glacier velocity estimation and observed a large difference in velocity (similar to 10 cm day(-1)) from that of shorter interval data. Therefore, for a slow-moving glacier like Gangotri, a dataset with a high temporal gap may not give a reliable result. It is also observed that X-band TerraSAR-X results are more accurate than the C-band Sentinel-1A results. The penetration depth of X-band is less compared to C-band, which might result in accurate estimation of glacier surface flow. According to the results, the velocity of the Siachen glacier is increasing at a very high rate.

AB  - Satellite imagery has revolutionized earth's civilization. It allowed human beings to explore many hidden wonders of earth, it allowed to uncover many unexplored places and discovered Iceland's, volcanoes, forests, natural resources and many more. Satellite imagery has improved exponentially in the millennium. Satellites are used to take images of earth and stitch it to form maps and helped people to navigate, many technologies used in imaging and positioning to improvise and sensors are used to accurate imaging like LISS, however sensors have a hardware limitation. There are many factor which affect the clarity of imaging like mist, light pollution, air pollution, clouds, which masks the actual image, and that's where image enhancement comes into picture. Existing systems use neural networks to enhance the image which uses model VGG19 which has error rate up to 7.5% and it has only 60 % accuracy. Satellite image enhancement is divided into 2 segments, upscaling and dehazing, image is loaded and pixels are segmented to have compatibility and work optimization. Earth image is very vast and complex, dedicated image enhancement for particular place is not possible so neural network is selected which can detect the place automatically and enhance it. Resnet is the model which can be used efficiently in this context, it results in better accuracy 70%-80% and has very less error rate. And for haze removal dark channel prior is used which is efficient and works faster without mat lab. The results shows positive improvement for image enhancement for almost all type of image with more efficiency. This can be done by comparing with the trained datasets present in landsat and present data. The landsat dataset consists of multiple satellite imagery which has been cropped. The result has showed increased accuracy and also haze level has been reduced from 43% to 35% in de-hazing. The proposed system has over 80 % efficiency.

AB  - The article presents biographical data, pecularities of the worldview and the practices of Tuvan healer Stanislav Kuzhugetovich Serenot - Serenot bashky (born in 1949). He has secondary education in medicine and a tertiary education diploma in biology. Serenot began as a paramedic, and in the 1990s turned to non-conventional medicine (i.e. folk or traditional practices not included in the government-run healthcare). It was in this field that he achieved fame and recognition, even the title of "Honoured Worker of Health of the Republic of Tuva" (1999).He is considered to be a descendant of a shaman family on his fathers side, and a great-grandson of a famous head of a Buddhist temple on his mothers side. He took courses in Chinese traditional medicine, studied with lamas and shamans, and was largely self-educated. He made his practice, focusing on traditional Tuvan-Tibetan medicine. At the moment, he runs his own healing centre in the city of Kyzyl. Provided in the article are some fragments from his diary, covering the stories of his patients and the effects his healing had on them.After examining Serenot, anthropologists, neurophysiologists and other researchers noted his ability to work using methods of immersion in altered states of consciousness. The healer has a lot of publications on the healing practices, mostly in Tuvian language. The article reviews some interesting texts on herbal healing, the medicinal characteristics of minerals, gems, water springs.

AB  - Remote sensing has a long and successful track record of detecting and mapping archaeological traces of human activity in the landscape. Since the early twentieth century, the tools and procedures of aerial archaeology evolved gradually, while earth observation remote sensing experienced major steps of technological and methodological advancements and innovation that today enable the monitoring of the earth's surface at unprecedented accuracy, resolution and complexity. Much of the remote sensing data acquired in this process potentially holds important information about the location and context of archaeological sites and objects. Archaeology has started to make use of this tremendous potential by developing new approaches for the detection and mapping of archaeological traces based on digital remote sensing data and the associated tools and procedures. This chapter reviews the history, tools, methods, procedures and products of archaeological remote sensing and digital image analysis, emphasising recent trends towards convergence of aerial archaeology and earth observation remote sensing.

TI  - Long-term trend of and correlation between vegetation greenness and climate variables in Asia based on satellite data
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data has been used to ascertain trends and correlations between climate change and vegetation greenness in Asia. Our study utilized 33-year (1982-2014) AVHRR-GIMMS (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies) NDVI3g and CRU TS (Climatic Research Unit Time Series) climate variable (temperature, rainfall, and potential evapotranspiration) time series. First, we estimated the overall trends for vegetation greenness and climate variables and analyzed trends during summer (April-October), winter (November-March), and the entire year. Second, we carried out correlation and regression analyses to detect correlations between vegetation greenness and climate variables. Our study revealed an increasing trend (0.05-0.28) in temperature in northeastern India (bordering Bhutan), Southeast Bhutan, Yunnan Province of China, Northern Myanmar, Central Cambodia, northern Laos, southern Vietnam, eastern Iran, southern Afghanistan, and southern Pakistan. However, a decreasing trend in temperature (0.00 to -0.04) was noted for specific areas in southern Asia including Central Myanmar and northwestern Thailand and the Guangxi, Southern Gansu, and Shandong provinces of China. The results also indicated an increasing trend for evapotranspiration and air temperature accompanied by a decreasing trend for vegetation greenness and rainfall. Increases in both the mean annual signal and annual cycle occurred in the forest, herbaceous, and cropland areas of India, Northwest China, and eastern Kazakhstan. The temperature was found to be the main driver of the changing vegetation greenness in Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, Northeast and Central China, North Korea, South Korea, and northern Japan, showing an indirect relationship (R=0.84-0.96).Temperature is the main climatic variable affecting vegetation greenness.A downward trend in vegetation greenness was observed during summer (April-October).Temperature showed an upward trend across many areas of Asia during the study period.In winter, rainfall showed downward and upward trends in different parts of Asia.

TI  - Prevalence of and Factors Associated with Negative Microscopic Diagnosis of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Rural Peru.
T2  - The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene
M3  - Journal Article

AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic to South America where diagnosis is most commonly conducted via microscopy. Patients with suspected leishmaniasis were referred for enrollment by the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Lima, Iquitos, Puerto Maldonado, and several rural areas of Peru. A 43-question survey requesting age, gender, occupation, characterization of the lesion(s), history of leishmaniasis, and insect-deterrent behaviors was administered. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted on lesion materials at the Naval Medical Research Unit No. 6 in Lima, and the results were compared with those obtained by the MoH using microscopy. Factors associated with negative microscopy and positive PCR results were identified using chi2 test, t-test, and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Negative microscopy with positive PCR occurred in 31% (123/403) of the 403 cases. After adjusting for confounders, binary multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that negative microscopy with positive PCR was associated with patients who were male (adjusted odds ration [OR] = 1.93 [1.06-3.53], P = 0.032), had previous leishmaniasis (adjusted OR = 2.93 [1.65-5.22], P < 0.0001), had larger lesions (adjusted OR = 1.02 [1.003-1.03], P = 0.016), and/or had a longer duration between lesion appearance and PCR testing (adjusted OR = 1.12 [1.02-1.22], P = 0.017). Future research should focus on further exploration of these underlying variables, discovery of other factors that may be associated with negative microscopy diagnosis, and the development and implementation of improved testing in endemic regions.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The three-component model of Brewin et al. (2010) computes fractional contributions of three phytoplankton size classes (micro- (> 20 mu m), nano- (2-20 mu m), picophytoplankton (< 2 mu m)) to the overall chlorophyll a concentration (Chla). Using in situ pigment data, model coefficients were adjusted for application to the southern African marine region. The refined model was applied to seasonal and monthly climatologies of MODIS Aqua Chla around Southern Africa. Chla > 1 mg m(-3) was limited to shelf regions along the coasts of Southern Africa and Madagascar, while values < 0.1 mg(-3) were found over most of the open ocean between the equator and 38 S during austral summer and autumn. In winter and spring, low values (< 0.1 mg m(-3)) were restricted to smaller regions within subtropical gyres, while values up to 0.7 mg m(-3) extended over a much greater area of the open ocean. Shelf regions in the northern (NB) and southern Benguela (SB), Agulhas Bank (AB), Agulhas region (AR), and Mozambique Channel (MC) all showed similar seasonal cycles of size structure. On average, microphytoplankton comprised > 50% of the total Chia in these regions with little change throughout the year. The AR shelf differed, with picophytoplankton dominating in summer, and micro- and nanophytoplankton the rest of the year. In the open ocean domains of the NB, SB, and AB regions, nanophytoplankton dominated for most of the year, with picophytoplankton being more prevalent during summer and autumn. In contrast, in the AR open ocean, nanophytoplankton were dominant only during winter and early spring, whereas picophytoplankton dominated throughout the year in the MC open ocean. The refined model characterised previously unknown spatial and temporal changes in size structure in various ecosystems around Southern Africa.

TI  - Sentinel-2 L1C radiometric validation using deep convective clouds observations
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the frame of the European Space Agency (ESA) Scientific Exploitation of Operational Missions (SEOM) program new algorithms are developed to validate the Sentinel-2 level 1C (L1C) product radiometry, beyond the baseline algorithms used operationally in the frame of the Sentinel-2 Mission Performance Centre (MPC). In this context this paper presents the implementation of a Sentinel-2 radiometric validation approach based on deep convective cloud (DCC) observations. Due to their physical properties DCCs can be used to monitor the radiometric response degradation of the reflective solar bands of optical sensors. Their observation allows interband radiometry validation in the visible-near infrared (VIS-NIR) domain relatively to an a priori well calibrated reference band. We first present the selection of Sentinel-2 data acquired over DCC targets, as well as the tools and assumptions used for the modeling of the theoretical DCC radiometric response. The validation methodology is then thoroughly described and justified. It is based on the comparisons between the observed and the simulated top-of-atmosphere reflectance spectrum. Interband radiometric validation is performed through the statistical analysis of a large collection of individual observations. Results show the very good radiometric performance of Sentinel-2 with interband gains lower than 2%.

TI  - Spark Sensing: A Cloud Computing Framework to Unfold Processing Efficiencies for Large and Multiscale Remotely Sensed Data, with Examples on Landsat 8 and MODIS Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Inquiry using data from remote Earth-observing platforms often confronts a straightforward but particularly thorny problem: huge amounts of data, in ever-replenishing supplies, are available to support inquiry, but scientists' agility in converting data into actionable information often struggles to keep pace with rapidly incoming streams of data that amass in expanding archival silos. Abstraction of those data is a convenient response, and many studies informed purely by remotely sensed data are by necessity limited to a small study area with a relatively few scenes of imagery, or they rely on larger mosaics of images at low resolution. As a result, it is often challenging to thread explanations across scales from the local to the global, even though doing so is often critical to the science under pursuit. Here, a solution is proposed, by exploiting Apache Spark, to implement parallel, in-memory image processing with ability to rapidly classify large volumes of multiscale remotely sensed images and to perform necessary analysis to detect changes on the time series. It shows that processing on three different scales of Landsat 8 data (up to similar to 107.4 GB, five-scene, time series image sets) can be accomplished in 1018 seconds on local cloud environment. Applying the same framework with slight parameter adjustments, it processed same coverage MODIS data in 54 seconds on commercial cloud platform. Theoretically, the proposed scheme can handle all forms of remote sensing imagery commonly used in the Earth and environmental sciences, requiring only minor adjustments in parameterization of the computing jobs to adjust to the data. The authors suggest that the "Spark sensing" approach could provide the flexibility, extensibility, and accessibility necessary to keep inquiry in the Earth and environmental sciences at pace with developments in data provision.
